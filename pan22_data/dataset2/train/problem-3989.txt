Once the SID tag has been applied, it will still persist even if the DC/GC is offline or unreachable; you'll just be presented with an unresolved SID.
As an aside, best practice still dictates that you should use local groups on the file system, with domain global/domain local groups in those local groups.  This theoretically cuts down on server-to-DC/GC SID lookups.
When you set permisions on the file system, the server tags the file system object with the SID of the security principal that you are granting the permission to.  If you are using a local user account / local group, then the SID will be one specific to the server.  However, in a domain model, you may be referencing a domain global or domain local group, in which case, the SID of the domain-based security principal will be tagged on to the file system object.
Mmmm.  Assuming, like Zoredache points out, that you are talking about NTFS file system DAC lists, then the problem is almost certainly not to do with your domain controller.
