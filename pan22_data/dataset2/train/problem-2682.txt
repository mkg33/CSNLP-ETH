Someone please explain what Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) actually does in layman's terms. I know it can cause problems with some network gear, but that's the extent of my knowledge.
Here is a nice article which explains the problem and the mechanism behind STP: Understanding Spanning Tree Protocol -- the Fundamental Bridging Algorithm.
The spanning-tree protocol prevents this from happening, while permitting redundant links to be 'standing by'. If a link fails, the previously blocked connection is enabled and in a matter of seconds restors connectivity.
It disables dynamically all links except one connecting two any switches. So it prevents network loops. And allows to have automatically enabled backup link in case the main one stops working.
But under bad configuration it can leave more then one link connecting two switches, then broadcast traffic starts multiplying and kills all network.
Bridges and switches, operating at layer 2, will forward (if the destination mac address is known) or flood (if it is not) traffic out ports except the one it is received on. If there is a loop in the network this would prevent packets from ever expiring and quickly consume all available bandwidth.
As a follow on as to why you need STP: bridging and switching operates at layer 2 of the OSI model and is commonly associated with MAC addresses in Ethernet networks. Unlike TCP/IP, which operates at layer 3, at layer 2 there is no concept of a hop count which cause packets to expire after a period of time.
The Spanning Tree Protocol addresses the problem of packet collisions/network loops in a bridget network with redundant network paths.
