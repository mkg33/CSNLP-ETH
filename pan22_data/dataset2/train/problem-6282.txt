According to the info you provided the rule that blocks this IP seems to be there, and nothing seems to be accepting traffic in a more general sense before that (unless you copied just a part of it).
My advice is check your access-list and see if anything matches your statement before the statement you are trying. Your deny rule should probably be at the top of the list since its a high priority for you to block that traffic. Just be specific as to what host you want to block.
then edit the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file and move the  -A INPUT -s 188.241.114.22 -j DROP above the line that allows port 80. Save the file and run 
The command iptables -A INPUT adds a new rule at the end of the INPUT chain. Iptables works on the 1st match principle so it is likely that you have rule that is allowing access on port 80 earlier in the chain.
Well, since it's rather a dark matter with your netfilter (at least in your explanation), you can use ip route to drop that host: sudo ip route add unreachable 188.241.114.22. This also will be more CPU-friendly, since route table uses either Hash, or Tree to store lots of routes (not a list of to proceed when packet comes in).
Like most firewall access-lists (ACLs) entries are read from top to bottom. People who are new to stateful firewalls (both host based and network based) often make an entry checking the access-list that is applied for similar rules that would match the same criteria BEFORE the rule that is entered. This is often done when a firewall administrator places a permit rule after a deny rule and curious to why they still cannot get a connection from a host.
