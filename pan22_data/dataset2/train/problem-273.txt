The probing that each OS's GRUB does is controlled before the system boots by files in /etc/grub.d. In particular, there's usually a script called 30_os-prober that controls the OS-probing process. This is likely to be quite intimidating to configure, though. You'll need to run update-grub or grub-mkconfig after adjusting the probing script in order to create a new configuration file.
Another option is to ditch GRUB in favor of another EFI boot loader for Linux. My own rEFInd is likely to be relatively easy to set up and configure, since it scans for kernels at boot time, and so doesn't need to be reconfigured whenever you install a new kernel. The biggest caveat is that with four OSes/distributions installed, your menu will initially be quite cluttered, including three separate GRUB entries. You'll therefore need to clean it up by editing refind.conf, uncommenting the dont_scan_dirs line, and adding entries to keep those multiple GRUB entries out of the listing. You'll also probably want to adjust the icons, as described here. You could still end up with too many kernel entries for comfort; that's best handled by uninstalling unused kernels via your distributions' package managers. You may need to run mkrlconf.sh (a script that comes with rEFInd) in each distribution to create a /boot/refind_linux.conf file, although that's sometimes not strictly necessary.
There's a tool called GRUB Customizer that's supposed to greatly simplify such procedures. It's described here, among other places. I've never used it myself, so I can't provide more details directly, but it might be worth investigating.
