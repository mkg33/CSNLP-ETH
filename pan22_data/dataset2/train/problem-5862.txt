This behavior is non-deterministic, the same document will print out fine first and fail to print right after or the other way around, the type of input does not seem to matter.
By what you're saying, I assume you are using a PostScript driver. I know Kyocera have a generic PCL driver that can be used, available for all platforms. May I suggest that you try using the PCL driver rather than the PostScript one, and see if a similar problem occurs. At a photocopier and printer company I provide the IT services for, they always suggest PCL when providing remote support, hence why I suggest it here.
I am using a Kyocera P602cdn printer (latest drivers from their website) with CUPS (1.7.2) on Linux Mint (kernel 3.13.0-48).
The default is "KPDL Auto" which tells the printer to auto-switch languages. I'm guessing it is making the wrong choice, so PS is printed as text instead.
On the assumption the printer is a P6021CDN instead of P602CDN, the Operation Guide shows how to select KPDL (Kyocera's PS emulation) on page 4-41 (pg 109 of the PDF). Start by pressing Menu (pg 74). Press the down arrow to get to Print Settings (pg 105). Then press the right arrow once, and the down arrow until you get to Emulation. Press OK and then the down arrow until you get to KPDL. Then press OK and Menu to exit. 
It is possible to force the printer into PostScript from its front panel or web interface. That way the printer will always interpret the PS code correctly.
