There appears to be much info on changing font colors, etc, but little on using REPLACE for the actual 1-99 number set. Will someone please help me?
However, one version has the verse numbers in italics and the other doesn't - no big deal, except that COMPARE will put a warning triangle on each text line stating a difference, which is distracting from actual noteworthy differences (spelling, punctuation, etc, which really is my goal) and this is slowing me down.
Additionally, if I could change both versions to have superscript verse numbers now, then that would be just fine too, and probably preferred.
Then, when it's all said and done I'd like to change that copy to have superscript verse numbers for all: from 3 or 45 to ^3 or ^45.
The rub: I can't just rip REPLACE through, deleting all /italics/ as many of the words are italicized and must stay that way; thus I would like to change one of the versions from having italicized verse numbers to just plain number text, but just the numbers and not any words.
The title says it all: I working on a large Holy Bible project and have two large plain text files representing two different versions, and I'm using the COMPARE plugin to notice differences in the 'ole King James.
