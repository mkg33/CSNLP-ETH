On a windows machine running Windows Update via the built-in service (not GPO), I would like to have it automatically restart every morning at 5:30AM, only when required by WU.
Open the Local Policy Editor (Start>Run>gpedit.msc) and browse to Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update and look for the Configure Automatic Updates. Enable that policy, and set the option for "Auto download and install" and set your install day for Every day and an install time of 05:30.
I would write a small VBScript or PowerShell script that is set in task scheduler to execute at 5:30am every day that grabs a collection of all of the events from the event logs for that day and checks for that specific event id and log entry.  If that event exists, execute the reboot.
I can scheduled a task with a trigger of 5:30AM every day. I can scheduled a task with a trigger that looks for the event above. But I cannot create a task that only runs when both triggers are satisfied or create an event log trigger that delays action until 5:30AM after the event is detected or create an event log trigger that runs itself at 5:30AM and checks to see if the event happened in the prior 24 hours.
