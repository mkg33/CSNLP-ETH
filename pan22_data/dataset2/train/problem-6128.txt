So I would like to know, how do I search for one in Windows 7 ? Is it simply done by using the windows explorer search for a specific extension ? And will I be able to simply reuse it after I find it without any authentication issues ? Thank you.
To quickly (!) search for any files by parts of the file name I recommend Search Everything. Just type whatever you know about the file name and it will find it.
Years ago I had to use a digital certificate for access to some web based application at college. It was provided by the "laboratory" where we used it. Presently it so happened that I will need to use the same one again, but have no clue as to where on hard drive it is located. However I am sure it is still hanging somewhere on the drive.
Thomas has already listed the appropriate extensions but there is a simple way to search that doesn't need additional software.
The above will trawl through your C: drive looking for pfx files. It may take a while but it will certainly find them and report what folder they are in. This isn't dependent on Windows Indexing either.
