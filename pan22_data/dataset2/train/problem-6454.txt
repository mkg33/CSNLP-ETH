So you just have to comment this lines (with the # char) (is not recommend to edit directly the file in conf-enabled) to avoid the forbidden error. After that, do this:
Ubuntu Apache configuration already has Alias /javascript /usr/share/javascript/, see /etc/apache2/conf.d/javascript-common.conf. You could change this alias or remove this file altogether but I don't know if this breaks something else.
It seems to be a reserved keyword or something, even without a javascript folder i get the same message rather than a 404 message.

I signed up and setup a small ubuntu VPS slice during the week and everything is going great so far, except one small problem.
This is the package that creates /usr/share/javascript alias and enables it in the Apache webserver.
And that's it, you won't have any other problem with javascript directories. Another fix could be to rename /usr/share/javascript/ to /usr/share/javascript-common/, then adjust the Alias in javascript-common.conf to point to the renamed dir. Still not sure if this will affect any future update.
