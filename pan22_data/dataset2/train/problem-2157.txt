For me the culprit was ConEmu's icon in the system tray. Closing it or simply clicking on it made the keyboard shortcut work again.
Then you have to scroll down to heading that says "Make it easier to manage windows". This threw me off at first because the window doesn't look like there's any more content. So scroll down against your better instincts, then the full name of the "prevent" feature listed above is "Prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen" -- make sure it's unchecked... I had to uncheck, recheck, uncheck to get my shortcut to start working again.
I had this issue but it was not because anything was disabled.  Instead, I think windows explorer was in some kind of weird state where it was not recognizing the shortcuts.  
After following all of the advice listed (turning on and off all functions in the Windows "ease of access centre" I still didn't get it to work... until:
Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Ease of Access Center\Make it easier to focus on task -- (keyboard works too as mentioned originally - they both take you to the same place).
Ultimately, I had to kill explorer.exe from the task manager (ctrl + shift + escape and find Windows Explorer or explorer.exe, and right-click -> end task).  After you do this, it should restart to where you have your taskbar and everything back.  If it does not, just re-open task manager, file -> run new task -> type "explorer.exe" -> click OK.
