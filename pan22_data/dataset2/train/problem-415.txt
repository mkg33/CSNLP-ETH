File systems are mappings of files to 512 byte or 4k on disk blocks. For dynamic disks the hypervisor creates it's own mapping of "real" disk blocks to on disk data. The virtualized mapping of VM data to disk blocks for dynamic disks would look like FS on VM -> Hypervisor Mapping -> File on bare metal -> Block on physical disk.
How a VM could free data: SSDs have introduced a notion of TRIM support which is a way of notifying the disk drive which blocks have been deleted and are no longer needed. Hypervisors could provide virtualized TRIM support to free blocks in the same way a SSD would free it's mapping of virtualized blocks to flash. Of course your OS would need to support TRIM, etc. etc. And... Even if hypervisors supported this, removing a chunk of data from a file is a non-trivial task.
Each time a write to a un-mapped block occurs the hypervisor appends that block to some file (The dynamic disk) and then annotates that append operation to it's mapping of "real" disk blocks to virtualized disk blocks.
When a delete occurs, the VM updates the metadata representing that file and then completes it's task. No actual delete occurs and the dynamic disk is the same size it was before the delete operation.
