The latter can at least gather entropy from some actual hardware. In fact, the operation of a piece of HW is - in most cases - bound to some physical phenomenon, which is  always subject to small variations, random by all accounts. Since servers typically run for a very long time without a reset, the resulting entropy pool will eventually be of sufficient quality.
A VM using such a service may even be more secure (cryptographically-wise) than a "real" server that has just booted up.
The best solution is to have the VM to simply give up and realize that the HW it sees is a bad source of entropy. Then, arrange a local network service for distributing high-quality entropy (see Entropy Broker). The "entropy server" may extract randomness from generic HW (in which case it must operate for a sufficient time, and it must have a decent OS) or from specific crypto HW (a TPM chip, a VIA Padlock chip, etc).
Yes, under most circumstances cryptography is less secure on a virtual machine than on a "real" server.
