I always liked, in OOP, Classes are nouns, Class Instances are proper nouns, and Methods/Functions are verbs.
Rather than explain indexing and pointers vs. live search. I described it as "Why can you use the yellow pages to find every coffee shop in town in two minutes, but it still takes you half an hour to find your car keys."
I once used an analogy to explain how RAM is defective to a customer of mine. I started at normal voice level repeating ones and zeroes, then after a few seconds I threw a "TWO!" loudly in there. I then explained that their reaction was how Windows XP/Vista/7 reacts: It freaks out and Bluescreens.
(oh, did you mean complex topics for us?  or just simple concepts like RAM, which are complex to the users?)  ;)
My recent favorite is to imagine their computer is a desk at the library.  Once you start opening books, you need to close some to make room to open others. If you leave them all open (I'm talking to you, VP who complains about his "crappy" computer because he leaves 35 windows open at all times) you'll have ripped pages, books falling on the floor, and general chaos.
One I have used:  Internet or LAN slowness can be thought of like automobile traffic.  Some days your commute in to work is faster than others, etc.  Just because Monday and Tuesday are quick drives doesn't guarantee that Wednesday will be quick as well.
Users say the darndest things. One of my favorites was, "Why does it take thirty minutes for windows to search my computer, when google can search the whole internet in a second?"
