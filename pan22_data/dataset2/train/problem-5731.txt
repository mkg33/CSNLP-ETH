It's a bad idea to use file copy as a progress indicator of anything. Stick with DiskSPD or you'll get random & unreproducible numbers. 
You can use Windows built-in SSD based caching software or configure tiered storage spaces where your SSD will act as a WBC or performance tier. 
Microsoft clearly recommends to only use the “Parity” Spaces layout without WBC for archive-like scenarios in which only reading takes place almost exclusively.
I'm wondering what my options are for speeding up the write speed to my storage spaces that's using parity.

During transfers I see about 1.5 GB of memory in use, and only 3-4% CPU.  I've read that you can tell the storage space it's connected to a battery backup (the computer is plugged into a UPS) or use an SSD cache array, but I don't know the pros and cons here, nor the PowerShell commands to do so.  I assume the write performance should be a little better than this, right?  With such a powerful processor, I wouldn't expect parity calculations to slow it down too much.

If adding SSDs is not an option for you, consider using "Two Way Mirror" (aka RAID10) configuration, this will significantly increase write performance.
I set up the storage space using PowerShell because I was attempting to do ReFS with parity, and though it's an option in the GUI, the GUI was giving me trouble.  Format-Volume said "the specified file system is not supported."  So, it's an NTFS volume at 26.1 TB, provisioning type is fixed, resiliency is parital, physical disk redundancy is 1.
