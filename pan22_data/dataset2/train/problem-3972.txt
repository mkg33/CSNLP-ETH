If you want to remove a directory and all its contents, you can chdir into the parent directory and them rm -rf that directory by name, bypassing the entire globbing question.  If you want to remove the contents but keep the directory, it's easiest to remove all and then recreate the directory.
It is complex to come up with a glob that will match all possible directory entries save . and ..; it's easy to come up with a simple answer (e.g., * .??*) that will work almost always in practice.  This is OK for interactive use, since it's easy to remember and the times it doesn't work can be caught with a post-rm ls -a.  For a script, it's easier to do the remove all and recreate the empty directory.
Yes.  rm -rf will only delete files and folders in the current directory, and will not ascend up the file tree.  rm will also not follow symlinks and delete the files they point to, so you don't accidentally prune other parts of your filesystem.
Of course, if any of the directories/files contains one of the characters in the shell IFS special variable (e.g. space, tab, newline), you might want to change the IFS first, run the command, then restore IFS.
If you don't want to move one level up like mpez0 said and rm -rf this specific folder, there is a way to work on all directories/files except . and .. in the current folder by doing:
