Assuming that it's hardware related, there are two basic possibilities: a bad connection, or distortion.
I'm not familiar with a "Genius 5.1" - I'll assume they're powered speakers, though.  You've verified that the input to the speakers works - again, make sure that you test by plugging in to the same input as you're using for the computer.  If possible, use the same cable to eliminate that.
The next things to try are a bit more dangerous, and shouldn't be tried if you're at all uncomfortable dealing with electricity.  With the case open and sound playing, take a wooden pencil (with an eraser) and lightly tap the various sound chips & connectors on the MB - this will help determine if there's a bad connection.  This is unlikely, but possible.
It's hard to diagnose it without hearing it, but you can break it down and try to eliminate the different possibilities.
Now you're down to the connector, or something internal.  Are the ends of your connector clean?  Try cleaning them a bit - rubbing alcohol is good.  Now, with something playing, lightly try to wiggle the connector - does that make any difference?  If so, it could be that there's a problem with the connector itself, or the mounting.
First, it can be either software (drivers, etc) or hardware.  Try booting with a linux live CD, and see if you still have the problem.  If you do, it's probably hardware - if not, it's software.
