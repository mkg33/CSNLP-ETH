I'm assuming there's not much of a budget, but if you're looking for real scale-out NAS, something like EMC Isilon is still relevant in this industry.
We were wondering whether there are some safe alternatives to Raid 0, or some other solutions that can let you "see" one single storage unit and expand it as you want.
So, we thought: isn't it possible to virtually transform all the hard drives we have into a single hard drive? And, also, to expand such storage every time we want by adding new phisycal drives to it? Our goal is to get a virtually infinite hard disk space
I'd suggest speaking to a storage vendor who specializes in scalable storage solutions. They can give you ideas and actually craft a solution based on real requirements. I like Pogo Storage.
This can clearly be handled with a SAN or something that presents NAS shares, but a well-architected ZFS solution is also an option.
The problem is, having now 14 4TB Hard Drives, we keep forgetting everyday where each project is and we have problems each time we re-open an old project because when you change files paths, the editing software has to re-link all media.
We work with video editing. We produce about 30TB of raw footage every year and we are getting crazy. In fact, we keep buying hard drives and putting new projects into different hard drives every time.
