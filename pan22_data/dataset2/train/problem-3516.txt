Overall I can say unpaper it's definitely useful tool to have but you need to fiddle a little with the parameters and doesn't fix pages that start to bend in the middle.
You can also batch adjust pages, but in my experience the printer doesn't always error the same degree of rotation.  Also, some pages I don't really care if they are a little crooked, so I only adjust the pages I care about.
A script I quickly come up for my needs to extract text can be customized and improved. (For sure the crop values will differ;)
For me, Acrobat Pro deskew the scan text, when I turned ON "Recognize Text Using OCR" without this option deskew didn't produce desired results.
Now click on two points on the page that are horizontally straight (most pages have a straight line somewhere).
Boom, your page is adjusted.  You can see in "Rotation" under page setup that there is now a rotational value.
I believe that Adobe Acrobat can rotate pages, otherwise I know Photoshop can, but that would be one page at a time.
For scanned hard copies that were skewed when converting to .pdf the OCR function under Documents > OCR Text Recognition > Recognise Text Using OCR works very well.
