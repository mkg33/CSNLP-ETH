Also what in the world does "[90m [32m [90m1ms - 240b[0m" mean? The "ms" makes sense, probably milliseconds for the request, rest I am unable to understand.
So my questions are, how come my server is returning a "200" OK for root level domains? How did the hacker even manage to send a GET request to my server such that "http://www.google.com" shows up in the log while my server is simply an API that works on relative URLs such as "/api/login".
Alright, so I left my Node.js server alone for a while and came back to find some really interesting stuff in the logs. Apparently some moron from China or Poland tried to hack my server using directory traversal and what not, while it seems though he did not succeed I am unable understand few entries in the log. This is the output of a "hohup.out" file.
The attack starts, apparently he is trying to find out some console entry in my server. All of which fail and return a 404.
And, while I looked up the OPTIONS, TRACE and PROPFIND HTTP requests that my server has logged it would be great if someone could explain what exactly was the hacker trying to achieve by using these verbs?
