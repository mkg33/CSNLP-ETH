The router has a log feature.  Even when showing all log messages the router does not log any refused connection attempts.  I am definitely not short of IP addresses.  I have configured the router to allow up to 100 IP addresses in the DHCP pool.  I have not seen it report allocating more than about 25 addresses.
Is the limit at about 20 devices something innate to wireless?  Is it a design limit in the device?  Are there other devices known to have higher limits.  I'd like to get north of 35 connections.  
I'm using a TP-Link TL-MR3420 wireless router to provide temporary internet access in a clubhouse.  I use a wireless 3G dongle to provide the actual internet access.  I accept that lots of users sharing one 3G connection will not provide sparkling performance.  Performance is not my issue - the users will be running a very low traffic application.
I have searched through the configuration screens without finding a setting that controls the maximum wireless clients. I have tried a lot of google searches looking for such a setting, or confirmation that there is a device imposed limit or a limit that's innate to wireless.
I find that at about 20 connected devices no more can connect.  Windows PC's see a simple "Unable to connect message."
