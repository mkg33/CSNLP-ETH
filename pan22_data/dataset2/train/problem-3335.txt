I agree with the other comments- probably not necessary, and I can't see how the quality would improve, only the features/control. However, you could create a restore point, install the driver and see if there is anything you think you will use or find useful. If not, restore to before the checkpoint.
I'm only going to be using laptop speakers and headphones, so is there a point to install the Realtek High Definition Audio Drivers? The sound already works fine and if I install the driver I'm going to have the Realtek Audio Manager full of useless audio filters (bathroom, hall, underwater etc). Not to mention when that thing runs it takes up like 40MB of memory.
Will there be any improvement in audio quality from the current Microsoft drivers that came with Windows 7?
If it works fine, then leave it. There is no way a driver will "improve sound quality", especially if you have low demands (ie. not using data-banks, sampler, etc.)
Video drivers often give improvements on NVidia and ATI cards, they are always trying to add new optimizations. If your audio works, and does everything you need it to, there is no reason to install the custom drivers/apps.
