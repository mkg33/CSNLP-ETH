The case I am most familiar with is called "step-indexing". In this setting, we take our lattice $\Omega$ of truth values to be downwards-closed subsets of $\mathbb{N}$, whose elements we can loosely interpret as "the lengths of the evaluation sequences on which the property holds". Meets and joins are intersections and unions, as usual, and since the lattice is complete we can define the Heyting implication as well. The lattice can also be equipped with an ultrametric by letting the distance between two lattice elements be $2^{-n}$, where $n$ is the smallest element in one set but not the other.
First, a comment. Your question sort of depends on how geometrically you intend to mean the word "metric". It's reasonably common to use ultrametrics in semantics and static analysis, but ultrametrics tend to have a combinatorial rather than a geometric interpretation. (This is a variant of the observation that domain theory has the flavor of a combinatorial rather than geometric use of topology.)
That said, I'll give you an example of how this comes up in program proofs. First, recall that in a program proof, we want to show that a formula describing a program holds. In general, this formula does not necessarily have to be interpreted with the booleans, but can be drawn from the elements of some lattice of truth values. Then a true formula is just one which is equal to the top of the lattice. 
Furthermore, when specifying very self-referential programs (for example, programs that make extensive use of self-modifying code) matters can get very difficult. We typically want to give a recursive specification of the program, but there might not be an obvious inductive structure upon which to hang the definition. To solve this problem, it's often helpful to equip the truth value lattice with extra metric structure. Then, if you can show that the predicate whose fixed point you want is strictly contractive, you can appeal to Banach's fixed point theorem to conclude that the recursive predicate you want is well-defined. 
Then, Banach's contraction map thoerem tells us that a contractive predicate $p : \Omega \to \Omega$ has a unique fixed point. Intuitively, this says that if we can define a predicate which holds for $n+1$ steps using a version which holds for $n$ steps, then we actually have an unambiguous definition of a predicate. If we then show that the predicate equals $\top = \mathbb{N}$, then we know that the predicate always holds of the program.
