I can send e-mail successfully to one of my domains, gus@echochess.com, and there are no MX records.  I am assuming it is using the A record here, but what if I wanted to have a different mail server handle emails, with a different IP?
The MX record is the preferred DNS record in these cases, but as you stated an A record can stand in its place if no MX records are found (don't count on that being supported by everyone), and if you have no MX record it's very likely that mail from your MTA will be rejected.
So as long as you don't have a specific MX record, your A record will be used as an MX record. Once you do setup an MX record, that one will be used instead.
If there is no MX record, an A record is used as a fallback. To achieve what you want, simply set the MX record to your desired destination.
If I send an e-mail to gus@example.com, how does my e-mail client find out what IP address to send the e-mail to?  I understand it would do a DNS lookup for example.com, but I want to know what records would be used exactly.
