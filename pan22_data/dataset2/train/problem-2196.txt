I am looking for a Windows utility which can search for files fulfilling certain criteria (e.g., file type is "Word" (.doc or .docx), with last modify date older than 1 year ago), and perform several actions on them all (e.g., delete them, or move them somewhere else, or copy them and change their archive bits).
To run internal command (like dir attrib and so on) you would need to use cmd /c command syntax.  If you need to run more than one command you can chain them with &, or put them in a batch file. 
I use Directory Opus for this kind of stuff. It displays found files in one window and you can do all usual file operations on the found result.
For Vista and later builtin forfiles (technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753551%28v=ws.10%29.aspx) seems obvious choice for simple tasks.
The easiest would be Cygwin, but it's a bit heavyweight if you want to do just that. You can get a standalone version of find+xargs with findutils. You can then use this the same way you would on a Linux platform.
