I run chkdsk with admin permission, I checked if my filesystem is NTFS, yes it is, no problems on my hard disk found. I tried the same on other devices, two laptops, but the same problem. Now I'm really helpless, so I thought asking here could help me. I also checked the permissions, i have full access, write and read access.
I asked google, tried a tool to unlock folder and file protection, tried this link:  Remove read-only attribute from folder after Windows reinstall, but nothing helped!
I have a huge problem! Last week, i performed the newest Windows 10 update. Since then, on each folder im creating or each folder already created, the checkbox on the folder properties "Write protected" is always enabled. When I'm unchecking it and im applying the new settings, the write protection turns automatically back. 
Why do I need the box unchecked? Im writing a file sync programm in c# and now I'm getting always an: Unauthorized Access Exception, because of the write protection. One week ago i didn't have the problem. After the update, the trouble started. Could someone help me?
