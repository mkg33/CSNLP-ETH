I have a Toshiba Satellite with Win7. At first I started noticing videos playing slower. At my boyfriends place it was less noticeable since the internet speed was cranked up pretty high and we lived right in town but at my parents, which is where I'm at now it's really noticeable since they live in the middle of nowhere and on the outskirts of their provider. So, to watch an hour long video take almost twice as long for it to buffer or just completely give up. My CPU stays under 5% most of the time and my RAM about 20%-40% depending on what I'm running.
I use Chrome and have disabled all my addons, cleared cookies, and all that jazz. After doing that, I ran AVG. No change in performance. I've opened task manager and ended processes like itunes updaters and java updaters... I've ran the disk and defrag cleaners that come on the computer. I've tried setting the processes that I want to use to a higher priority. I've uninstalled all the extra programs and games that I'm not using...
I've read many other posts about similar cases to mine but none really seemed to be exactly what I needed. I'd follow some of the advice from them and nothing changed.
I either get an Unknown Network Error and the download fails or it just doesn't do anything. You can watch the kbs/s drop from like 50 to 0 where it will stay.
Still, none of the videos that I try watching run anywhere near expected even when every other electronic is off and my lappy is the only one on wifi. 
I don't know much about computers and I'm hesitant to mess with too many settings for fear of breaking my only PC.
Well, to see if maybe there was something I was missing I tried downloading Avast. I've read a bunch of reviews saying it was decent and picks up a bunch of things other programs miss. This is where my second problem came in.
A few downloads did make it through and on them when I tried installing them is when I had the same problem of the program just "freezing up".
