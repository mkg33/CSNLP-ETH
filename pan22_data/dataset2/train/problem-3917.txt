That appears to work across bitnesses. Finally, if you don't need the profile scripts to run, you also have the option of disabling profile loading with the -noprofile switch to powershell.
It's likely that the execution policy was set for the whole machine using Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted in a normal PowerShell prompt. On a 64-bit system, there are actually two versions of PowerShell: one 64-bit and one 32-bit. In this situation, running PowerShell normally will get you the 64-bit version. It appears, though, that Ruby is a 32-bit process. Judging by the presence of SysWOW64 in the error message, 32-bit Ruby is launching 32-bit PowerShell, which doesn't get the same view of the system as 64-bit PowerShell. Ruby-launched PowerShell doesn't see the altered execution policy, so it refuses to run the profile script.
After upgrading from Ruby 2.2 to Ruby 2.3 powershell calls stopped working because powershell profiles are not loaded.
To correct the problem, run the policy-setting command from an elevated 32-bit PowerShell prompt. You can get one of those from the "Windows PowerShell (x86)" entry in Start. You could also set the policy for just your user account:
