Save them as *.jsx files and put in C:\Program Files\Adobe\%Your Adobe Version Folder%\Presets\Scripts
After testing those in Ps I've stumbled upon the fact that if there are groups in the current workflow, scripts don't work properly. They don't take in account layers inside groups, known as layerSets in script language; when the script lists through "layers" it handles only upper level elements (layers outside groups and groups themselves).
I managed to do this by slightly modifying the script I found on AHK forum (that one switched target layer forcefully to visible and had other minor errors), and it's works for me:
Well, in the following, the common way: place both scripts in Ps script folder, make Action with "Insert Menu Item" and assign hotkeys as you wish. You may later use even your fav AHK shortcuts and so on...
Modified scripts are below; they can handle properly workflows with upper level layers&groups and nested elements in upper level groups. With more hierarchy they will work too, if active layer is not twice nested element (otherwise "down"-script will switch to uppermost layer and "up"-script will simply do nothing). But I really very rarely deal with more than once nested groups and at the worst one can do good old mouse click if too necessary (ore use legacy Alt+[/] shortcuts, they still work on all non-hidden layers howsoever nested).
Sorry, I'm not a programmer by far, so full-functional code is beyond my brains; furthermore, these scripts are quite bulky too, I suppose. But they work. (For example, I assign "up"-cycle to F3, "down"-cycle to F4 and "toggle-visibility"-script to F2; for me this combination is quite handy and saves much time).
This is for stepping to the next (down) layer; for previous (up) just make another script with changes [a+1] to [a-1] in TRY section and [0] to [doc.layers.length-1] in CATCH section.
