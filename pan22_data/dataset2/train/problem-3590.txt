Many users complain that this drops connections. I found this to be true, but after some digging I found that the root of the problem was not the adapter, but Raspian attempting to save power by shutting off the WiFi adapter when it becomes idle. If you are experiencing dropped connections, open terminal and make a file 8192cu.conf in directory /etc/modprobe.d/ with the command:
But when I do a ping google.com, it times out. So technically it has a valid IP address and it is connected.
The problem is consistently reproducible when I do data intensive job from the internet. Like when I do a apt-get install nmap, it hangs after 48-50% and the network drops.
I used the steps from https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-3-network-setup/test-and-configure#fixing-wifi-dropout-issues
Forget the "rating" of the PSU - this is often misleading, and the Pi limits current, so it is not possible to draw more than 1A, even if the PSU can really supply this.
Use a powered hub (or otherwise power the WiFi adapter). The Pi can supply at most 300mA to peripherals, and this is often insufficient for WiFi.
