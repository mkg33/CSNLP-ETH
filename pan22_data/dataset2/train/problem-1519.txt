You need to put your site in /Library/WebServer (not sure about WebServer part but it should be similar) and make sure permissions are correct.
The issue I had was spaces in the hard drive name or folder name.  No matter what I added +Space it would not work.  It did however work when I changed the hard drive and folder name removing the space(s) and then mapping it something like:
Where bob is your username. Now you can access localhost/mywebsite instead of localhost/~bob/mywebsite
I have also just changed DocumentRoot in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf. But another option is to use vhosts:
You want to change the "DocumentRoot" setting in the file /etc/apache2/httpd.conf, and restart web sharing.
If you get an error like You don't have permission to access / on this server, try adding this to /etc/apache2/users/username.conf:
So now Dreamweaver or other edit is mapped to the external hard drive and the http.conf file is mapped to the external hard drive saving 100GB of my small internal hard drive's space.  Of course, this means I can only edit and test locally with that external hard drive attached.
