(1) There are M available resource blocks that can carry data, N data channels that must be scheduled every time instance i
I want to have a best guess (prediction) how the data will be scheduled based on this incomplete information i.e, which resource block will be occupied by which data channel. What is the best choice of prediction/modelling algorithm?
Essentially I am trying to model a scheduler operation, trying to predict its scheduling without knowing the scheduling mechanism and having incomplete data. 
Let us assume for a moment that the scheduler has no memory.  This is a straightforward classification (supervised learning) problem: the inputs are X, the outputs are the schedules (N->M maps).  Actually, if every N gets scheduled and the only question is which M it gets, the outputs are lists which channel (or none) is scheduled to each block, and there is only a certain possible number of those, so you can model them as discrete outputs (classes) with their own probabilities.  Use whatever you like (AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, RBF SVM, Random Forest...) as a classifier.  I think you will quickly learn about the general behavior of the scheduler.
If the scheduler has a memory, then things get complicated.  I think you might approach that as a hidden Markov model: but the number of individual states may be quite large, and so it may be essentially impossible to build a complete map of transition probabilities.
