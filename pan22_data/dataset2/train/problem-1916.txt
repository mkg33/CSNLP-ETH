So do I need something in repeater or access point mode for my mystery box, and can it be made to work over a wired connection?
My question: I want to get the two WiFi devices in Room A connected via the 'mystery box', which will allow a strong signal since it is in the room, and which will use the (effectively, via Powerline) wired LAN connection to the modem/router in Room B, and not just pick up the existing WiFi signal from Room B,
If roaming doesn't work well for you, I would simply change the SSID and ignore/shut off the WiFi in room B. It depends greatly on the equipment, but I have yet to see a decent consumer repeater, and since you can run a line to your mystery box I see no reason to use a repeater.
If you'd like to roam between both WAPs (one in room B and one in room A) then set identical SSID and security settings. I would give this a try and see if it works well with your wireless devices. Wireless roaming is left up to the client device/network adapter, so your mileage may vary between machines (my Galaxy S3 roams like a boss; the wife's ancient Mac book not so much.)
You can buy combined Powerline and Wireless AP units, meaning that most of the functions of your mystery box would be subsumed into the Powerline plug.  Then you can buy a cheap four-port switch to let you connect your wired boxes to the network.
The issue is that when in Room A, the WiFi signal from the router/modem in Room B is flaky, causing the devices in Room A to drop the connection all the time.
I can easily add another 3-port Powerline networking plug in Room A (I have them elsewhere) to get wired connections into the Wii/XBox/Sky TV box.
