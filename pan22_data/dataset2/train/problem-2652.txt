DWORDS can only make use of the digits 0-9. Strings, any kind, always use ASCII, in ACSII 1000 can only be written as 31,30,30,30 For the String data type, ASCII works in the background without you even knowing. It has to because the computer only understand 1s and 0s. For Expandable String and Multi String data types, these save your entries as a series of ASCII codes in a hexadecimal format, separated by a commas and hex zeroes. So, an Expandable String of 1000 would be: hex(2):31,00,30,00,30,00,30,00
Just wanted to mention that if all you need is the current directory, or the path to the right-clicked file, you can use these "command line variables" for Explorer shortcut commands: https://superuser.com/a/473602/231129
Have you ever tried to convert a curious hex registry entry into ASCII and failed miserably. This lesson contains all the knowledge required to reverse engineer any hex coded registry entry that is not encrypted. Have Fun!
You should remember to make the registry value a REG_EXPAND_SZ instead of a REG_SZ. Normally, only REG_EXPAND_SZ values are expanded.
Don't forget that %ProgramFiles(x86)% will expand with spaces in the name so the path(s) needs to be enclosed in quotes. It might work like: 
Now open that in any modern browser. Put %PROGRAMFILES% into the ASCII box, and select encode it. It will give you %25%50%52%4F%47%52%41%4D%46%49%4C%45%53%25 Copy paste that into a text editor, move the first % to the end. Select the replace command, find all "%" and replace with ",00,". Remove the comma at the very end. You should get: 25,00,50,00,52,00,4F,00,47,00,52,00,41,00,4D,00,46,00,49,00,4C,00,45,00,53,00,25,00 And finally, hex(2):25,00,50,00,52,00,4F,00,47,00,52,00,41,00,4D,00,46,00,49,00,4C,00,45,00,53,00,25,00
I'm making a program which requires arguments from context menu (click a file and invoke my program with the file name as parameter).
Variables are expanded based on the parent process though. %ProgramFiles% will expand to C:\Program Files (x86) on a 64bit installation if you use the 32bit console or regedit (Located in SysWOW64).
I'd like to use %ProgramFiles(x86)% environment variable, because I've read somewhere that it works on x86 and x64 Windows as well. (Changing to "normal" Program Files on x86.)
So let's convert %PROGRAMFILES% into an expandable string. First, download this: https://hotfile.com/dl/244097278/55aa086/ASCII_2_HEX_Conversion_Tool.7z.html
A DWORD is a 32-bit unsigned integer (range: 0 through 4294967295 decimal) In the registry, a DWORD always begins with 0x. In the registry, DWORDS always have 8 digits that follow 0x. This can be in decimal or hexadecimal format, 1000 can be written as: 0x00001000 or 0x000003e8
