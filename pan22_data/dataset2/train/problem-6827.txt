A program and all its EXEs/DLLs are installed to C:\Program Files(x86)\MyCompany\MyApp.  But only one EXE is ever used, App.EXE.  So chocolatey doesn't add ...\MyCompany\MyApp to the PATH.  There is one folder, C:\chocolatey\bin, that has one MyApp.bat file per program.  Each bat files has one line that runs the full path to the EXE: 
Open your system properties (Right click My Computer->properties) Click the Advanced Tab and the envirnment variables button. Look for Path in the System variables section. Then Either put your program in one of the directories listed in that path, or add the install directory to the list. The latter is probably the better option
Even if you don't have Chocolatey, I would recommend the same pattern.  Create a %USERPROFILE%\Documents\bin folder, and create the .bat file.  In PowerShell you can use Set-Alias to do this, add this to your default profile.ps1 file.
You need to have your PATH environment variable set.  You can find this in the Control Panel under the System icon, in the "Advanced" tab.  Click on the "Environment Variable" button.  A second dialog appears with two sections.  The top one shows variables that are specific to you, the bottom one, to the entire system.  If you want it to just affect you, put the change there, else put it in the bottom.
