Now copy the relevant package folder from %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages once again and compare the changes against the "backup" folder. You may want to use a folder comparison tool like Beyond Compare or WinMerge to find the differences.
If you're running Insider Preview Build 14328, you can reset app data using the Settings tool under Apps & features. Not all apps support reset though.
If you're not running the Insider Preview build, you may need to run some tests to figure out which files you can safely delete to reset the app data.
Now start the app and do something that might affect the default data (e.g. win a game, attempt a high score, save game, etc.)
Install the app, but don't start it yet. Find and copy the relevant package folder from %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages (sort by Date modified to find the newest package folders) and save it as "backup".
I noticed that to reset high scores for Simple Minesweeper, a game I downloaded from the Store, I needed to delete settings.dat and settingsB.dat from the LocalState folder. Depending on the game/app you're trying to reset, you may need to delete other files.
