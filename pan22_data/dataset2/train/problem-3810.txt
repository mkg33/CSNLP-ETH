The "TRIGGER" property specifies when the alarm will be triggered. The "TRIGGER" property specifies a duration prior to the start of an event or a to-do. The "TRIGGER" edge may be explicitly set to be relative to the "START" or "END" of the event or to-do with the "RELATED" parameter of the "TRIGGER" property. The "TRIGGER" property value type can alternatively be set to an absolute calendar date and time of day value.
The "VALARM" calendar component MUST only appear within either a "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component. "VALARM" calendar components cannot be nested. Multiple mutually independent "VALARM" calendar components can be specified for a single "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component.
The only workaround I can think of would be to schedule a 0 minute meeting immediately after the one you want an end of meeting reminder for.
In an alarm set to trigger on the "START" of an event or to-do, the "DTSTART" property MUST be present in the associated event or to-do. In an alarm in a "VEVENT" calendar component set to trigger on the "END" of the event, either the "DTEND" property MUST be present, or the "DTSTART" and "DURATION" properties MUST both be present. In an alarm in a "VTODO" calendar component set to trigger on the "END" of the to-do, either the "DUE" property MUST be present, or the "DTSTART" and "DURATION" properties MUST both be present.
