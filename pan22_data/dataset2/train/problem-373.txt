Once often gets this error if you are upgrading and you use the install process that came with the PHP that you are upgrading too, which tries to be nice and adds the include line for libphp5.so for you, but does not remove the pre-existing one because it is in a different place or for whatever reason it did not notice that it was in the file.
Did you uninstall the php package from CentOS before doing the install of the new version? Also check where the /libphp5.so file was save after installing.
In addition to the httpd.conf file, the CentOS Apache setup loads configuration directives from files placed in /etc/httpd/conf.d. Check if you have a file named /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.ini or something similar.
You have two lines that are including libphp5.so on your httpd.conf.  Just open it in your favourite editor and search for php5, and then keep searching till you find all instances of the line.
Look for a PHP loader in an /etc/apache/conf.d or /etc/httpd/conf.d type directory.  You can probably track down where PHP is coming in by looking through the Include directives in your httpd.conf.
If you do, it probably means that you have additional version of PHP installed from RPM. Consider removing it to prevent additional conflicts.
