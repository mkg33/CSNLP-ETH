Then, I would set up the Hyper-V host / VM for kernel debugging - see here: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ntdebugging/archive/2011/12/30/configuring-a-hyper-v-vm-for-kernel-debugging.aspx (though you might need to update some of the info on that page since you didn't specify the OS). Then, try to replicate the scenario - have any of the users log in to that machine (from home), logout / disconnect and then try to login from the Hyper-V console. If nothing happens, it's most likely a hardware / driver problem (not sure how you can debug those). If you do hit a kernel / user break, most likely a service such as termsrv is at fault and you can take it up with Microsoft from there.
When they login locally, they type their passwords and then the screen goes black. They can't lock or ctrl-alt-delete either.
Several users work from home once a day. They RDP to their workstations (running Windows 7) from home and then when they arrive in the office the next day, they login locally again.
As mentioned, this sounds like a video problem, but you can try to find the root cause. To root cause the issue, I would set up a VM on a Hyper-V host with the exact same configuration as the OS that the users have (I assume they all have the same OS). If possible, get a VHD with the same configuration.
I think this issue is caused by an underlying process on the remote host. For a similar issue faced by me while connecting to remote host (running Debian OS) using mstsc program from my Windows 7, I used the following steps for resolution:
If it is a hardware problem, try to see if your video card manufacturer has some newer/beta drivers for your OS/hardware configuration.
