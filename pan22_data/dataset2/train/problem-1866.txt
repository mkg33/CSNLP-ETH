Can PHP hide a reference to the malware site so I cant find it with a simple search? If so, how can you find it?
I also tested the site with siteadvisor.com it says "We tested this site and didn't find any significant problems".
The version of PHP-Fusion that's running on the site appears to be v6.01.3, which looks to be a pretty old version, so it would probably be a good idea to upgrade that.

But note that there are many variations that attempt to hide the fact that an external script is executed, and which may also modify the source URL, causing your simple string search to fail.
The malware might not be on the site, but might be coming from material brought in from external sources, such as advertisements.
Some friends of mine have a website (www.kennelsoffie.dk) and I'm trying to help them when there is any trouble. However this time I, can't figure it out. When I visit the site using Google Chrome, I'm presented with a warning page claiming that the page that I'm trying to visit contains elements from stopssse.info. 
If the site was "infected" via cross-site scripting, then what you have is probably a user-submitted comment somewhere that contains something like this:
There seems to have been quite a few security advisories for PHP-Fusion, including a number of SQL injections issues.
I don't know any PHP, so I simply downloaded the complete website including backups of the database (which are .sql files). Then, I searched all the files for stopssse, but I didn't find anything.
