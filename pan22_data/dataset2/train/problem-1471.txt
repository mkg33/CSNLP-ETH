This isn't a huge issue because almost everything in the office uses static IP's, but I do have some areas of the office that have a wireless AP connected to this switch (through another managed switch first), and devices that connect to these AP's aren't getting DHCP leases.

Nonetheless, I'd still like to get this suspect Secondary Switch configured correctly in case I have to load balance or use it as a failover switch to the Primary.

The thing is, the suspect switch (call it Secondary Switch) is connected to the working switch (call this the Primary Switch).  The Primary Switch is connected to our Juniper router (the DHCP Server).  Other servers in the rack are all connected to the Primary Switch, as are the area switches around the office.  The only things currently directly connected to the secondary switch are the devices within ethernet cabling proximity to the server room, and these are all set with static addresses.
I've recently replaced a number of 10/100 switches in our office with Gigabit managed switches and I've found that computers connected to one of the switches aren't getting DHCP leases from the server.
