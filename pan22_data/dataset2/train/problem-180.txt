However I also agree that there is always room to start some projects we all could benefit from. For instance, I think we need to replace COLLADA with something much simpler that is JSON based. Maybe something that only handles arbitrary meshes, but nothing else. I think we really need a better mesh format.
I think on the highend, you have to compare companies like EA and Ubisoft to other large software companies, like Apple, Google, Facebook, what have you. 
As @Sean James said there are legal reasons and host of other reasons, but I think even if there were no road blocks, inventive software companies would still develop custom alternatives to common existing software components if they thought they could make them better.
It depends. I think there is actually a fair amount of middle-ware out there, that gets used, ... if you are willing to pay of it.
They all write a very large amount of custom code, when there are existing alternatives, because they want to get a competitive advantage. 
At the same time sometimes it is easy to hack something to get really fast without that many external dependencies, if the scope is small.
