Aside from going down you can also go up to 150% brightness. Here is how brightness on 110% looks like
I looked quickly and didn't find any info if your monitor is a led based one or not. Some older monitors have fluorescent tube for lights (I think) and those probably have a pretty high lowest brightness setting. So if you have that type of monitor you are probably not going to have any luck making it darker through settings.
So you alternative is probably a privacy filter. I have one for my computer at work. It made the screen quite noticeably darker. Although those filters will make the screen harder to read from certain angles, it might still be what you need.
One thing to note is that I don't recommend changing the brightness via monitor buttons if the monitor is LED. Most LED monitors change the brightness via a process called Pulse-width modulation which is really bad for the eyes.
I know this is an old question, but I figured I'd put my two cents in. I actually use f.lux, and it's a great piece of software. It supports (though I don't know since when) screen contrast dimming with use of the Alt+PgDn and Alt+PgUp hotkeys (Down for dimmer, up for brighter) and it's an eyesaver.
Looking at the other answers most programs lower the brightness by placing a transparent overlay filter.
This will also block some UV and blue light if you don't want to use software or use some strange Linux on which no software works at all :)
Assuming that it is not a limitation of the hardware and/or driver, then you can use Nirsoftâ€™s NirCmd to adjust the screen brightness up or down to whatever the video-adapter is capable of.
If you  have intel graphics, open up the graphics properties and set the brightness lower. My default was set at 0, and went to -60. I also use f.lux and dimmer.
One plus of Iris over f.lux is that you automate the brightness reduction based on day and night just like most blue light filter programs do with the color temperature and blue light.
