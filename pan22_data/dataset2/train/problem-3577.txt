And the CPU utilisation remains there as long as I have chrome open. I see similar status on Windows Task Manager.
Here is the case. Chrome is not open (no chrome.exe appears on my task manager). I launch Chrome. Just a default empty tab. No default page. I click on the 'View background pages' and I see the following (CPU list):
If you launch some other process that puts even a moderate load on the CPU, you'll probably see that percentage drop. It's not because Chrome is doing less, it's because your CPU's performance has been increased.
I'm using latest version of Chrome 25.0.1364.172 on a Windows 8 Enterprise fully updated. Quad core machine with 8Gb of RAM and SSD.
It seems we will never know. I uninstalled (and cleared all user adata) and reinstalled Chrome, added again the same addons I had before.
Most likely, it's because of power management. CPU usage is expressed as a percentage of your CPU's current capability. Power management drastically reduces that to the point that 10% is practically no CPU at all.
