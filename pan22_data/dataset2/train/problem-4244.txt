Because the VT-x setting is typically locked at power on, it is necessary to fully power down the system after changing any VT-x options in the firmware (BIOS/EFI). A simple reboot is not sufficient!
I hadn't realized that the steps for accessing the BIOS had changed in Windows 8.1, but this is the MOST helpful link for this problem!: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-access-the-bios-on-a-windows-8-computer/
After following the steps that most others had recommended I still wasn't able to move forward; what did it for me was disabling antivirus (in my case Avast).  Restarted Virtualbox and voila!
The solution for me was to update my bios. Even though my 2012 bios had the Intel virtualization option, it didn't work for me. I'm guessing it was a mismatch between my bios and my windows drivers. Flashing to the 2014 bios fixed the problem for me. Now I have x64 options all up in my virtual box.
Once you enter the BIOS by following the steps from the link above, Enable "SVM" and you should be good to go!
