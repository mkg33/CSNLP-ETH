Google has information on what firewall rules to add, but to be honest, compared to Dropbox's simple proxy settings, this one is a pain.
I work in a call center (in IT). We apply a default policy on our proxy so that our callers cannot access the internet (except for select sites) when they are working (they can during their breaks). 
I can't see that there is an option for people who have no option but to authenticate with a proxy though.
My workaround was to set workstations that need access to Google Drive to bypass the proxy for  google.com, which is now allowed through the proxy without authentication. 
A workaround is to disable proxy in Internet Explorer and instead to use a proxifier that supports HTTP proxies. You will need to know the network address of the proxy server. 
I will use Proxycap in this example. It is easy to configure, and has a very nice option: "Use integrated Windows authentication".
As a result anyone in the back office that wants to use the internet for http/s must authenticate with the proxy - which is of cause not supported by Google Drive.
