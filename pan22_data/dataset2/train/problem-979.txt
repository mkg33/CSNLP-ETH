I have setup a few NAS boxes that are nothing but a bunch of disks and a network interface. Definitely not a windows server, they were running busybox under the hood. So the disks would be formatted using the ext* file system and sharing is done with samba. 
This works ok if you just want to copy a file every now and then. But a lot of the metadata in the NTFS file system (permissions, owner, read-only, etc...) are lost when writing to a disk formatted with the ext* file system. So if that extended data in the NTFS file system is important to you then you will want to use something that formats the disks with NTFS, like a windows server box, or something running windows PE under the hood.
I'm working with a group of Visual Studio developers who are using a server that has "NAS" in the name, and I'm unsure of the specific file sharing protocol in use between the windows client and server.
From an API perspective, there isn't much of a difference when using Win32 calls or .NET, therefore I am curious about the protocol-level interaction between the workstation and server.
Is there a list of known limitations when using a SMB based file share (that isn't based on Windows) and how that would affect file IO calls.
Can anyone provide insight into the limitations and bugs that could appear when using a NAS device with a Windows desktop versus a standard Windows Server?
