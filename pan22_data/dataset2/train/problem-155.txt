Let's say you have a box with a small ball in it. When you touch-hold the ball, you hold the ball "in your hand". Then you swipe across the screen with the ball in hand and "let go" (release touch), the ball rolls in the direction you swiped with the speed of your swipe, decreasing in speed according to a set friction. 
Also check out the libGdx demos, gives a better understanding how what is used and how to organize files: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Running-Demos
first of,  I'm new to android game development so I don't know all the classes and dictionaries within android and libgdx. I'm actually following a game development tutorial for the first time (kilobolt) but I already have some ideas for games I want to make after finishing the tutorial. So here's my question:
Is it possible to implement such a function with libgdx? If yes, could you please explain how to make it?
This may help a bit. As for knowing how to do what you exactly want to do, I would need hours of trial and error as I am also a bit of a beginner.
