But i added a little script that sends a message to the name-server that host my domain-name (I use gratisdns.dk), with the new ip-address, and the DNS record is updated.
When my device boots up it gets a IP-number from the local DHCP server (usually build into the router/modem), this is standard behavior and this is probably how your raspbarry already works.
To make this work on any network with any computer You need to use a real domain, sorry. But all the other solutions (Avahi/hostfile...) requires setup of the other machines.
While you cannot use berry.local, but have to use something like berry.fancyname.eu, it still fulfills your purpose, also if you connect at another network.
The best way of getting your Pi into the network DNS is going to depend on the details of the environment where you're trying to access it.  There are several approaches:
So any computer on the same network as berry, that can connect to any website out there can now also connect to berry. 
If you're on Windows you need to install an external service to handle doing the lookups.  Appe's Bonjour Print Services comes with mDNSResponser.exe, which works for this purpose (even though you're not using it for printing).
I also like to connect to my machines on my network by name. So i have bought a domain-name (quite cheap now a days), and setup dyndns.
First Let me stress that just because the domain-name is available from the internet, this does NOT make your device available on the internet.
For berry.local to work, you need to either have avahi running, so that the name is resolved via mDNS, or your router must have appropriate host entries and a default local domain which is searched. The avahi approach is probably the least trouble, and is also needed if you want to use shairport or other zeroconf services.
