I think that the 40-60% is for storage when not in use. Otherwise Li-ion batteries' lifetime are limited by the number of full discharge/recharge cycles (if I remember correctly.) 
If you can't find an app, the only option is what I do in my ASUS G53, manually unplug it when it charged to 80-85% and replug when it is 20-25%. BatteryBar is Taskbar widget with modifiable settings for reminding you of ideal range.
You are right. In fact in EV cars(tesla etc) specialized firmware maintains charge between 30 & 80%. The battery never actually chrages upto 100%. It is also liquid cooled. This is to increase the life time of the battery. So two things are actually important: Heat and 100% charge. Both are harmful. You should not use it always at 100% charge, which is what will happen if you are always plugged in to AC adapter.
Just heard that if Li-ion battery is kept at 40~60% charged, its lifetime will be longer. Is this correct? If so, are there some applications, respectively for Windows XP, Windows 7 and Ubuntu, that can control charging and discharging of the battery so it is always within some range like 40~60%?
There is built in app for Samsung laptops & netbooks called Battery Life Extender which will limit charging to 80% in order to extend battery life. Try and find out if it is available for your laptop.
I always worked with my laptop online, with battery on it. (4 years old now) I used the battery only in airports and in some rare occasions. The battery still have the full capacity, it provide energy for 2 and a half hours, like new.. The number of cycles affects, not keeping on the laptop when online. And if you don't discharge it completely, the effect of aging is even lower. It's true that the battery lose capacity over time even if is not really used, only kept on laptop, but this is really not a concern, because the rate is maybe 5% per year. Temperature is the real problem, but as long as is no more than 26-27 degrees, it's still okay.
