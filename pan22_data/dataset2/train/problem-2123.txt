This is much work to do what you need if you want to move the apps to HDD and system to SSD. You would have to change installation paths in registry for all apps. This is nearly impossible.
It is always advised, that when moving from HDD to SSD, one will reinstall Windows on SSD, beacuse Windows has some settings "knowing" that it runs from SSD and behaves then faster.
Okay, so I currently have a 4 TB HDD split into 2 partitions, one of which is my C:\ drive. I run Windows 10, and have lots of programs installed. I also have a 250 GB SSD as a secondary drive, but I want to make a fresh install of Windows 10 on it, to use as my boot drive. I plan to install (keep?) most of my programs and games on my HDD. 
The question is, since few of my programs are portable, must I backup the settings (with something like CloneApp) and reinstall the programs one-by-one, or could I just keep them on the HDD and somehow make the new Windows installation detect them? I have 770 GB of software [and that's just in the C:\Program and C:\Program (x86) folders]. Reinstalling it all would take a very long time.
