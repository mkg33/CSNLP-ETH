Are you using the driver provided with Windows 7 or are you using the driver from HP.com?  Windows in-box drivers usually only have a subset of features.  You're almost always better off downloading the drivers from HP.com.  The latest drivers for the CLJ 2605dtn for Win7 64-bit are at http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodNameId=1140732&prodTypeId=18972&prodSeriesId=1140727&swLang=8&taskId=135&swEnvOID=4063.  In this case, you'd be using the "Universal Print Driver" which supports many other HP printers including the CLJ 2605dtn.
I think it very much depends on the printer and you'll just have to try all the offered drivers and see which works best.
For one or a small number of computers I normally go PCL, but if output speed, quality, or printer functionality (eg stapler) is important then I always do test prints to compare. For example colours or logos on letterheads may be rendered better with a particular driver. Speed may also be an issue if the printer is going to get heavier use on complex/long documents.
It does really depend on what you're printing.  One answer said to use Postscript because it has better fonts.  That may be true if you're only printing text documents but if you're printing mixed jobs that have both text and graphics PCL6 may be better.  Print and compare the difference.  Personally, I usually go with PCL6 first, then PCL5 then Postscript.
The PS interpreters on HP devices are not great and I would generally avoid it. Other types of printers (Xerox for example) handle PS better than PCL. So it always depends on the printer and what you are trying to acheive. Both languages have pros and cons.
I have an HP Inkjet that won't print pdf with pcl5 or pcl6, but will print word and excel with postscript. I know this because I just spent 3 hours trying all the different combinations of drivers and documents.
I am nstalling drivers for a printer, and I have a choice of either PCL (5 or 6), or PostScript drivers? Which one would you recommend and why?
However, as you can see from all the other comments, the "complete" answer is somewhat more elusive. 
I can add to that by noting that a generic Linux inkjet driver on my FC20 box just happened to be postscript and was able to print pdf, while the Windows 10 pcl6 driver couldn't.
On an HP printer, a PCL driver (either 5 or 6) will likely work the best. The intrepreters on a HP device handle PCL much better than PS [they developed the language, so they better!]. If you are just doing regular windows printing then PCL6 would be my suggestion.
