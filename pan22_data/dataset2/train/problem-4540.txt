Microsoft is a little weird with their software. There are many Microsoft official partner sites that you can download Windows 7 for free and legally if you have a key. 
For Windows 8, Microsoft changed their policies. To download a copy of Windows 8, Microsoft makes the user go through some hoops. If you have a product key (I asume you do through Dreamspark) you may download a Windows 8 ISO directly from:
SDM is very poorly programmed. After downloading 100% of the file the progressbar will drop to 0% and you may notice very high RAM usage (for me SDM consumes all available RAM). After few minutes you'll see a "Download complete" message, voila.
Also, make sure that you have enough free space for both the final ISO and the temporary download (.sdc) to coexist.
I just had this problem, what worked for me was to close Secure Download Manager and reopen the .sdx file. This launched SDM again with the download at 99%, gave me the option to resume, and then proceeded to validate and unpack successfully.
The log file contains only one line : "Unpacking File: C:\Users\en_windows_8_x64_dvd_915440.sdc" I was unable to unpack the file using 3rd party software, and there seems to be no official software made for unpacking this type of file. 
I am downloading Windows 8 RTM using Microsoft's secure downloader provided by my school's DreamSpark account. The OS I'm currently on is Windows 8 preview. Once the download reaches 100%, it restarts to 0%. I open the download path folder, and find the  en_windows_8_x64_dvd_915440.sdc file and the en_windows_8_x64_dvd_915440.scd.log file.
