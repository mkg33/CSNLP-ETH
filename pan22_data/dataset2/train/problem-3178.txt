In the end I packaged Miredo for OpenWRT myself. Currently a pull-request for openwrt/packages is pending: https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pull/4201
However it seems that Miredo isn't currently very much supported. I tried OpenWRT, which currently doesn't maintain it. I also tried DD-WRT, for which it seems to be theoretically possible to install Miredo via ipkg from (older) OpenWRT packages, but I did manage to get it work because of some unsatisfied library dependencies.
In the meantime, the packaging files for building the package manually are available at https://github.com/ppetr/openwrt-miredo
Has anyone managed to get Miredo work on a similar router? For example, by getting ipkg Miredo package to work, compiling it from sources etc.?
I'd like to set up a home router (ASUS RT-N66U) so that it'd allow outbound connections. As the ISP doesn't provide public IP addresses, I wanted to use Miredo together with a dynamic DNS service to provide a DNS name pointing to a IPv6 address provided by Teredo. (Yes, it's not the most efficient and reliable solution, but for my purpose it's enough.)
