This one is less likely but here goes...make sure you are not looking at size on disk if you have different OSes e.g. FAT, NTFS, exFAT are using clusters as a block unit which is completely different from ext(2,3,4)
I would not be overly concerned.  Afterall, there might be sparsely allocated files.  When these are copied via logical file access that rsync uses, the unallocated space is expanded read as a zero filled area and thus you get more space.  The file sizes would still be the same on both the source and destination.  
One other possibility is that some files have been deleted from the production server, and rsync hasn't been told to delete the files from the backup (--delete -option).
I ran an rsync to backup one of our production servers. I put the production server in readonly mode so that no additional data could be added or modified. I then did a recursive rsync with archive (-a) to backup the production servers data directory to a remote backup, which is configured identical to the production server. 
After days passed, what I found was that the backup (destination) server ended up having about 100MB more of data. How could this be -- Is that normal? Any idea how to track this down? Right now I'm doing a ls -laR out to a file on both the production and backup server. I'll then try to diff the files to see if there is any differences. Any other tips?
There are a few possible reasons for a copy to take up a different amount of space than the original:
Another scenario might be that some OS might be using power of 10 instead of power of 2 when listing filesize e.g. 2^10=1024 which is definitely not 10^3=1000
If you are using different OSs on the backup/target machines yes there might be a difference. Same file is larger on linux than windows because of line endings and that would make a lot of sense if you have a lot of text files.
