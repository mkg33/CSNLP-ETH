I would suggest you keep your tables just as you show them in the question. As a subscription is written, automatically generate the corresponding order and invoice to match. This can be done in the application or through a DBMS trigger. There will be a one-to-one relationship between Subscriptions and Orders. The foreign key column should be added to Subscriptions so Orders can remain agnostic to the source of the order.
The order-invoice-payment pattern is one commonly seen in accounting. Those tables belong together in the "finance" part of your business model. It is well-established practice to be able to tie incoming money back to a customer request.  Your financial auditors will expect to be able to follow that trail and reconcile the rows there with other records.
Subscriptions belongs in the "sales" part of your model, along with any other channel you have for bringing in trade. Although a subscription may share a number of foreign keys with an invoice they are distinct and separate concepts with different lifecycles. For example, a subscription may be removed once it has expired but an invoice must be retained for, say, seven years for tax purposes.
