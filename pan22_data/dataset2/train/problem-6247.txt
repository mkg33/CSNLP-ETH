At site B, I have a single VoIP phone with PoE (only FastEthernet0 and FastEthernet1 are PoE). The phone connects and registers over the VPN and can make clear calls to site A. Using the PC port on the phone I connected a PC which receives an IP from DHCP on the 880. The PC can also ping 208.67.222.222 (openDNS) but can't resolve www.google.com or a host at site A (i.e 172.16.1.5). The voice is on vlan 100, and data is on vlan 1. I am thinking that the PC is not getting on vlan1, but it is still getting an IP of 192.168.9.13. 
Still no luck, I am hoping someone with more experience can throw some pointers my direction. Thanks in advance!
I configured FastEthernet1 to match a working port configuration from the UC520 at site A (minus a macro description). I also tried configuring FastEthernet1 using:
I am working on my first Cisco project. Site A has a Cisco UC520 with working VoIP phone system configured. Site B has a Cisco 880 router. My goal is to connect each site with this VPN connection.
