JBOD is exactly what you are looking for. It stands for "Just a Bunch Of Disks", as in the opposite of RAID, it just appears to the OS as a bunch of disks.
It runs on pretty much any machine, and whilst I use it for RAID on four hard drives, you can set it up however you want.
fantastic solution if you just want to read from the disks, for example film archive that spans several disks. and if one fail you just loose the films on one drive instead of all as you would with JBOD.
When writing, you have to copy the files to the separate disks, there is an option that might handle this but I would be careful.
I would recommend messing around with it in a virtual environment first so you can add multiple disks and test that it does what you want. But I love this software and would highly recommend it!
Another solution for NAS software is Openfiler, many people like it however again, after testing both, I settled with Freenas!
I would highly recommend you take a look at Freenas, I have been using it for around 6 months and love it.
Try setting up a VM, running something like FreeNAS, and then adding dynamic virtual hard drives to it, but storing them on external hdd's attached to the host.... This should be quite flexible..?
