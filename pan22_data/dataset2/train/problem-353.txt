I do not believe shutdown was ever an MS-DOS command; it was introduced in Windows XP. The usual way to shut down MS-DOS is to wait at the command prompt for all disk activity to complete and then kill power (except on really old computers whose hard drives had to be "parked" first). To restart, just hit Ctrl-Alt-Del.
Instead, put all the files you need to access on your flash drive. The commands you mention probably do not work because they probably do not exist on your flash drive and are not built into the COMMAND.COM interpreter. If they do exist on your flash drive, you may need to set the PATH environment variable so that MS-DOS can find them. (The AUTOEXEC.BAT file of a DOS installation generally sets the PATH so that the user need not do so each time the computer is turned on or restarted.)
If your hard drive is formatted with the NTFS filesystem (as is the case with all Windows Vista/7 installations and many XP installations), you cannot read your files from MS-DOS, which only supports FAT filesystems.
Generally, you would only boot into MS-DOS to use some BIOS flashing utility or hard drive utility, and even that is increasingly rarely necessary on newer computers. Otherwise, consider setting up a) DOSBox or b) VirtualBox and FreeDOS to run your DOS software without having to shut down your 32- or 64-bit edition of Windows. The former is useful for running old games, which may not otherwise work on modern PCs with fast CPUs.
