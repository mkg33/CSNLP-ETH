If there has been no firewall change then there is likely an issue with your MX records.  Use nslookup and check an external DNS server to see what they resolve to.  You can also try sending yourself an email by telneting into the server.
Just to check - how is external mail coming in?  Direct delivery to the server, via some av/spam filter gateway or are you pulling mail down using a connector etc?
If mail is delivered direct to the server then definitely look at DNS/MX resolution issues and firewall changes which may be blocking delivery.  You can do a quick test by trying to telnet to your server on port 25 from a machine external to your network.
Do you have at least 4GB disk space free on the volume where the SMTP virtual server is storing its SMTP queue?
If you route via another gateway service for filtering as many people now do you need to check whether they are queueing up your mail as they can't connect to your server.
Edit: You're probably having a backpressure situation-- I didn't even stop and think about that. Ugh! Backpressure got a lot better after one of the post SP1 rollups, but I can't tell you which. Your event log will tell you if you're having a backpressure event, though.
If not, you can move it with this procedure: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb125177.aspx
