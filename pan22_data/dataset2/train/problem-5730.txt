First you need to verify which type it is.  Even though it may look like a Phillips at first glance it may actually turn out to be, on closer examination, a square drive or even a Torx.  Simply getting the right driver (in EXACTLY the right size) may be sufficient.  (Note that the cause of stripped Phillips screws is usually the use of the wrong size screwdriver.)
Do your best to open the laptop and remove all dust blocking the fan.  If the overheating issue persists, re-seat the heatsink on the CPU and GPU.
Otherwise either a miniature impact driver or a (similarly miniature) screw extractor would be the way to go.
Over time, the thermal paste can lose it's efficiency, especially if it dries out, or the heatsink has been separated from the CPU/GPU.  This is very likely in a laptop, especially if it is moved around a lot, bent/twisted, or dropped.
Aside from opening the unit, there's absolutely nothing you can do.  While it's possible that there is a lot of dust build-up in the laptop, there is another possibility - your thermal paste.
IIRC, a number of the HP models run hot, and the heat-producing components are right under the wrist rests of the keyboard.
