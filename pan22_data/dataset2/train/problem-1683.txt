This means that validating the server (correctly or incorrectly) isn't going to be influenced by your selection of symmetrical encryption algorythm.
SSH will validate the server based on the signature of the public key used (a simple hash). It's up to the user to make sure that signature is valid (i.e. you usually need a secure channel for that also, in practice, clients usually just remember the first signature sent by the server and simply warn you if that signature changed).
if you need more information, someone actually performed a detailed analysis if the performaces of AES vs RC4 (including several mode of operation for AES)
That being said, I can more or less guarantee you that changing the symmetrical encryption from AES to RC4 isn't going to yield any noticeable performance improvement: even with a very slow (or starved) processor, the difference in speed between the two isn't going to be noticeable.
I'm no expert on this but (assuming that the problem is with the ciphers) using RC4 doesn't help with authenticating the server - RC4 is used as the symmetric encryption algorithm and not the asymmetric connection set up phase (where IIRC identity is determined). Maybe a PSK based method would be a more appropraite method to avoid performance problems due to computation overhead?
