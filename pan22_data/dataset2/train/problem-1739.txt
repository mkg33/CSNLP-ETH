AdBlock in Chrome doesn't seem to work because it just hides the web page elements, it doesn't stop the browser from downloading them. I imagine that some kind of proxy/browser extension hybrid would be the best.
When I'm browsing the web, I'd like to not be tracked by any third party services like Facebook or Google. For instance, if I visit somepage.com I don't want my browser requesting things from facebook.com unless I allow it. However, if I visit facebook.com, Facebook still works.
You will notice that this causes a lot of trouble if you were using Noscript.  There's a ton of times where I go to a webpage and have to allow some third party webpage to load javascript (and other items) for the page to function or even render properly.
The add-on No Script probably does what you want. I appreciate that I have to explicitly allow those scripts/domains that are needed for a page and can easily keep other certain scripts/domains from ever firing. It's also very nice that you can temporarily allow a domain so that you can see if it really is vital for the page/site to function.
I would caution you against doing this.  While you may think that this will solve snooping and cross site request forgery, it will only cause more problems.  A lot of websites have a separate domain such as paypal.com I think has staticpaypal.com which is responsible for loading all of the static content like images, video, scripts, etc.  
I just discovered a program called "Ghostery" that allows you to view/prevent third-party sites that track you, maybe it can help you out. It has plug-ins for all the major web browsers:
