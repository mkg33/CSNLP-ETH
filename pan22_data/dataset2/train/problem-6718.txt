Basically the software allows you to set up the classroom visually, lock the keyboards and mice remotely, push files, project presentations and the screen, and elimantes the need for using projectors completely.
I wish I knew what it was called, but they had this style of system in place at my university in one of the computer labs. It had what you asked about (teacher seat at the front, projector, ability to show anybody's screen, and some other cool features like blocking out access to things while class was in session). 
its not free, but we use DameWare for training and remote support. It lets me look at the students screens and even control them. Once it is displayed on my screen the projector displays the image. 
What you are looking for is a product like Net Control 2. We evualuated this last year for our own training campus, however the cost was a bit high at the exchange rate at the time.
I could look into contacting some people at the University (Marshall University) and see if they can give some more information on it if you would like.
This is one of about 4 product similiar we tested, however I can't recall the others. This particular one was the easiest and simplest solution we could find.
