This answer will depend on using Grub and rebooting the server, but since they're Redhat servers, Grub is practically guaranteed, and it is a sure way to regain access without booting to another medium. Here goes:
No need to boot up with a live cd as suggested by @Mr Shunz, since the system is working. Just restart the server, in the boot manager select to edit the boot parameters and add an 1 to the end. The system will boot in runlevel 1 with no network and the root user already logged in. Eventually disable system management programs from starting up automatically at startup, so that things like puppet or chef won't eventually enforce particular users or passwords on the system. Change the root password, restart and then do your investigation on what's on the system using the root user.
Since you're going to shut down the servers, boot one of them with a live CD/USB key, mount the root filesystem and chroot into it.
Then you can reboot it, connect to the network and procede with the same procedure with the other server.
Then change the root password and check if there are other users presents and change their password too.
