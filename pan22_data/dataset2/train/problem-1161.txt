The partition(s) filling the rest of the disk will be for your Ubuntu installation.  If you want to be able to access your files from the Windows side, then make a 15GB or so ext4 partition for Ubuntu and a FAT32 partition for your data, which would then be mounted as /home.  If you don't need your Ubuntu files to be seen from the Windows side, then you can just make one big ext4 filling this part.
Then, install your Windows.  After that you can install Ubuntu in the empty partitions at the end of the disk.
A note: Ubuntu does have built-in NTFS support (to the best of my knowledge) but don;t go storing your entire /home on there.
Spacewise, ubuntu dosen't need as much as windows, even a 20 gb partition would be enough. You can probably store data in the other drive if need be - ntfs-3g is pretty reliable at this point. YMMV and it would depend on your usage habits.
you won't be able to access the ubuntu files easily with a wubi install - wubi installs to a image file, so you'd need some way to mount that, as well as needing an ext3/4 driver.
If both installs are going to be 'fresh' installs, partition FIRST before you do anything. If you're going to repartition a existing install, back up first.
Also, NEVER write to your Windows partition while it [Windows] is in hibernation.  YOu could corrupt your hibernation state.
Filesystemwise - NTFS3g on linux (it should be in the repos if not preinstalled) and ext2fsd on windows should cover your bases, assuming its vanilla installs of both to start with.
