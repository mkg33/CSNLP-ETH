I reinstalled osx but it installed osx mavericks, and it works fine, but when i try to update to macOS mojave or high sierra it get stuck in installation. I tried to install by direct installation and by bootable usb and it get stuck by both ways.
Yesterday i was working normally on my mac and it got stuck, the display was frozen but the sound was working. I clicked the power button until it turned off and then i wasn't able to boot again.
My question is if you think that is a hardware problem or is something that i am doing wrong? Do i have to install other osx before i install mojave or high sierra?
You may have better luck cloning an existing macOS drive using https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html or Carbon copy cloner.
The last thing to try (or first) is the apple hardware test https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257
Its possible the drive went bad so you could also try using the disk from another mac. Restart the broken mac and hold the option key until the available startup drives are listed. Boot the other mac up while holding the "T" key until the target disk mode icon flashes. Connect the two macs via cable and if the broken mac is able to boot -> good news its just a hard drive failure, otherwise it may be the motherboard :(
