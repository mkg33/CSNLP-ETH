What usage is being reported here? On a Unix / Linux box, the OS will assign as much memory as available for disk caching - but some tools will report this memory as not being available - its a bit more complicated for Microsoft (which has several different management models). Some tools will report cache memory as available, some as not available.
There is significant variation in the memory usage throughout the day - enough that you should be able to demonstrate a relationship between available memory and response times (if one exists). But you need to know what you're actually measuring first.
You need to profile your application and figure out what's actually running slowly, when, and why. You're grasping at straws if you just immediately try to throw more hardware at the problem, especially when your own numbers show that your memory is never completely utilized.
The information in the graph tends to favour the null hypothesis (adding more memory won't help performance) but we'd need to know a lot more about what's going on here.
That you need more memory and that - brutally speaking - the talk with them already costs the company more in wages than the memory would cost. I was recently upgrading a server and 32gb DDR2 Registered RAMs were about 1500 USD. 1GB when under pressure is a non-issue to upgrade to at least the level of a decently powerfull workstation (4gb, 8gb, 16gb).
