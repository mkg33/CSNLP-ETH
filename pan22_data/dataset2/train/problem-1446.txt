On OpenSuSE Linux, SLES, and Novell OES (all SuSE-based products), we've got a script that runs zypper and looks for packages that need to be updated. When it finds one, it submits a ticket to JIRA and assigns it to the sysadmins. When we install the updates, we close the ticket, which leaves an audit trail that tells us when it was installed and by whom. This can be reconciled/confirmed with the zypper and sudo logs, which are centralized on a syslogging server. 
apt keeps a log in /var/log/apt/, and dpkg uses /var/log/dpkg.log. dpkg in particular is fairly parsable. 
For our Windows boxes we have a local WSUS server, and a standard window to apply the monthly patches.  For the Linux systems (RHEL) we have a RHN satelite server on campus that they are all joined to.  That provides a nice dashboard of every joined system that you administer, as well as the unapplied updates for each system.  For those that are in puppet, we push out a script that auto applies patches during a regular window and sends an email notification with the results.
I use apt-history for history. I've no idea why this useful tool isn't included by default, it's the first package I deploy with puppet.
Regarding your third question: I always run a local repository. Even if it's only for one machine, it saves time in case I need to reinstall (I generally use something like aptitude autoclean), and for two machines, it almost always pays off.
For the clusters I admin, I don't generally keep explicit logs: I let the package manager do it for me. However, for those machines (as opposed to desktops), I don't use automatic installations, so I do have my notes about what I intended to install to all machines.
