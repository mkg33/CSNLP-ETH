I do think you may be asking for trouble and making things too complex when you want to boot of a CD, mount a USB drive.
The Debian Live Project is pretty well documented.  If you are a fan of Ubuntu there are several good docs in their wiki, this is probably a good starting point LiveCD Customization From Scratch.
As an alternative, since you are using software RAID, why don't you simply create a small 1GB partition at the start of the drives?
I'm used to running a headless Fedora server, and that would be ideal, but I'll take what I can get. Can anyone suggest a good approach for this problem? Specifically - an appropriate distribution to use, how to configure the LiveCD, and how to get it to automatically mount and run certain scripts on the USB drive?
Unfortunately I am not familiar with how to Customize Fedora/Centos to offer advice on something that will be more familiar to you.
The Fedora LiveCD can be customized fairly easily if you have the drive space. Take a look at the LiveCD howto on the Fedora wiki
Have a look at SystemRescueCd (I'd add a link, but I don't seem to be allowed to, so you'll have to goolge that), it's easily customizable and can be booted from USB or CD.
I'm setting up a large software RAID array using MDADM, and don't want to waste a drive bay on a system disk. Unfortunately, the server I'm working with has trouble booting from a USB drive, so I'm attempting a workaround.
I want to create a LiveCD with Knoppix or some other suitable distribution, then use the USB drive as a mountable storage device to keep all my admin scripts etc on. I plan on running several services including:
