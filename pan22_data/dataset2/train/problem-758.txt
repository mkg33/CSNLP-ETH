We use PHPlist which is free and we're happy with it. I'm not sure how well it compares to others, but we send about 80,000 a week without issue.
A commercial but good one is YourMailingListProvider. They have a (limited) free option. But to be able to import csv you have to pay.
A group I volunteer with chose Campaign Monitor because of it's inexpensive price.  It's web based and will do the import (and export) that you want.
Mailman is the standard tool used by most open-source mailing lists. I'm not sure exactly if it can import your contacts in those formats.
You can use Google Groups for that. Just create a new group, and people can subscribe to the group or read it online like they themselves prefer. Don't think there's csv import support though.
iContact is a service that lets you run email campaigns for your clients. I haven't used their service to send emails, but I am on a few lists of companies that use their services to send marketing material. I have used a trial of theirs to test it out (it was for a project, not for real uses). They let you send out HTML emails and surveys. I'm not sure what the pricing is for it though.
