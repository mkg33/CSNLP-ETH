I think a common technique is to run the image in some sort of chroot. That way you can install a new package containing a new chroot environment with all the updates etc without affecting the "master" OS.
However, I got to thinking that I can't be the first guy with this problem.  So what software/conifguration is available to manage a remote set of (very similar if not identical) appliances.  I'd also love to have a dashboard where I can dive into each box to diagnose problems too -- but the idea of remote updates (especially in bulk) seems like a whole new problem.
I am thinking about creating a linux appliance (probably using xubuntu booting from a USB drive, FYI) and I'm curious about how best to perform remote updates and administration.
Just ssh in. You can do everything from a shell. Ubuntu's aptitude programme is able to upgrade every part of the operating system from a shell.
As far as updates go, I'm going to continue to beat on the Puppet drum.  It really is the best way currently in existence to automatically manage and update a number of identical or near-identical machines.
You can use ssh with x-forwarding. This allows you to run any application on the remote machine to be displayed on your own computer.
The use case I want to support, is to have this box at a remote location out of my control (someone's house or office) and I want to update it remotely to patch something, alter it's configuration, maybe just upgrade the OS or applications on it for example.
For remote access, I'd have each machine establish an OpenVPN tunnel to a central location.  This gets around NAT problems, and ensures that any protocol you might have to use that isn't encrypted by default is kept secured.
At a dead-simple one-by-one situation, I figure that if it's running the entire OS in RAM, I should be able to remotely overwrite the OS image on the USB drive and tell the machine to reboot for the changes to take effect.
