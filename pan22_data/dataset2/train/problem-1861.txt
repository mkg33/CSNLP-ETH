Dropbox works on Windows, Mac and Linux, and there are programs that use the passwordsafe format on all three platforms aswell. The original works on Windows, there is a java version that works on Windows, Mac and Linux. For a fuller list, see the related projects page that shows platform support for Windows, Windows Mobile, Mac, Linux, BSD, Solaris, perl modules, C# support ...
I use the open source PasswordSafe application for storing my personal passwords.  I keep the database file on a DropBox volume, so it is accessible from anywhere.  (hat tip: Joel)
I save passwords in passwordsafe (or one of its variants) and keep the passwordsafe database in a folder shared by dropbox. (Dropbox syncs files online and across multiple computers).
I use Linux, and mostly use the command line pwsafe and occasionally MyPasswordSafe - both available in the ubuntu repositories.
There is no reason that the password database file can't be kept on a network share, and there is an option to open the password file in read-only mode.
For single use passwords I set it and forget it.  If I have to do something with it I reset it again knowing that it has a single purpose.  This also keeps me from using the account for a second purpose.   The account name will match the purpose and may be a long long winded name.
