Today's hypervisors can provide almost the same performance as the underlying physical hardware, as long as the performance is physically there and you don't put too many VMs on the same hardware; so, virtualization per se is not going to impact performance a lot, if you have enough CPUs/RAM and you make sure this VM's data disks are not shared with other VMs.
Long answer: It really depends on load.  If you're a company of 80 users, and your SQL server is serving an accounting application, a SharePoint instance, and some other random Line of Business application I doubt you'll see much performance hit.
If that SQL server is serving thousands of users, or has some intensive application running against with with thousands of queries and calculations/second, you'll see a massive performance hit.
For a small/medium workload, this is almost always enough; but for large workloads, you'd really want to have SQL Server running on physical hardware, for two main reasons:
Everything I've ever experienced of virtualization comes with a considerable performance hit, in particular on the IO. I would never run a heavy DB on a VM.
