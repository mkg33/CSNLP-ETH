and since then many of my Applications keep crashing multiple times while I’m using them. Twitter, MPlayerX, VLC, Photoshop, Sketch, etc. They crash and show a message like this:
Unfortunately if you do not own a dvd for the OS (Mavericks nor Mountain Lion have one), Internet access is the only method. When you get the HDD zeroed-out and install a clean OS, immediately make a clone of the HDD for future use (in leu of a DVD).
This could be a hardware issue like defective RAM. Run Apple's Hardware Test (for Macs made after 2013 Hardware Diagnostics) to check that. 
(The reason is different with each app). I’m really getting tired of this problem since I have to start over what I was doing every time.  
There is no other means of obtaining a work-a-round. Either find a broadband connection or visit an Apple Genius Bar where they can perform the reinstall in minutes from their SSD files.
Use the cmd-r during start up and follow the instructions to repair/reinstall the Mavericks form the web.
If you Mac has magnetic hard drives then you should perform a full "zeroing-out" of the disk by using Disk Utility first. I recommend doing at least one full pass of zeros.
