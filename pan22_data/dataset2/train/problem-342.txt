I recently upgraded to Apache 2.4.7 (x86) and PHP 5.5.9 (x86 as Apache module) on Windows 7 x64.  I downloaded the Apache binary from apachelounge.com and the PHP binary from windows.php.net.
You have at some stage copied something from either Apache or PHP into somewhere like C:\windows\system32 or something like that and whatever that was was not removed when you uninstalled the previous versions, and it is that that is causing the problems.
It should not be necessary to copy anything to the Windows folder or have anything hardcoded onto your PATH.
Now the error logs keep telling me that the PHP build API and certain extension APIs (php_fileinfo.dll for instance) are mismatched.  I downgraded back to Apache 2.2.22 and PHP 5.3.6, using the original MSI's I previously installed them with, and I have the same problem!
I moved dll files around and found that they worked when they were in C:\PHP.  Then I renamed the extensions folder to C:\PHP\extensions and modified php.ini to reflect it and everything worked!  Then I changed it back and it was running perfectly!
Solved!  I'm not sure what could have created the problem but I'm sure it had something to do with the 'extension_dir = "c:/php/ext"' line in php.ini.
