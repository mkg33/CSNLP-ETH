You can migrate using third party software like ShadowProtect or DoubleTake among others... these are not inexpensive solutions.
KEY question #1: Did you buy SBS preinstalled on the server?  If so, you CANNOT virtualize it.  OEM copies cannot be virtualized.  If you bought a volume license or retail copy, you CAN do this - those can be virtualized.
Assuming you don't have an OEM copy then I ask KEY question #2: Are you suggesting you have NO other computer with at least the capability to have 8 GB of RAM and a virtualization capable processor?  Almost EVERY new computer sold in the last couple years and MANY in the last 5 support this configuration.  At worst, you could build one for $400.
I did basically this exact same thing for a client in October (only difference, is we upgraded them to SBS 2011 Standard from SBS 2008 Standard.  But logically, it wouldn't have been different to migrate to SBS 2008 (the same version).
If your TIME is not valueable, then you can do this the by doing a swing migration to a temporary server.  It's like an upgrade only you're staying on the same version.  You install another system with Hyper-V, migrate to that server, then reload the physical server with Hyper-V and export the VM from the temporary server and import into the newly installed physical server running Hyper-V.
