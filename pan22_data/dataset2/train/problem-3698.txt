Alright, I figured it out. All you need to do is hover over any un-opened application, make sure it's highlighted, and hold shift and right click ONCE. This might also be the problem that caused the error in the first place as well.
4. If the Taskbar don't show after a minute, go to File -> Run new task and write Explorer. This is worked for me.
The problem is when, for some reason, I accidentally Right-Alt Right-clicked an icon in the taskbar. And that causes to freeze the highlighting on any icon that is selected from the taskbar. I managed to solve this by:
I can't find any solution for this in the internet pages. Any help is highly appreciate it because this thing is really frustrating.
1* Right-click an icon on the taskbar. (nothing will happen, except that icon highlight sticks). 2* Press the WIN-Key. (opens the Start menu + the context menu for the previously Right-clicked icon).
Okay, so I was playing around with the Start button, and I figured it out: First, right-click any NOT opened program on your task bar, for example, if you don't have Windows Store open, right click on that icon.  Then press the Start button.  After that, click on an empty space in your task bar, and it should be fixed.  I hope that worked for you, because it worked for me.
In case shift + right click does not work (which it did not for me although it used to on Win 7/8), Ctrl + right click worked for me.
This problem is not new to me as it occurs when I was using [Windows 7 + Windows 8.1], and Found a solution that worked with the both OSs: (Shift-Right Click). But in Windows 10 that is no more applicable. I don't know but I think Microsoft is keeping this bug as an evil-eye protection, this is the 4th OS upgrade and the bug still exists.
