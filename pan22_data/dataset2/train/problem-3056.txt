Putting the data onto removable USB drives so that you can lock up the drives at night seams even less secure to me than running the database on a computer under a desk.
If the data is sitting on a USB Drive, then someone could walk by, unplug the drive slip it into there pocket and they are gone.  If the data is stored on internal drives in the server they have to take the entire computer to get the data, which is much more obvious.
The only people who should have access to that room (who should have the key to the room) are the person or people who manage the servers.  The manager of those people will probably want a key as well, but he doesn't actually need one.  There should be a spare key in a sealed envelope in a locked drawer the HR managers office in case something happens to the IT staff.
As for performance of SQL Server on a USB drive, the performance will be horrible as USB is very slow, as are thumb drives and external hard drives.
If the data on the SQL Server is really that important pick a small office (or storage closet as long as it has good AC) and mark this as the server room.  Put the SQL Server and other machines running server processes into this room and lock the door.  Make sure that the cleaning crew knows that there is nothing in there for them to clean, better yet take back there key to that room.
As for network protection to prevent people from accessing the data over the network, that should be done via normal best practices (minimum permissions, firewalls, etc).
