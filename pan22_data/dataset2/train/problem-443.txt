I have recently started experiencing very strange issues on my self-built PC system. Although the system is still very speedy, it's very fluctuating now. This is most notable when using graphically intense applications.
Now I'm no expert, but this seems to me like something is very much wrong. And could be causing all sorts of instabilities. It even makes me wonder why my system hasn't exploded altogether.
I also think I can exclude my HDD/SSD from being the problem, because my system boots in about 10 seconds.
Symptoms on the software side are that sometimes performance is unstable. For example in the Box2D testbed, I often times run at 60FPS capped. While other times it barely reaches 1-5FPS in the same tests.
To resolve it I tried ran some stress tests on CPU, RAM and GPU. All this showed is that those components are actually functioning quite good. (Cooling is also good, 100% CPU for 20 minutes resulted in a stable 48 Celsius in temperature. AFAIK until it goes near 70 it should be pretty.)
