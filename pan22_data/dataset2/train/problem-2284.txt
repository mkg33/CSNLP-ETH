I am not sure if database partitioning is the solution for you without more details.  But partitioning alone solves some difficult issues with may relate.  In general database partitioning achieves the same thing your doing now just in a more automated way.  Think of a partitioned tables as nothing more than several tables with the same name.  Each partition stores a subset of your data. When your ready to access it you use the same parent table name but include a filter in the where clause to limit the data. A common way to partition tables is by date.  You could create a new partition for every month using the following example:
This allows you to query a single table in your report and just filter by the date.  So if you want to see only stuff from Jan 2014 then include that range in your where clause. MySQL will only query that 1 partition rather than scanning the entire table.  Using this method is great for archiving data, maximizing query performance, and also giving you the ability to prune your data quickly by dropping individual partitions.
