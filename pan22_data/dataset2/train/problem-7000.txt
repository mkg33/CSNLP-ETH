I have a really great alias, h. It's really just "history | grep", but I filter out previous "h command" entries with the "grep -E -v"
If you have your shell configured to use vi key bindings (set -o vi or having set editing-mode vi in $HOME/.inputrc), then you search with <Esc>/some-command<Return> and hit n (next) or Shift-n (previous) to cycle through the command line history.
Notice that the command is expanded, replaced, and output before the command is run, so if the wrong command is run you can see what bash thought it was doing.
Another related and useful technique is the ability to run a previous command while changing a word.  Say you typoed the directory name, or want to change the file name:
This instructs bash such that, after any history actions (like !!:s/prev_text/after_text), it places the resulting line to the command prompt. Then you can review or edit the command, and press Enter afterwards.
I prefer to use history-search-backward over reverse-search-history. The former lets you type a few characters of the command then press the search key, as opposed to hitting the search key first then typing the search string.
