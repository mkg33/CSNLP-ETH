The reason for that is that the Virtual account is auto-managed and can access the n/w in a domain environment.
During normal installation with user interface there is no need to specify passwords for services. I assume that setup generates random passwords or they are handled by Windows virtual accounts.
I have seen this type of failure before. Somehow something still knows that that managed account had been created already and therefore now requires a password. 
My situation was slightly different but I had the same problem.  Was trying to use Managed Service Accounts in a SQL configuration file for unattended installation.  To make this work I removed the entries for the passwords altogether.  So in your example of ( RSSVCPASSWORD="" ), deleting the entire line allowed the install to complete.
My question is why do I have to provide a password with silent installation while it is no needed during normal installation.
I am a database developer and I have a task to prepare silent installation of SQL Server 2012 using configuration file.
No, you should not provide the password for Virtual accounts. The Password Parameter should be left blank.
However when I use configuration file then setup expect to provide a password either in the file or in the command prompt.
