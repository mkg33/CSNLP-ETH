Disclosure: from 2002 to 2009, I've been working as a network engineer for the Swiss Stock Exchange (then known as SWX, later as SIX Swiss Exchange). We did not have a trading floor as such, but we ran the "other end" of a trading platform (the server side) and our own market surveillance departments had similar requirements of uptime, reliability and low-latency.
Run. Don't turn around, don't look back! RUN! Until you find someone who can help you with this. I don't think NESE, although there's networking gods walking around here, is a place do discuss such a project. 
Fingerpointing between business and IT will ensue, once things go wrong, and trading departments are VERY quick with their fingers, and they usually have very good ties to top management. I strongly suggest you pursue a thorough top-down approach here to avoid disaster. 
That may sound overly dramatic, but without precisely defined requirements, and to the point definitions how and how far to fulfill each of them, all your engineering effort will remain foggy.
