You can simply re-download the file using a different method which does not set the security flag in the first place. Firefox has an about:config option to disable the security flag. Google Chrome does not have the option to disable it.
What happens if copy (in the normal explorer) the procexp to a new file and launch that one? That usually fixes the problem for me (unless the file is block, then you have to unblock it as well).
Or an ftp program.. Or any one of a million other ways of putting this file on your computer which does NOT involve "downloading it with IE8"
When you downloaded the exe with IE8, it set an NTFS security flag on this file. There is nothing you can do to fix it from that point onward if your workstation is locked down.
I believe right clicking the file, clicking Properties, and clicking Unblock will solve the problem. (unless it's a different dialog)
The block is merely some side data in the NTFS stream so you can use "streams" from sysinternals if you want to fix that, if the normal explorer is fighting with you.
If you want to remove the warning for a particular executable file, you can trick Windows into thinking that the file originated from a safe location. You can't accomplish this by a simple copy (in Windows 7 or later, at least), but I most frequently bypass the warning by archiving the file (e.g. in a ZIP file) and then extracting it to a new location, or to the same location after deleting the original file.
