It gets the job done with a minimum of fuzz and saves me from having to install additional software on the server. Just ctrl-c the script when you are done.
Is there a way to have a holding page saying something along the lines of "The site is down don't panic" - just a static html page, nothing fancy, when apache is restarted or goes down?
You could probably set it up start when apache goes down, but I done see the need. Random outages of apache are pretty much unknown in my environment. 
If it is possible how would I go about doing it? Would it require a separate web server running which kicks in once apache goes down.
The "correct" answer is that you should have a cluster with automated failover for unplanned outages, and shift your DNS to a new server for planned outages... But as you probably have noticed that is not always an option. 
The first thing I would like to ask is what kind of websites are you hosting? If its a small personal or corporate website that doesn't have many visitors, then don't worry about a little bot of downtime, or get a reliable hosting provider. 
it might be possible if you have an upstream cache (squid or similar) that can return a page while the server is restarting.
I'd suggest using reverse proxy, for example NgniX. Then on Apache being down, you'd get 502 or 504 error, which you can handle with you custom error page.
If you would really like to have a page then you could use a reverse proxy server to redirect the user while the web server is down.
