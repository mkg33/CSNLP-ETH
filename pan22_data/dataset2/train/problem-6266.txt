The ASA only supports FAT-32-formatted file systems for the internal eUSB and external USB drives. If you insert an external USB drive that is not in FAT-32 format, the system mounting process fails, and you receive an error message. You can enter the command format disk1: to format the partition to FAT-32 and mount the partition to disk1 again; however, data might be lost.
You should be able to format the drive on the primary box and copy the software image (nb - it's just FAT32).  This will get you to where you should be able to convince the bad box to boot, at which point you can restore the configuration and drop back into the standby role.
The boot flash (disk0) on that is an internal eUSB.  I don't have a 5508-X handy to see if it can be swapped out easily or if it was soldered in.  You might be able to get away with using a USB thumb drive connected to one of the external ports and adjusting boot variables accordingly.  
The ASA contains one internal USB flash drive, and a standard USB Type A port that you can use to attach an external device. The USB port can provide output power of 5 volts, up to a maximum of 500 mA (5 USB power units).
You can use the external Type A USB port to attach a data-storage device. The external USB drive identifier is disk1. When the ASA is powered on, a connected USB drive is mounted as disk1 and is available for you to use. Additionally, the file-system commands that are available to disk0 are also available to disk1, including copy, format, delete, mkdir, pwd, cd, and so on.
