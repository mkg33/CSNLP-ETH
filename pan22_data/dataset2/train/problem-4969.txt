Is your network properly configured?  pkg_add can't seem to resolve cdn.openbsd.org (hence no address associated with name), which likely means you either have no DNS server configured (it should be in /etc/resolv.conf, which usually is written by dhclient if you use DHCP to configure a network interface) or you have it configured but can't reach it because your network connection is down.  Check if your network is up and properly configured and check if you have a nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf.
I am compleatly new to OpenBSD so I started reading the documentation, after tried pkg_add emacs, this is the result
Now I am certain that there is something wrong in the config of pkg_add, but what? I have tried running pkg_check, but it just say everything is ok.
So I try installing python3.4 using (as the documentation) pkg_add python%3.4, but get the same error as before when trying with emacs.
Would like to have emacs installed on my server running OpenBSD instead of just vi, reason because I am used to emacs.
