Well, the alert (and the LED) cleared after a reboot of the IMM and a reboot of the server. Which of these was the "solution" I don't know, we just happened to need to do both at about the same time.
The server had a disk added, and then the operator realized they put the disk in the wrong server, so they pulled it out again. No harm done, the server is running and the disk was never actually accessed from the OS, but the Fault LED went on, and the IMM (Integrated Management Console) shows this "Active Event":
Are the Drive 5 member of your raid configuration? If yes, u can import the foreign config on that hard drive. There are 2 method, 1st Boot into the raid controller web bios utility. 2nd using Megaraid Storage Manager on ur OS (u have to install it 1st).
Since we don't need the drive (and indeed don't have it anymore), we want to clear this alert. I've tried clearing the event log, and it did remove the "disk inserted" and "disk removed" events, but neither the Fault LED nor the "Active Event".
