dmesg has nothing that seems relevant. I've tested the graphics card and it seems to be just fine, as is my other hardware. I may have done a security update recently, but don't know which ones as I rarely reboot this machine.
The xinit program allows a user to manually start an X server. The startx script is a front-end for xinit.
By default, xinit and startx start an X server on display :0 and then start an xterm on it. When the xterm terminates, xinit and startx kill the X server. In general, xinit and startx can start an arbitrary server and run an arbitrary script. Typically, this script runs a number of programs and a window manager.
A few days ago, it stopped initializing the gui and just drops me into a character mode screen. I can login there, but no graphical interface. I've got the nvidia drivers installed and have two monitors configured which has also been working fine.
I have a Kubuntu 10.04 system that I use for software development. I've had it for quite a while and things have been working well - no unexplained glitches. I've got it setup so that it automatically boots into the KDE gui.
Two alternative methods for starting an X server are by using a display manager and by starting the X server and then manually starting one or more clients. On desktop Linux systems, using a display manager is the most commonly used method.
