With either of this two methods you will also obtain the list of mac addresses of any devices that are connected to your network infraestructure: PCs, printers, access points, etc. In the first case, even of devices without an IP address. This may or may not be want you want, but it may worth a try.
You can use a program called SIW, it's free and scans the network requiring no permissions, or args. 
Another option and (again) depending on your topology and your type of networking equipment, you may also try to get the mac addresses of your devices displaying the arp table on your routers.
As long as you run this command from a host in the same network segment, nmap will report all of the MAC address for each host is discovers. 
For the MAC addresses I need to be root on my Ubuntu box. Also a simple method for a single host is just to ping it and look at the arp table with arp -a if you wanted to only use commands normally included in the initial install of a distribution:
Is there some easy way to find out mac address of all machines on my network rather than doing an SSH into each and ifconfig | grep HWaddr if there are 300 machines on network I really need some easy solution.
Depending on your LAN topology, your best shot may be to display the MAC address table on your switches.
Will scan 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.255. Look up CIDR notation on wiki if you're not familiar with this subnet notation.
