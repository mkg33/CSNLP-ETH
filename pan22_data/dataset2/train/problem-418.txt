All you have to do is visually create a rule, similar to how your create filters in Gmail, and then specify a folder in your Google drive. The add-on runs in the background and will automatically download the matching emails to the corresponding Drive folder
There is an add-on called "Save Emails and Attachments" that you can use to download email messages and file attachments from Gmail to Google Drive automatically. But emails are archived as PDF files.The add-on is completely free but there’s a premium version as well that offers a few additional benefits.
