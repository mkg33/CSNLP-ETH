Likewise is popular, but I've been using Centrify Express for all of my linux boxes in my work lab lately & it's been great.  It comes with their own version of SAMBA & getting it set up is a simple as installing the RPM (make sure you read the PDF though).
Take a look at Likewise Open.  Much less mucking around necessary, though having an emulated windows registry isn't exactly my idea of a good time.  But, the more recent versions have gotten pretty solid, it's worth a look.
SSSD may be the answer although I haven't used it yet so I don't know.  What I have used is winbind from samba3x and that worked fairly well.  The problem with configuring kerberos and ldap directly, for me at least, is that you then have to backfill UID/GID and home directory for all your existing users and maintain two worlds of data in AD/LDAP which didn't seem like a good use of time.  winbind will expose the native AD groups, rekey its machine account in kerberos, etc.  The only downside is that it insists on 15 character or less hostnames for maintaining some weird kind of netbios compatibility that I'm not convinced actually exists or matters to anything inside windows anymore and every once and a while the daemon gets wedged and needs to be restarted which requires working OOB access.  Combine with pam_mkhomedir and pam_access so accounts get homedirs autopopulated and you can limit who has access to which hosts if you need to.  Be advised that while usernames and groups with spaces in them work in a surprising number of places, they break some tools such as pam_access access.conf not working with groups with spaces in them.
