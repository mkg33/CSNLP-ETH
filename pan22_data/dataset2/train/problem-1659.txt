The quickest way is to grab the corners of the window with your mouse cursor and drag to resize it. You should then see the contents of the window.
I'm on Windows XP so this may be useless, but here in XP land (and for a few Windows versions before that) you can get to the properties you're looking for either by right-clicking the icon/shortcut you use to open the command prompt, or by left-clicking the icon in the top left corner of the command window. In Properties, go to the Layout tab and increase Screen buffer size: Height to some big number like 1000.  If you do it that last way, when you click OK to exit the Properties dialog, it will ask if you want to make the settings the new default. Some variation on all that likely exists in Windows 7.
Right click on the title bar of the command window and select properties and select tab layout. A scroll bar will be shown when screen buffer size is bigger then the windows size.
