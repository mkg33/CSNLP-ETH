To install SQL Server on a workstation operating system, you need either the Developer Edition installation, which is basically enterprise version but with limits to production usage, you can use it for development.
Which version of SQL Server do you have? The standard and enterprise versions require a server operating system, even for the evaluation version.
Note that the developer edition usually follows a license for one of the full versions, or an MSDN subscription, I'm unsure whether you can buy developer licenses separate. In either case, Developer is not free, in the sense that you won't get it without giving Microsoft some money.
On the other hand, you can use the Express edition, which is a version that doesn't have all the enterprise-y features. It is free, but as I said, doesn't have all the features that Enterprise/Standard/Developer have, so it depends on what you intend to use it for.
If you intend to develop software for it for distribution over the internet, then I would advice you to use the Express version and limit yourself to the features it support. That way, more people would be in your target group.
