This is what you want. You build your own custom open source operating system by scrolling or searching through the site for the modules you want...check the box next to the ones you want and when you've finished your selection select "BUILD"(choose your boot platform,ie. Live Cd or Live USB) and your done.
It sounds like you're over thinking Linux. Any Linux distribution allows for a customized kernel, that's the point (and one of many powerful features) of Linux.  You should install any of the big name Linux distros with a package system and be good to go.  For instance in Fedora ( http://www.fedoraproject.org ) you can simply select Add/Remove Software and select a "collection" like Developer Libraries and it installs the proper packages.
I have built several of these from Slax, Puppy and DSL where each was customized for the computer at hand.
If you want massive flexibility (but time consuming) I'd recommend you use a distro such as Arch or Gentoo.  I'm not 100% sure, but I can't see any reason you couldnt run these from a USB drive.
Two others are similar...Puppy Linux and Damn Small Linux(DSL for short). These two can be very small distros'...some people report a complete operating system with KDE or even Gnome under 50mb.
However you will need to do more than just "tick a few boxes", but the build will be relatively painless, very lightweight and easy to script for repeatability.
"only a few apps" and "Gnome" is a contradiction in terms. Also, installing extra software doesn't really mean modular. Pretty much any distro can do what you want, sounds like a better question would be which distro is the easiest to do that.
