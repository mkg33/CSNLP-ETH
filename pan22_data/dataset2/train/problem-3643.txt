I encountered the same poor-font-rendering issue immediately after making a system tweak. Undoing the tweak corrected the rendering issue. In an attempt to speed up my machine, I modified System Properties/Advanced/Performance to adjust for best performance, which disabled "Smooth edges of screen fonts." When that option was re-enabled, the font rendering issue disappeared.

This is due to a current problem with Chrome's font scaling if Windows' font/content scaling feature is activated (i.e. if you have a high resolution / big screen and set Windows to make things bigger so that you can actually read them).

For me it was simply monitor settings. I use a HDTV as my monitor, and it was using a preset that worked fine for gaming, but the contrast, brightness, and other settings made text look like it was being anti-aliased wrong. Simply changing to a different preset fixed it for me.
