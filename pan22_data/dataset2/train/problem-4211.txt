Also ensure your router has correct DNS servers on it's WAN settings otherwise when your CentOS box goes down and clients use the router, it will have no idea where to get the DNS records from.
Option A: setup dd-wrt with your CentOS box as primary DNS, and your ISPs DNS as secondary DNS. In dd-wrt, you can enforce strict ordering of DNS servers, which overcomes the restriction I pointed out in response to Robin's answer. References: dd-wrt forum and dd-wrt wiki. Note that I am not sure this will work with your CentOS box on your LAN; if not, that leaves you with option B.
Set your DHCP server (likely your router) to hand out leases with your CentOS box as primary DNS and the router as secondary. Reason being you would prefer your client pc's to use the CentOS box as this has the relevant records for our testing websites and anything else, and when you do have to take this box down, clients will fall back to your router which will serve DNS records for the public internet but will have no knowledge of your internal structure. 
If the clients are using static ip details, then you will need to manually enter your CentOS box as primary DNS and your router as secondary. 
I can think of two solutions to your problem. In both cases, set the DNS for your clients to the dd-wrt router.
