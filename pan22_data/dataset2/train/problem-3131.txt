There is not much to go on from your question in the way of details, but here are some general pointers.
Please also measure disc latency because that may be a culprit - but generally: start profiling, doing a load test (on a separate system) and figuring out code wise which part is fast.
However web pages can sometimes be very slow, and some queries can take multiple seconds to do anything, and this is starting to frustrate my users (clicking on an edit link can take 10 seconds in some cases before the textbox appears).
As the server doesn't seem to be being utilised can anyone point me in the right direction as to where to start looking for performance enhancements?
First thing, make sure you're metrics are being gathered correctly.  In a virtual environment you can't necessarily rely on traditional performance counters.  The host can (and will)  regulate hardware allocations to your VM based its load and the demands of other VM's it's managing.
Grab them, analyze them. Would not be the first time that a programmer not really knowing what he does or not having a real load scenario in mind (or available for testing) is missing indices that get critical under production load.
THAT SAID: also consider running your site access through cloudflare and have them cache - that may give a faster user experience.
