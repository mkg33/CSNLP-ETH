Consider using the mintty terminal instead, which offers xterm-compatible terminal emulation with a native Windows UI, i.e. it doesn't require an X server. Installing it through Cygwin's setup.exe creates a start menu shortcut in the Cygwin folder.
If you're primarily running Cygwin X Clients, then the cygwin X server probably makes the most sense.  If you're running clients from UNIX/Linux, it may be easier to run Xming. This is basically a port of the Cygwin XServer code to run as native Windows using mingw.
You'll get the X menu in the lower right-hand corner.  You can configure the contents of that by editing your .XWinrc file.
This will then execute whatever's in your .startxwinrc file, which you can make your choice of terminal.
I remember a few years back, I was able to edit some shell script and then create a shortcut to it, so that anytime I needed an xterm I just used to click on the shortcut which would start the X Server and starts an XTerm client.
I think you mean startxwin which is both a Cygwin script and should be in your Windows "Start->Programs-> X server" menu.  I think the file you're thinking of editing is $HOME/.startwinrc, where you can add clients. I think you also need to make sure you have a window manager, something like WindowMaker (wmaker.exe)
