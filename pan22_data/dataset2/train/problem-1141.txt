I have color-coded a few of the rows to help illustrate the pattern, which essentially consists of flipping the highlighted portion of the row horizontally, and then rotating downwards and to the right, as if on a hinge.
I have included two screenshots which I hope will illustrate the pattern and how the data should be organized:
I'm hoping that this can be done recursively through built in excel functions since I have little experience with VBA.
I am having trouble manipulating my dataset into the form I need. I have 50 spreadsheets whose data must be reorganized in a certain pattern to be correctly interpreted by a software program. For one the spreadsheets, I have the initial dataset, as well as what it should look like after being reorganized. I figure that if I can recreate the final sheet starting from the initial one, then I'll be able to use the same method on the other spreadsheets.   
My colleague and I tried using the built in function offset but made little progress, so I'm hoping someone knows of a more efficient way of solving this.
