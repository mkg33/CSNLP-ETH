Here's the simplest possible proof: suppose the computer has a total of $N$ possible states, and suppose there is something outside of the computer in the universe, so the universe has at least $N+1$ possible distinct states.  With zero overhead, each state of the computer can correspond to a state of the universe, but since the universe has more states than the computer, some states of the universe will map to the same state of the computer, in which case the simulation will not be able to distinguish between them.
Now, is this doable? It might be tempting to use a counting argument (there are more states in $W$ than in $C$) and say that it is impossible. But this is not necessarily the case!
Start the automaton and see what happens. The current state of $W$ will always be equal to the state of $C$ + its mirror image. That is, merely inspecting $C$ is enough to tell what is the state of whole $W$.
A finite computer cannot simulate itself, in contrast to a Turing machine that has an infinite tape and can simulate any other Turing machine. It is, however, possible to simulate any computer on a similar computer, but you need a little more memory than the "simulated" one (like in a virtual machine): http://meaningofstuff.blogspot.com/2016/03/can-computer-or-human-simulate-itself.html
(Of course here the computer interacts with $W$, and affects the future state of $W \setminus C$. But that's what happens in the real world, too.)
Let $X$ take a turing machine $M$ as its input and decides whether it halts or not by simulating the universe (since $M$ is included in the universe), then do the opposite (e.g. $X$ halts if $M$ does not, and loops forever if $M$ halts). Then $X(X)$ demonstrates a contradiction. 
Let's replace the "universe" by something that is very discrete and simple (and finite!). Let's say that our universe is a finite cellular automaton. In particular, the whole world $W$ is an $n \times n$ grid.
The same applies when you want the state of the universe after $t$ time. Since $X$ can not decide if it will halt within $t$ time or not within $t$ time (same argument), then it will let it to the universe to do it. Trying to simulate the universe doing it, can not reduce the time you'll take to decide. And if deciding how the universe will look like in $t$ time takes more than $t$ then the simulation will diverge (as $t$ goes to infinity). 
Essentially this means that the best $X$ can do to decide whether $X$ halts or not is just by running itself (i.e. let the universe work its way), so simulating the universe doesn't give an advantage.
I guess we could try to see this as a modelling problem: how can we re-phrase the question so that it becomes computer science and not physics? I'll try to give a simple, concrete example of how we might try to do this, to get things started...
No, a computer cannot perfectly simulate itself in addition to something else without violating basic information theory: there exist strings which are not compressible.
Assume that there is a turing machine $X$ that can simulate every atom in the universe including itself, it then necessarily can simulate itself. 
This leads to the conclusion that only useful simulator that decides how the universe will look like in $t$ time must take exactly $t$ time, i.e. by letting the universe work. This simulator is then indeed the trivial simulator.
I am not sure if this answers your question but I hope it could be meaningful and leads to some insight.
Let's assume that our cellular automaton is totalistic. Then what we can do is we simply let $C$ be the right half of our grid $W$, and let the initial configuration of $C$ be a mirror image of $W \setminus C$, so that everything is symmetric. That's it.
Assume that the initial configuration of the world $W$ is arbitrary. Now the question seems to be the following: Can we choose a strict subset $C$ of $W$ ("computer"), and an initial state of $C$, that satisfies the following conditions:
Now it might be interesting to see if there is a non-trivial answer to this question. For example, which CAs admit computers that have size smaller than half of $W$?
