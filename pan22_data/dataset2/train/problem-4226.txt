Because they moved from Python to Objective-C, I suspect you're not going to be able to cross-compile between all platforms anymore from the same code base.
You write your code in Java and it handles converting your Java code to JavaScript (via GWT) for HTML, to ARM assembly (via IKVM to go from Java bytecode to CLR bytecode, then MonoTouch to compile CLR bytecode to a native iOS app), to ActionScript via a custom GWT backend that generates ActionScript instead of JavaScript, and to Android and desktop Java with no conversions.
You could try the Angel Engine. It's based on C++, OpenGL, Box2D, and it uses Python for scripting. It's mostly for prototyping, but the recent versions seem to focus on making full games.
There really isn't any reason you can't use Unity3D to create "2D" games.  You can use textured quads and an orthographic camera, and you have yourself a 2D game.  There are even some unique solutions like using a skeletal animation system and putting sprites on top of different joints, or using a really tight perspective camera to get cheap parallaxing.
There are even middleware providers for Unity to provide better sprite management solutions.  Like sprite manager 2.
Unity3d is best 2d game development tools and engine. alternatively monogame. html5 and  flash is not appropriate for this topic. already flash is dead. 
Cocos2D originated under Mac/Windows in Python and is available in an Objective-C flavor under the iPhone. It's popular in 2D iPhone game development. Ray Wenderlich has some great Cocos2D tutorials for the iPhone.
