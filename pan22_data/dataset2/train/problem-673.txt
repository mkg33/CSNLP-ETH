I have a Gigabyte GA-880GA-UD3H with an on-board SATA RAID controller that was working fine for about a year. I have 4x1.5TB drives in a RAID5 configuration. 
I've tried playing with advanced power management settings by setting the drives to never go to sleep, but that didn't help.
I haven't tried to rollback because I'm not sure where to get the old drivers or even what the version was.
I'd really like some info on how I can get this to generate some sort of log, or error so I know why this is happening, and also any help in tracking down an older driver would probably solve this as well.
After updating the driver set to the latest on the Gigabyte support site ("AMD Chipset driver 8.71") the system started freezing randomly. I figured out it has something to do with the RAID device by disabling it in the device manager. While the RAID volume is disabled I have a happy, stable system, and as soon as I re-enable the volume and reboot it runs for about 10 minutes and then freezes with no error in the event viewer.
