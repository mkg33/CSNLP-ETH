I'm partial to a free app called PRIO, which is a process priority saver (among other things) with a very small ( less than 1 MB) footprint. After installation it runs silently in the background until you need it, and its interface builds directly into the Windows Task Manager, extending its functionality and making it as if the added features were always part of Task Manager. When you right-click a process in Task Manager with the intent of changing its priority, some of PRIO's added features become apparent, as you can change not only the process' CPU priority but its I/O priority as well (ergo your question), and you can choose to SAVE the new settings if you so desire. This last makes it so that every time that process ( i.e.  that program) is run, both the CPU and I/O process priorities set and saved by you will come into effect.
The app has other features that also extend the functionality of the various tabs in the Windows Task Manager. Versions exist for both 32- and 64-bit systems, and the app is free for personal use.
