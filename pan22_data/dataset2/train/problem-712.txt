Check Control Panel --> Device Manager --> Disks --> double click on the disk drives and make sure that under Policies tab drive 'write cache' is enabled and there is no 'optimize for quick removal' enabled. This is directly related with how windows considered or not a drive being removable.
I did all the above and my system still thought my two hard drives were removable drives but I did the following and It fixed the problem.  Check Control Panel --> Device Manager --> Disks -->right click on the drive in question and select properties --> then select Volumes --> populate... this will identify the drive as a hard drive. Once done, reboot . All fixed.
