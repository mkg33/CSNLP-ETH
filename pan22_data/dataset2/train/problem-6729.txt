Again, mysqltuner is for reference, if you don't see  performance issues you don't need to blindly follow the suggestions.
So there's tuner's logic, if the (Created_tmp_disk_tables/Created_tmp_tables)*100 is more than 25(%) then increase your tmp-table size (upto max 256M).
I use MySQL version 5.6.25-0ubuntu0.15.04.1 on 64-bit Ubuntu 15.04. I have 2GB RAM and the disk is SSD (so, in my mind, writing to disk isn't that costly). I currently have databases for just two small Wordpress blogs. I wasn't trying to get too deep into optimizing this but I encountered what I consider to be strange behavior.
There is a page in manual covering internal usage of tmp tables. I will try to give a short overview:
Also note that tmp table has nothing to do with InnoDB vs MyISAM (if you mean that in your last line). You might want to read about internal temporary tables.
Do not use any suggestions from mysqltuner unless you understand what they mean - mostly they are unfortunately nonsense.
My problem is the tmp_table_size (and max_heap_table_size). Every week I've been increasing it and MySQLTuner keeps suggesting larger. (As you can see, it now proposes >128M.) I can see from the above output that it's writing tables to disk, which I assume is the reason for the suggestion. However, in my understanding, this only relates to the MyISAM engine, while all of my Wordpress tables are using the InnoDB engine. I assume there are some internal MySQL tables that may be using MyISAM, but I still don't know why MySQLTuner thinks I need such a massive table size just for that minimal stuff.
Probably Wordpress uses such queries and tables that MySQL has no chance to actually use the MEMORY engine in most cases.
