Ubuntu is based off Debian and I've found the Securing Debian Manual  to be very useful in Debian-based distributions in completely walking you through your system and checking every part. It's basically a really, really comprehensive answer to your question.
Also, the exploits I have seen were almost always related to unsecure user code, not unsecure configuration. The default configurations in minimal, server distributions tend to be pretty secure.
Say I've got a fresh install of Ubuntu, what steps should I take to secure it for use as a Rails application server?
Of course this list isn't complete, and you'll never be completely safe, but it covers all the exploits I have seen in real life.
If you're going anywhere near the Internet with the server, install an intrusion detection system like snort. 
One quick thing that I do early on is install DenyHosts.  It will regularly look through the /var/log/secure, looking for failed logins, and after a couple of failures, block the IP. I set it to block after the first no-such-user, on the second attempt at root, and after a couple of tries for real users (in case you mess up, but you should be using a SSH public key to login).
