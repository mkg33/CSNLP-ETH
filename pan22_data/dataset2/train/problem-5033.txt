Also on my laptop support page, an integrated graphics driver software (intel hd graphics) is also available. So is it possible?
One more question I have is that why my computer display works fine without gpu driver installed? Could it be integrated graphics powering it?
Note: Tried to install different versions of amd drivers with same result, used DDU to wipe and re-install drivers, tried some fixes found on google, nothing works!! Warrantly period is over :(
sorry if this is not the right place to ask this question. Since a few days my laptop is BSODing with error atikmpag.sys (after showing a garbled screen when booting) if I install amd graphics drivers. If however I uninstall the amd driver, it boots up fine. Is it possible to enable the integrated graphics that is present in the cpu (i5 3230m)? Looks like the gpu needs reflow, but that is last resort option, so it would be fine with integrated graphics (if possible). The only problem I have without gpu installed is that I can't change the screen brightness(always full brightness). Also I went to a laptop repair shop, the person says he'll remove the gpu from mobo and enable integrated graphics, but I don't trust him as I'm sure the gpu is fine.
The only reason I'm asking this question is because that person (laptop repair shop) said he'll do it (enable integrated graphics)
