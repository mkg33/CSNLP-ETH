This works but I need to specify all the sheets. If I add a new worksheet I need to modify all the formulas. How could I solve this issue to make it generic?
The AGGREGATE function is designed for columns of data, or vertical ranges. It is not designed for rows of data, or horizontal ranges. For example, when you subtotal a horizontal range using option 1, such as AGGREGATE(1, 1, ref1), hiding a column does not affect the aggregate sum value. But, hiding a row in vertical range does affect the aggregate."
It sounds like u would need to first copy the cells to a single worksheet, then use the AGGREGATE function.
This funtion adds the content of all A2 cells on all the worksheets contained between MySheet1 and MySheetN both included. If I have one single error the sum results in an error. I see that there is an auxiliar AGGREGATE funtion that allows to ignore errors. 
Note: I am using the spanish version. I have tried to translate function name and syntax but might have forgot something.
