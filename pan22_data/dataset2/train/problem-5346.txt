DVTM also supports mouse integration; simply click on a terminal window in order to select it. Screenshots are available at the website linked above.
Don't forget the vim quickfix commands for the edit-compile cycle (see :help quickfix and :help make). 
You may also be interested in trying the Dynamic Virtual Terminal Manager. It does something similar to the screen features highlighted in a previous answer, but is in my opinion easier to work with. Here are some of the default keybindings:
Maybe it's a radical suggestion but consider using a tiling window manager. In the following screenshot you can see vim in the left column, with the quickfix window opened, and on the right an xterm used to launch and test the application. The window manager used is called wmii. 
You can also try tmux , which is an alternative to GNU screen and is actively developed. You can set screen like shortcuts and have a nice configurable status bar.
If you don't use vim-specific features (but rather use only vi-compatible commands), you might try vile, a vi clone with intelligent multiple buffer handling, more similar to emacs.
This also has the advantage of allowing you to use your editor inside a screen session without removing your use of any other screen windows.
