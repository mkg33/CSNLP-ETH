Then the connections are ok, but the problem for sure is a hardware problem with the camera and you have to change the camera for a new one. Don't waste time trying to solve it because it's a defective camera. If you get a new one it will work.
I had the same problem. Comparing it to a number of other posts, the most likely answer is that two processes/applications are trying to access the PiCam at the same time. This can be ffmpeg streaming, motion, raspivid, raspistill, etc.
I had the same error message because I had not updated the firmware (via sudo rpi-update) after enabling the camera via raspi-config. I had already updated the firmware a few days before and I thought it would suffice, but since the camera was not enabled back then, it did not help.
Then there is a connection problem. Check if the cable both ways are with the good side to the pins (and of course connected to the "camera" bus, not the "display" bus that are the same size).
If it didn't work, usually it's a hardware problem with the camera and the quick option is to change the camera with a new one.
In my case I needed to reseat the cable on the camera.  I had disconnected it to feed the cable through a case; it must not have made a good connection.
I've tried with last RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE (9.4 - 2018-06-27) in a PI3B v1.2 with a PI CAMERA 2.1, all fully upgraded (apt-get upgrade)
In researching this, there are a number of reasons that can lead to an ENOSPC message, I thought I would create a question here to catalog the possible causes.
