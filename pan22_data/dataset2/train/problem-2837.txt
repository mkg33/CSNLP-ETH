I'm getting a lot of hits on my server. This server normally gets little to no traffic yet there's is constant hits every time I bring the server back up. I get the following error first 
From the time-stamps, it does not seem like a very high hit-rate but from the IPs, it seems to be originating from all over. Most web-servers should be able to handle a few hits a second. However, you can try a few things to mitigate your problem.

OTOH if you really are webmaster for all these domains then have a look at mod_evasive and mod_security.
then sooner or later my httpd runs out of memory and my server becomes unresponsive. Any ideas on how to fix it? 
Setup a server section for your domain and one as a default for catch all requests. Any requests that arrive on the catch all domain return a 404 on them.
I've seen a big increase lately in scanning for open http proxies on my machines - it looks like you may running an open http proxy (which is just as bad as running an open mail relay - worse even, since most people now implement carious mitigations like RBL and SPF).

Also turn off KeepAlive by setting it to 0 and you probably want to disable logging for the default section till the attack goes down, else it will fill up our disk.
