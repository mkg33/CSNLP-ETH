I tested with my HP Compac 6710b / Windows 7 Pro with external monitor and found out that there is a Presentation state (got it by WIN+P). When choose Projector only I can close laptop and monitor stays on. Have to set laptop not to go sleep when closing lid also.
Try selecting the external monitor as a primary display. If that doesn't work check if there is a button to switch display outputs on your laptop.
I've already tried this solution http://www.troublefixers.com/stop-windows-7-laptop-from-sleeping-on-closing-lid/ but still problem is same.
Now when you close the lid, your laptop should keep running and should recognize that only the external display is available.
I have a new dell XPS laptop. My external Dell monitor attached to my laptop.Everything works fine if my laptop lid is open, but if I close the laptop lid, I lose the display on the monitor attached to laptop. How can I close the laptop and keep the display on the monitor showing?
Edit for windows 8: While in desktop mode right click the windows tile button, select power options, on left hand side select choose when to turn off the display, below all the options click change advanced power settings, scroll down to power buttons and lid, then select lid close action, and change both settings to never. boom youre all set :)
