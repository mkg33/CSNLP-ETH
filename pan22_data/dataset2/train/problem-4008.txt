Doing a gentoo install from bottom up is the best I can think of for a first start, it gives a nice perspective on how things work from inside out.
Ubuntu seems to be the beginner's choice these days so it's probably a good one to start with.  I personally don't use it but it seems to be all the rave with Windows users and people not familiar with Linux.
But setting up a complete (production ?) web server with php+mysql seems a little bit too much for an introduction.. (although under debian it's only a couple of apt-get's away - Compile from source!!)
Ubuntu would be my reccomendation. It mightn't have the most hardcore Linux features, and can be rightfully accused of pandering to Windows users, but when you're starting off, that's just what you need. It's also the only Linux distro to consistently "just work" with no hassle across all my pcs.
A great resource for learning the ins and outs is Linux Server Hacks by O'Reilly.  There is a follow up called More Linux Server Hacks.  I learn best by diving the deepest and a majority of the Hacks made no sense to me at all.  I had to struggle through them and from each one a Perl of wisdom popped out.  Strangely enough after three years some of them still make no sense to me but such is life.  I pick the book up often either as a reminder or as a challenge.  Good luck and God speed!
Ubuntu is better for new users, and I'd recommend the latest if you're only doing a small site. Get the server edition, and don't install X (the gui). CentOS/Red Hat are more enterprise focused, but I prefer the debian based distros, for the package manager.
My vote would be to take it easy on yourself and pick up Ubuntu in any flavor to start with.  There are silly little traps for getting too comfortable with Distros (aptitude vs. zypper vs. rpm vs. yum vs. Synaptic vs. GodKnowsWhatTheHeckElseSomeOneWillCallTheSameCrap).  Make sure you know what an rpm file is and avoid anything but a standard bash or ksh shell and you should make some decent progress.  
One of the best documented distro's in my opinion is Debian.  You can find a lot of information both on Debian's website and via http://www.google.com/linux.
