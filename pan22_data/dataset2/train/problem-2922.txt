You might be better served by using a shared filesystem, especially if the search index is readonly by the app using the search index (i.e. at the destination end). That way, much of the complexity is done for you.
Try bittorrent. It's designed to spread files over multiple hosts quickly. Multicast is going to make your network engineer scream in pain :)
I'd recommend looking at git. I've used that in the past to make changes on one server and push them out or have cron jobs on the other servers to pull them down. There is quite a bit of flexibility with the solution.
We have a cluster of machines (around 50 and growing). Each machine has a search index that needs to be updated multiple times per day. We currently update the index on each machine individually, but ideally, we could update it on one machine, then sync the new files to the rest of the cluster. We initially used rsync to handle this, but as the number of machines grew, it became apparent that this solution can't scale. I have just started researching multicast file transfers. Anyone with some experience here that can suggest some places to look?
