The log indicates your HTTPS connection gets passed to SquidGuard as IP address and not domain name; this is expected behavior as browser always connects by IP in transparent deployments. Please use the latest Squid that is capable of passing SNI info to the external filters and find out how to adjust squid guard to use this info.
If you need to look into SSL content - setup SSL bump as for example in http://docs.diladele.com/administrator_guide_4_3/https_filtering/index.html; then let the ICAP web filter (qlproxy) block the next request from the browser (the domain name will be taken from Host request header).
I get no errors, just nothing happens.  I can get to the site just fine.  I'm not sure if it's a problem with my squid or squidguard. 
Only caveat, you must be running the newest version of squid.   Updated packages for squid and centos can be found here. 
Sorry but your question it's not so clear for me , but if I understand right you use squid in transparent then you'll never could filter and intercept https!
