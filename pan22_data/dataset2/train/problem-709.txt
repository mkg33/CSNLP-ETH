I believe that there are other similar programs. Here is an article that introduces others, for fairness.
You mentioned you are using Windows 10. Group Policy Editor provides this capability. You can use a group policy template to manage settings at scale.
I've come up with a lengthy but comprehensive script for this that should remove all tiles, even those for apps that haven't been installed (Candy Crush, Netflix, etc.). This is intended only to apply to the currently logged in user, and must be run from an administrator powershell window.
An alternative to the method InterLinked suggested is to use PowerShell to remove the apps (this completely removes the app's, not just hides them).
If you don't have gpedit.msc, you can use a 3rd party workaround to get it installed, but that would only be if you are using the Home edition. Otherwise, this should work as is.

If you want no tiles, make sure your template has no tiles and deploy. If you want certain tiles here/there, arrange them once, capture, and then deploy.
I use the free version Startmenux to get a windows XP like start menu with no tiles and a full list of programs accross the screen rather than hidden in that scrolling menu (yuck).
