How does your client feel about a subdomain like app.clientdomain.com instead of clientdomain.com/app?
You will need a virtual server for clientdomain.com on the dedicated hosting setup.  Then the issue becomed transperently proxying the request from clientdomain.com to the dedicated server (by IP address).  
The other solution is to have a server on your client reply to every request with with a HTTP 302 for the corresponding URL on the other side but again I would advise against this setup too because it would require 2 GETs for each page request and would also change the URL visible to the end user (on the address bar).
I only see two ways of doing this. One is to use a reverse proxy setup like you say... However, according to your description I would advise against it.
The easiest solution is to define an domain alias within the webserver. This is much the same method that www.blah.com is the same site as blah.com.
If clientdomain.com is not dedicated to the application, using a subdomain would be simpler.  This also would need a host (virtual or otherwise) on the dedicated hosting setup.
