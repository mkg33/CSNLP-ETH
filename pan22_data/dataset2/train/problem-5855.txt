It's written in Lua and uses the Corona SDK. But I'm sure you could port it over to whatever platform you are working on.
Specifically look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion and the application of a constant force of gravity.
Projectile motion is just a function of gravity and velocity. At every tick, decrease your vertical velocity by g (the force of gravity), and then add g to your current height. If you're having trouble doing this, come back and ask another question with some of the code that you've tried.
You haven't told us what is the problem. Anyway, I guess you are asking how to do it. Here is a link. 
For a more in depth look at the physics required in these sorts of games, Google around for some game development blogs or how-to's, or start with this one here.
Obviously if you're not sure about how to apply these things together, perhaps look at implementing a Physics engine.
Just read this tutorial(its a series so go through all of them): http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2011/11/03/develop-a-flash-game-like-angry-birds-using-box2d-predictive-trajectory-line/
