textsearchable_index_col is the index column in the table. But after running the code I am getting an error.
In this way can I retrieve from index as table ?? This query is running perfectly in command prompt.
You would've quickly realised this if you'd run the query on the psql command line (or in PgAdmin-III if you prefer GUIs).
A second misunderstanding: You don't retrieve data from an index1. You get data from a table. The database engine might used any indexes that are present to speed your query up, but you're still getting data from the table. You can see this if you explain a command to get its query plan.
1: ... well, arguably until PostgreSQL 9.2's with index-only scans, but that's a bit of an implementation detail.
I am writing an application for searching, using text search of Postgresql. I am a beginner in Database. I created a Gin index and i am trying to get data from it. My code is
The parentheses form a row-constructor, so your query returns a single column row literal, essentially an anonymous composite type.
