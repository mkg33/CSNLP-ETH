The way I see it you would want to have the hostnames of these servers as prod1.example.com and prod2.example.com and perhaps loadb.example.com.
This would be a linux environment, for arguments sake ubuntu, a django framework dynamic website, running in apache 2.2
You want to have two servers, prod1 and prod2 with some kind of load balancer in front of them for fail over reasons.
For example, lets say you have a website example.com, and an A record in DNS that points at it's IP address of 1.2.3.4 . 
Im just starting to look at deploying a webpage and get into the joy of DNS etc. And im wondering how you set up multiple web-servers all with thier own hostnames/public IP addresses, and yet have them serve up a webpage from one domain.
How would you set up the DNS so this would all work. ie you could ssh to any of the server domains, prod1.example.com, prod2.example.com or loadb.example.com and also just use the www.example.com url to go to the website. And would all these server names be resolvable from the public internet and is that safe?
