Again, keeping DC's current and having one at remote site is "better" but is just throwing darts at the wall of this specific issue.  I've had 70-100 remote sites on much lower WAN speeds with no remote DC's act just fine as long as connection was reliable and had available bandwidth.
For mapped drives, if they are done by login script then you have little to no ability to see any logs about that info, but I would move that functionally to Group Policy Preferences which will let you map drives, make them persistent, and also log to the client event logs on any issues.  Your mapping issues could be either they can't get the script, or they can't access the drive... but hard to tell without logging.
First you should ensure that WAN connection is reliable, has no packet loss, and has ample available bandwidth throughout the day. 
@gWaldo has a good idea in terms of increasing reliability and updating your outdated DC, but it's a "guess" as to if it'll fix the issue. @Chris-S is correct in comment that bandwidth (at first glance) doesn't sound like it's the issue either.
Also a DC not being available will not prevent a Windows client login (assuming default GPO's) because cache credentials on a domain let you in.  It would help if you posted the actual errors the users are getting.
