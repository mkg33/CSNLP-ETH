You have a couple of options.  Option one is to get an external connector license.  This eliminates the CAL requirement (unless these are all your systems).  Another option is to pull the data rather than push (I've always thought it was dumb of microsoft to license by access but it clearly states that CALS are required for devices that access the server in question- not the other way around), in which case CALS are the other guys problem.  Lastly use a web edition if you can.  All content on a server running Windows Web Server must be accessible to users outside the organization that owns the server; licensing rules dictate that the product may not be used to host employee-only material (doesn't mean that data can't be encrypted or has to be meaningful to all users). 
While I don' have enough information on what you need to do to tell you if it's cheaper to use a non microsoft based solution as a whole, I can say that you cannot remove CAL requirements by using an intermediary device.
If this is a web based solution you should also consider SPLA licensing, which also eliminates CAL requirements (but changes the whole pricing model)
