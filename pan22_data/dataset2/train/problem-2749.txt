This is not explicitly stated in the paper, but the term $$C_i$$ is the premultiplied-alpha color (i.e. color.rgb * color.a)
If you'd rather keep the same equation as before, you can achieve the same result by changing the shader outputs in listing 3 to:
$$ C_f = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}C_i \cdot w(z_i, \alpha_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_i \cdot w(z_i, \alpha_i)}(1 - \prod_{i=1}^{n}(1 - \alpha_i)) +  C_0\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1 - \alpha_i) $$
However, the equation for additive blending (using glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE) and glBlendEquation(GL_FUNC_ADD)) without weights is:
I have worked with this specific formula for the OVER operator but not with additive blending. I'll use the paper's nomenclature in the following discussion:
This equation is already order independent! In order to add weights to the transparent surfaces with a normalization step in the end, the equation can then be simplified to:
provides the "revealage" of the background color. If all the transparent surfaces are transparent, the product will be 1 and the background will be fully visible. The rest of the equation provides an approximation of the result of sorting the transparent surfaces by distance and using the OVER operator with pre-multiplied alpha colors.
