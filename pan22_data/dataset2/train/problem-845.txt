Which exact services you need to configure is easily visible in every guide on the internet explaining how to implement SSL certificate on to 2007/2010 Exchange environment.
You can buy contosointernational.com certificate and csti.com certificate which is SAN (Have several names in it) or only one. Technically it doesn't matter. What you will end up doing is to create an INTERNAL DNS zone for any domain/s you wish to implement in your external certificate and simply indicate that the internal names of the resources such as mail.csti.com or mail.contosointernational.com using the INTERNAL IPs. However, in order to make sure you'll be able to resolve the actual external names of the server, which say host your www.contosointernational.com you would need to add and IP to that INTERNAL zone pointing to the external IP. As well, you'll be required to alter, using powershell or Exchange Console, the OWA, Client Access server and couple other settings to allow your outlook to connect properly to the exchange. I have done it dozen of times. It works 100%. Just make sure that the A record for the INTERNAL/EXTERNAL mail server is exists in yuor INTERNAL ZONE.
