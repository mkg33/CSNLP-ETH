When I do a NSLookup of the subdomain, it says it is fine but when trying to access it in the browser, the server cannot find the address.
I have two A records pointing to the IP address, both "portal" and "www.portal". I have tried to use the same configuration that cPanel uses, in hopes it would work, but no success.
I want to add a sub-domain to one of my domains, but even with the same configurations I cannot get it to work. I have both domains, and sub-domain listed in /etc/hosts as with the server IP.
If you can flush your DNS caches (on your computer, and any upstream caches) then it should start working. Otherwise you will have to wait for the negative cache's to timeout before they  will try resolving it again rather than using the negative cache.
portal.mitiamosports.com.au works for me (although I get a directly listing, not a site) so I'm guessing you have a negative DNS cache somewhere.
I have a personal VPS configured to host two domains that I purchased, I managed to configure Apache correctly and get both domains able to point to their own directories and show correctly.
