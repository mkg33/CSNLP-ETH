Without seeing a lot of data about how your system is behaving I would guess that the performance problems are a result of the limited amount of memory on the server; adding squid will have reduced this further.
Get the Calamaris package (http://cord.de/tools/squid/calamaris/).  This reads your squid log files (assuming you turned on logging) and outputs reports which should give you what you are looking for.
So we installed squid reverse proxy in front of the apache server. Interestingly when we started load testing, we realized that the server is performing pretty well even for larger loads. We have a reason to be happy but then we want to know what exactly is causing this performance improvements. 
You should use Squid SNMP MIB (if you already use SNMP for monitoring your servers) for general statistics about hit/miss ratio. 
squidclient is an excellent command line tool for querying Squid status. It can show you cached objects, Squid process status, cached IP addresses, disk subsystem status, open file descriptors and whatnot. Try squidclient -h your_squid_host -p your_squid_port -u your_user -w your_password mgr:menu for all possible options. User and password can be configured in squid.conf.
We conducted a load test on our web application and we found that once the load goes beyond 40 users the server response time goes up drastically. (It was a 256MB RAM cloud machine).
