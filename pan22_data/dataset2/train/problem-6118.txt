Windows, without appropriate codec libraries, doesn't support anything useful apart from MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video. If you were to convert your iPhone videos to that format, you'd lose a lot of quality and the files would be huge.
If the MOV container is what irks you (or, Windows), then you could use MP4Box to wrap it to an MP4 container. I don't think this will heavily increase compatibility, but it's worth a shot. Also, it won't re-encode the video and audio bitstreams, it'll just change the container format. It's rather easy to wrap this is in a batch file for all videos, I guess.
Again, I don't see a lot of value in re-encoding videos to an old codec just so Windows supports it out of the box. That's like opening your door with a sledge hammer just because you forgot to install a doorknob.
If you install codec libraries like CCCP, then Windows should be able to play almost any video on its own. This would mean that you don't have to re-convert your h.264 iPhone videos â€“ because re-encoding is never good.
