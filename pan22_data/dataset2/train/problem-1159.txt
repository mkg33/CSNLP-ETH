If are looking to take notes and getting organized,  I would suggest Tracks GTD.  This has the added benefit of being able to turn notes into actionable items.  The interface is simple and has a mobile web based version as well.
There are a few vendors out there that do Dynamic DNS and most . I've used DynDNS as they offer free Dynamic DNS but use their own array of domain names to choose from. I'm sure there are other providers who may offer better features and what not, but just keep Dynamic DNS in mind as it will make your cloud a little easier to access.
I realize you're looking for software such as programs and the like for hosting your own apps. But if I could stray from your post and bring up a minor side point: 
If you're doing it (hosting your own server) from home, odds are.. you'll need some sort of dynamic DNS service. 
I'm not sure what your definition of "note-taking" is.  Lots of people use a blog like Blogger or WordPress for this purpose, because the interface is simpler than Google docs or Google Sites.  Blogger's "custom domain" option serves the blog pages from your own server.
Depending on the nature of your notes and workflow... I'd go for BitNami Tracks if organizer/planner's features might become handy , or just Dokuwiki for a sort of wiki aproach... In both cases the Bitnami installers take care of the complex steps, and have it all integrated, it's easier to have it up and running (in just some mins, through an installer-wizzard). You can install it in your Mac, Windows, or Linux. (or even in a VM, in the cloud, etc)
+1 to Millhouse's answer. I think TiddlyWiki is a great little app. To add simplicity, you can use TiddlyWiki with a WYSIWYG plugin.
