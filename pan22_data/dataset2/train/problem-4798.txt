As I'm beginning this process too (setting up Git server on Windows), and this discussion is over a year old, I thought I'd add that to the mix.
Gitlab is a great solution, and includes a web based interface. To make it work within your requirements.
If you have multiple teams with some healthy turnover, assuming you have Windows active directory running, you might want to consider Atlassian bitbucket. We use bitbucket mainly for the following requirement:
If you have a 5-10 developer team, I would suggest go with vanilla git with ssh. Easy to setup and you have ssh to protect data in transit.
Gogs is certainly worth a look: easy to use (several supported installation options), cross-platform (including Windows), lightweight, open source.

1. Manage git repositories as projects, where we can provide self-service access control at project level. 2. LDAP login integration with AD group sync 3. Very low administrative effort
