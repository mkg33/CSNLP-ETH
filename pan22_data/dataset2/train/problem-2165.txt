Did you try typing in the password and pressing the Enter key? SSH clients usually dont write-out stars or dots like webbrowsers do.
I have seen cases where SSH logins could hang due to mis-configured DNS servers in /etc/resolv.conf. Especially if sshd is using DNS for reverse lookups or logging. Check your DNS configuration on the server and verify you can ping and resolve external names like google.com.
Also try sshing from the box itself ("ssh localhost"), and see if that works. You might have a network (or firewall) problem if this works, and remote ssh doesnt. 
we have a Centos server and currently SSH access to it isn't working. It used to work until some 5 days ago. Now, the only way to log into the machine is to do it locally. We have tried SSH both using Putty and FileZilla with no success. The machine is alive and answering. I can ping it and the Apache service is up and running. But SSH access isn't available. When I try it using Putty, the machine answers asking me to type the username. I do it. When it asks me for the password, it never answers again and, after some 60 seconds, it times out... Any ideas where we should work to try to sove this problem? Thank you in advance!
First of all you should check the logs on that server: /var/log/auth.log or similar (I don't know where sshd logs on CentOS). If the server refused the connection, the log should tell you why.
