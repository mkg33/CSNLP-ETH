Without access to chmod, they won't be able to set the necessary permissions to make ssh certificates work (some people might see that an an advantage, but if that's the case, you should be editing pam.conf to disallow it entirely), they'd have to call the interpreter w/ the script as an argument (eg, perl script.pl), rather than the script directly, and a webserver will refuse to run their CGIs as the permissions aren't set correctly.
... giving the users sudo rights to chmod is possibly an even bigger can of worms -- as then they'd be able to run the commands as root, not as themselves, so they could affect the permissions of any user.  You'd be better off making a 'chmodders' group, setting the  permission on chmod to 0750, and add people to the group who are allowed to use it.
Depending on what the user's default group is, and how you have the default umask set up, it's also possible that files created won't be be readable by the webserver, and so can't be served at all, CGI or otherwise.  Also, lack of chmod means that you can't correct problem permissions from files that were moved over via scp, which is permission preserving by default.
