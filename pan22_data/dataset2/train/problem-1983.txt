Is this achievable with vSphere Client (I have 5.0 version)? I have guest additions, but I only can choose from pre-defined resolutions.
In Virtualbox, with guest additions enabled, in Win-Win machines pair, I had by default the dynamic screen resolution adaptation in the guest (i.e. whenever I resize the window of VM, it internally changes resolution to whatever obscure resolution just to fit the window size, e.g. 1246x517).
You're dealing with two different classes of products here. Virtualbox is a desktop virtualization system, and ESXi is a server virtualization system. As such, the VMware vSphere client is not really meant to be used for heavy day-to-day operations. You'll find performance to be significantly better if you enable remote desktop on the Windows 7 VM and connect via an RDP client.
But note: this won't solve the original problem with dynamically adjusting the size to VMSphere's window.
When your Virtual Machine has not enough Video Memory, then the available modes will allow for very small screens only, and will cause severe stability problem with RDP also!
Provide it with a sufficient amount of video RAM, and you can choose from many more resolutions, and RDP becomes stable.
