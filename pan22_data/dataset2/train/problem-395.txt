Also, when you run a number of games, some might trigger background processes that remain even after you close the game. So that explains high RAM usage after playing a number of games.
Firefox and MBAM are using about 500MB alone. You have an scvhost running at 300MB. There are a lot of Windows services which run under a scvhost.exe instance, you would need to use a monitoring tool such as Process Explorer from Sysinternals to see which service that scvhost instance is holding. If I had to guess it's probably the Windows Update Service and/or Background Intelligent Transfer Service. 
Now, instead of restarting the PC to clear RAM, just log off and log on again. That should also do the same as restarting for all the processes started by that particular user account. And its faster!
Also, the lag has many reasons. Maybe, your hardware is getting too hot. In your case, the RAM seems to be the reason, but don't ignore the heating part. Too much heat causes lag.
Video Games can consume large amounts of RAM, especially big box games. Really though, BF4 looks like it's running within reasonable limits. You should only be concerned if your machine is trying to swap RAM with a pagefile constantly.
