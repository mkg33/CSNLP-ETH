What about BANK of servers? Perhaps they're on the same subnet, or maybe not, but you don't want them grouped by subnet in documentation. 
Vality has a point, 'farm' is also commonly used, as I almost always hear 'server farm' at work, and not 'server bank'. However, I hear 'bank of servers' more often than 'farm of servers', so it all depends on which one you want, just don't say 'server cloud', at all.
Cluster of servers that serve specific shares, vs an additional cluster of servers that serve distinctly different shares.
Given the fact we are referring to a specific site with a set of servers cooperating to perform a task the word 'farm' comes to mind. However this is a fairly specific term and requires a: the servers be on one site and b: the servers are cooperating in some way to perform a task.
I think I'd favor "mount points" or "home directories," but wouldn't see a problem with any of the terms, as they're all accurate.
I would tend to call them what they are - network shares, mapped drives/folders/directories, mounted drives/folders/directories, mount points, home directories - or something of that nature.
