If you do not want to go through the process of using the formulas the Microsoft Excel Add-in Cel Tools makes this process a simple click.
You need to arrange the data in a 11 x 11 grid (from 0 to 10 across and down). At the intersection of the X and Y values enter the Z value. Then chart the data as a 3D column chart with the right-most template in the drop-down
I had same problem and found your question. Since I don't use Excel, I solved it using plot.ly online tool:
Again, this is made simpler with a third party application. One that the article mentions is XYZ Mesh because it is the only software that will fill in missing data points for you.
The other option (the 3D Surface Graph) is also outlined in the blog post above. To accomplish this you need to arrange your values as such: X values form the first column, Y values form the first row and Z values are placed inside:
The result will be fairly unreadable, though, since 3D charts just don't work on a 2D surface, unless you can actually rotate them and get things in perspective.
Both of these are obtainable inside Excel, for free with calculations and formulas or by purchase of third party applications for less headache. Both of these are explained in this blog post about how to graph 3D data inside of Excel. 
Now I would like to make a 3D-chart, whose 3 axes are X, Y and Z. For each axe, the labels are 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 10. So at place (2,5,6), I want to have a point labelled N1; at place (2,7,8), I want to have a point labelled N2... Finally there are 9 points in the chart.
If you would like to do this inside Excel you have two options. You can create a 3D Line Graph that displays the data in a rotatable line graph (like your comment suggested), or you can create a 3D Surface Graph that can be populated by a MESH formation.
In this case you need to set 4th axis values equal to 1, and after chart generating decrease the bubble size by click S- button several times.
