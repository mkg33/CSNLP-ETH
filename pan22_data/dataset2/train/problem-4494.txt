Just curious: does AdBlock download the ad but just not display it? Or does it stop the downloading of the ad entirely, which means that the display of the ad never happens at all?
When a webpage is loaded, the browser download the HTML document.  It parses through the documents and build a DOM tree; the DOM tree is a specialised structure that keeps all elements (e.g. images, text, layout, font, video, scripts, plugins...) to be displayed.  The browser then download the external elements referred in the DOM tree and render the whole webpage.
Therefore, the ad element is already disappeared when the browser is about to render the webpage, and the ad will never be downloaded.
AdBlock works by removing the element to be blocked from the HTML DOM tree directly, before the webpage is rendered.  It could be the ad banner itself, tracking elements, or even scripts that displays the ad.
blocks network requests for ad-related files, and also prevents the browser display, by using CSS rules,for elements that can't be blocked.
