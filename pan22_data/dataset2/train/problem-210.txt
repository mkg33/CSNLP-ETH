I have a TCP server listening on some port on my box (Windows XP). There are many users connected to it. Now without bringing down server application or box, or without unplugging network cables how can I disconnect those connections? I am not very well versed with network related commands (e.g. net, netsh, netstat etc.) but I believe there must be some command to do this.
You could also block the connections individually using a firewalling tool. Again, I'm not aware of a Windows CLI for this purpose.
You can do so by using SQL server configuraion manager. Because all network protocols are install through SQL setup.
TCPView from Sysinternals (now part of Microsoft) will let you close established connections. This is a free download and the whole toolkit should honestly be part of the default install.
Technically, you could probably achieve this end by sending crafted packages to your peers that make them reset the TCP connections. I am not aware of a toolchain that makes this readily possible on Windows XP (or other platforms).
Disabling (or otherwise nerfing) your network adapter would effectively kill all the connections to your machine as well.
