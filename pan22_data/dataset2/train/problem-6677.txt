See Lenovo's own service advisory for more definitive information on this subject, including a list of affected models and links to the disabler utility and firmware ("BIOS," although that's a misnomer) updates.
I believe you're referring to this report. Briefly, Lenovo has been using its firmware to ensure that a particular Windows binary (C:\Windows\system32\autochk.exe) is the Lenovo version, not the Microsoft version. If it's Microsoft's version, it's replaced by Lenovo's version. The binary then downloads two more Lenovo binaries that report back on how you're using the computer. Lenovo's security advisory refers ambiguously to "vulnerabilities" in this system, but I don't know offhand precisely what this means -- presumably it's something potentially worse than Lenovo's keeping certain files installed on your computer without bothering to ask you about that.
Note that these flaws don't really have much to do with the "security" of "partitions," except of course insofar as C: resides on a partition on the disk. It's really the firmware itself into which Lenovo has inserted its bloatware.
