I did look into it and I don't see a way in Server 2003 to create a SHA-256 CSR. There is a utility called "Certreq" built in to Windows. I don't see HashAlgorithm in the Server 2003 version of certreq, but it is present in later versions. 
One other reference I found was creating a custom request through the MMC. In the tutorial it references selecting a hash algorithm, but the screenshot doesn't match. May be worth investigating. 
There are a few updates that add SHA-256 support in Windows Server 2003. The one you need is KB2868626; when installed this update will enable you to install SHA-256 SSL certificates on Server 2003 SP2. You may want to install the ones below as well so you can connect to your own site. 
Regarding the CSR generation, if you are purchasing a certificate from a public CA you shouldn't need to specify the signature algorithm in the CSR. The CA will issue your cert signed with SHA1 or SHA2 depending on your selection and/or the CA's issuance policy. 
KB938397 adds SHA-256 support to Server 2003 (SP1 or SP2). This update only enables Server 2003 to connect to sites that are using SHA-256 certs, but cannot serve them up itself (for that you need the above KB2868626). There is an additional SHA-2 update where XP & Server 2003 clients cannot get SHA-256 certificates from Windows Server 2008, that is KB968730.
