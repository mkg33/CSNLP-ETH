I am just finishing gathering parts for a Aspire Revo build.  I am swapping the included drive for a 30GB SSD, and using a network share to access media.
Mac-mini all the way.  Just get a dvi to hdmi cable and you are ready to go.  I'd say you could get the previous generation model for $400-500 US.
I got a nice ASRock ION machine. It can run high res videos and do most server processing. Since it uses the ION chipset I get accelerated 3d graphics in linux and I'm able to use the full features of XBMC. Also the machine has a DVI/HDMI out and Optical out. I'm quite happy with it. Its really quiet.
I know, it is not running linux (but rather a sort of BSD), but I have a mac mini for that in my living room connected to a 2.5 inch silent USB drive. This is silent and plays back all h264 content I have just great. And is has a high "Woman Acceptance Factor", which was necessary for my living room survival.
Note that water cooling your CPU and/or graphics card (ram maybe even? shrugs) will result in what is essentially a silent system but A: will cost a lot more and B: will be messier.
Check out if minis are available refurbished or used at your place as well and if the inbuilt ram and harddisk is to small the upgrade it on your own. It is not that big of a problem - at least I had no problem with that after reading some upgrade advice on the internet. But be sure you buy one with a core 2 duo inside, I don't know if the others are fast enough.
