To have Duplicity perform a full filesystem backup, I think I need to run it as root using sudo. However, this makes it so the gpg commands run by Duplicity are ran under the root user. One solution is the use of the --homedir option. However, there is no persistent session as the root user using this method.
I guess what I want to do is: have Duplicity run relevant gpg commands as my user and take advantage of my already-present session caching. Is this possible as-is or will it require changes to the code base?
I already have login-session credential session caching set up with gpg-agent. For example, I can use the 'pass' command without needing to enter a password every time. This is how I would like Duplicity to work.
I'm trying to set up automatic, full filesystem backups on my local system using Duplicity. I do not want to have to enter my password for it to encrypt a volume: what if I am not at the computer and the backup stalls? I absolutely do not want to be prompted for a password for every volume it encrypts.
