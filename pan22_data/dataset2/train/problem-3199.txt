If you are OK with temporarily having the converted tracks in your iTunes library, you could use AppleScript to convert the track, remove the reference to the converted track, and finally move the converted file where ever you like.
As far as I know, there is no way to do this. You might want to use a different app, like Quicktime or AudialHub to do the conversion instead. Do you want to keep the original, or the new file in iTunes? You can create smart playlists to help you collect either one into a single list to remove them all from your library in one step (opt-delete in OS X).
It does involve a somewhat tedious step of burning the CD but it doesn't require anything third party and is a function within iTunes.
Depending on how often you do this, you could export a playlist to an MP3 Disc.  You'll need to burn a disc each time but a rewriteable might solve that issue.
Plain AppleScript has little capability for smooth UI, but the following script might do what you want. Paste it into Script Editor (or AppleScript Editor on Snowy) and save it as an “application bundle” (“application” on Snowy). To use it, configured your conversion settings (Import Settings) in iTunes, select some tracks in iTunes, then drop a folder on the saved application. Note that newly converted files will overwrite pre-existing files in the dropped folder (if their names are identical). It is probably best to drop empty folders unless you are sure you want any overwrites you might get. You might even get some ID3v2 tags out of the process (I did in some testing, but it depends on what iTunes decides to do).
