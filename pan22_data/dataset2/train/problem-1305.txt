It's not particularly common for network cards to begin failing but it does happen from time to time. If you've not altered the drivers on your PC then it seems to suggest a hardware issue of some sort, whether an NIC failure or possibly even a powersupply issue
If you want to really test things out try the system with some short and very long cables too and see whether that makes a difference, if the problem is that the nic's Signal-to-noise levels are too low then the error rate should get worse with longer cables. 
On a home network it shouldn't matter what port you use on the switch (enterprise switches have some more complicated settings but this doesn't sound like your setup).
to answer your second question problems like these that involve the analog circuitry in the network's physical layer can conceivably lead to the variation in error pattern that you are seeing across ports. When everything is working to spec it's quite possible that each port still has significantly different signal-to-noise handling abilities, it's just that all ports will be at least good enough to handle GigE signalling without [significant] errors so that variance is invisible (and irrelevant) but when you add in a sub standard external device the variation can become apparent. 
To answer your first question - complete NIC failures are not uncommon (having redundant and even multiply redundant nics in servers is practically mandatory for as well as other reasons) but partial failures are also possible, especially in the Physical layer circuitry and mechanical parts. On a standard (1000BaseT using RJ45 connectors) Gigabit Ethernet nic problems with any of the four pairs of signalling contacts, the analog to digital converter, the filter, the feed forward equalizer, the echo canceler or the clock (and possibly other things) could cause these issues without necessarily leading to the nic completely failing. The result would generally be much poorer signal to noise performance and that will lead to packet loss as the decoder's at each end will get data that clearly has errors. 
The additional diagnostics certainly point to a faulty NIC, specifically since the problem is consistent when you try the same hardware with a different OS but other systems are totally unaffected.
