After acquiring n-gram feature vectors for each text category, you can apply k-means algorithm with several distance metrics to find similar categories.
Methodology that I would adapt here, forgive me if understood your problem wrong, would be to concatenate all the textual data for a given category and create 1,2,3,..n gram vectors. The values of these vectors can be TF-IDF of a given n-gram, and so on. Still different feature matrices can be formed to compare category vectors but TF-IDF is a pretty common way to do it in.
The proposed method can capture the similarity between soccer and basketball games as they are both sports. 
K-means can be a good starting point for getting similar groups of text document categories, you can try out different k for more sensible outcomes.
If your ultimate goal is to cluster similar categories and assuming that you have labels of each text as category1, category2,...,categoryN from 1 to N, a bag of words method would be sufficient in order to create features so that you can run multiple desired clustering algorithms.
