Due to heartbleed, I revoked all my certificates and reissued them.  Unfortunately, I clearly missed setting RDP up for this new certificate.  Now I get "This certificate has been revoked and is not safe to use", and "You may not proceed due to the severity of the certificate errors".
Is my only option to drive there and login from the console, or is there a way to temporarily ignore the certificate error?  
I know the certificate is revoked.  That's why I'm trying to get in to fix it!  But I can't replace the certificate until I can remote in.  And I can't remote in until I replace the certificate.
Another option which works if you can't access it that way is using program which doesn't validate the certificate.  Apparently Microsoft's RD Client for android is one such program.
I have a remote server that I can only access through RDP.  It uses a proper SSL certificate from godaddy for RDP, not a self signed one.  The server is 2008R2, and I believe is set to the default of requiring network level authentication.  Unfortunately, I do not have any lights out management features or IPKVM on this server.
