Of course I have used a voltage divider now, just in case. But my question is, how did I turned out okay and did not end up damaging the GPIO? In other words what property of HCSR04 could have saved my Raspberry, is it output current capacity? I just want to know to understand the entire picture and make sure I do not do something as such again. 
The easiest way to ensure a limited current is to use a large series resistor.  I use something like a 20k resistor on the echo line when I can't be bothered to use a proper voltage divider.
Your sensor requires 5V to function. You provided less than that, so it never turned on. Not enough supply voltage isn't normally a problem - just don't put more than 3.3V into a GPIO and you'll be fine.
The substrate diodes on the SOC would have limited current carrying capacity and can be easily damaged, so you should not rely on this for protection. They are mainly there to protect against static.
At the time I was not aware that Raspberry Pi 2 GPIO is not 5V tolerant so I did not have a voltage divider circuit, but it still worked pretty fine. Recently I have found out that GPIO should not be working with 5V, in fact I could have damaged the GPIO. 
The reason is that the GPIO have clamp diodes to 3.3V (and 0V). This prevents the actual circuitry from exceeding 3.3V + a diode forward drop. This is a standard technique for protecting digital circuits PROVIDED THE CURRENT IS LIMITED. So external resistance is required.
