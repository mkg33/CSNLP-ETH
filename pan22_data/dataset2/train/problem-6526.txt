My experience is that the message "rsyslogd-2177: imuxsock lost xxx messages from pid yyy due to rate-limiting" can appear in the logs several days after the log messages in question were dropped. This means that you can't find any other references to the given pid in the current log file, and so can't find any other messages from that pid that might tell you what it was.
Those log messages are related to rsyslog's rate-limiting feature. I'm currently trying to pin down a similar problem on one of my machines, though mine seems a bit less severe -- I'm only losing about 100 log messages at a time. (E.g., I'm seeing "imuxsock lost 100 messages ...")
If anyone has any insights on tracking down the source of the "lost" logged messages, that could be most helpful. I believe my issue may be related to Postfix, but as the process IDs ("pid" numbers) given in the log message are no longer relevant (as, presumably, the processes no longer exists), it's a bit tricky to pin down...
I had a similar issue, and it probably caused by a cronjob failing and try'ing to send a mail. This mail was stopped and postfix was not liking it.
Assuming you're using something like logrotate, grepping through the archived logs for the previous week will likely show the source of the dropped messages, and you'll see the messages that started the flood which might be enough to understand what was going on.
It sounds like you may have an out-of-control process running on your system... Perhaps, even, your machine could have been compromised (?).
Please let me know what these messages could be and if these messages can be the reason for server going down.
