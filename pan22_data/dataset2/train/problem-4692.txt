But that seems really odd because isn't the version of selinux-policy that error is saying I need the version I have installed according to my xrdp error?
rpm -Uvh http://scientificlinux.mirror.ac.za/7.6/x86_64/updates/security/selinux-policy-3.13.1-252.el7.1.noarch.rpm
You can change the display to :1 or :2 or whatever it is on the VM by specifying it when connecting with vncviewer. The vncserver will continue to run on the VM until the process is stopped.
The instructions I found said a requirement first was to first install the EPEL repo which I did this way:
Create a vnc password at the prompts and then it will show you the display that it's running on with the output of:
        selinux-policy = 3.13.1-229.el7_6.15 is needed by (installed) selinux-policy-targeted-3.13.1-229.el7_6.15.noarch
I'm a bit of a novice Linux user and I'm trying to prepare a CentOS VM through Azure.  I have it built and can operate on it through the serial console on the Azure portal.  I've installed GNOME and now I'm trying to install xrdp so I can access it through RDP.
Anyway, that was the brick wall on my journey.  I'm not sure what to do next.  And if I can't get xrdp installed is there another way to access the GNOME desktop of my machine?  I am a novice at both Linux and Azure and I didn't see a console option besides the serial console on the Azure portal.
Install vncviewer on the machine that you're trying to connect with. Launch it and connect to it with one of the following:
Firstly, you don't want to install packages from other distributions which is what you did when you installed the Scientific Linux selinux-policy-targeted package.
