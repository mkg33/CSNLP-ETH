If there are no MAC addresses being learnt (or only in one direction), check the subnet mask that is configured on newDefaultInstall and HostX - it may be that one host has a longer mask and is unable to send ARP for the other without trying it's default gateway first.
Check that there is only a single network connection on each node - is there both a wired and wireless connection on the same subnet that may responding asymmetrically - if so, disable the wireless adapter and see if that changes things.
Depending on the capabilities of your Netgear switches, check the forwarding table of each and confirm that both device MACs are learnt end-to-end on the correct switch ports.
Confirm that each of your Netgear switches do not have any port security functionality (DHCP-Snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection, MAC limiting etc.) enabled, and if they do, disable these features during your testing.
While the issue is occuring - does HostX have an ARP entry for newDefaultInstall?  Assuming these are Windows machines, use arp -a on HostX to get a list - you should see a MAC address for the newDefaultInstall IP.  Compare that ARP entry to the MAC address of newDefaultInstall (found using ipconfig /all) and make sure they match.  If they do not, then you may have a duplicate IP address on the network.  If there is no entry, check the ARP table on the newDefaultInstall and look for an entry for 'HostX' - compare against ipconfig /all again to make sure they match.
