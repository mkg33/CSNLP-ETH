I never did this myself, but I am quite sure it's an easy way to share data between Win/Linux platforms.
In addition to Windows simply not having support for Linux file systems, Microsoft cannot reasonably take on the responsibility of guaranteeing your data will be safe if they try to support them. For example (and completely hypothetical), say the ext4 team improves performance by recognizing a new ext4 inode format that is not backward compatible. Windows next modifies your data but mixes the old format with the new one, because it doesn't know about the change, and corrupts your data. Who will you blame?
Just had to mention, if you really want to have bi-directional shared data from both OS, setup a data partition as NTFS with GParted or some other partitioning tool, and they will (should?) both be available by both OS.
For years, as my memory recalls, the Linux kernel had read-only support for NTFS, and write support was labeled UNSUPPORTED for years after it was introduced. The Linux kernel was obviously very concerned about data integrity until they were confident their NTFS file system support was fully stable and understood. Now imagine how much harder it would be on the kernel team if Windows had 3-5 other filesystems just as popular as NTFS. (Think: ext3-4, XFS, ReiserFS, Btrfs, etc.)
Windows does not have native Linux filesystem support (ext3, ext4, zfs, among others). It's as simple as that.
A solution to this is to install an open-source software/driver that allows you to read and write to ext3 partitions on Windows:
This is because Linux uses ext2/3/4 file systems for its partitions. Windows does not read/write this type of file systems. Just NTFS and FAT. Linux reads/writes on almost any file system.
