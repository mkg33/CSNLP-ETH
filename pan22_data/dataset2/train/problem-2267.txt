I don't recognize kickseed as being anything standard, but it might be something that a program is using from a host on your network.  I would start by checking whether the name resolves on your network and whether it is in the hosts file on the DB server.  If it does or is, track down the machine and figure out why it is connecting to the database and see if you can switch it to a non root account, or at least what you have to do to password protect it.  If you can't find the machine, I would password protect the account and wait a while to see if anything breaks, if it doesn't then it is probably safe to delete the account.  127.0.0.1 is your loopback address, deleting that one is probably bad news.
I have no idea what kickseed is as the database is installed under localhost, on searching around i have discovered that this is something to do with the ubuntu OS itself.
I have managed to get mySQL running under Ubuntu 8.10, I am now diligently trying to secure the database and am adding passwords for the root users.
My absolute preference would be to have only one account with root access but i do not want to delete these accounts if they are necessary.
