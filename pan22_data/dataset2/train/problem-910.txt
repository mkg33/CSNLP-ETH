i have written the webservices suing SOAP, and its still under development. When have set of code which are already running the webapps folder of tomcat6. When I make changes in particular file I replaced only that file but stopping the tomcat server and restarting the tomcat server, but I am not able to see any changes in the application, itself reflecting the old functionality itself. I deleted the whole project and deployed a new project with the same folder name, then also I am not able to see the new changes some times, I get an error in the browser which says resources not found. But it works fine when I create a new folder with different name and deploy application in the new created folder. I am not understand, what actually happening. Kindly help me out
Tomcat caches servlet response in %CATALINA_HOME%/work/Catalina/localhost/myapp.  If you're really desperate you can delete that directory manually.  However, normally setting reloadable=true in the Context will make Tomcat automatically reload the Web app.  Also, if you deploy it using the manager app instead of just dropping the WAR, that reloads it automatically.
