I'm trying to install zimbra on a linux server. I downloaded the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS version of zimbra, unpacked and tried to run install.sh. But after I have approved the license I get this problem.
I've also encountered this issue when installing on Ubuntu 14.04. There is a bug in their detection script for this. The script pulls only the first line that contains:
If you build your Zimbra server in a private range behind some NAT router it could be handy to install a tool like DNSMASQ on that server. That way your hostname and dns resolver are always in sync on that server and Zimbra should be happy whatever NAT, proxy, VPN or other real connection you have to the internet.
in any position, like ipv6-localhost. All other lines are ignored. Ubuntu places the IPv6 loopback as the first line, so even if you have the suggested line:
Solution: Make sure you specify the 127.0.0.1 line ABOVE any IPv6 configuration and the script will succeed.
In all of your examples you are showing an IP of 127.x.x.x. You need to use a real IP. Here's what my hosts file looks like:
I try a last time and remove the lines about localhost and linux-server-test yet the same result. I have config the dns to be able to handle email so that should not be a problem.
