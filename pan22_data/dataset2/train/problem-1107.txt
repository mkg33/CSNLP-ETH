Another option I suggest is to make monsters run away if they don't get killed quickly enough so players will know a high level monsters is not a likely target and focus on lower levels until they are able to take it down quickly. This will give a sense of urgency to battle which is missing when the play cannot lose.
Give players new weapons and tools that make higher level monsters more attractive. Make the best XP - per - second area a same level area. The players can kill higher level monsters but it will lower their xp - per - second. Later give them a weapon that makes higher level an easier and more profitable target because they can farm more xp that way.
I think you should use something more natural.. give the players goals (quests) they need to accomplish in order to proceed. The goals will implicitly require the players to kill monsters in order to progress to higher level areas. So yes organically restrict higher level zones by making the player progress to them by completing quests.
