With Revo Uninstaller, sometimes the best approach is to actually reinstall a program while Revo is watching it, and then let Revo remove it. It will 'record' all the changes made during the installation process, and undo them. Note - I have a paid copy of Revo - I'm not sure what limitations the free version has, but at first glance it should do everything you need.
It's a very common issue when Avast is uninstalled to have your PC left in shatters. In many cases (google this), people are left with systems that won't boot at all. The best thing I can suggest is to use a tool like Revo Uninstaller to uninstall it. It's very good at finding the files and settings left behind after an installation.
After using Revo, I would then use Avast's own uninstaller - yes they have a seperate utility not included with the software - and it is their recommended method to uninstall Avast*. You can get it and instructions to use it here Avast 2016 Uninstaller. If you are using an earlier version of Avast the same uninstaller should work per their notes.
