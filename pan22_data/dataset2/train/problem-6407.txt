Note: Sharing a GND might introduce noise with 2 sources.  So you could use 2 relays and open one while closing when your time triggers the program.  You can use a cron job to do this part.
I was wondering if I could use the GPIO or breadboard to bring in two stereo audio and have one audio output that would switch between the two inputs depending on the time.  So essentially 2 in 1 out... audio A and audio B, if time is 9am then the audio A switches to audio B.
Yes if you mean that you would like to select A or B as a pass through device.  What I mean is if you are just using the Pi as an On/Off switch you can do this with a simple relay.  Use your ground from both stereo inputs as the lead to the relay.  Then connect the 'A' channel GND to the normally open side of your relay.  Connect the 'B' channel GND to the normally closed side.  Your program will go something like @ 9am digitalWrite low to your relay pin (switching to channel B).  You can do this with a Bash script or Python and WiringPi. https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/
