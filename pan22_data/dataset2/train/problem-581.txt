-c makes su execute the command you specify using whatever shell is defined in /etc/passwd for the specified user. This makes it much like sudo, but as whatever user you select and know the password for. -c does not give an interactive shell, so anything requiring a tty will not work.
--session-command does not call setsid() to allocate a new session (which has the effect, as you found, of allowing the continued use of the controlling tty and thus bash will give you process control being an interactive shell). This means its children can be assigned to any process group of the parent session, perhaps the session foreground pg or to avoiding killpg() or other classification based on process group id. It also retains the ability to send SIGCONT to any process in the session, though I'm not sure how abuseable that is.
Generally, you should prefer --command (-c) to --session-command. You should not be using -c with interactive shells (maybe you wanted --shell /bin/bash ?), but you should be using it with background processes.
Considering --session-command isn't on the man page of any major distro that I've heard of, it's likely a custom RHEL thing (google didn't help either).
