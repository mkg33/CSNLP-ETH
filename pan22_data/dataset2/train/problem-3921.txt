Use 'Select all' to reveal any hidden text boxes etc that are on the extra 'blank' page so you can then select and delete
I had this issue, pressing CTRL-A showed there was some kind of invisible box outside my drawing.  I could click on it but it wouldn't let me delete it.  When you hovered over it, it would show the arrows and let you make boxes off each side.  So I created a box on each side, selected all 5 boxes and pressed delete and it finally went away. 
I had a footer, with a page #, and this may have contributed to my problem.  This is what I finally had to do:  (Visio 2007)
I just had what sounds like a similar problem...  turned out it was some of my text boxes (within shapes) that were going over the page (even through the text itself didn't go over)
Click Ctrl A to select the entire drawing. Look at anything that lies outside the page boundaries. Even if your drawing appears to be on one page, the "outlines" may not be. Shrink the drawing until EVERYTHING is on the same page. Voila.
