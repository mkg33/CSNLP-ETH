Running the domain and a test account through the Microsoft test site will often tell you where the issue is. https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/
If it is your own SSL certificate that is being presented though then it will be something else - probably missing Autodiscover entries. Autodiscover operates on a fixed number of URLs, which Outlook will move through. WIth Exchange 2010 and higher Autodiscover cannot really be ignored, so you need to ensure that you have a valid entry in place. 
Number one reason for this is that the URL https://example.com/Autodiscover/Autodiscover.xml works. That is often the case with web hosts who have setup one of the leading control panels with the default options. It attempts to use autodiscover for its own purpose. You need to get the host to turn it off for that domain - it can be done but a lot of support at web hosts will not have a clue. 
Looking at the certificate that is presented will usually give you an indication of whether that is the case or not.
