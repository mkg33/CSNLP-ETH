Make sure all of the routers are on the same subnet, but have different IPs (192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2). 
If you can't find the IP address of the router, then have a look if it is listed as a client on another router or download fing
I also disabled DHCP on the DG934G/DG834G of course. Though I disabled DHCP on the Belkin too but that's only because my Belkin isn't my primary router. The DHCP server runs on my BT Home Hub.
After further research, all day, I've found out the DG934G is a DG834G router reboxed by Sky. So I flashed the firmware on the fully-working DG934G to 4.01.28 and the 'Advanced Wireless Settings' option appeared in the routers control panel. I must have installed the wrong firmware before. I enabled WDS on my Belkin again, added the MAC address of my DG934G/DG834G. I then enabled WDS on the DG934G/DG834G and added the Belkin's MAC address.Turn off both routers, turn on the Belkin, and then turn on the DG934G/DG834G -  and everything worked fine!
I like to set the main router as the DHCP server. So you don't have this weird overlap of DHCP. Then you disable DHCP on the other routers. I haven't actually used WDS before I use the repeater bridge option instead. 
Repeating/ wireless bridging does not work for all routers so you may have to face the fact that yours don't support it. In that case I would look at getting a WRT54GL or its N equivalent.
