This sets the number of retries, so set it to 0 if you just want one ARP. Unlike linux, BSD doesn't kick back an ICMP unreachable; it's up to something else to time out (TCP SYN_SENT timeout or whatever).
If you were doing traceroutes to a non-existent local address on Junos (BSD), you should see 5 ARPs followed by traceroute printing *, then traceroute will try again, you'll see another 5 ARPs, another * and so forth with traceroute continuing until it eventually gives up after 3 probes for 30 hops, ARPing 5 times per probe (a total of 450 ARPs I suppose).
The linux kernel will return an icmp host unreachable to the original sending process if it's unable to resolve an ARP after the mcast_solicit tries.
If you were doing traceroutes to a non-existent local address on Linux, you should have seen 3 ARPs followed by traceroute exiting with !H !H !H. (You get all three !Hs because net.ipv4.neigh.eth0.unres_qlen is set to 3 by default, so ARP will hold up to 3 packets in its queue while it's trying to resolve. If you set net.ipv4.neigh.eth0.unres_qlen to 2, a traceroute to a non-existent local address would give you !H !H *
