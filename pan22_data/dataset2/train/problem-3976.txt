Run BackupPlayer setup.exe and install the IMM4 codec. Then download and play on Realplayer 16. That has a converter that allows you to convert for different devices. Works perfectly for me. Nicely converts to .m4v despite being IMM5 codec
When installed the codec you can open the file with potplayer and then by right click in the viewer window select video capturing, convert the file in a mkv
How about (and this is really the last option) using a desktop recorder tool (Fraps, VLC - yes, it can do that too.) and recording the video as it plays in that "BackupPlayer"? Since it's CCTV footage, it's probably low-resolution and framerate anyway, so you shouldn't have any noticable quality loss when doing that.
FFmpeg now has a decoder for files encoded with the IMM5 codec. It is not in a released version yet so in order to use it, you will have to build it from the master branch.
Did some googling, and IMM5 seems like a pretty obscure format, possibly without open-source implementation, too. 
In particular, I've installed the mm4,5 and 6 codec and played the video with Windows Media Player successfully.
You can download the codec form this side https://www.lorextechnology.com/security-camera-systems/security-and-surveillance-cameras-system-with-lcd-monitor/L23WD-Series-1-p#downloadsTab
If all else fails, you can try Virtualdub: http://virtualdub.org/ It offers the option to export to a series of BMP files, which you can then stitch together using a more common codec.
