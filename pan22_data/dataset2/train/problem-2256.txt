If you have a machine with multiple PCI/PCI-x expansion slots, all you need to do is buy more graphics cards with dual output. I currently have a machine with two PCI-X graphics cards.  Each card has two video outputs.  I have four monitors.  
Yes, to achieve that you need to add another video card, mind you it's recommended to have 2 cards from the same vendor. Or you'll get some incompatibility problems later on.
I also use virtual dimension to give me extra space, I have 5 desktops which gives me the same as 10 monitors (kinda :-). It does promote a bad habit of not closing stuff down though.
This depends on your hardware setup.  Most current moderately priced workstations now have the capability to support 4 monitors.  Usually four is all you need.  Anymore than that and sometime of mounted monitor rig would need to be setup.
It really annoyed some of my users when they try to maximise an application on one screen and it expands acroos both. I wouldn't look at Dualhead again as a solution.
The nvidia Quadro NVS series cards (specifically the 420, 450, or the older 440) support 4 monitors in a single card.
There exists VGA splitters that take a single VGA output and emulate a huge resolution which is split on two or three other screens. Matrox makes these I believe.
