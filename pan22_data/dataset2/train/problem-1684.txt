my girlfriend just built her new PC on her own. Everything is fine except that the motherboard (890GX Pro3) doesn't remember settings, boot preferences and datetime every time she turn the power supply. 
My first thought would be bad battery, yes, or a bad battery receptacle. It is possible the board is faulty and not getting power like it should from the battery to hold the settings properly. If a new battery does not fix the problem, and you have already flashed the BIOS, the next step may be to RMA the board.
Before it had problems when turning on, the debugger said 00 and didn't even began to boot. An update to the Bios solved it but it didn't worked for the clock and preferences.
RTC (CMOS) Batteries are very easy to replace. And are very inexpensive. Typically it is a CR2032 button (or "watch") battery and is usually held in with a clip on the motherboard. To replace, pop the small metal clip holding it in on one side with a flat head screwdriver and press the new on in place of the old. It is easy to spot, a metal disc roughly the size of a quarter on the board.
I'm pretty sure the problem is the battery of the motherboard, but i would like to ask you what could be the problem, and maybe a tutorial to replace the battery.
