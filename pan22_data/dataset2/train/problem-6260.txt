I was just wondering if Acer or any other laptop charger had some sort of safety to shut off when extremely hot, because if not, then I would definitely consider bringing this charger to the repair store tomorrow for further testing.
Based on other hot objects I have unfortunately touched in the past, the temperature of the brick was as hot as a pot of newly-cooked soup. It has also made its surroundings uncomfortable to touch and I had panicked that something inside was burnt and needed replacement.
Before coming to such a conclusion, I backed up my files then gave the charger another go, knowing that there's a chance that the charger would surge and fry my motherboard. Thankfully that didn't happen, and my laptop is charging as of asking this question.
I was using my laptop a while ago with the charger plugged in. I noticed that the laptop switched to its batteries, so I glanced at my adapter (which had a switch) and noticed that it was still drawing power. I assumed that the transformer's removable end must have been pulled off, but when I checked it was intact. I tried to push it in further to get a good connection, but as I was doing so, I almost burnt my hands due to the extremely high temperatures.
