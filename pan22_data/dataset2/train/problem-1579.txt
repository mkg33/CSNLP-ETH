Read Receipt Remover for MS Exchange 2000/2003 application (RRR) can remove the read receipt request from each inbound e-mail message delivered to default Inbox folder of user's personal mailbox. So the Read Notification will never be sent back to the message originator. 
I got a new one today: a marketer sent one of my clients a spam with a read-receipt request attached to it, then replied to the read-receipt to demonstrate he knew my client had read his spam.
OK.  Entourage doesn't support read receipts at all.  So at some point MS decided that if you are using it with Exchange it will reply for you (automatically).
Putting aside the evil diabolicalness of such a plan, I can't seem to figure out how to prevent Exchange from responding to read-receipt requests.
The client is using an Entourage client against a Exchange 2003 SP2 system.  Entourage doesn't appear to deal with read-receipt requests itself, everything I've read suggests that it is a "feature" in the server itself.
My user has logged on to OWA, and confirmed that in Options -> Privacy and Junk E-mail Prevention, the Do Not Automatically Respond To Requests field is checked.
I have gone through the System Manger to Global Settings -> Internet Message Formats -> Default -> Advanced, and disabled the 'allow delivery reports' field.
