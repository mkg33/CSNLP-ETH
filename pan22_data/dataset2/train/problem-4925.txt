To rectify this problem, you may want to either download a full version of the Kali Linux distro onto your Raspberry Pi (choosing the correct ARM-architecture model for your device) or attempt to install the software yourself. 
Granted, this could prove to be complicated overall. If you are new to Linux, then you are best off not utilizing Kali Linux to start. It is a powerful system, albeit a difficult one at times (especially if you have never utilized the tools it includes). I would advise installing a more user-friendly distro such as Linux Mint to start with. However, if compatibility is a problem, then Ubuntu tends to be the friendliest distro with a great package manager to be found in Synaptic. 
Try to perform an apt-cache search at the terminal for the programs that you wish to install. If they are available in the repository, the set up can be as simple as executing an apt-get install and confirming you want to install it. Another alternative during the installation would be executing a simulated run to ensure there are no missing dependencies or other issues. You can do this utilizing the -s switch.
