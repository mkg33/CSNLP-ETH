I figured there might be a driver setting that can be tweaked to fix it, but I'm not sure what that setting might be. I'm using the latest driver for the card (1.1.2). I have a built-in Ethernet interface and a regular PCI Ethernet card in the machine, but both are disabled. Any idea why this would randomly happen?
I had this problem with Vista, but not XP. When I would come out of hibernate, it would take 5-10 minutes to connect back to the wireless. I disabled Ipv6 and it sped the process to 2-5 minutes! In my mind, that was still too long. The next idea I tried was to disable the security on my wireless router. That fixed the problem instantly. I WAS using WPA2, but it takes so long to reconnect so I had to downgrade to WPA. I know this is a bad idea, but I couldn't take the delay anymore.
I recently bought a Linksys WMP110 wireless PCI NIC for my XP machine. It works fine, except when I take it out of hibernate it sometimes won't reconnect or even see any wireless networks. I have to reboot for it to work again.
