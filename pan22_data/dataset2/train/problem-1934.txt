To make any drive bigger than 2tb appear as one space, it needs to be converted to a GPT disk in windows Disk Management. 
I read the accepted answer and feared that Windows 10 was now suddenly going to force me to clear my drive and setup a "Storage Space" before mirroring it, even though this was not the case in Windows 7. Turns out, this is not the case at all.
I know that this is an old question, but to answer one part of the question about the 5TB (for anyone who finds this page through G), MBR allows partitions of up to 2 TB (2048 GB). Converting the disk to GPT allows partitions much larger - up to approximately 9.4 ZB.
It's important that the disk you are trying to add (which should be same size or bigger than the source disk) has no volume. So you need to 'delete volume. Once Disk Management finds a sufficiently big unassigned disk, the 'Mirror' option on the source disk will no longer be greyed out.
At this point, when I right-clicked the existing data drive, "Add Mirror" was no longer grayed out. I was able to mirror the existing drive with all data in tact to the new empty drive.
It was greyed out for me when I first tried because I had formatted the destination drive - the key is for the destination to be unallocated. Do this by right clicking the destination drive and choosing 'delete volume'.
It is possible to add a mirror without using windows Storage Spaces or losing data on the source disk. In windows Disk Management, ensure your destination disk is an empty, unallocated basic drive of equal or greater size than your source disk. Right click on your source disk, and 'add mirror' should be there, not greyed out. 
So to recap: both drives Dynamic, both drives MBR, left the empty drive un-partitioned, and "Add Mirror" worked perfectly. I am using Windows 10 Enterprise.
