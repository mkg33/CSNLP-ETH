Once things are working, you can run dnsmasq without the --no-daemon and --log-queries options, so it will start in the background and you don't need to keep a Terminal window open.
I've experienced the same problemâ€¦ And while restarting mDNSResponder does seem to "work", restarting it a couple of times every hour sort of sucks.
Is 10.94.62.3 a DNS Server you trust?  If so, why is there only one?  You should have at least 2 DNS servers to refer to for failover purposes.  If that one goes down, you're a sitting duck.
I had the same problem with nslookup resolving my windows box, but ping giving me a "unknown host". I tried what Navdeep suggested and went to clear out the nameservers in the Network Preferences->Advanced->DNS tab. It would not let me subtract them, they were grayed out. I finally hit the + and they disappeared. I canceled adding a new one and applied changes, once no DNS servers were showing. Ping started working after that. The strange thing is that my local router/DHCP server was the first in the list and is the one responsible for resolving the Windows box. It must be something weird with the ordering. The other nameserver listed, is a work NS and would not be able to resolve the windows host. THANKS Navdeep!
