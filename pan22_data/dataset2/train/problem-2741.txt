You can using the outlook web app, set up a rule that will mark the mail as read, and it will work as if it truly was server-side. Anyways, it never pops up as unread in my iphone, even if I don't have the web app or outlook open.
Being marked as "read" is a client side action not a server action. When you opened the message on your phone it (the client) read it and then told the server to mark it as read.
When I did that, the Outlook marked the rule as Client-Side.  So I removed the part about marking it Read and it became a server side rule.
So I thought, ok, maybe marking an email as read is a client-side only activity.  So I sent myself an email, closed Outlook, opened the email on my iPhone (thus marking it read).  Then I opened the Outlook again and the email was already marked read.  So clearly marking emails read can be a server-side activity.
If you have the destination folder in Personal Folders, it would be in your pst file(located in PC) and the rule will become client-only. But if you place the destination folder in inbox, the folder will be in your Exchange and the server will process your rules.
