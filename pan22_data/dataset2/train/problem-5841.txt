Actually managing them with Group Policy-like functionality is a different story - there are some third-party products available like AdmitMAC and Radmind which can help with this.
The capability to add them to the domain is free - it's built into OS X and can be automated during deployment using DeployStudio.  
We have been adding our Mac devices to our domain for a few years now and haven't really encountered any issues with doing this.  It simplifies life for the users and keeps authentication consistent.  Their network home directories are automatically mapped to a desktop shortcut on login, which is another nice feature.
When you say "and to mount some network drives," be aware that Macs cannot access DFS shares without third-party software. AdmitMac claims it works, and it may at this point; when I dealt with it about a year ago DFS access was an unmitigated disaster.
We have got an inquiry about getting some Macs into the network domain. The main reason for this is authentication (the Mac users are already members of the domain and would like to login with these credentials), and to mount some network drives.
I have not done this before, and would like to know your ideas of the best way to implement these Macs into the domain. We are looking for free, or at least inexpensive, solution for this. I have looked into some of the solutions out there but would appreciate some feedback from someone who have worked with this in a production environment.
I am working at the operations department at a large, mostly Windows based, IT solutions company. Personally I am a Mac user, but I mostly use my Mac in "Mac environments".
