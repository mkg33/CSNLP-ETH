I guess it is a good idea to backup your raid configurations before you even think to fiddle with them =)
From a degraded mode you can recover either forcing a resync so that the only active partition gets cloned to the one which you have taken back to work, or replacing the defective disk and providing the new space to the array, which will cloned in the same way described before.
Both methods will keep your data intact, unless you do something unproper to configurations or to the "good" partitions which are still alive =)
As to the SMART values, they seem quite ok to me, besides the Hardware_ECC_Recovered which is also discussed on other replies.. 
Anyway avoid considering the single value you see there, also check at which pace it is changing. I once had strange values on a drive, but they didn't get worst, they were stable. On the other hand good SMART values are not proof of a perfect disk: in my opinion they can be good to check disk wearing due to usage/aging, but they can do little to prevent sudden failures (for instance those caused by mechanical stress, overheating, etc.. - think of a failing cooler on the server room..)
So an offline hard drive or a defective one will force the array into the "degraded mode" (just one copy online, non redundancy).
When you have two volumes mirrored using RAID1, each copy has an "activity counter" that gets updated when something gets changed inside the copy: that way the system is able to understand which one is the most up to date in case of a crash or other things that take down one of the two.
