If it still doesn't fix things, you can reinstall Windows. You'll want to back up your data first, though, if you haven't already done so. You can also reinstall Windows without removing the partition, but sometimes that doesn't work and you'll probably still have to reinstall all your software.
I've installed Windows 10 using Bootcamp to my Late Macbook 2008. After an update blue screen occurred (inaccessible boot device) and there are two options on the following screen: Restart or Advanced Options. However, a built-in keyboard and external USB keyboards don't seem to work. Is there any solution?  
I don't know how BootCamp affects things, but I'd suggest making a boot repair disk and running standard Windows repair methods. These are some of things I did when I was a PC repair tech, rather than a Mac repair tech. I don't remember the full list, since it was really long and it's been several years since I've worked as a tech.
There's a couple other things the links suggest, but I haven't done them myself.  You may need to run these steps 2-3 time for it to fully work.
There's plenty of other resources to look up repairs online. Even when I was a tech, I'd spend hours to research new fixes so I didn't have to spend days reinstalling everything. I've seen more complete repair walk throughs on SE/SO, as well as Google, so just keep searching.
