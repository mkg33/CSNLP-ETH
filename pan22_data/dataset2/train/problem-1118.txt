If you get access, backup everything and run a diagnostic on the disk to decide if you're going to be able to continue using it. Also check the power supply cables to see if they're reliable - they're frequently the cause for such problems. If that's the problem, it's not the disk's fault!
Then run fsck.ext4 on the driver - this does not mount the disk (which should not be mounted either) and checks for the file structure. If the superblock is damaged, it can use a backup copy, and maybe get access close to normal again. See the man page and Wikipedia
Connect to the manufacturer's site and look for the disk recovery software. Almost all manufacturers have such a tool (Western Digital's is called DLG if I recall correctly). It might be a tool which runs in DOS or windows. These tools are able to switch bad sectors for spare ones, and get the disk at least logically correct again. There might be some files which have now bad sectors replaced by new ones, but at least the space is usable again.
