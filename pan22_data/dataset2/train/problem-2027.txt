Keep in mind that AD LDS is not the same thing as an Active Directory domain; it's only a LDAP database and server, and you're the one which will need to populate it, at a much lower level than the one you're used with when dealing with AD.
Your best bet is to follow this technet article: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730701%28WS.10%29.aspx
Think of it this way: AD LDS is like SQL server with no databases or tables defined. AD itself is like SQL server with a full schema, databases, set of tables, triggers and stored procedures all defined and ready to go.
If you only need it for development purposes, it would be a lot easier to set up a virtual machine running an actual domain controller; you can do that with as few as 256 MB of memory if you use Windows Server 2003.
I think you're in for a world of pain trying to get LDS working in place of AD when dealing with SharePoint. It's not really a lightweight version of AD even though its name implies so.
If your app requires SharePoint, which in turn requires AD, I don't think AD LDS will be enough; and, even if it will, it'll be a lot more difficult to set up and manage properly than a full-blown AD domain.
