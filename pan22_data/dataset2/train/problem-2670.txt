Well, this doesn't work. The only thing that works is if I define mail addresses in the regular ".forward" file, but that file just seems to get used if all else fails. I've tried poking around with the user rights to read the .forward files, tried other syntax than line-seperation, but to no avail.
The behavior is described in http://www.postfix.org/local.8.html in the paragraph of Address Extension:
First of all: I'm working on a rented server setup here (hosted at Ulyssis.org). I only have access to my user folder (/home/preparee) folder and an online application that allows me to manage my account, and set up mail aliases.
I was told postfix should try to "match" the incoming mail to these .forward files, and use the most specific .forward file.
But to be honest: Ditch that provider. Letting you configure mail forwarding only by .forward files is technology of the last century.
I've checked the postfix documentation, but it is quite archaic, and no info seems to match the restricted environment in which I'm working (only access to home directory, I can't even access the postfix logs).
Now, I want to be able to manage mail forwards for my domain, which is called preparee.be. Preparee is our organisation. In the past, we just added users to mail forwarding manually using the online application. Now, I'm developing a PHP solution to manage our organisation. I wanted to be able to control the mail forwards from PHP, without having to manually visit the online tool every time. I've got all the mail adresses in a MySQL database, seems a bit silly to manually copy them and paste them in the online tool every time.
