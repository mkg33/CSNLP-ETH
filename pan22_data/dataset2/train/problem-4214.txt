This sounds a little bit like your motherboard is dying, at least in my ears. A faulty sensor can trigger such behavior, but do also check if all the fans/heatsinks are probably seated.
This is almost certainly a heat issue. If you are spiking to 108c, your computer is almost definitely shutting itself down. It is either shutting down because of intense heat, or the motherboard is set to do an emergency shut down at a certain temperature.
Check your CPU fan. Is it working? If so, are your other fans in your case working? Good rule of thumb is to intake air towards the bottom of the case and exhaust at the top (heat rises). Make sure none of your exhausts are clogged with dust or anything.
I changed 2 settings in the BIOS - one to enable the fan to adjust its speed to the temperature, and the other to disable shutting down when the computer heats up.
Even being in the 60s is considered somewhat high. Should still be stable, but at that point you need to be concerned.
If you can confirm this is a temperature issue, you may need to reseat your CPU with some fresh thermal compound.
You also may wanna consider that it is a problem with the new power supply. Did the problems directly start after swapping it?
You can also try to find the same motherboard from some shop and see if your PC works with replacing that.
+1 for defective sensor, motherboard or power supply. Also it is not uncommon for a faulty PSU (you have already replaced one) to fry some of the connected components.
Not the ideal solution, I know, but the computer no longer powers down, and all sensors report normal temperatures.
