From the navigation pane, drag the section to the correct place (eg, drag dogs between mammals and reptiles) and then you can select 'demote' on the dogs section. This will demote dogs and all its subsections.
In that view, you can easily drag headings and their corresponding paragraphs around and change the level.
The paragraph numbers will automatically change. If they don't, then the list style isn't properly set.
The following article shows how to create a list style. I'm going to suppose you already did that, because i'd just plagiarize the article.
If I just move the paragraphs and corresponding headers to the proper location, the heading levels will still be wrong; i.e. "Insects" and "Dogs" will still be Heading 1, whereas they should be Heading 2 and Heading 3, respectively. Is there a way to fix this in bulk, rather than clicking on each individual header one by one and changing its style?
For example, I realise that the "Insects" should really be a sub-section of "Animals" rather than its own separate chapter. And "Dogs" and its subsections really belong under "Mammals".
