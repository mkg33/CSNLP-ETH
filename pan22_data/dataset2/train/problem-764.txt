numerous Google and and Bing and Stack Overflow and Server Fault searches all told me that cron operates this way, but they all also seemed to indicate that incron operates as described in the documentation, which it DOES under Ubuntu...
(this does not address my problem with applying a SELinux security policy for incron, but I'll worry about that later, in another post...) 
Despite all documentation I can find declaring it to be the contrary, incrond under CentOS 6.4 runs in a sparse environment and behaves as cron. this is NOT the case under Ubuntu, where incron inherits its environment from root for system tables and root tables and only user tables run in a sparse environment. This of course means that if you're calling a script (I am) the script needs to build it's environment and every thing must have a full path. EVERYTHING. (well, except for shell builtins :p)
Try to add the x permission to the script to be executed (this permission could have been "removed" by ftp, sftp, etc.)
