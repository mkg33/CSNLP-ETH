I've been playing with Linux RAMDISKs, as in the block device /dev/ram0. I understand that when I first start writing to one of these devices some RAM is allocated to it.
Freeram is part of loadlin package https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/loadlin/1.6f-5 and implemented as opening device to read/write and doing BLKFLSBUF ioctl
Try to unload (rmmod) the module with rmmod brd, this is the only way to call brd_del_one function and delete ramdisk.
If you do format and mount a ramdisk however, the only way that I remember doing is by using freeramdisk but that was a long long time ago.
How do I free the memory used by, say, /dev/ram0? Put another way: how do I indicate to the Linux kernel that I'm done and it can reclaim whatever resources are held by /dev/ram0?
/dev/ram0 and other are implemented by brd linux kernel module: Source - http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/block/brd.c, documentation of modprobe brd: https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7012396.
