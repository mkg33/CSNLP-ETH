STP will not loop if the same MAC address is used for all the ports. On the contrary, it would be more likely to loop if the MAC addresses are different, but it is unlikely that such a problem would get through product testing, or survive long in implementations.
While I'm testing the STP function in several different Switches, I found Some Switches use single MAC address for all LAN ports (e.g. Buffalo's BS-G2108M, Netgear's GS716Tv3), while some other Switches assign one MAC per LAN port (e.g. ELECOM's EHB-SG2A08-PL)
The one-MAC-per-port design decision really has nothing to do with STP since all the MAC addresses will be relatively in the same ballpark as far as value, and STP takes into account the port number when making decisions. It is likely that the separate MAC addresses per port are easier to use for the switch's STP port decision if the MAC addresses increase in value as the port number increases.
So why use "one MAC per port" design for STP function? Someone said that STP self-loop may not work correctly if "one MAC per port" design is not used. Is it True? And is there any other advantages or disadvantages by using "one MAC per port" design?
