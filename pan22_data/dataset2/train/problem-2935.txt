Basically, 9 of these will be loaded, anymore are dropped without an error. If I rename files in this folder so they are ordered differently a different 9 pools will be launched (ie. it loads the either the first or last 9 from the folder).
I've setup our server so that each site has its own user.  This seems to be the standard way to do it (and most secure).
I seem to be reaching some sort of pool limit.  The php-fpm.conf file clearly says, "There is no limitation on the number of pools which FPM can handle. Your system will tell you anyway :)". However, the service will only launch a maximum of 9 pools before one silently dropped. Is this my system letting me know? (no error and plenty of spare memory).
This is kind of old but i had a similar issue where the pool name was too long and thus the pool was getting droped without any errors.
All my pools are setup as above (with different user names of course).  I have tried both ondemand and dynamic but neither work.
Is this a FPM bug or do I need to adjust some setting somewhere to allow more than 9 pools?  I've looked through the FPM bug list and can see nothing current and do not want to post a bug if this an obvious config error.  I cannot seem to find anyone else posting anywhere about similar issue.
