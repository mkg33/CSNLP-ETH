Essentially, you need a formula in the A column that looks for values in the B column (columns and Rows are interchangeable in this example).  In this example, think of A as the destination for the data and B as the sample used to determine the answer to your statement.  Just make sure you're closing each statement with a ")" at the end (observe the sample statement houses two Nested statements and ends with 2 ")".
You can continue this indefinitely and then use the plus at the lower right of the finished A1 Cell to automatically change as many rows down in the A column you wish to use.  By using this method the formulas in each A column cell filled in this manner will be directed at the corresponding B cell.  So essentially you only need to update the A1 cell then drag the plus sign down to fill the remaining A Cells (which will read "FALSE" until data is plugged into the B Column cells).
What your looking for are called Nested IF statements (full tutorial here https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-if-function).
