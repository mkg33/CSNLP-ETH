if you hard drive is on local RAID - check if the battery status is fine - and the local cache is enabled - otherwise your writes are going to be much slower 
Last time I had random freezing like that it was a dodgy hard drive cable causing the drive to time out and need restarting occasionally; I would have expected that errors of that level would be reported quite loudly in dmesg though :S
You seem to have high levels of concurrency - but parts of your MySQL configuration seems to be setup for MyISAM - innodb might be better for this setup, however a slow mysqld will only indirectly affect load metrics (unless the 120 waiting processes are all mysqld?). Are you running a mix of engines? If you're sticking with MyISAM, the reduce the number of threads and increase the key_buffer_size. Regardless which engine your tables use, change your long query time to zero (at least temporarily) and start parsing those log files with mysqldumpslow.
You've looked at all sorts of metrics, but seem to have missed the ones I'd start with: what happens to your request times during the slowdown - while you'd expect everything to be slower, are there URLs with higher levels of access leading up to the events? Do the events follow any sort of pattern with relation to time?
I wouldn't put much faith in hdparm's benchmarks - it's a very poor substitute for things like bonnie++ and fio - but even the latter is difficult yo use to model real application traffic.
