In order to implement an "outgoing connections only" policy the firewall needs to keep track of the connections initiated internally so it can allow responses back in without opening up the floodgates. There is no fundamental differance here between IPv4 and IPv6.
NAT really has nothing to do with security. That comes from having a firewall. The RFC for NPTv6 is experimental, not on the standards track, and NPTv6 can break some IPv6 features. It is not necessary to do NAT for IPv6 since you can easily get far more IPv6 addresses than you will ever need. NAT breaks the IP end-to-end connectivity paradigm that IPv6 restores with its vast addressing where every host has a unique address. NAT breaks that, and it is a kludge to extend the IPv4 addressing until IPv6 is ubiquitous. You should never use NAT unless you must.
As Sander pointed out, a firewall will let you control what external traffic can reach your network. A firewall will, by default, block all external traffic. You can enable what you want to come in. IPv6 is different than IPv4, and you should probably allow all ICMPv6 because IPv6 depends on ICMP for many things that IPv4 does not.
