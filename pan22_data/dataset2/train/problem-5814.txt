By placing a VPN into the mix, you're complicating things somewhat.  By making the VPN endpoints machines within a LAN, rather than making the default gateways the endpoints, you're complicating things greatly.
There's also all sorts of firewalling stuff you might have to do, both on the gateways and the VPN endpoints, and you might have to turn on IP forwarding on the endpoints, but it's all fairly straightforward network configuration stuff.
Without knowing what your gateways actually are, I can't tell you how to configure them, but the routes basically need to be:
In order for machines on different networks to successfully talk to each other, both ends need to know how to route traffic to the other end.  Normally, this is easily done on a simple enduser LAN because there's usually only two destinations: "the local network" and "everywhere else".  Traffic to the local network is just sent directly to the destination, while traffic to everywhere else is sent to the default gateway ("router") and it handles it (by passing it to your upstream ISP, which has far more knowledge about where to send traffic to the many destinations that make up the Internet).
What you need to do is add routes to allow traffic to go to the right places.  You can either do this on every machine in both LANs, or just add it to the default gateway.  The latter is far easier, but slightly less efficient (traffic will have an extra "hop", going via the gateway, which shouldn't be a major inconvenience in most cases).
