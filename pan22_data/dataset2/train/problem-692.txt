I am wondering if Honeytrap (the low interaction honeypot) that has a proxy mode couldn't be modified to achieve that.
There is a new kid on the block. SSH piper will route your connection based on pre-defined usernames, that should be mapped to the inner hosts. This is the best solution in the context of of reverse-proxy.
A possible solution would be to have a 'bastion' host, where clients can ssh in to that machine, get a normal (or restricted if desired) shell, and can then ssh into internal hosts from there.
Adding a name based vhost system (as implemented by Apache) could make it a perfect reverse proxy for any protocol no ?
because of how ssh works I think it's not possible. Similar to https you would have to have different (external) IPs for different hosts, because the gateway doesn't know where do you want to connect to because everything in ssh is encryted
In addition, you would have issues with host key verification. SSH clients will verify keys based on an IP address as well as a hostname. You would have multiple hostnames with different keys, but the same IP you're connecting to.
I don't believe this is something that would be possible, at least the way you described, although I would love to be proved wrong. It doesn't appear that the client sends the hostname that it wishes to connect to (at least in the clear). The first step of the SSH connection seems to be to set up encryption.
As the number of ports/hosts you want to access behind a firewall increases, the convenience of VPNs increases.
