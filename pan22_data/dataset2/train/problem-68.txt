If the logins are copied over and you're still running into issues, you're probably looking at a SID mismatch.  Have a look here for more information and a resolution.
SQL Server Database Mirroring is a database level high-availability mechanism.  Anything that affects databases other than the one you're mirroring (ex. logins stored in Master) need to be manually propogated over to the mirror after the failover happens, or (more ideally) on a regular basis during scheduled maintenance.
I have a peculiar scenario where my mirrored database can't be accessed on one server but it can on the other.  I've tried specifying a specific SQL login to get it working but when the database is failed over the other server SQL no longer is able to use those credentials.  I also tried using integrated security to use domain administrator account which I figured would be consistent between both servers.  No luck.  So what can I do to remedy this problem and is there a way to have the one server instance pick up the security accounts from the other.  Both servers are in a trusted domain.
