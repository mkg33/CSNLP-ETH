OpenNMS is supposed to be the gold standard free monitoring for large infrastructure (thousands of hosts)
Nagios does have a web interface, and there are web interfaces that allow you to configure Nagios.  But Nagios set up is not all that easy in general.
The configuration of nagios can be quite complicated and take a while to get used, but once your there its a fantastic tool. There are also a number of tools to help in its configuration such as nagiosconfig.
I recommend Zenoss Core (free).  They have ZenPacks to pull custom information that needs to be tracked.  Works great in my Linux/Windows environment. 
I run Nagios & Cacti, both polling through SNMP, and there has yet to be anything i cant monitor, sometimes i have to write my own php/perl module to do it, but nothing has been "unmonitorable."
I generally think of health as fans, power, temperature, etc.  If you are using dell servers, open manage can help with that.  Nagios allows you to write your own plugins in whatever language, it just uses the exit status of the script.  It is possible to tie open manage in with Nagios as well. 
One of the most common tools used to do this is Nagios, its opensource and has a wide array of monitoring plugins, and if you don't like any of them its able to run any bash script you might like and handle the response. It displays all data through a web interface.
Even with PHP+CURL i was able to monitor the logging in of our Exchange server's OWA portal, check that its actually logged in & can view the inbox, and if there is a failure anywhere in the path, notify an engineer.
