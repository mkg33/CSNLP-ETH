I was setting up a laptop that kept changing time and date on reboot, went to all sorts of lengths... BIOS, everything I could think of at the time.
You can fix this by either asking windows to set the hardware clock with UTC, or Ubuntu to use localtime.
Check the actual time zone setting (Click the clock, "Change date and time settings" and if needed change time zone from here.)
I decided to continue wasting time on troubleshooting problems in tools that are supposed to save me time... and I rebooted the system several times in order to have a more controlled observation of what's going on:
It turned out that it was set to a Canadian time zone instead of mine (GMT + 12/13). Changed to the right time zone and all of a sudden the time was correct (Go figure).
So when you shut down, your hard ware clock is set to say "13:00". When you boot, windows sees "13:00" as localtime, so 1 PM, but Ubuntu sees that as UTC and so converts the time back from UTC to local time.
So, part of the mystery is solved, but I still don't understand why Windows 7 won't automatically 'Synchronize with an Internet time server' immediately upon reboot, just as Ubuntu does.
Because of the way the two operating systems set the hardware clock. by Default ubuntu uses UTC, and windows localtime.
Apparently, Ubuntu uses UTC time, while Windows 7 uses local time (as has been for decades), and after retrieving correct time via NTP, Ubuntu updates the BIOS accordingly.
