We can't be sure what the total power consumption will be at 100% load, be cause we can't take into effect the power factor which is unknown at the 100% load. I don't think that it will be considerably lower than the on at 50% and it may be higher. 
Also voltage level can make an impact at efficiency of the power supply. Power supplies running at 230 V are usually a bit more efficient than when running at 115 V, but the results will vary from PSU to PSU.
If you plug a 200w card to the PSU, it will draw 200w DC from the PSU because there is no loss at this stage as it was converted from AC in the previous calculation.
The efficiency is an extremely complex topic, and in very simple terms Wil's answer is correct, but...
From it we learn that the efficiency is considered ratio between real power provided at device output and real power provided at device input. This is important when calculating whole power consumption of the device. From it we can see that the power factor isn't taken into concern when the efficiency is calculated. So at 50% load, we can more or less accurately calculate total power consumption of the device: First, we say it provides 500 W. Then we take efficiency in, so we know that it consumes around 555.56 W of power. At last, we take power factor into equation and we get that it consumes around 617.28 VA. That is the total power consumed by the device. The real power power supply consumes is 555.56 W and it also consumes 61.72 VAr for which you may or may not be charged, depending on the way electricity is sold in your area. 
A 1000w PSU rated at 90% efficiency at full load will draw 1111w of 120v AC from the wall. This 1111w AC will be converted at 90% to 1000w DC and the rest will be lost in heat. But remember that it is most likely that efficiency at full load is much lower than 90%.
Also about the card power consumption. Here, card is considered a separate system and its own efficiency isn't taken into account. Instead, you're provided with its maximum power consumption. So a 200 W card will pull up to 200 W from the power supply. However, if the power supply is 90% efficient at the moment, you could say that the card will pull 220 W form the power plug of the computer plus an unknown number of volt-ampere reactive.
The 1000 continuous and 1100 max means that it is capable of providing 1000w constantly but will accept spikes up to 1100w. Such spikes may occur for instance when an optical drive starts to turn or some new devices are connected to USB.
The answer form @AndrejaKo is very good and detailed but I feel it is a little complex so I'll try to answer the question as simple as possible:
