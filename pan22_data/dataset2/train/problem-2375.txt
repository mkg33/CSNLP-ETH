The reason you are not able to connect to Elasticache nodes is that the DNS name or the endpoint only resolves to the IPs belonging to the VPC CIDR (not Public or Elastic IPs). As these IPs are not publically routable, the connection cannot be established over the internet.
You can also spin up OpenVPN Access server in that VPC. More information can be found in Using a VPN Server to connect to your AWS article

I have made sure that inbound rule allows 6379 from any IP and also tried to edit /etc/redis.conf to add bind example-redis-1.example.0001.euw1.cache.amazonaws.com but even than the error remains the same.
You need a way to establish a route over to the internet to be able to access the node. This can be done by means of VPN or using NAT settings as told by @"Matt Houser"
