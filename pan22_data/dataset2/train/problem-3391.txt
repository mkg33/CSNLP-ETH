A wiki, as already suggested by others, or some kind of database (e.g. Microsoft Access) would work well but or such (relatively) small numbers of machines there should be very few entries. If you find you're needing to add more than a few entries per year, say anything more than 1% of the total number of machines less than 5 years old, it's time to look into why.
We just use a table in a wiki.  We've got about the same quantity of hardware, and it works pretty well for us -- certainly no worse than any of the asset tracking systems I've used over the years.
The main problem with asset tracking systems is that everyone has their own idea of what they want (and don't want) to track.
My immediate attempts to find a solution via google did not elucidate anything using various combination sof the search terms 'recording hardware failure' or 'logging hardware fixes'.
I recommend one page per machine and then a "master page" or pages (perhaps at the department level or whatever is convenient) to link everything together.
In an environment of a couple of hundred of PCs and maybe 10-20 servers, what are the methods that are used to keep track of hardware failures and fixes either under warranty or otherwise?
The nice think about a wiki based solution is that you can create a standard "template" and begin tracking your machines that way.
Any decent servicedesk system would include both asset tracking and case logging, and a nicely connection between these in the CMDB. 
I haven't used too many softwares, but one that would suffice for these things would be Servicedesk Plus from AdventNet. I'm sure there are plenty of other systems with the same capabilities.
I'm sure there must be something out there that does this to some extent. Otherwise I guess I will have to write a db-based solution.
