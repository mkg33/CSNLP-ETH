In general you should look at LTSP as even if you don't like their methods some of the idea's are good.
I use LTSP on my Ubuntu 10.04 64bit box and have 8 thin clients running off it all running 1920x1080 on 24" screens.
I've done 3 installations of LTSP using these as thin clients, 2 of these installations where running mythtv frontends, really pushing the units.
I recently set up a thin client solution for my company using LTSP and diskless/fanless mini-itx boards as the thin-client pc's. The system has been in use for a few months now and it's rock solid. All of the thin-clients run a touchscreen, and are housed in a custom built enclosure. I would recommend LTSP for it's ease of setup. It does lack a really good admin module, hopefully someone will create one at some point. That aside, it's fast and works really well.
I recently tested a thin client from HP for work.  It ran a Debian based thin client OS and it supported 2 monitors (dvi).  I was able to connect it to my Ubuntu desktop using XDMCP and it worked really well.
We were testing the HP T5720 and it supported two monitors but was expensive.  There are cheaper models that should work though.  Just be careful to avoid the XPe (XP embedded) thin clients as they won't support XDMCP.  But the Debian based ones seem to work great for this.
