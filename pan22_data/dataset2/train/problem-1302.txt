This would kind of be a hack and obviously isn't a great solution, but I suppose you could disable or uninstall the driver for your touchpad.  You'd need to find the touchpad under Control Panel-->Hardware and Sound-->Device Manager-->Mice and other pointing devices, then double click it to open the properties dialog.  Under the Driver tab, there are buttons to disable and uninstall the driver.  For me, the disable button is grayed out, so uninstalling the driver might be the only available option.
I haven't actually seen that exact model, but it's probably a marked Fn-F key combination built into the keyboard.
I have an ACER Aspire 7745G. The Fn (blue) + F7 will disable the touchpad. Hope that helps anyone that is using a USB mouse and have the problem of the cursor moving every time you type anything and accidentally touch the pad like I have had in the past. 
If you happen to have a Lenovo laptop with the UltraNav software installed, you can disable the touch pad by unchecking a checkbox in Control Panel-->Hardware and Sound-->Mouse-->UltraNav tab.
