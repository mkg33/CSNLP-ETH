The simplest way is to read the type of the printer and search it on internet. If the printer has a display, you may find out its IP address using its system menu.
If your printer shows other ports, you might be able to look them up at IANA's registry of assigned ports, or elsewhere.
I'm trying to determine what printing protocol a network printer expects (ipp, http, etc). I've got the hostname and IP address of the printer, and access to a cygwin bash shell and powershell. How do I determine what protocol it's actually using? There's no print server between my machine and the printer as far as I know (but would appreciate tips on how to verify this).
This will give you a list of ports that have been found open. Here's a scan I just did against a Sharp printer in the office:  
So here we can see that it is listening for connections on both 515 (LPR) and 9100 (JetDirect). There's also port 631, which is Internet Printing Protocol.  
You can use a tool like NMAP to perform a port scan of the printer's IP address, to see which ports it is listening for connections on. This will likely give away which protocol it is using, as these will almost certainly be left at the default. For example, port 515 would suggest LPR, and port 9100 would suggest HP JetDirect.  
I don't know what port 50001/tcp is supposed to be doing, and apparently neither does NMAP (it shows the service as unknown). So after a brief Google, I have consulted the manual, and found it is the default administration/management interface, used by the proprietary admin tools to manage the printer.
So, we know that this printer supports not just one, but several printing protocols - and these are just the ones that are enabled on the printer. I could have probably learned all this much more quickly if I'd just read the vendor's specs, but it might not have been as much fun.
