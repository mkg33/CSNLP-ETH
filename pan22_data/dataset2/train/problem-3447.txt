So say if the file is owned by user1 and group user1, most user1 files also have user1 group. If I add user2 to group user1, user2 will have gained extra permissions. The only way I can think of is create a group for this specific file, change the group with chown and then add user2 to this group. Is this correct? It seems to me that this creates a lot of complexity if I have to do this for every file. I come from a windows background and over there you simply right-click the file and add the user to the file's permission. So no need to create 20 groups for 20 different files, then add the users to all 20 groups, etc.
As I understand it, to give a write permission to a user I can either change the owner of the file to that user and give it "user write permission" (which I don't want to do), or keep the same owner but add this user to the file's group and give the group a write permission. But the latter will give this user permission to all other files associated with this group (whatever those permissions may be).
