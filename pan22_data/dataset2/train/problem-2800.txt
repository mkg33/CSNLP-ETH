favicons are actually small .gif images that are stored on the website's server itself. It works just like downloading an image in your browser, except it displays it on a tab or at the top of the window. I don't think there is a way to change what favicon is displayed unless you intercepted that image and got your browser to replace that with an image of your choice when you visit that site.
Copy this string from the desired image and overwrite the image data in the favicon you wish to change.
Chrome is able to run greasemonkey scripts, and I was able to adapt this script to replace a favicon on the site of my choosing.  If you are a little bit technical, you can modify too.  Just get the desired favicon base64 encoded and you are good to go.
Open the Other Bookmarks button at the right of the bookmarks bar and navigate down the tree till you see the imported bookmarks.
There's a Chrome extension that shows you the unread message count, and it also allows you to change the color of the favicon at the same time. If one of your two Gmail tabs is regular Gmail and the other is for a custom domain, then you can set a different color for each one. My pinned tabs look like this now:
Drag your newly faviconed bookmark from here to its desired location on the bookmarks bar and delete the original.
I know in Firefox there is an extention that allows you to change the colour of tabs. If there such an add-on for Chrome you could use it to colour the tabs and therefore be able to distinguish between them.
The challange is finding that add-on though. If Chrome has an add-on website like Firefox, you could search there for one. Failing that, hopefully someone more familiar with Chrome can post a suitable add-on.
