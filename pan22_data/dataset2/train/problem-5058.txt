Make sure you are not deleting any wrong system services or else you will end up in trouble starting your machine. 
I have installed a Windows service using the sc create method, then I later used the sc delete method to get rid of it, it then marked the service for deletion.
If installutil and sc can't immediately remove my services, what other options do I have? (Excluding 3rd party components) Or is there a way I could forcibly remove these services?
"marked for deletion" means it will be deleted at next reboot. Just reboot your server, it will automatically disappear.
I then tried the same thing using installutil with a different service and the first couple of times it added and removed it successfully, then it eventually also got stuck. Now I've got 2 services marked for deletion, installed using different methods and they were also marked for deletion using different methods.
I made changes to the service and recompiled it, then I tried to recreate it using sc create but it said: The service has been marked for deletion So I thought I'd give it some time.
is for Adobe Flash player update service. You can see it in the corresponding displayname on the right panel of regedit.
