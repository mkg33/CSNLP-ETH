There is this page at Raspberry Pi, evidently they've thought of doing it. https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/dpi/README.md
Given how long this information has been available, I'm fairly surprised we haven't seen modules for sale for this already.

This is effectively identical to the many questions that pop up on reusing screens from phones, tablets and anything else with pixels. Without access to detailed information, parts specifications and Pi-appropriate driver software from Amazon (none of which exists in the public domain) there's no way you're going to be able to interface a Pi with the Kindle screen. The best you can hope for is to send signals from a Pi to a whole Kindle, per the existing projects you mention in your question. 
The only thing is that the Pi may not be able to deliver the timings needed for controlling the device so you may need a microcontroller in between.
If you want an expensive alarm, try using 640x384, 7.5inch E-Ink display HAT for Raspberry Pi https://www.waveshare.com/7.5inch-e-paper-hat.htm
I am not sure why people are being so negative. There are at least two people out there who have worked out how to drive these screens.
So it comes down to finding a display with enough information.  Once you're sure of the logic levels some of it could be explored or confirmed by touching wires to places to see what happens.  Then again, can you tell if you're seeing a 2^4 or a 2^5 colorwise?  The Pi  can do 24 bit color over DPI it seems but that's a lot of wires to guess at.  If you can find documentation for the display you're trying to connect it would save time and frustration.
