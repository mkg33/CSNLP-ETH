The network should be set to All Users, but it may also be necessary to save the authentication for access to the wifi network. This is intended by Microsoft to allow updates when no one is logged in. When the auth setting is (user or computer) it is not possible to save auth info. Try the following:
If the network connection has been saved for 'All Users' then it should connect when the wireless is enabled, regardless of whether anyone is logged on.
If the setting mentioned is set to all-user profiles and Wifi is still dropping, you may need to log into an admin account and connect to the network. One of our machines at work would disconnect when switching users, making remote control difficult as the user had standard user rights. What I did was log in as admin when I was local to the machine and connected to the WiFi network in the admin account. Now, I can switch users over remote control.
If you open the network and sharing center, go into Manage Wireless Networks, right-click the network and choose properties, you'll see the 'Network Availability'  - is that set to All Users?
