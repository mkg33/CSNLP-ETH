The fan sensors on the motherboard of this model tended to go bad after 5 years. The server can't boot when the wrong combination of fans is not detected. I had to walk the customer through jumpstarting the machine with a shop-vac (to get the fans spinning at boot) and this is how they kept the server running until I could arrive with a new system.
I knew someone who decided to reorganize the files on their computer by putting all the .exe's in one folder.
Earlier this year we hired a new girl.  I was asked to make sure that all the company fonts were installed on her computer.  I knew they were but decided to pick my battles and just install them again.  I got a call from the girl about 5 minutes afterwards and she wanted me to come over and show her how to use the new "software" I installed.  I walked over, opened Word and walked her through how to change fonts....which is what I installed.
Apparently real sysadmins don't use those cliched config files like /etc/fstab and /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/*
A few years ago, the company I was working for acquired one of our competitors and I had to audit their machines (Centos) to ensure that they would meet our standards in terms of configuration (their sysadmin had declined the opportunity to join our company in favour of starting his own company that developed turn-key solutions).
The company had a 95% market share in a field that dealt with safety of life and property.  All I can say is that that can give a real pause.
Ten years ago, I interviewed for a company whose primary server room's cabling looked like spaghetti soup.  The networking equipment was in 3 racks near one corner of a 20ft x 60ft room.  There was a cascade of network cables of all sorts of colors tumbling down the racks and ending in a pool of tangled cables about 7ft wide and spilling out about 5 ft from the racks.  There wasn't any documentation and no one knew what went where.
