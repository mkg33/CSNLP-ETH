The challenge with port forwarding in GCE is that instances only have a single network interface, so packets forwarded with DNAT get their source IP replaced by SNAT immediately when they run through the POSTROUTING chain. As this happens before they reach their destination instance, it looks like DNAT didn't work. The fix now is to protect forwarded packets after DNAT from immediate SNAT by skipping that rule in POSTROUTING. The second rule below does exactly that:
Note that a GCE firewall rule must be added to allow all forwarded ports from anywhere, on both the head (bastion) and the backend instance. 
The above rules can be repeated for any number of ports to be forwarded. The final rule below ensures all instances in the local network have Internet access w/o them having a public IP (this rule replaces the MASQUERADE rule suggested in the GCE documentation):
This solution enables port forwarding to backend instances w/o a public IP, while those instances also have full access to the Internet. The latter also requires IP Forwarding to be enabled for the head node, and a default route added to the subnetwork, as explained here: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking in section "Configure a NAT gateway".
The network's gateway replaces <1-local> with the public IP before packets are sent back to the Internet.
