Tapes are a terrible medium.  The tape drives have a habit of destroying tapes when they kill themselves, the tapes themselves are fragile.  Anyone ever have to have a DLT tape repaired from a broken leader?
In short -- the question of which interconnect to use is basically chosen for you by which sort of tape drive you use.  Otherwise, how you do your backups is a matter of which engineering compromise you're willing to make.  When I did backups, I preferred to do them straight to disk, but then I had several SATA <-> FC enclosures and several computers and would duplicate the images between the computers and the enclosures.  You're probably not looking at quite the same level of infrastructure to support your backups.  I've certainly seen LTO2 robots work very nicely.
If all your backing up is 100GB why bother with tapes?  you can buy external USB HDD for the price of an ultrim tape.
You've got three choices -- Older tape drive technology, newer tape drive technology, and disks.  Older tape drive technology would be LTO2.  Guess what, it's only available in SCSI.  Newer tape drives, such as LTO4, are much more expensive and mostly available in SAS.  Disks, well, they're disks.  Let's run the numbers:
Now -- you wouldn't use this as a raid.  You would mount each disk and format each disk individually, put individual filesystems on to these disks, and only keep the "active" disks inserted and mounted; the rest would not be plugged in or active in any way.  You'll want to make each backup to 2 different disk drives, or at least automate duplicating the backup image from one disk to the other.
