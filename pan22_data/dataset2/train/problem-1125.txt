As a bonus, setting things up in this layout means that your local traffic to eddings (from feist for example) will no longer go through the cable modem. Judging by the information you've given regarding throughput speeds, I'd guess that currently your traffic is not being routed via the internet, but that your cable modem is slower than your router, which is not unsurprising since in normal cases it only needs to bridge a slow internet connection with the intranet, not carry large volumes of intranet traffic.
Finally, if you use a dynamic DNS service (doesn't sound like it, but just in case) get your cable modem to run the update if its firmware allows it, otherwise, if eddings runs an update script, you may have to jump an additional hoop to get the actual public IP you've been assigned to submit to the DNS service.
One would be your normal public IP, the other IP would be on the same network as your workstation (192.168.1.0/24). If you have a second NIC (and give it 192.168.1.x) then you can plug that into a switch (LAN, not WAN) port of the Netgear. If you only have one NIC then we will need to configure proper routing in both the Cisco DPQ2935 and in the Netgear WNDR3700. 
You could move your server (eddings) to be connected to the router. Then set up your cable modem to have no firewall, and let the router do the fire walling. This is sometimes called 'passthrough mode', but I'm sure if you muck around in the cable modem's settings interface you'll find it. Basically this means any incoming connections from the internet get passed straight through the cable modem to the router.
