You didn't specify either way, but if you're running power, you really need to talk to your city or county inspectors.  They're typically very helpful to people who are trying to do things the right way.  They'd offer suggestions for low-voltage (data) lines as well.
We just purchased a building that is right next to our current building with a small gravel "road" in between (that we own). I'm looking to run some wire in a conduit underground to the other building. What type and size of conduit should I get, how deep should it be, and what other advice or tips can you give me?
When installing data lines between buildings, ground potential can be a serious problem. You could end up with a lot of burned up equipment if connected incorrectly.
Make sure you check with your local utilities to ensure you'r not going to cut into a 10,000 volt power line or crack open a sewage pipe.
I would suggest using optical isolation (fiber optic NIC or adapters), point-to-point wireless or hiring a professional.
