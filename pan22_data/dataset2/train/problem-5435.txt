Yes, it uses LDAP, but the website claims it can be setup in an hour. If you never 'see' the LDAP Server, it might be worth a try.
Private keys might be easier to keep synchronized if home directories were on a shared storage like NFS.  Automount can help with that, but you might run into issues if you have users working on both boxes at the same time.
This is by far the simplest solution, requiring only a bit of scriptage on each end to handle the sync, and provisioning of home directories etc. The downside is that it really doesn't scale gracefully, but for only a few systems this will be the path of least resistance.
NIS, NIS+, and as you mentioned, LDAP, are what do these on an enterprise scale.  But you're right that it's probably a lot more complexity than you want for a few servers.
Well, since everybody's posted all the reliable, scalable, right answers already, let me suggest instead what our shop does: sync your passwd/shadow/group files to your several systems from a reliable 'parent' system on which you do your account configuration.
