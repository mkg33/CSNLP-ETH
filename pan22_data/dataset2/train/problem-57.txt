It's a no-brainer for the common users, and allows some tweaking for advanced users. We're really liking how it takes backups ever when the laptop is out of the office, then transfers it all back to the backup server the next time the laptop is in the office.
i'm using unison over IPv6 (teredo).  That's because i syncronize between laptops and workstations (which get backed up with rsnapshot).  If i wanted to keep laptops separately from desktops, i'd use straight rnapshot
I've been happy with SpiderOak for my laptop backups.  Alternately, you could use JungleDisk or something like it to back them up to an S3 share that you control.
If you're looking to backup to an external service, then I've had good experiences using Carbonite. It's cheap, very simple, and works well.
I've also heard about companies using TSM and Symantec's NetBackup (with the Desktop/Laptop option), but I've not used it myself (small site, no budget, etc).
In general, you're probably looking for a networked backup scheme with a handy backup daemon that you can set and forget.  I think both of the previous meet that description.
If you're looking to backup to your own servers, it's somewhat more complex. I've used DeltaCopy, which is rsync based, but it's not hugely friendly for the users. However, if you add the folders that they need, then it should run automatically, and not cause any problems.
I have good experience with Mozy. It's a fire-and-forget solution, and it's easy enough to configure that most users can do it themselves. Works on both Windows and Mac.
It's probably a lot more solution than what you're looking for, but we just started using Microsoft's System Center Data Protection Manager 2010 to backup Laptop like you want.
