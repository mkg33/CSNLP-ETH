Those LDAP queries looks a lot like what happens when a domain member is trying desperately to find a domain controller.
You could perform the same testing with Firefox. Install the Firebug addon and see if the same result with regards to DNS is occuring. The NET tab will be able to display DNS query times for all elements. Be sure to flushdns (ipconfig /flushdns) between tests. Perhaps it's not IE8 and if not this might help you.
If I remember correctly, Wireshark doesn't show the process information involved in the packets captured. Can you install Microsoft Network Monitor 3.3 (which does show the processes) to see if it's actually IE8 or if it's another process issuing the DNS LDAP queries?
On the PC involved, can you switch the DNS server configuration from the local router to OpenDNS servers 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220, and see if the problem is resolved.
Why does it receive no answer?  It's a DNS Query, the lack of LDAP servers shouldn't stop your firewall/router/dns server/coffee maker from negatively responding to an SRV _LDAP lookup.  I bet if your DNS server properly responded to this query, IE8 (Or whatever process is actually making these requests) wouldn't have to retry for 15 seconds.
It sounds like the broadband router isn't handling the DNS requests correctly, though I'd think IE8 shouldn't be waiting that long for responses either.
