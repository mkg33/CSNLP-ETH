Since some have mentioned Graphviz, there is also dot2tex which converts Graphviz code into TikZ. This makes  using it within LaTeX (have mathematical expressions in labels etc.) and fine-tuning the appearance of the graph easier. You can even embed the Graphviz code directly in the TeX code (in a dot2tex environment) and have it run Graphviz automatically.
That said, I still tend to use Xfig for most illustrations in my papers... The possibility to embed arbitrary Latex code in your illustrations is often essential, and that's exactly where Xfig excels (at least until you need to deal with publishers who expect self-contained EPS files).
You can, of course, use any graphics program. I have found Creately and Dabbleboard very useful for graphs and the like.
Actually, OmniGraffle is Graphviz with a GUI (and much more). You can draw a graph (or import it from a file), then use a Graphiz-based layout engine to automatically layout the graph. You can tweak the parameters of the layout engine, and finally you can switch off automatic layout and fine-tune the placement of the nodes manually.
Apart from TikZ and graphviz I have made good use of my graphics tablet. You can get the new small Wacom Bamboo for 50€ (used) to 100€ (new). With a tablet you can create quite good looking images quickly; for anything but journal/conference/book publications -- depending on your skill, even then -- the results are very presentable.
