Don't give up just yet. This is probably caused by a bad connection between the display and the graphics adapter. RAM probably has nothing to do with the issue. I suggest you take the laptop apart and make sure the display connector is properly attached.
Had exact issue.. plugged into external display works fine. On lappy screen it's also ok once into windows.. replaced lvds cable from mobo to lcd panel and all fixed.
I know on a horizontal black screen at the bottom half of the screen, pushing the lower left side of the screen fixed it.  I also have read it could be the graphics driver.  Just reinstall the display driver and it might fix it.
Before you write off the system, consider powering down the laptop, removing the power connector and battery and removing the RAM (it's probably under a flap on the bottom), and then reseating it to see if the problem is related to poor contact or dust/contamination in the connector. Be aware that the RAM can be damaged by static electricity so ground/earth yourself by briefly touching a grounded metal pipe or ground point before starting work and avoid touching the contacts on the memory module/s.
Also, if you connect to an external display you might have a picture even when the laptop display goes all rainbowy.
