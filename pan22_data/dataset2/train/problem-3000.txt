Some files should not be readable by other users on the same machine, e.g. ~/.bash_history, ~/.ssh, ~/Mail, and so (based on what I have in my home directory that might actually matter)
copy/paste that into a terminal.  Don't worry about errors, I'm sure you don't have all the same dotfiles and directories I do.  (and I left out a lot of obscure ones that are really just game save directories, and could be publicly readable without harm.)  Generally, if you don't want your pr0n stash or any mention of it to show up in other users' locate results, or other searches, make sure your history files and so on are private.
Actually, hardly anything in your home directory should be executable, so I'd start with just find -type f (without -name), and then make things executable as necessary.  Maybe chmod to mode 664, if you ended up with everything mode 777, since you don't want world write permission on your files (or directories either).  So actually,
However, to address your root problem, it is impossible to correctly restore all the file permissions without a reference. If you have the space, you could create a virtual machine, install all the same packages (to find out how, search for dpkg get set selections) as your real machine, and then "copy" the permissions using chmod's --reference option.
