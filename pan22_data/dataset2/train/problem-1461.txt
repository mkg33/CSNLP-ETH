For IMAP and client-SMTP (143, 993, 587) you might have luck with creating SRV records for each service. They're similar in purpose but can tell the app which host and which port to use:
Note that only some programs care about SRV records. While the above _imap &c. examples are technically standard, they're still very rarely used by actual mail apps. (Practically the only widespread SRV users are Kerberos, LDAP, SIP, XMPP, and Minecraft.)
Some specific apps have their own mechanisms, though. For port 25 (server-SMTP), create a MX record that points to another domain. If the sending mailserver finds one, it will only use the servers listed in the MX record. (That's how nearly all domains redirect their mail to a dedicated 'mail' server or even to Google Mail.)
That's not something dnsmasq can do, because it's not something DNS itself can do. TCP ports only get involved after the address lookup has been done. Therefore, whichever one of your hosts example.com resolves to, must be able to handle all of those connections – possibly using a HTTP reverse proxy where possible, or yet another layer of port forwarding (iptables, pf redirect, &c.).
