In this case, all graphics (world, fire, ass, character) are given in SVG and are meant to be displayed as that, whereby the connection between physics and graphics is established by the use of R.U.B.E. I am searching for the most painless way of realization for the ass on fire.
Intentionally I am not posting any code, since I can imagine a solution based on each one of the methods mentioned above, this question is meant to issue the pros and cons, due to time and flexibility.
The character can jump, too. To visualize the impulse, which gives the »jump-power« some fire blow out of its very ass straight ahead, what should be animated, during its short visible time.
This character is on the one hand represented by a bunch of Box2D bodies and on the other hand, graphically, by a bunch of SVG-Elements. The character is a floating one, a kind of Hovercraft, basically based on this tutorial, but more sophisticated all in all.
Question: How to animate that bespoken fire? I could use plain css, or JavaScript, or even SVG-Animation Tags themself, BUT I would like to ask for the preferred weapon of choice, faced to the fact that time is running out (less than 3 days) AND flexibility needed for the customer?
