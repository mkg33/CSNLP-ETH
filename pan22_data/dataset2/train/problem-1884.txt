Per-port configuration is done in master.cf, not main.cf. The default Postfix configuration files already have good example settings, they just need to be uncommented. Port 587 is labelled as the submission port there (port 25 is of course smtp).
Your settings could be somewhat simplified. In main.cf, specify the default policy (for port 25) only as recipient_restrictions, nothing more than that is necessary:
Unfortunately I get this error when trying to send on port 587 with my mail client from a different IP address.
I understand that I need SMTP on port 25 to receive email, but I do not want this to be a relay port.
In master.cf, override it by removing the previously set restrictions and allowing unrestricted relaying for authenticated users:
I have set up Postfix to receive email, and authenticate users, but I am utterly confused about the difference between port 25 and 587, and how to use one for receiving and one for relaying.
Instead I would port 587 to be used for registered (SASL-authenticated) users to relay email from any IP address, through my server, and to any email server (e.g. GMail, Yahoo).
