Then I found out that all HTTP requests got processed correctly and as wished (!), as I saw in the log, but requests with HTTPS didn't get logged at all! So I assume that either the logging is not correctly configured OR (and that's what I fear) that requests over HTTPS do not even go through the mod_rewrite procedure. 
So the actual problem at hand right now is that everything over HTTP gets correctly rewritten, but when I have a request such as https://myurl.org/shop, I want it to be redirected to http://myurl.org/shop, because it is neither admin.php nor login.php.
I basically want the above behaviour for all pages except admin.php and login.php. Requests to those two pages should be redirected to the HTTPS part, whereas all other requests should be processed as specified above.
I've used the following .htaccess directive to enable some sort of Pretty URLs, and that worked fine. For example, http://myurl.com/shop would be redirected to http://myurl.com/index.php/shop, and that was well working (note that stuff such as myurl.com/css/mycss.css) does not get redirected:
I entered the RewriteLog and RewriteLogLevel directives in the global Server configuration (which should apply to HTTP AND HTTPS, right?). 
I know it has something to do with rules overwriting each other, but I am not sure since my knowledge of Apache is quite limited. How could I fix this apparently not that difficult problem, and how could I make my .htaccess more compact and elegant? 
I have come up with the following .htaccess, but it does not work. htps://myurl.com/shop does not get redirected to htp://myurl.com/index.php/shop, and htp://myurl.com/admin.php does not get redirected to htps://myurl.com/admin.php.
