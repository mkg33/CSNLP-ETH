After installing fedora and Centos and other OS now I have them all showing in my Boot menu [F2] on start up not the menu form the OS even after deleting them and reinstaling other OS - Ubuntu -so It just shows one when the OS starts but when I go to UEFI setting I still find all the old ones they instruct you to use DEL to take them out but that does not work
Be aware that in any of these cases, you may have leftover files on your EFI System Partition (ESP). You can delete them through normal file-manipulation commands, although depending on your OS, you may need to explicitly mount the ESP. If they aren't referenced, the files won't do any real harm, unless they consume so much space that they prevent you from installing another OS or updating your boot manager. The files will normally be stored in subdirectories of the EFI directory on the ESP; most OSes create subdirectories named after themselves or the companies that create them, such as EFI/ubuntu for Ubuntu or EFI/Microsoft for Windows.
The menu to which you refer is the firmware's built-in boot manager. Its entries are stored in NVRAM, and can be edited by any number of tools in various environments:
