This is for a database (Postgre) VM, whose data is stored on a separate EBS volume. Can I make it so that the same EBS volume is mounted automatically (this is assuming that no other instance is using that EBS). 
so you know that the device is xvdf1 (it may be sdf1 or something like this) the second entry is where you want it mounted, the third entry is the filesystem type (which you can see as the second entry in the df -T command) and if you don't understand fstab, it's probably best to leave it as defaults and 0 0
Might be better would be to create volume from snapshot during boot instead of attaching specific volume. This is more flexible - you could launch your instance in another availability zone and you won't get conflicts with existing instance. Also with new Snapshot Copy feature - http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/12/17/announcing-ebs-snapshot-copy/ - you could copy snapshot and launch instance even in another AWS region. And finally by doing snapshot you will do backups of your data which is must-have in the cloud...
something like this, although it is possible it will vary from this. you can man fstab for more information
