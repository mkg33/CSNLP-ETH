I ended up using SteelEye's Data Replication and High Availability suite. They have version fro Windows and Linux (which wasn't a requirement). The Data Replication protion allowed for block level replication (Synchronous or Asynchronous). The High Availability portion allowed services to be switched over from once server to another.
We use MirrorFolder for this.  It's file level, but it's affordable ($40) and easy to configure and use.  We use it on server doing site to site backups of about 250GB.  It manages differentials and gives you logs of progress.  Good luck!
I implement this by running Windows in a Xen VM under Linux (CentOS) and using DRBD to mirror the VM's disk images. Okay, so it's an extra level to figure out, but it is free and gives you the flexibility to start adding further VMs to your machine. I also use Linux LVM to make easily resizeable disk volumes to use as VM disks. Hardware wise, other than two machines there's not really anything else necessary, although an extra network card per machine dedicated to DRBD is always handy.
VVR is an option. I've also designed solutions where the critical data sits on a SAN and can simply be remounted on a different server if the server goes down. 
DoubleTake is a common one for applications that don't have much disaster recovery capabilities built in.
I'd like to mirror a drive between two windows servers for fail over/disaster recovery. I assume there is a software package for this. What do you use?
Veritas Volume Replicator is a really slick enterprise-quality one.  I've seen that used with Microsoft Exchange, for example, to replicate data between two different SANs.
