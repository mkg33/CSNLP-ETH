Using mstsc /v server01 /admin logs you on with a Admin Console, and does not consult the broker database. Only administrators of the server can connect using the /admin option.
You have two servers - server01 and server02 - which are part of a RDS Farm. One of them (or a totally separate server) is a broker. When you connect to either server01 or server02, the server you are connecting to first has you log on, then consults the broker database to find if you already have a session on one of the two servers, if so, it sends you to that server. If not, it sends you to the "least busy" server (If I remember right, it's by # of users).
That's why you get this. The bar at the top of the RDP window shows the name you use in initiating the connection. 
If you had a DNS entry called "rdp" for example, and that was pointing to either one of your server, or a round robin DNS entry with both, or point it to your broker, then you would see "rdp" in the bar, regardless of whether you have a session on server01 or server02.
Sounds a bit like a DNS issue.  Are the DNS entries for the servers Static, or Dynamic ?  Do you have an alias in place, re-directing the first server to the second ?
