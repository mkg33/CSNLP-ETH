On an administrational decision it's not that important regarding size, with a 500GB disk you are nowhere near the limits of any filesystem (except FAT as David Schmitt pointed out). Do not consider NTFS, it may have read support but using NTFS under linux is just plain wrong.
On ext3, there is always a portion of the disk hidden (5%). This is for when a root drive get's swamped, you can still log in at runlevel 1 to remove some data. On an external hard drive, you can switch this to 1% (to be safe):
If you are using selinux or any other system that makes use of extended attributes or ACLs, make sure that your backup media is formatted using a file system that can back up those very same attributes or ACLs.
I'd go with ext3, hands down. I've heard that ext4 isn't that stable yet (don't shoot me if I'm wrong) it's got journalling, so unclean disconnects shouldn't be a problem.
I'd still stay with ext3 is is well tested and has the largst toolset available in case someting happens to your data.
