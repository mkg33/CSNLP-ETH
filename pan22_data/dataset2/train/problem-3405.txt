I think you want something like Monit or God here to automatically restart services when they stop/crash.  Your description of the crash itself would suggest the OOM Killer, which can be avoided by configuring some swap space on the host.
I found the answer myself: the simplest way to achieve that is to add the following two lines at the end of the upstart script installed by MongoDB (/etc/init/mongodb.conf):
You could use Supervisord, this tool can restart anything you need and it is very simple to configure.
In the unlucky case you can't reach an answer, you could brute force your system: I'd check regularly via a script if the mongod PID file exists, it should be stored somewhere in /var/run, if not, service mongod start.
I am running MongoDB on an Ubuntu server. It's using an upstart script to start mongod when the machine boots. I noticed that if the process crashes, it doesn't get restarted.
This will try to restart the process if it terminates, and stop if it crashes more than 10 times in 90 seconds.
First of all, you should understand why the system service crashes. Lack of memory? Bugged libs? Wrong or not updated package? Your software using MongoDB is not working properly?
