Some PDUs only monitor down to the circuit which will still allow you to localize servers with high power consumption. Some of the newer PDUs allow monitoring all the way down to the outlet. 
From what I know, a typical Datacenter spends more then 50% of it's energy budget on cooling. Computers generate heat, which then needs to be cooled by energy-intensive methods. Heat is one of the primary drivers of energy cost. Nearly every major air-handling vendor offers equipment which allows the company to monitor the power consumption.
Footnote 1: PDUs are fancy power strips. Some people, especially electrical contractors, use the term "PDU" to refer to the big box which distributes power from the mains or the UPS.
Use PDUs [See footnote 1] that provide metering capabilities, such as these Metered Rack PDUs from APC. Monitor the PDU using software-- APC provides software which allows continuous power monitoring, and there are other options. Your best bet is to monitor power consumption trends over time.
Really, there is an entire industry out there which can help you monitor power consumption in your datacenter.
