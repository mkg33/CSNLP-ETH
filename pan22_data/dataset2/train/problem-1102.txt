I'm looking for preferably free/open source solution for booting from network. What I need to do is:
I agree with the PXE-boot suggestion, but also check out GPXE if you have compatible NICs.  It will allow for additional config options such as HTTP or iSCSI.  
I tried something like this a long time ago, but my knowledge then was very limited and I couldn't get it to work. I think there are several network boot managers, but what I tried was PXELINUX.
If you make it work, it would be nice if you share it with us, as it's a very useful technique, IMHO.
Check out FOG. It has a built-in PXE server. It's also comes with a virtual appliance you can download and be up and running in minutes.
What I'm trying to achieve is that the only thing I need to do in order to run the disk cloning software is to put a file into a special folder on the server. I have to manage 50 computers in an internet cafe, and running the disk cloning tool from a thumb drive is a real pain.
I was thinking about a lightweight linux distribution, but my knowledge is very limited when it comes to linux.
If you are looking for a tool that helps you easily build a boot environment you may want to look at the Linux terminal server project (LTSP).  While this tool is generally aimed at building a boot environment for allowing thin-clients to connect to terminal server of some sort, it is pretty easy to modify the environment to accomplish other things as well.
