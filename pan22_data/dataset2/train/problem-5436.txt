I have beaten this lesson into plenty of new recruits by now, but many new in the field doesn't quite understand how important it is. From this simple rule comes the philosphy when working as a sysadmin:
Great, you deleted something, somewhere, as some user, on some system. I have the same alert, and I'd like to know how you fixed it last time.
Hostname changed :-) Now I know everything except what you deleted, but at least I know where to look.
I have a bad habit of getting frustrated enough at the security "fixes" in Windows that I'll blindly add sites to a trusted site list or lower security enough that IE8/XP/Vista/etc. stops pestering me while I'm trying to get something done and I'm fairly sure I'm going to the right place and downloading the right file. I know it's supposed to make you more secure to rethink your actions, but quite frankly, click click click click makes me nuts nuts nuts and eventually the warnings all blur together until I don't pay attention to site certificate errors (it's our own self-signed, right?...well, probably...) and other times it's asking me stupid things that should have been enabled by default (yes, I really did mean to go to Windows Update, and I do want security settings to allow Microsoft's own update site to run, thank you...)
Applying vendor updates the instant they become available.  Wait a few hours and google the patch's name to avoid being the one submitting the horror stories.
Perhaps not a true habit but how about habitually expecting senior managers to have and/or use a brain? Or believing programmers have a basic understanding of the machine and OS they're programming for?
Is it a bad habit to give in to user requests (demands?) that lower security for the sake of their own convenience?
I think most of the bad behaviours of sysadmins is due to the fact that they forget the golden rule:
