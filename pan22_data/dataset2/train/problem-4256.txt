But as useful as it is for thinking about things, as much as it's used to program and process data, don't forget that in the end, in the words of Monty Python, "It's only a model."
When it hits my firewall, for example, the firewall peels back all the way to Layer 4 to check the TCP ports against my ACLs.
The OSI Model layers are more for thinking about things. It may--or may not--necessarily be happening precisely. Some things happen on multiple layers. One kind of "thinking about things" is programming. In vague, general terms, each layer is handled independently and assumes that the layers below/above it are functioning properly.
I understand that data passes down through the OSI model and then at the physical layer is transported as bits across the networkcables. But I'm confused at exactly where the layers are happening (in the PC, in the router etc ?). Does the processes at layers 7-2 happen in a PC before the data goes out on the cables as per layer 1? That doesn't sound right, as I know switches operate at layer 2 and routers at layer 3. But then wouldn't the data have already needed to go out on the cables to get to the switch or router? Thanks :-)
It then re-wraps the data down to Layer 1--and if I'm doing NAT/PAT, it even (gasp) modifies that data!!--and hammers that onto the wire to the next device, which may dig deeper, or not as deep.
