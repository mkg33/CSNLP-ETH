When you make a virtual network device (which you're doing on your windows PC), you should set its MAC address to be different from the physical network card.  If they both make DHCP requests, they should be treated as two different machines, and each be given separate IP addresses.  If you set up your DHCP server (on your linux machine) to reserve IP addresses to either of them, or both of them, then you can specify what addresses each interface will receive.
For example, is it possible to set up a virtual interface that piggy-backs onto the first interface and gets its own configuration?
Is it possible to configure dhcpd (on a Linux box) to assign a Windows PC 2 separate IP configurations?  Right now I've configured the two IP addresses manually and it does exactly what's needed, but I can't figure out how to achieve the same thing with DHCP.
Alternatively, is it possible to run a script upon getting IP values from DHCP that would then be able to configure the secondary IP?
In general, DHCP servers aren't aware of the physical layer, but the DHCP request made includes the mac address of the requesting interface.  Because this is a field in the packet which is volunteered by the DHCP protocol, rather than being automatically attached by the physical network device, you should be able to get this working simply by creating a virtual network device, and setting its MAC address (sometimes referred to as MAC address spoofing).
