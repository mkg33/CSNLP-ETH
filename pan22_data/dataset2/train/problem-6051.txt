Another helpful method for recovering deleted tables data in SQL Server is to use fn_dblog() function. 
however the method of recovering data by using fn_dblog() function is too long, but it can be helpful for viewing the deleted records of a table.  
The limitation of both tools while in trial is that they recover only 1 out of 10 transactions. The good news is that ApexSQL Log shows all the records in the grid even in trial, so you can see the records that can be recovered. The limitation is that you cannot create the undo script for all of them until you license the tool
A few people have mentioned 3rd party tools.  The only one I have personally had any luck with for transaction log playback is Toad by Quest.  It's not very cheap but if it's important it's a life saver.  We had some poorly written web apps that were attacked by SQL injections and ruined some old DBs.  The attack wasnt really a problem but we wanted to see what code they were executing and so being able to read back the T-LOG was amazingly convenient.
If you have backups then you follow the procedure described in How to retrieve a specific table or rows from database backups or transaction log backups in SQL Server:
As Joe Stefanelli said, ApexSQL tools can help. There are actually two tools - if the whole table was dropped - ApexSQL Recover. If only the table records are deleted, both ApexSQL Log and ApexSQL Recover can help. 
If you don't have a good backup, you could give a 3rd party tool like ApexSQL Log a try. I don't know what the limitations on the free trial version are, but it might be worth a shot.
The tools can bring back the data even if you don't have a full or differential database backup as they read the data (MDF) file (ApexSQL Recover) and transaction log (LDF and trn - online, detached, backups - ApexSQL Log)
