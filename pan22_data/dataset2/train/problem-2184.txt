tracert(or ping) my.external.ip.address returns "Destination host unreachable" (if I used IF 1 it returns "general failure"), but if I tracert or ping 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.1.106 both reply just fine.
I have looked at the very least at 8 pages of super user questions, And loads more pages of google, and I'm still stumped. Any input is appreciated.
Am I doing something wrong? Is route add not the right way to do this? Using the command at least redirects the IP to somewhere. It just fails to connect..
I'm trying to use route add to redirect connection attempts for an external IP to an internal IP (the loopback IP, my network adapter's IP, either works). I've tried using the following commands to redirect my IP.
Now, both of these commands say "Ok!" and work just fine. My problem is that if I try to use a program that connects to my.external.ip.address, the destination host is unreachable.
IF 1 is my loopback interface, otherwise the command assumes to use my default network interface. (according to route print -4)
