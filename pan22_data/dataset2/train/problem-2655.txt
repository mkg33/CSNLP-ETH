I doubt as there are any. I have always been quite successful installing python 3000 from source and running it so you would probably be ok doing that its quite nice and easy - that way you can also run multiple versions of python at the same time in order to maintain compatibility with any older scripts you may be running. Just remember that centos isn't really designed for new and emerging technologies so it will be a long time before python 3 comes into the official repos.
I see lots of Python packages for RHEL 5, but I did not spend the time to see if 3.0 is in there as I could not quite figure out the search fast enough.  
One of the neat things Novell got when they bought SUSE was the Autobuild model.  I am told it is a reasonably large cluster of devices (in the hundreds, last I asked) that recompiles most anything for all the platforms they officially support.  (x86, x86_64, IA64, IBM mainframe hardware, PowerPC, etc).
Please note that many of the tools redhat ships rely on python, so you're probably better off building from source and installing in /usr/local/ or using a bleeding edge release like Fedora 11.
You can try package from ActiveState http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads. It doesn't depend on package manager (just unpack and run "install.sh").
