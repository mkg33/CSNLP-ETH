When I convert a 20 second clip 3 minutes into the movie, to mpeg2video at 24 fps (using the flag -r 24), I get a smooth movie, except for one of the first frames which is a duplicate.  However, when I first try to copy the same clip into a separate file, and then try to convert this to mpeg2video, I get a staccato movement of a few frames, then a dupe, then some more frames, a dupe, etc. etc., with seemingly random numgers of frames between the dupes.  So - the same clip, but smooth in the first case, and staccato in the second!
The original material is a film. It seems to be shot in 24 fps, because the stream seems to consist of a series of 4 frames followed by one duplicate, and then over again. 4 frames, 1 dupe, 4 frames, 1 dupe, 4 frames, 1 dupe, etc.,
However, when I use ffmpeg to convert the exact same file to x264, I get the same staccato movement for about 30 frames, and then the movement becomes totally smooth!
There's the specific issue at hand, for which you can use the select filter, or the general problem, of removing duplicate frames present in an unknown pattern introduced during the telecine process.
Is there some way of specifically telling ffmpeg to only use 4 frames, then to skip one, and looping this all through the movie?
