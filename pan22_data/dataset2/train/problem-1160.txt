My computer crashed while running an old game not really meant for Windows 7. After every unexpected shutdown, I run sfc /scannow and this time it came back with errors. A long log, 12000 lines of basically nonsense. While looking into it, I discovered DISM and that there is a shim for it to work on Win7. I run dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /scanhealth and it produces this log (much shorter than sfc):
The errors you are seeing in the SURT log are nothing to worry about, and only occur because that version of SURT didn't know about the IE10 packages and therefore flags them as corrupt. Don't try and repair them because they're not actually corrupt! I suspect if you download the latest version from here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/what-is-the-system-update-readiness-tool, you won't see the errors any more.
The lines you see in the log are actually due to an old bug in the SURT and its incompatibility with IE10/IE11 (in your case IE10). This has been fixed in the later builds of SURT, so you may be running an older version.
Is this the latest version of the SURT tool? I suspect not since you used a shim to get DISM to produce that log in Windows 7 when it doesn't naturally support that. The SURT (System Update Readiness Tool) is the Windows 7 alternative.
Since this is on Win7, I can't run /RestoreHealth to have it fix any problems. It seems like all I need to do is rename these files to include the word neutral in the proper places but I absolutely do not want to do that myself.
The system seems fine and stable but I'd still like to fix these issues. Is there maybe a place I can get the cat/mum files to aid in the repair of these issues? Maybe a different command? Maybe boot a Windows CD and do something with the Recovery Console? I'm open to anything.
