We have database servers running on MySQL and Microsoft SQL. Is there a software that can do automated backups to all our database servers?
If there's a way to command MSSQL like that remotely, then the same strategy would work for it, too.
I've already evaluated zrm of mysql(no web access,hard to configure), bacula(only on mysql), and navicat(I like the well-designed GUI but it doesn't support ms sql). What are other tools out there?
SQL Server is easy - backup / restore is done via SQL commands. So, at the end you take a live backup, then copy the file over, OR install a local agend.
BackupPC can execute pre-backup commands and post-backup commands. That makes it possible to backup MySQL: first just execute mysqldump (or whatever you use), then let BackupPC to backup the dump, and as a post-command remove the dump. 
Pretty much EVERY (!) enterprise backup software can handle multiple datbase types and srvers. Go out and get one / some for evaluation. Offers are out from Microsoft, CA, Symantec and maybe a dozen others.
