I'd like to re-package this somehow into an RPM package (ideally that I can throw onto a self-hosted yum repository) in order to keep these "cluster" machines both up to date and consistent. I could do 7 manual installations, but there's scope for error. As I understand it, I'll need to accomplish the following tasks:
