It might be worth weighing the benefit of running on a multi-user system where the users have system level access but wouldn't by default due to information disclosure.
I haven't seen a mail server running identd for a long time.  It doesn't mean much on Windows, and few Unix admins accept the resulting risks.  I haven't logged probes to the port for a while, but last time I did, there weren't enough to indicate it was being used.  Some firewall still reject packets on the port rather than drop them, just in case.
Besides that, mail servers might give you a lower spam score if there is a valid identd response. Especially when sending newsletters etc. everything that lowers spam ratings is good.
The days of finger or ident are long since past.  They belong in the protocol dustbin with gopher and rlogin.
I don't run an ident daemon ever anymore.  I wouldn't consider it part of any e-Mail delivery best practices.
Additionally, running identd has no real security implications - someone else can never know if the ident response contains a real or a spoofed username.
