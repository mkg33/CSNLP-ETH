I am not sure what is going wrong, although I have altered my source.list file as I was upgrading GCC to 4.8 and here is my source file.
This package hasn't got any .deb files in the repositories, but (as apt-get said) some other packages refer to it.
My ultimate goal is to try and install the unqlite python module however, I get an error saying that python.h is not found or is not in directory, so I decided to google around and found that I had to install python-dev however this did not work
I see that you are mixing major distribution versions, i.e. your listing has both Raspbian 7.x (Wheezy) and 8.x (Jessie) in your sources.list files.  That does not sound good to me - I would suggest that you choose one (probably Jessie) and then use dpk-query -l | grep "deb7" to identify packages that are probably specific to Wheezy and carefully try to remove/upgrade them to "deb8" ones.
Also, your apt-get output says that another package replaces it. Install python package (sudo apt-get install python).
After this you can install unqlite or any other module with pip. Pip is like apt-get for python. pip install unqlite
For this aptitude may be more helpful than apt-get because it will tell you if multiple versions of a package is available and allow you to choose which to install - and work out if it is possible with the addition or removal of others.  The only niggle with aptitude in its default interactive mode is the ncurses (text) UI which may take some getting use to if you are not familiar with it.
