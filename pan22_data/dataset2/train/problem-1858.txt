Yes. This sort of thing is just part of the "background noise" of having an internet-connected system.
If a server's IP is accessible to the internet, it'll see attacks. Worms etc. crawl the publicly available IP space for victims, and on a VPS host there's a good chance your IP was another known server until recently.
As your server is cpanel server and by default it provides Brute Force Protection. Have you enabled "cPHulk" on your server, it protect your server from brute force. For more details you    can read this http://docs.cpanel.net/twiki/bin/view/AllDocumentation/WHMDocs/CPHulk
Disable root login via ssh and turn off password authentication in your sshd_config (using key auth instead), and you should be sufficiently safe from brute force attacks.
Lots of software calls home with the IP Address then people get their hands on the information and try and hack into the servers. This is fairly common I would contact your hosting provider and ask for assistance.
Yes, it's typical. Basically any system in the internet is constantly under some kind of attack. Usually, it's just considered background noise unless you have a large number of attempts.
