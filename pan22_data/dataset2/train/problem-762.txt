Some corporates may have applications that are specially tuned to one OS and there may be a risk or high cost in migrating to another OS platform.
All Linux/UNIX systems for the serious production are commercial, the software vendors like to make a big software (i.e. Oracle) for the predictable OSes. Vendors of the free systems can't ensure the predictability and a backward compatibility.
Some companies will prefer to stay with a 'known' name, especially if they have legacy systems with the supplier and the supplier has significant expertise in maintaining or migrating from one OS to another within their portfolio.
There may be technical features that are only available in one specific OS or the company may prefer specific branded hardware that restricts their choice of OS.
There may be issues of commercialisation where a corporate feels 'safer' with a big-name company holding their hand for a licence fee (although the likes of Red Hat etc. could counter this argument for Linux).
