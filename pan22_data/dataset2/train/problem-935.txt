Here's the problem in a nutshell.  We need to backup some SVN repositories, Samba shares, /home directories, postgresql nightly backups, etc.  But the results are going to be written out to external USB drives (which are rotated weekly).
Mounting the USB drives is not a problem (autofs works well for this), and encrypting the drive with LUKS also works flawlessly.  Currently we use rdiff-backup to backup the source files to a central server (total backup size is 800GB), then rsync the results out to the USB drive each night.  This works very well, even though USB drives are slow, because only a small portion of the 800GB changes each day.
Although we like rdiff-backup + rsync, we worry a lot that the rdiff-backup directory is fragile for anything other then the latest revision.  Because older revisions inside the backup are done as a series of diffs and if one of those gets corrupted, you lose all older history.
There are two options in the rsnapshot configuration to customize it called rsync_short_args or rsync_long_args. The default behaviour can be changed this way:
As local filesystem snapshots are handled by the rsync tool you need to customize rsync settings. By default, it uses "-a" argument which includes preserve owners/groups/permissions but not ACLs. If you want to preserve ACLs you need to pass it additional argument "-A".
