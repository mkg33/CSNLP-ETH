On the above is where the problem lies. The uplink should be ~10Mbit, not 2.4Mbit. Below, you can see that UDP is working fine.
The OSX behind the linux router seems to be unaffected by the problems at the linux router. How can this happen? UDP works fine, too.
I found the solution to the problem. All I had to do was turn off segmentation offloading on the network card:
As you can see, the linux box is stuck at 2.5Mbit/s outbound TCP. UDP works fine, and the workstation behind the router works fine.
To simplify the situation, I modified my Shorewall TC to a very basic level. I also tried turning TC off alltogether from shorewall without any effect. :
Now, I have a Debian squeeze linux box acting as a home NAS and router. It's running shorewall, with NAT and tc enabled. I also have an OSX workstation connected via a switch to said linux router:
Yesterday I got a new and shiny VDSL2 connection home! It's specced at 100Mbit/10Mbit, and seems to deliver pretty close to the mark.
Do you have any idea where the problem might be? The only non-default thing I'm running on Debian is a 3.2.0 kernel from backports. The box is a powerful Xeon machine with lots of RAM and Intel network cards. All the tests were done in a short timeframe with practically no other network traffic. And repeated multiple times. Where could I start debugging?
