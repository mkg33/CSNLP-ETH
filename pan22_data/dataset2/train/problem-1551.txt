All the manuals are available here: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/index.htm. Read the installation guide, specifically.  If you want to install Oracle DB yourself, there's lots you can do without reading it, but you'll achieve more if you do.
You can install RAC in VMs, not a problem.  Have a look at this as an example: https://martincarstenbach.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/rac-attack-using-virtualbox.pdf
To answer some of your questions, firstly read this: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/index.html and this http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/licenses/standard-license-152015.html.  These are your licencing restrictions.
As to distributions, that's totally up to you.  Obviously Oracle Linux is a good place to start, but have a look at the supported platforms lists.  Personally I like RHEL/CentOS/OL, but that's just what I've most experience with.
I don't recommend using "pre-built" virtual machines - try to install OS and db from scratch. The process is the same as installing on "real" hardware. Use CentOS as mentioned in comments.
Im starting like a Oracle DBA, and I want play with the database and your administration task in a test enviroment.
