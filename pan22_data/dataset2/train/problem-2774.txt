Send To Dropbox gives you a unique e-mail address. Any attachments sent to that address are added to your Dropbox.
However, you should have a pretty good anti-virus (Like Avast? No ad intended.) installed since they can upload virtually anything. (Except if you specify that stuff too in your php script.)
Dropbox Forms is a service of JotForm that allows you to create forms to embed (nearly) anywhere that people can use to upload files to your Dropbox.
I'm thinking about having a webserver (like XAMPP/LAMP) installed on your PC, and the folder is accessible on the web.  
MailDrop monitors your e-mail client (for a keyword or a specific folder) and, when triggered, uploads any attachments to Dropbox. 
Dropbox Uploader lets other people upload files to your Dropbox (if you have your own website and can run PHP).
Then you can simply use a html/php script to protect the folders (for each contributor) with password, and as soon as they upload stuff, you sync them. (and they get avaliable on Dropbox.)  
Choose a username and link dbinbox to your dropbox account. You can set an access code. Non-dropbox users can then upload files via the custom link 'http://dbinbox.com/USERNAME'
