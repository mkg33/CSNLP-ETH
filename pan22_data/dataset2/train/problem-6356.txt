After installing multiple older versions of dotnet and reparing my VS2019 install, I was finally able to fix it by adding C:\Program Files\dotnet\ to my path. Then VS2019 would load the project again.
Although netcore SDK version 2.1.801 is installed, it's not used because it doesn't match the Patch number. 
Also, none of this affected VS2017, which could load and fully work with the project. And it worked on the command line when I specified the full path to the dotnet executable.
stick a global.json file at the root of the soloution with the version that you need, it needs to contain all the digits. This is the latest version at the time of writting
It looks like each version of Visual Studio has it's own corresponding dotnet version that it builds on. This is due to msbuild requirements.
I had this problem because I uninstalled some older dotnet SDKs. Not only would VS2019 no longer load dotnet core projects, but dotnet was no longer available on my path and so not available on the command line as simply dotnet.
As detailed on that page, you'll need the following versions of dotnet for each visual studio version:
I found a file global.json in the folder: c:\Users\admin    (my login user is admin) that point to uninstalled version 2.1.602
I had the same error a while back which caused my web api projects to fail during the solution loading process.
