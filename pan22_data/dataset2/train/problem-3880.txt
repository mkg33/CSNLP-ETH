Actually - I also use one myself. And the modmypi.com website even sells a special adapter for them. I think as long as it is large enough and at least a class 6 (don't quote me on that part) it should work.
As products that use this media became smaller,for example action sports camera's and suchlike..,then the SD card required, also became smaller...The adapter just means that you can use both types in older or different types of devices, or in your computers, or Standard SD ( full size card readers ) Just my opinion anyway........
Now the Pi isn't a £1 card reader, but the same issues may apply - the more connectors you have, the higher chance you have of pushing it over the edge in high speed modes.  If you look at dmesg and see SD command errors, that's where you'll see problems if they occur.  It's more likely if you're thrashing the card (eg using as swap) rather than people who just use them for moving photos about.
I have read somewhere that I should not use a Micro-SD card (with an adapter) for the main storage & OS boot of my Raspberry Pi. Is it true? Why?
In some cases, the signal integrity of SD cards can be marginal - the signals have to come off the SoC, down the PCB traces, through the socket, and into the SD card.  SD cards, especially fast cards, can be clocked at up to 100MHz.  MicroSD adaptors are often designed to be as cheap as possible, and may make the signal integrity worse.  For example, I have a £1 USB card reader that will read MicroSD in its own dedicated MicroSD slot, but not in an adaptor in the normal SD slot (which reads full SD cards just fine).  If you open up an adaptor, you find it's just a series of metal pins in plastic - no shielding or any other signal protection.
