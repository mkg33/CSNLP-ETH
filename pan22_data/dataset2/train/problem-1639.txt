I prefer tape to disk for a number of reasons: it's simple, easily transportable, long lasting, and extremely cheap per GB by comparison.  It also answers the question of "how do you backup the backup server?" rather easily (if you're not doing this you don't have viable backups, by the way - what happens if you lose your backup server?)  A lot of people have bad experiences with tape, but investing in a good library from a specialist manufacturer can solve all of that.
You should be backing up, at least recent data, to RAIDed solution, if it's not going to an off-site location.
Unfortunately the answer for you depends on your situation and scope of backup project. At my company we are quite large and backups are deemed crucial so we use a Netapp solution.
My concern is that it's a single hard drive you're backing up to, what happens if some data is corrupted or deleted and it takes a few days to spot? at that point you may not have a copy.
Backups need to go offsite at some point, or at least to a separate fire zone; otherwise what happens if you lose the building?
I would agree with you and shy away from a hard drive to hard drive backup though just over USB. I would consider having a backup server if possible and large storage space so that you can go as far back as needed.
One system a server admin I worked with used was an Apple Xserv RAID. Very easy to implement and not too costly. It scales nicely and since its Java based, can be managed by any OS. So OSX is not needed for the front end management.
There's literally zero wrong with going from disk to disk, data on tapes generally lasts longer than on disks but we're talking years or decades not the timescale I imagine you're concerned with.
No one cares about backups, everyone cares about restores. Test your backups, make sure you know how to restore, and without the server that made them. Test every so often.
