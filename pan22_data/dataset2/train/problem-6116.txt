I would highly recommend switching to Quicksilver or Alfred. Both are free. Quicksilver is still in beta, but don't let that scare you off; I've had virtually no problems at all. The only time I did have a problem was when I had a lot of applications open, and QS froze. I still keep Spotlight just in case QS freezes again. Hope this helps!
If this is too drastic, you may want to clear out Spotlight's .Spotlight-V100 file at the root of your drive to force reindexing. Once reindexed, you might see better performance (and you might not).
Actually, you just need to use an alternate interface to Spotlight. HoudahSpot allows you to search by any criteria of your liking. E.g. search by file name only.
Since this is already off the announced topic, you should try Google Desktop or quick search box, depending on your OSX version. It's been a good alternative to search for files on desktops for a long time already, including linux and specially on Windows.
Rather than using spotlight, do your search in the upper right hand corner of a finder window. That'll search only file names.
As far as I know, Spotlight is hardcoded to work this way. Most people in your situation simply disable spotlight, and use an alternative, like EasyFind.
