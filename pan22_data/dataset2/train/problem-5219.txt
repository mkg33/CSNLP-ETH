I'm imagining a cellular modem is one option. What's the price range for these? Is anybody using them and feel that they are worth the cost? I'm imagining that it's something we would end up sending an emergency page ~ 1x/month at most, so I'd like the pricing to reflect that--I don't mind a high per-page cost as long as it has a low recurring cost.
Currently, we run Nagios on a Linux VM on a Windows 2008 Hyper-V host. It would be great if the solution would work in that environment, but I know it's tricky with external devices, and we could move Nagios to a standalone workstation if needed.
What is the best option for remote paging when network services are down? I'm looking for a solution that can let me know when network services are down during off-hours only, and especially when email/smtp services are out. Therefore, it needs to be redundant to our network and power supply.
Another option would be to expose at least one server to remote ping, and run a check script on a remote server. Are there paid options for this?
I've been using a serial-attached GSM modem with Nagios for a while; really any phone(-like thing) should work (as long as it presents as a serial port), but I'd imagine the industrial modems are more reliable, and since mine has an external antenna, gets better signal inside my datacenter. (Older EDGE/GPRS usb-dongles seem to be cheap, but I haven't tried any. There's probably also room there for double-duty if you get one with a data plan as an out-of-band management path.)
