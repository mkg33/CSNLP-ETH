I doubt the load analysis needs the commands to be started within milliseconds of each other, what is more useful is timing the actual execution.
So here is what i want to do. I have a perlScript.pl and a list of machines: machineA,machineB,machineC. These are linux machines that i can ssh into. I want to issue this script on all 3 of these machines at the same time. I am trying to do some load analysis and need to measure the time it takes for the scripts to execute. 
If you have 20,50,100 machines, then sure, use dsh,pssh,cluster-ssh/terminator/whatever.. but 3? just copy the command, open 3 windows, and hit paste 3 times.
Has anyone heard about puppet?? iff all the client are open system then puppet will help you a lot. Look at redectivelab website for details.
With that tool you can manage actually hell lot of things. We use it to maintain plethora of servers for the same kind of configuration.
you cand find different ssh clients on the net which connect to multiple clients at the same time, so you can execute commands at the same time. one of these clients is cluster ssh. you could give it a try or search for an other client on the net.
