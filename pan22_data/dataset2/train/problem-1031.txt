It looks like you are trying to find the value of cell in the rng2.Cells. It might be quicker to use the Find method:
Another alternative is to use a Dictionary to store the rng2 values as the keys and the column numbers as the value. You'll need to go into Tools -> References and select the Microsoft Scripting Runtime to use early binding. Your code might then become this:
That way you only loop through the headers if the cell value isn't 0, instead of looking at every header for every cell no matter its value, then checking to see if it's a cell you're interested in.
This method might leave you with blank cells though. Are you able to pre-fill all the cells with zero? Use something like before you start the For Each cell... loop:
You could also consider writing the data to an array before processing, as one big thing that slows VBA is the constant referring to and from a worksheet, but this is a slightly longer winded fix.
Which will break the immediate for loop and stop you double checking over and over again if you've already found it.
