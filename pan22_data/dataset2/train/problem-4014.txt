There's a lot of companies out there that send bulk emails, so I'd be inclined to shop around (or re-negotiate fees) before investing time & resources into building up and supporting your own MTA solution. 
Unless your company is in the business of sending emails, then I would only look at this as a last resort. 
Running a server on an address range assigned to you will gain a much higher rep than on a hosted server. The also simplifies the process of setting up PTR records (also boost your rep).
I suggest to not lose the emails, to start testing your new MTA with a small amount of emails. When you are satisfied, you can use it for all you emails.
But, you can use this new MTA to send mass e-mail only. You don't need yo switch the whole company messaging to it.
I found the MTA MailerQ easy to configure and seems to be build for handling very large volumes of email. You can watch sending results live from the gui and change rules on the fly. 
Keeping a company agile and able to pivot is critical. Outsourcing non-critical services allows you to more easily accomplish this.
cvaldemar suggests using DKIM, however makes no mention of SPF (these are not mutually exclusive, however the latter has much higher rates of adoption). In addition to the points mentioned in that post, you also need to enable throttling by destination, intelligent bounce handling and pro-active list management (to avoid poor reputation for bounces). 
Running an MTA is relatively simple. Running a MTA delivering a high-volume of bulk-emails while maintaining good deliverability is very, very complicated.
Having said that, if you are in the business of sending emails, then you absolutely should look at setting up your own MTA - though you might still want to look at hosting this on a VPS environment.
