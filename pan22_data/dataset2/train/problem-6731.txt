If you're accessing multiple servers (\\fileserver\homedir, \\devserver\coderepo) you can definitely connect to each server using a different AD credential. But only if you log in to the local workstation as a workstation-local user.
When you connect to a server (\\fileserver\homedir), you connect to \\fileserver and then access \homedir. You can't then access \\fileserver\shareddir using a different credential, Windows will complain. In order to switch, you have to disconnect from all resources on \\fileserver and reconnect using a different credential.
If you're on a domained workstation and log in with a local account, your security token will be generated by the local workstation and your credentials will be local. All processes spawned by you will inherit this token. To access domained resources you will need to provide an additional credential, the AD credential, as part of the connection process. You authenticate once per server, so you can't talk to a server using two different credentials. 
Not sure if you can use a local account to masqurade as a domain account. All auth is based on GUIDS and they'd be different right?
Best I can think of is starting any programs you need as your domain account. Easy way to do this is using runas and set it to remember your password.
