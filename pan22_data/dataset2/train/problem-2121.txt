Quick question - are you sure that you want this automated? What if someone had something important running against the TEST instance when the automated job blows it away?
If you have Windows in your environment, you could write this in PowerShell using PowerCLI, and run it as a scheduled task. This FAQ has details on some of these steps that you could use to build this script.
You'll need to enable guest customization on your vCenter, and you can set up a scheduled task in vCenter to delete the Test VM a few hours before the conversion job is due to run.
Edit: hmm, no delete vm option in ESX scheduled tasks. Bugger. Could look at doing this from the console with vmware-cmd.
1. Make a Template from the DEV instance, probably with a fixed name, overwriting the existing one in subsequent runs
You should be able to achieve this with the VirtualCenter/vSphere Convertor plugin. It has options for scheduling and re-occuring conversion jobs, and you can specify both the source and the target as the same VirtualCenter or ESX host.
You could do this with GhettoVCB. Look at the section about cron, and just set it to monthly rather than nightly.
2. Make a new machine for TEST, overwriting the existing one, from the Template from the previous step.
