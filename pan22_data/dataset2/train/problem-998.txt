And, as usually, I figure things out 10 minutes after asking the question. It turns out I had the parameters in the wrong order. Here's what worked:
I've tried using the -i option with PSExec with no luck. Any ideas about basically just fire off the batch file and NOT have it stop when PSExec is disconnected?
of if you are not "domain admin" you can use the -u and -p params to pass your user and password, example:
I have a batch file I run that, among other things, reset's the NICs in the machine. I have some watchdog software running on another machine that monitors the first one. I'd like to run this batch file using PSExec when it detects certain types of failures. The problem I'm having is that since the batch file reset's the NIC's it kills the connection PSExec has (I'm OK with that). The real issue is that when PSExec dies the batch file stops running (leaving the NIC's disabled).
How about using the SOON.exe from the Windows Resource kit to schedule the batch file in a few seconds.
