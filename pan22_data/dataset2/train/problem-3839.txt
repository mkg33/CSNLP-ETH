If you're worried about attacks, simple monitoring isn't enough. Imagine an attack comes in at 2am, or whenever you're off the clock and asleep. How many password guesses can be made before you check your email?
I think you may want to rethink being alerted for every unsuccessful hacking attempt.  If you want an e-mail every time someone pokes around looking for a vulnerability, you are probably in for quite a deluge.
If you'll never immediately respond to a notification, then it's probably better as either a daily digest email or just a log in an alert system somewhere.
If you'll respond the same way every time, you should probably be using a trigger system like Fail2Ban (blacklisting IPs for failed logins automatically).
Every software package I've used has already been listed, but I just wanted to bring up a point about your second request:
I do log monitoring with logwatch to look for suspicious login activity.  I have the system locked down pretty tight so I mostly "catch" our security office doing their regular scans.  There's also an open source version of TripWire that would be useful for monitoring changes to selected files, though this is only useful after they've broken in to let you know what's been compromised.
Too damn many. fail2ban and other programs will automate the policy you're after. Logwatch can look for unusual behavior, but it's mainly intended for discovering logged errors.
Keep the signal to noise ratio high in any sort of alert based system. If you get 5-10 emails a day letting you know about some mundane 'attack' that you do nothing about, its a lot easier to let something important slip through the cracks.
