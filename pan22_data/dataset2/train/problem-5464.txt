You might simply do better, development-wise, to wait whether your players actually care enough to cheat. If the app is not in a figurative "top 500 chart" and cheating isn't dead simple (ie bugs) players won't care enough to waste their time trying to cheat through other measures, such as modifying the IP stream or hacking the app.
So as far as cheating goes, you should protect yourself against the obvious cheats (bugs, encrypting both app and IP stream) and only react to actual cheats you learn of, and address those directly. What you really want is to log all player actions, have them verify on the server and if you find an illegal action that is occuring rather often, find out why. Could be a bug, could be an exploit, could be a technical hack. 
Perhaps a more sensible approach is to not waste time doing anything above and beyond the reasonable and generally effective anti-cheating measures. 
If your app is successful and cheating does become a problem, that's when you should tackle it. But at this point it's going to be a cat & mouse game, and the cheaters will always win.
Basically what I'm saying is that 100% of your players won't cheat if it isn't possible through a reproducible bug and/or your app is not very popular. If your app does become very popular, less than 1% of your players will cheat in ways you can't even begin to imagine.
Those are: double-testing for bugs that would allow players to perform any illegal actions, and sending only encrypted data (via https or custom encryption), and encrypting the app itself to make hacking more difficult. That's it.
