It is likely that you are subject to Group Policy that will prevent some or all of what you want. However, one thing I would try, just to see if it would work, would be to add a screen save to my Startup stuff and set it to timeout immediately and require a password.
In addition to running a screensaver, you could also run the "lock screen" command as a startup batch file or scheduled task.
Would love to know if this works: I don't have a machine to test it on but I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't.
Why don't you just leave the machine suspended or hibernated at night rather than fully logged out and shut down if this is the behavior you want? That way you wont be making any radical changes to the system's security policies and the resulting startup process will be much faster.
The security option setting that you mention re: "Interative logon: Message text for users attempting to logon" and its counterpart, "Interative logon: Message title for users attempting to logon" are what's stopping the "normal" autologon behavior of Winlogon from working.
I suspect that you'll find both equally impossible. End-running your IT policies re: the pre-logon text isn't something that I'll think you'll get a lot of support on here, either.
