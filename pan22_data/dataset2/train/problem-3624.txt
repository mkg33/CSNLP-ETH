If you're not blocked by your provider, I would suspect that something left from your antivirus installation is blocking SMTP traffic. I have seen many cases where the culprit was the antivirus program. Try to download and run the Norton Removal Tool.
It's throwing a "Socket Error: 10060, Error Number: 0x800CCC0E" error on send attempts.  So far my googling and binging reveals that a lot of other people seem to have the problem, but none of the listed solutions help.  Note that this was a clean build just days ago, next to no software loaded yet.  Looking for more suggestions, here's what I've done so far:
Usually port 25 is blocked by AV software and is labeled something like "prevent the spread of mass mailer worms." See if you can find an option like that and just disable it instead of removing your protection suite.
Did you try other smtp servers or just your ISP/Mail provider's? Maybe you have been blocked for some reason?
Installing the Windows Live update/package (with "Windows Live Mail") has made the problem go away.  Windows Live Mail looks identical to Windows Mail, yet it actually works...
Trying to Telnet out to the SMTP service was used to confirm that it's not just Windows Mail.  Seem to be completely incapable of sourcing traffic with the SMTP destination port.  The same configuration works fine on the same ISP on a Windows XP box.  Unfortunately, the e-mail provider doesn't support the MSA port (it's SMTP-AUTH, but on only the standard SMTP port).
