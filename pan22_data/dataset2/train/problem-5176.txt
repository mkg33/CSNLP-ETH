Note: I don't currently have office installed so these were done with libre office and the docx it saves as. It should be the same either way.
As an alternative, you could copy your image, crop it down to the section you want blurred.  Then apply the blur effect and lay that over the top of our original image where you want it blurred.  When finished, group the two images together or use the snip-it tool to create a new image.
At worse case, you'll need to first add a shape over the area to mask it (using the same colour as the background , in your case black) and then add the blurred font.
Download a font which is blurred (they exist, use your favorite search engine), and use the Text Box to draw a box over the area, type the same content over the top (masking the image below).
Is there any way to blur out a specific part of the image without having to delete the image, edit it and place it back into the document?
I have placed and styled (give height and width and some shadow) an image in a Word 2013 document. After that i've noticed there is some sensitive data on the picture, which can't be shown on the document.
