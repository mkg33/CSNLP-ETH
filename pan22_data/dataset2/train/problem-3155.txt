My MS Office 2007 somehow got corrupted on windows 7. When i open any app (word, excel, access, etc.) from MS Office, i get this message :-
Also keep in mind that any changes to the system in that time are rolled back too, so drivers, software, etc. from that period are gone as well. Still, for problems that occurred relatively recently it's a nice solution in many cases.
I have seen that issue before. You need to follow some steps to manually remove it. Try the instructions found @ http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928218
How to manually uninstall the 2007 Office system if you cannot uninstall it by using the "Add or Remove Programs" feature
I tried it in safe mode...but no luck. I tried to repair MS Office with Installation CD, but it didnt help either.  I can't even uninstall MS Office from control panel.
How do I uninstall the 2007 Office suites if I cannot uninstall it by using the "Add or Remove Programs" feature?
You can roll back to a system restore point before you installed Office (or before it started acting wonky).
Provided, of course, that you have System Restore enabled and that Office hasn't been doing that for the last few millennia, in which case it might be a little difficult to find that restore point.
