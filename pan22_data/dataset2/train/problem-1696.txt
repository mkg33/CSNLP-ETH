I just want to say thanks, almost a year later, to Ariane who's answer quickly resolved the same issue on my end. I was in an environment without internet and needed to convert a client's MySQL database table to .xls for a third party so I pulled the .SQL file from the database.
One could use a simple SQLLite-browser with an IMPORT feature. This may be the easiest way if you're not into learning SQL.
I realize this is a year old but perhaps someone like me will come along in the future and this will help!
After importing it into the installation created 'test' database, I was easily able to export an .xls file for opening in Excel. 
However it should be noted that using the option "CSV for Excel" did not product a CSV format that Excel could use without making a mess but choosing basic "CSV" with options "Remove carriage return/line feed characters within columns" and "Put columns names in the first row" produced the perfect file.
But after reading the post above that suggested "to install and run WAMPserver ( http://www.wampserver.com/en/ ) , then to type "localhost" in your Web browser's address bar. Then you click phpMyAdmin, and click import to, well, import the file." It really was that simple. 
If your SQL file has schema definition i.e. create table blah and also insert statements to add data, you could use sqlfiddle: http://sqlfiddle.com/
Can't speak to opening it as a table, but if you are interested in reviewing the SQL code you can simply change the extension to .txt and open with a text editor.
