In addition to the already great answers it may also be worth your time to modularize the code file so that it's easy to invoke and easy to distribute. that way, instead of having to invoke it as
Here's a great post by Ed Wilson that describes how to modularize an already written PowerShell script and it shows how to include native help as a comment. A little old, but still very relevant.

I would suggest storing it in a variable. That way, if the path ever needs to change, one change would cascade through all of the places it needs to without any risk of making a mistake in just one of them.
