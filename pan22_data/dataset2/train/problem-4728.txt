Once this is changed you'll want to shrink the log files (right-click database in sql management studio, Tasks > Shrink > Files).  You can set them to auto-shrink but once you've fixed the underlying recovery model problem you may not need to.
This is referring to the transaction log, not an error log, and that cannot be disabled on SQL Server.  Every transaction writes to the transaction log before writing a change to the database itself to protect the integrity of the database.  If the database is using the full recovery model (which it sounds like yours is), the transaction log records will only be overwritten after a transaction log backup (not a full backup); if you change the recovery model to simple, the log records are kept for a shorter period of time, and transaction log backups are not required.  Depending on your hosting provider, however, this may be out of your control; you would have to check to see how much control they give you over the database settings, and request the change if you don't have direct control.
The log file is dependent on the database recovery model.  The default is Full which means you'll be doing backups of the database and transaction log.  When you backup the transaction log, it will truncate.  If you never backup the transaction log, it will grow forever.  If you only want to backup the full database, then change the recovery model to simple.
