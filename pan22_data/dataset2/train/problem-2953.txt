However, all this seems like overkill.  You said htaccess, so it definitely sounds like Apache to me.  You have load balancers.  In my mind, it sounds much easier to "have your cake and eat it too."  I mean, just re-write the urls with your conf files of Apache (which takes only a little skill and testing) or get the load balancer to do it (I don't have one, but some co-workers have an F5 and they say it can do this thing at a low level, which is fun).  Either way, take your pick, the first paragraph directly addresses your question.  Happy hunting.
Depends on the environment, and this assumes you run Linux and Apache, probably some LAMP solution if it is common of what I hear about.
Your explanation makes it sound like you know what you are doing, but have you considered a chroot/jail/whatever you want to call it in your OS of choice jargon?  Of course, properly feeding everything into the chroot environment is a different animal, and that is where rubber meets the road for you.  Since you are talking production environment, it could be a problem for performance and stability I suppose (then again, I see lots of docs insisting lower-level production services like BIND DNS run in chroot, so I doubt it is that bad; I mean in the sense of running another chroot-ed Apache instance alongside your other one).  You might want to start here for an explanation of chroot for Apache.  I assume if you can do that and MySQL, you are set.
