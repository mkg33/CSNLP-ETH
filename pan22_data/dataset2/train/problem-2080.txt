a) The question of acceptable collations must be directed towards people fluent in the language and your business requirements. Expectations about the order of language are extremely locale specific. 
Inquire as to what specifically is superior about the requested locale compared to ones based on Unicode Collation Algorithm.
b) How one could go to a different version of mysql that supports this (or any other working well in thai) collation? 
We have a different database per instance. Each database needs to work well in a specific language, so it is not a problem if we changed the collation of their database.
b) GCP Cloud SQL is currently at MySQL 5.7. Later MariaDB developments are not available. Either select something available in SHOW COLLATION or consider a migration a different database. 
The latter could be a major porting effort. Especially if GCP PostgreSQL does not meet your needs either and this service cannot sort your data properly. You could run MariaDB on your own infrastructure, but that changes your operations.
