I use may own nomenclature base on host function: ns1, ns2, ...(for name servers), ad1, ad2, ...(for active directory hosts), mail1, mail2, ...(form mail servers), srv1, srv2, srv3, ...(for multipurpose hosts).
So, since this is just a host name essentially it can be anything. Sites with multiple front end servers would usually hide these behind a single round-robin name such as www, but it is possible that you will be redirected to a specific host for things like downloads or media streaming. In this case www6 or www8 are probably just two servers in a large farm of hosts providing material to users on the worldwide web.
There's not only www8 or www6. There www1, www2, www3, and so on. These hosts are just different servers for the vast, world wide web.
It just means someone has no imagination and someone never come up to read the proper guide on domain usage: http://no-www.org/
In fact, it's more of first issue. Instead of calling it srvr8.example.org or serv8.example.org, etc, they use what's first on their minds: www. It is deprecated. Domains working only on www always make me a bit mad.
"www" is just the name of the host or server for the website. You can have any name you like for your webserver, such as "mywebhost.example.com" but "www" is now such a well-known and understood convention for a publicly available worldwide web site that it would be very unusual to do so other than for very well known sites or internal-use hosts (such as an Outlook Web Access site - you might choose to use owa.example.com for your users to visit, separate from your company website).
But you can use names with mor imagination if you want, like, vader.somedomain.com, homer.domain.com, ilovemydog.manydomains.com.
