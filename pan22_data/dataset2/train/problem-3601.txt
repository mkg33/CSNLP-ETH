The SAN will be able to give you similar features as ZFS does: snapshots, dynamic volume sizing, cloning, etc.
Set up an Illumos/OpenSolaris system as a SAN and use iSCSI on the Windows server to attach to disk volumes on the SAN. Set it up so that the Windows server has an extra gigE card attached to a gigE switch which the server is attached to so that the iSCSI traffic basically has its own dedicated switch.
As far as I know, really the only option you have that approaches being somewhat reliable is to get a SAN that implements storage virtualization and connect your windows servers to it via iSCSI/FC/FCoE/etc.
There is a couple of options you can look forward in windows. Windows ntfs file system has supports for logical disk management. You can read more and see if it fits your requirement from http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc758035(WS.10).aspx. The other option you have is to use veritas volume manager http://www.symantec.com/business/storage-foundation-for-windows . 
To backup something like SQL Server, shutdown SQL server, tell the Illumos machine to snapshot the ZFS volume where the db is stored, restart SQL server and then use ZFS send/recieve to backup the snapshot to another server. Doing it this way means that you can backup your databases with very minimal downtime.
