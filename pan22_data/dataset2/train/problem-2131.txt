We recently went through the same problem. We decided to change the subnet mask, and while it's a bit of a PITA, good documentation made it easy to track down every last device where it's IP is configured manually. Changed DHCP to match and everything was updated within a week. 
Also the switch will be an additional single point of failure, and adding devices such as these will never improve bandwidth/latency/reliability so in my opinion should be avoided unless actually needed.
We have remote site2site vpns connecting into our network from 192.168.102.0,192.168.103.0 etc. They will need access to all the internal networks 
The only downside I observed with changing the subnet mask was on the Monday morning when everyone came back in, for some reason Windows was often reporting printers offline when they weren't but this seemed to quickly settle down.
I'm guessing you should be able to redo all your static devices in one day - when I last had to do this, I started when everyone left on a Friday at 17:00 and was finished by 23:00 - even if you got double time for overtime I'm guessing this is massively cheaper than a L3 switch.
Why not jump to 10.x.x.x? For example 10.3.0.10. In the format 10.a.b.x have each site have its own 'a' value, then each group at that site could have a 'b' value. Each device would get an 'x' value. That's is our structure and we have close to 5K 
Our current backbone is 4 x L2 dell switches connected by LAGs to effectively create 168 port backbone
Well, I run a backbone and distribute a lot of /24 to different locations. I would NOT change netwok masks - not worth it. Put decent cheap routers in there. Gives you more flexibility.
Layer 3 switches aren't cheap, and in my opinion one is not needed in this setup seeing as you could accomplish the same thing by changing subnet mask.
