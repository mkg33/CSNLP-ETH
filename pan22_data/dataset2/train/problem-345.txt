Now install Debian with your installer. After you are done, reboot. Your system may or may not reboot correctly. If it does, fine. If it does not, reboot from the Ubuntu stick, choose Try Ubuntu without installing it, open a terminal, download BootRepair as detailed here, follow those standard instructions which are generally sufficient to solve all problems.
You may need a recovery tool after the Debian install, so you might as well prepare it beforehand: download Ubuntu, and burn it to a USB stick.  
The last step is to install the GRUB boot loader. Now, this can be done different ways. The easiest is to just follow the suggestion to install GRUB to the Master Boot Record. This will overwrite Windows boot loader. You an always get back the windows bootloader from the recovery USB that you made.
You an fire up the debian installer from the USB while booting up the system.  In the partitioner, move to the now free/unused space on the SSD, and use the assisted partitioner for all unused free space. Going with the recommended option (all data on same partition) is fine. You will then get /dev/sdb[...] and /dev/sdb[...] partitions for general use and swap.
When you boot from the Ubuntu stick, you will have a network connection, so you can read the Boot Repair installation and operation instructions online, as you fix your system, no need to save beforehand. Also, if you are wondering why I did not suggest to download BootRepair earlier, it is because live distributions like Ubuntu's do not keep a copy of what you install: in other words, after installing Boot-Repair, if you turn the system off, the install of Boot-Repair on the USB stick will vanish. So you need to do it on the fly.
