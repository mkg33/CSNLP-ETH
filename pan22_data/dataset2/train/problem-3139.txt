As with IPv4 the all zeros address (known as the unspecified address) is used as a placeholder value. In the case of a local address it means that the socket is listening on all IPv6 interfaces (and possiblly all IPv4 interfaces as well depending on socket options that netstat doesn't show).
For TCP this applies only to sockets listening for incoming connections. When "accept" is called to accept a connection a seperate socket is created with a defined remote IP and port.
For UDP there is no concept of accepting connections. An application bound to a UDP socket with a foreign address of :::* uses the "recvfrom" API call to receive packets and determine where they came from and the "sendto" API call to send packets to a specific address.
It means that the socket is not bound to a specific foreign address. :: or 0.0.0.0 indicates an unspecified IP address (for IPv4 or IPv6 respectively) and * indicates an unspecified port.
:: is an IPv6 address in condensed form using the rule that a run of zeros can be replaced with ::. Written out in full it is is equivilent to 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 .
* This notation is unfortunate because it means that a displayed string means different things in netstat to elsewhere. In most contexts 3FFE::1234:5678 would mean the IP address 3FFE:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1234:5678 but in linux netstat output it means the IP address 3FFE:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:1234 and the port 5678 . The windows version of netstat by contrast surrounds IPv6 addresses in square brackets to avoid ambiguity.
