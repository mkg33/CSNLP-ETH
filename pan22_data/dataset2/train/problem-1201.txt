I've been looking into different kinds of UPS solutions. (Standby, Line-Interactive, Standby-Ferro, Double Conversion, and Delta Conversion UPSs) So far I think I've narrowed it down to Double Conversion or Line-Interactive. However, I'm unable to determine which of them is able to:
Generally a UPS requires MORE current on the input then on the output for 2 reasons - (1) to charge the battery and (2) to take into account inefficiencies of the UPS components.   I would speculate that a double conversion UPS would be more likely to handle this eventuality as the input and output are at least somewhat decoupled - on the flip side they are generally less efficient.
It is theoretically possible that both UPS's could do this if specifically designed to, but I would hazard that most are not designed to do this.   (Note that "watt spikes" is probably less accurate a term then current spikes, but I guess they are the same thing, if we assume that the voltage is constant - equipment won't generally cause an increase in voltage).
