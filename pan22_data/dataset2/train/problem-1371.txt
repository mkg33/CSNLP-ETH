yeah I suppose Virtual Machine is a solution, hosting Windows XP and Ubuntu and run both as virtual machines. However that costs performance. 
You can use a "hypervisor", which is a sort of Virtual Machine setup.  There are several available, which (last I knew, several years ago) work with varying degrees of reliability and efficiency, with significant dependency on the specific hardware processor model and other hardware attributes.
I could be wrong here... and it's gunna be real interesting to see if someone smarter pops in and corrects me but... I don't think you can do this.  Not that way.  I see you already noted the VM concept and I really think that would be the only way to achieve anything close to what you want.
Is it possible to run both OS as "real machine" instead of "virtual machine", share the same PC, and toggle by automatically "hibernate and wake up"?
Some hypervisors are "hosted" on an OS (such as Linux), while others run "under" all the OSes in the box.
My notebook installed Windows XP and Ubuntu. Every time to toggle, I need to hibernate one OS (to keep current working things) and restart to the other.
If that were possible, that would be awesome. However I can't think of any. I remember back in the 90s IBM had a computer that could do this, but it had two motherboards. Basically two computers built into one case. As you mentioned, Virtual Machines are your way to go. I would suggest to make your host the one that you will need most processing power. Make the second one the OS that will need less requirements.
