In WM, I am authenticated as a domain admin to the Active Directory and can see all the users, user groups and computers from the AD, but no computer groups. The button to create a new user, new user group, or new computer are greyed out, and only the New Computer Group is available, though as stated above, I can't actually use it. 
I have setup a new Snow Leopard Server (10.6.4) in a Magic Triangle setup (Dual Directory Integration), but am not able to manage preferences from within Workgroup Manager and am wondering if I might be missing something.
I've bound it to AD, ran "sudo dsconfigad -enablesso", setup the server as OD master, and checked that my DNS is all correct.
Also, when I push the button to create a new computer group for my macs I get the following error: "Got unexpected error  Error of type eDSNoStdMappingAvailable (-14140) on line 1268 of /SourceCache/WorkgroupManager/WorkgroupManager-361.3.1/PMMUGMainView.mm" This same message shows up in the Console.
When I attempt to save a change I've made to a setting for 1 computer (eg. Energy Saver pref to turn off the computer everyday at 8pm), I get an error message saying, "Error while saving record "compname$": The directory system schema does not support storing Managed Desktop settings." This gives me a message in the console from WorkGroup Manager, "DirServices [dsAddAttribute] error: -14140"
