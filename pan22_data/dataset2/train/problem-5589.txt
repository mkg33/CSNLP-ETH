Now when you resume your computer from the screen saver, you'll be greeted by the lock screen. A simple click, keypress, swype, etc. brings you back to where you left off.  
The gesture based unlock I have found to be most convenient. Instead of drawing 3 gestures triple clicking a spot of your choice works just as well. Quick and simple.
Second Step: Making sure we are automatically logged in. Windows + R to bring up run, type netplwiz. With your user name highlighted untick the box that says "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Hit apply then ok.
This will force a lock screen so you have to press the three finger salute (control alt delete), but after that, when it asks for a password, just hit enter.
First Step: Screensaver settings. Right click desktop, personalise, screensaver. Check the box that says "On resume, display login screen". Hit apply then ok.
Bring up Search from the Charms bar. Search for "Run" and open it. Type in control userpasswords2. Go to the Advanced tab. Select, at the bottom, "Require users to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
Go to the personalize option in the desktop right click menu and open the screen save settings. Here set a screen saver and select the box that says "On resume, display login screen"
Third Step: Creating a picture password. Bottom right corner, settings, users, change picture password. Find a picture you like, create the three gestures, confirm the three gestures and then click finish.
If you don't want a screen saver, choose "Blank" as your screen saver rather than "(None)", as from my testing, the lock screen will not show when you have it set to None.
Now restart your computer. You will be automatically logged in and when your screensaver is now interrupted, you will resume at the lock screen with a gesture based unlock.
