It might be a graphics card problem, like dragging windows seems slow and juddery and watching videos are terrible
Strip the system down to bare essentials ans see if the problem remains. Remove all USB hardware, and then plug them in one at a time, in different ports than usual.
When collected dust clogs up fans and grills your components (mainly CPU & GPU) will overheat and run at a lower pace.
But now it is very, very slow, and I don't know how, why or when this happened. After I noticed the slowness, I removed Windows XP and installed Windows 7 on it, but it is still very slow. Now watching videos is unbearable at full screen (slow frame rates, audio out of sync) and painful when made smaller.
Originally, I have been using this computer for all sorts of stuff: Photoshop, web design/development, movies and even some light (Warcraft 3) gaming. I have been running it with Windows XP
This is my last guess, as you have tried two different O/S. However, modern Anti/Virus and security suites can drag down any older system. Try running without one for a while and see what happens (just be careful on the Internet!)
The PC is running with 1GB of RAM, three hard drives (all up, something like 400 GB) and I think a 1.6GHz processor
Why would this happen? What would cause this? I am starting to think it is a hardware problem (the CPU has died or something), but I don't even know if that is possible.
Try a utility that can turn on SMART and check for read and write errors. SpinRite and smartmontools come to mind. This is my first guess.
