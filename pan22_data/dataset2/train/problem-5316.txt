You are basically asking if there is a way to do an escalation of privileges without proper authorization. The answer is obviously NO, there is not.
Note that SETUSER is deprecated, provided only for backward compatibility, and has inferior functionality.
When signed in under the guest account, you have very few privileges by default. The sa password is displayed as blank because you do not have the necessary rights to view it. Disabling the guest account is a security best practice, where it is not required.
SQL Server does provide a way to impersonate another login or user (assuming you have sufficient rights). See EXECUTE AS (Transact-SQL) for details.
The real sa password is almost certainly not blank. SQL Server does not allow a blank sa password since the 2005 release.
If you need to gain administrative access to an instance on which local administrators are locked out follow the procedure described in Connect to SQL Server When System Administrators Are Locked Out. As a local administrator you can then grant all necessary privileges to the authorized users.
