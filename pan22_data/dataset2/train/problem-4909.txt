So, with that said, your query will greatly resemble what Kondybas provided, with a couple of tweaks:
Note that I do not count the entry marked 'draft', per your note in the question that only items marked 'publish' should be counted. If the actual rule is more complicated, you should be able to modify this to match the actual rule.
If you're refactoring the database to optimize it for your actual business needs, you will probably want to make a number of changes. Since we don't see your full data structure, or your full set of business rules, we can't tell you everything that should be changed.
I would also probably change the name of the post_author field in entry to dealer_id, to make it more clear that it's the link to the dealer table.
Odds are good I would move all the data from wp_usermeta into dealer, but not knowing what all is there, I can't say for certain.
That said, you've given us one business rule that would imply a change. Every dealer should be tied to one and only one manufacturer. So, I would move the manufacturer link from the meta table directly into dealer. I'd name the new dealer field manufacturer_id.
