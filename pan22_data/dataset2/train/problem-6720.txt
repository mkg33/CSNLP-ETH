For instance, the Quake-Engine games, to me felt more solid, whereas Build engine felt more flimsy, and Unreal felt kind of abstracted.
  Similarly, when people see shiny, grimy, steroid abusing space marines they'll think 'Unreal' but this is more of an art direction, rather than a facet of the underlying engine that displays that art. Even though different studios make grimy space marine games they'll often use unreal because it's been proven to be able to make that sort of game.
A lot of what people say is a typical engine is actually more art related. Engines empower or impose restrictions on art assets but the design and execution of how things feel is largely an art issue.  Take for example the faces in Oblivion; So many people were blaming the engine for the slightly less than convincing characters. This was clearly an issue with the art, or if not that then the section of Bethesda's code that blended faces together, rather than the whole 'engine'.
It's funny because it's true, the lighting and further post-process effects can easily expose the underlying engine.
I've found that facial animations are usually a dead giveaway. There is a lot of variation and even with different art you can still see the same patterns in the textures.
I think there are more subtle signs than what you see. Quake felt the same on OpenGL, Software, and PowerVR - despite unique looks on each.
