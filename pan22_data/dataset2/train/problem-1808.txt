I am not sure if I was able to explain the question properly. But basically I am using a windows xp box 32 bit to deploy asp.net app to 64 bit windows server. The IIS server I am guessing is 64 bit process. Can the asp.net app use all the memory that is allowed from being a 64 bit server? or will it just use 4 GB max.
So as long as your project is running Any CPU it will up itself to 64 bit mode on a 64 bit operating system and the appropriate memory access. 
My understanding is sort of.  The application itself will not be able to address a larger memory space than 32-bit.  However, the OS should enable address translation that allows that block to exist anywhere in the OS's address space.  So, the app will not be able to address more than it otherwise would, but more ram will be available for addressing.
As asp.net is JIT-enabled, it will JIT-compile on the webserver upon page requests. Which means it should have no problem utilizing all the resources on your server.
I'm not a .NET expert, and it's been a while since I worked with precompiled binaries, so take this with a grain of salt.
Forcing x86 will make the .net assembly run in 32 bit mode even on a 64 bit machine. The default build option is Any CPU. 
A .net application by default will run in whatever environment it is in (either 32 bit or 64 bit). It is possible to force a platform in the properties of the project in
