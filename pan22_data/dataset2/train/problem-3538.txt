I rebooted my computer and everything worked perfectly. I decided to try playing another steam-game, Counter-Strike: Source, but sadly the same thing happened again after around 15-20 minutes.
At first I blamed it on my wireless internet connection, but when I saw my brother playing the same game with no problems I got suspicious.
If I could open the task manager after the computer acts like a complete retard, I would've linked a screenshot of the task manager, but since I can't open it, this is impossible.
I also ran a full computer check using F-Secure, a small malware-file was found, but was instantly removed. This didn't help neither.
I've repeatedly tried to fix this on my own, like closing all background applications and running the games again, but with the same result.
I read this thread on another website, but since my problem has never occured before, I figured it was irrelevant. Besides that, I have already cleansed my computer using all the standard Windows 7 cleaning-utilities, like the defragmenter, and followed most of the advices on that page. 
Yesterday, after playing Team Fortress 2 for around 20 minutes, my computer (an HP Compaq 8510p laptop) started lagging so bad I couldn't even shut down the game, I couldn't move the cursor nor could I run the task manager.
