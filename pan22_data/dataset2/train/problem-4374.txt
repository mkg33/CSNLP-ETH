Of course this assumes you're considering a desktop-replacement laptop. The laptop itself wouldn't have a 24" monitor, but since they basically come with dual-video built in, you can just slap another monitor (or two or three) on it without any problems, and actually get CrAzY desktop space.  
Have you thought about getting an iMac and putting Windows and / or Linux on there using Bootcamp?  The 27" model meets most of your requirements, especially for being quiet, and for having good build quality.  They also have decent graphics hardware for a non-gamer-dedicated system.
I would reccomend an HP. Their systems are reliable, and they also offer servers, so your minimum reqs shouldn't be too much of a problem. 
I had a couple ThinkPads and was quite happy with those; though I'm uncertain as to their quality since Lenovo took them over.
I prefer HPs over Dell's simply because HP's Technical Support wins heavily over Dell's 2 hour call-time average, and 3-4 year product lifetime. We currently uses HP laptops and desktops for virtually all of our non-linux/solaris machines.
Only caveat with a DR laptop is the price will be steeper; you just need to decide if it works for you. Personally I LOVE working on a laptop instead of a desktop that can't go anywhere. e.g. When we have development/coding meetings or pow-wows at our office, we can all bring our systems into one room and compare notes right then and there. Very handy!
Other than the alternatives already mentioned, I suggest you take a look at the Dell Vostro 4XX series (info from the Swedish page, I couldnt navigate on the Finnish page). I am using one such machine for the past year and I have to say I am very very happy with it running OpenSuse.
