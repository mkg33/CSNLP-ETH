Personally I'd use a combination of the compressed air with a regular vacuum in close proximity to "inhale" the dust after it has been blown off the boards.
I tend to use a specialist company for this sort of thing, who wants to explain to their directors why their servers are broken when you're caught holding the dustbuster ;)
We have a local company named DPEnvironmental that comes in to clean our room.  They somewhat oversell themselves, talking about how terrible dust can be, but they don't charge too much and they do a good job, quickly vacuuming the whole room and the servers and switches w/out ever damaging anything.
It works great, and I've had no problems during the clean up process. It comes with many attachments, and is the single tech product that sucks on purpose.
Vacuum cleaner with a plastic endpiece (anti-static like you said) is the way to clean stuff when you can't blow the dust away with compressed air.
Using compressed air inside a server room is not very clever as the dust will circulate and eventually drag inside the servers.
