I'd personally let the server run or move it to a better running environment. This may not be worth automating.
If you must shut down the entire host, please make sure that your VMs have the VMWare tools installed (to allow graceful shutdown and power up) and that they're set to stop and start with the host.
However it seems you are dealing with a bigger problem , i.e overheating server room.This needs to be dealt with on a correct level.Fix HVAC asap or you will damage your equipment eventually.Read on http://www.openxtra.co.uk/articles/skimp-server-room-ac
You can use the vCli and schedule a cron job to place the host in maintenance mode and/or shut down the host entirely. I would probably just manually run the host shutdown command from the GUI client at the end of the day, though.
If you have python running you can use the script I wrote below to wake up and shutdown your ESXi server.  I have a Dell R810 at home that I use as my Cisco VIRL Server and other things but i only power it up when I need it.  It is downstairs so i wanted a way that i could start it and stop it from upstairs.  I have enabled Wake On Lan on the primary NIC on the server (CTRL-S as it is booting and enable for your primary NIC).  In vSphere set your VMs to start and stop with the server as this script will shutdown your VMs and power off the server.  Enable ssh for your ESXi server, enter the MAC of the primary NIC, and change the root password, server ip, and path to python below.
