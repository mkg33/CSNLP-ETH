(Even Apple's Time Machine only does hourly backups... think about the largest file that may change and have to be shoved over the wire...)
That said, it's probably NOT a good idea (What if you attach a full 1TB drive to a machine being backed up? Your backups just ballooned).
Scalability: if I attach an USB drive to the computer, I want it's data to be backed up as well (well... That on linux might be quite easy, simply backup all /media/ except cds and dvds, but for windows?)
Near real-time (~ 5 minutes at max) file backup: I lost a latex report and was hard to reconstruct it from scratch
You can include or exclude specific parts of the filesystem (down to file-level granularity) in Bacula.
Not bad on Unix (Just back up everything under / and it will grab the media), but probably not possible on Windows -- I believe you need to specify the drives you want to grab because the filesystem isn't a tree hierarchy under a specific root (there's a root for each drive).
Restores are (and should be) a manual process. I have no idea what an "automatic restore" would look like (the backup server decides on its own to restore a file? :)
Revisions (SVN-style): a file has to be backed up each time it gets modified (and multiples versions of the same file can exist on the server, in fact they must)
BackupPC may also be able to hit these requirements (not certain - haven't used it) - other commercial backup solutions almost certainly can as well.
Database-backed lists of jobs and results, with the ability to write to log files, email, etc. in the event of errors.
Not happening -- You CAN specify a 5 minute backup window, but your logs will be filled with jobs being killed because there's already a duplicate running.
No-Duplication: for instance if I backup the USB's disk content from 2 different computers, I do not want the data to be backed up twice (symlink instead of hard copy in worst case)
