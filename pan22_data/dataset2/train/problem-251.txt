click on the drive and right click and select change drive letter. This should help (If I have understood the issue correctly)
I think the best programs are Recover My Files or Stellar Phoenix Win Data Recovery. Both of them are useful and strong programs for you.   
I have an external hard disk. I plugged it into my friend's laptop. It doesn't show up in "My Computer" or Command Prompt. So as usual I plugged out and in again. Then in "My computer" it says the hard disk need to be formatted before you can use it. And I can't access the drive which prompts "Access Denied". The external hard drive had been formatted currently. And I want to recover the files in that hard disk. I want to know which software is the best in recovering data from formatted hard drive. Please give me an exact direct download link if you don't mind. Thanks in advance.
Open up Disk Management when it is plugged in and booted up by right clicking on My Computer -> manage, and then select Disk Management from left menu.
