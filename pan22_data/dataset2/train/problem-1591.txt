If you're not "married" to a particular editor, I really recommend ZeroBrane Studio IDE: It's open-source, implemented in Lua itself (using wxLua), very lightweight but also very powerful and convenient.
ZBS allows you not only to re-run your code with a single keypress, but also to debug it and even do "live-coding" for Löve and a few other game frameworks.
If you made a .love file, the same applies, just drag the .love file to the Love2D executable. Make sure main.lua is in its root folder, though.
Then, main2.lua is my actual main file. You don't even need to make the actual main file a proper module. Writing the love.load(), love.update(dt), and love.draw() functions will write to the global definitions.
I put that file in a zip by itself, gave it the .love extension, and put it in the root of my project folder. Now, I can just double click that whenever I need to test.
I'm not sure it counts as running it through the lua interpreter, but you should be able to run it without packaging:
To run a game you made in Löve2D, you have to drag its folder (the one containing the main.lua) to the Love2D executable. It's the easiest way to run it. If you want to export you game into an executable itself, you have to package the folder and embed it into the Love2D executable.
If you installed Love2D in your computer instead of running its portable version, you should be able to play it by just double-clicking the .love file though.
