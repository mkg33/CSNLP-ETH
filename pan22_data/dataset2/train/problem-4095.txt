I have been doing some image processing on my computer using Erdas Imagine.  Specifically, I am running a 5x5 median filter on imagery.  I can specify the number of processes that occur simultaneously within the Erdas batch command window.  I have been observing unusual behavior when I specify 16 simultaneous processes, which lead me to double check the number of processors on the machine.  I used the following command prompt command to assess the number of processors:
Number of cores (8) represents the actual number of physical cores. For each processor core that is physically present, the operating system addresses two virtual or logical cores, and shares the workload between them when possible.
Where multiprocessing systems include multiple complete processing units, multithreading aims to increase utilization of a single core by using thread-level as well as instruction-level parallelism. As the two techniques are complementary, they are sometimes combined in systems with multiple multithreading CPUs and in CPUs with multiple multithreading cores.
How does the number of cores differ from the number of logical processors in the context of software like Erdas imagine where the user can specify the number of simultaneous processes?  I am trying to determine if I should be specifying 8 or 16 simultaneous processes to maximize efficiency.
