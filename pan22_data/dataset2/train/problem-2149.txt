You can create a container for each of your developer, you can create instant public or password protected download links for your clients.
As somebody looking for a similar solution for video project files, I agree that SVN isnt really the solution, and I dont think Git is either. Ive been looking at couchDB actually. A UI needs to be coded for it (but can be in Javascript or something) but its a document database so i think conceptually it works better. AND its designed to work with binary blobs. So I think it would be good with performance. 
You could also try Alfresco. Using Adobe Drive 2.2, you can mount the Alfresco DAM in the Finder and right click to show versions, check out and check in files.
S3 will cost you $1 per 10GB. S3fox is free. Your designers will be happy about it, only thing is that each time they have to rename the file themselves, you can use;
for psd's I second the use of version cue. subversion is great, but it has it's own issues with large binary files.
SVN is almost useless in your case, large files will take ages to put into repository if it won't totally break the whole thing. SVN can store binary but it is not meant to (it can't tell if one pixel is different unlike text files) do that. Since it will try to process and update its database on each commit, it can be errorful. I wouldn't rely on it.
