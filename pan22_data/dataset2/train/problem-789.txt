The server S-2003 is a database server that is used by LAN users through Internet Explorer by going to a web page.
So I found that in the TCP / IP address of the user's PC was configured as the preferred DNS IP 10.10.10.1 and DNS as an alternative to google (8.8.8.8)
So that, users can access at the database server portal or writing in IE 10.10.10.1 or the name http://plutoweb configured in the local DNS server S.2003.
Now, this system has worked for several months, until a few days ago a user could not access the database server.
Thus, from the user's PC I tried a "nslookup plutoweb" and, strangely, nslookup relay the answer of the google dns server (8.8.8.8). 
Now, I do not know if my deduction is correct, but it is as if the resolution of the name was incorrect because the dns to google dns was faster than the local S-2003.
The pc clients, all with windows xp pro, are configured with static IP addresses in the domain active directory managed by S-2003.
Removing the IP 8.8.8.8 from local TCP/IP settings of pc, the web page of the database server opens without problems.
