You need to replace this by your dns server (192.168.0.19 in my case). It could be done manually using kubectl edit cm -n kube-system coredns. In case you also want to automate this process: 
Before applying our dns (so 1.1.1.1 was used, which belongs to Cloudflare) this throws the following resolving error: 
I have a dns server running at 192.168.0.19 for custom domains like .fritz.box. Having a single node cluster on k3s, Rancher was installed using a subdomain server2.fritz.box using this command: 
Rancher itself shows that some services are not avaliable and the logs from cattle say server2.fritz.box is not avaliable. Since Kubernetes has its own dns system, I looked at the documentation and it seems that I need to set my .19 dns server so that Kubernetes knows how to resolve .fritz.box domains. Some questions also have similar problems like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41448095/kube-dns-does-not-resolve-external-hosts-on-kubeadm-bare-metal-cluster
ibuildthecloud9 gave me the right hint. Since the github issue doesn't describe how to midify the dns, I figured it out and want to document it here in case someone need to change it, too. It's stored in the configmap coredns as Corefile:
