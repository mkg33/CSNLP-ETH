We've had quite a few ideas already, but I'd like thoughts on how the users of ServerFault would solve this problem. Feel free to ask questions :)
They also do protocol acceleration, which locally emulates some of the traffic they know they'll be seeing for certain chatty file protocols. That said, protocol emulation doesn't work across the board, so you might want to ensure passthrough for certain applications.
In addition to Mark's excellent answer, I'd like to suggest that you consider some WAN acceleration technology. Something with a few TB of storage at each end that will only send references to data it's already sent recently enough that it's still in cache. Riverbed and Cisco both do this. 
That latency is going to kill you (as it is already) for TS/RDS. If you can't address that, no amount of bandwidth or tweaking is going to help.
I might suggest though that you give RemoteApp a try. The underlying component is still TS/RDS and behind the scenes there's still a full desktop session but owing to the fact that only application windows are presented to the user this might cut down on the amount of data traversing the link, making RemoteApp a passable solution for you.
Going to cut right to the point on this question, as I'm after as diverse range of solutions as possible so don't want to effect any opinions with the question too much.
