Well this device has an ARM core and they will officially support ARM arch so surely this should be do-able.
I switched to OpnSense from pfSense when they announced they aren't supporting x86 anymore. I get that it makes businessSense, but it is rather annoying to watch support die off for every old atom platform. The older x86 atoms are all very cheap, and still very useful (for under 100 mbps). Plus I don't feel guilt-ed into supporting the project after just buying a Gold subscription...
i know its a long long time ago you asked the question, but now i created a OPNsense Port for the RPI3, you can find it here:
It's nice that pfSense has 90 hours of training videos in their hangouts section, but with OpnSense I didn't need any of it. They have 2, or 3 factor auth VPN, that supports the Google Authenticator app out of the box, and Suricata IDS / IPS built in as well. The interface is much easier to navigate, and with the team member from hardenedBSD, they are implementing things like ASLR, and root separation etc. (makes the Firewall OS less hackable).

@Eric Pretorious: IPfire runs on Raspberry Pis as well. I got ~22 Mbps thruput on a Pi 1B and 50 on a Pi 3B. However, I don't recommend using a Pi 1 since the web interface is very slow.
I was just looking through the highlight notes for v2.4 as I saw what looked like a cutdown raspberry pi type device they are selling soon called the Netgate SG-1000.
