As they often have open electronic parts, except SSD, externally connected they may become dirty, or be shorten and thus damaged.
Functionally, there is no reason why this wouldn't be ok - if it works internally, it should work externally.
Take into account other factors, such as humidity, direct sun light, dust, (sound) vibrations and etc.
Personally, if speed is that critical and time is money, I would recommend you get a USB3 card for your PC and use a drive case - or look into the possibility of a SATA cradle which the drive clips securely into and then ensure that you place the drive cradle somewhere secure and generally out of reach (shelf with cables behind it, behind the PC etc).
HDD drives with open electronic circuits (if not SSD) mostly designed to be used inside some cases which serve them as Electro Magnetic protection, so permanent using them in open area can be less reliable, if EM fields are high enough, it can cause a failure.
From a practicality point of view - protect the drive!  Static, dust, water, variable heat, impact, the list of potential pitfalls are huge.  Gratned some of these risks (dust, impact) are present both internally and externally - but the risk and impact of such events is greatly magnified when there isn't a huge PC Case surrounding the drive.
You run risk using 2.5 and/or 3.5 internal drives connected to the dock permanently. External HDD hub is easier to be dropped/touched causing HDD to fall out.
