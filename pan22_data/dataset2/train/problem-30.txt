RefuseLA rejects new incoming SMTP connections/sessions but sendmail may receive further messages over already existing connections - QueueLA will handle them. It is handy in default background delivery mode. Think about fast SMTP session sending multiple messages to many slow SMTP destinations and sendmail forking delivery process after receiving each message. [It is possible to limit number of messages accepted in single SMTP session.]
Setting QueueLA and RefuseLA to the same value makes some sense if you want to reduce number of sendmail states. It configures just two states "normal" and "full overload" with no states between.  
Based off of historical logs, it almost looks to me like it flops between the two enforcement behaviors.  I see some stuff where messages instantly get queued (stat=queued) and others where the incoming connection is rejected... but no clear indication of why one action was chosen over the other. 
I came across a sendmail server with QueueLA and RefuseLA set to the same value (50).  I'm not sure why the previous admin would have done this.  Is there a legitimate reason for why someone would want to set that? How would sendmail behave in that scenario? 
I would not use such configuration myself but IMHO it is mostly matter of personal preferences (preferred "style").  I sometimes use "Keep It Simple Stupid" approach myself :-)
