Honestly ... nothing, not a damn thing. I sit back and learn the job as it is done NOW by the people that are there. After some time and when you are sure you have a good handle on how things work now (not just technically, but politically, and inter-personally as well) you can start formulating lists of what you think should be changed. 
As for must haves ... I think that depends on on what you do and how you do things... like I must have a digi terminal server hooked to a modem with a dedicated line as a last resort if I can't get to my Voice Routers... but you may not need that. Once again, sit back and take some time to figure out how things are and what peoples complaints are first before swooping in and wanting to change everything.
1 -- Analyze the current processes and systems so that you understand them better than your predecessor.  Even if it is a stupid reason in your eyes, something probably was not configured the way it is for no reason at all.
If you don't understand where you are right now, your ideas of where you should be could and most likely will be wildly off from reality.
2 -- Concentrate on efficiency, not growth.  You want to do more with less, then grow from there.  Going forward, things should be extremely well documented, secure, but most importantly of all, scalable.
