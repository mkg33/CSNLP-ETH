Or you could make your Raspberry Pi accessible from the web / use it as a webserver (for example nginx)
i use gphoto2 package (commandline shoot) with Raspi to shoot (by usb) every X seconds with a Canon DSLR camera and upload it to a local web server. so later, make time lapse videos with it.
I made a simple photo-capture script which writes to /var/tmp, a fake directory in the memory instead of the sdcard, to reduce sd-card wear!
Definitely use gphoto2.  Here is a great script for installing gphoto2 on the pi: https://github.com/gonzalo/gphoto2-updater/
You can check if your camera is in the list of working hardware (not a complete list), to make sure it will work: http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals
I'm working on a project with my Raspberry Pi at the moment. I'll give a brief summary of what I'm trying to achieve.
Note that you can email to a dropbox, so if the Pi is connected to the internet you could have your script email each image capture using mpack.
So my question at this stage in my project is about your experience with cameras that work well with the RPi and what I should look for the get the highest res possible out of it. Also if anyone knows of any good software for taking picture at intervals that would be useful too! I have read about the 'motion' app but it seems to have issues with high resolution.
