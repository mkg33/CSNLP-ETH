To solve this problem, Simply go to keyboard layout seetings on the control panel and change the keyboard layout to US and save. Proceed as follows;
SHIFT +   the key that is at the left of the "1" key, (the key at the top of TAB, or if you prefer at the bottom of ESC)
I have just run into this problem on Windows 10. My computer does not have an Alt key to the right of the space bar (Alt Gr) and the Alt + [numbers] doesn't work. I found the solution through trial and error - Ctrl + Shift + \ (key above the Enter key).
I have now remapped planking L (Â¬) to backslash (\) using the following shell script at startup.  I am using gnome / Ubuntu 13.10 on an Asus Zenbook.  
All the UK servers I control, I now pin the on-screen keyboard to the start menu now so I can get to that key fairly easily. I could set the machines to US keyboards, but my UK based colleagues probably wouldn't thank me for it :)
If you are controlling a windows machine remotely that is set to UK then open the "On-screen keyboard"
