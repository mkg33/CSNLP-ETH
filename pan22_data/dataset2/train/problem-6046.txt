I had a Chinese PDF from which I could not copy and paste the characters using Adobe Reader. I found success however by opening the PDF in Adobe Acrobat Professional, rather than in Reader.
Perhaps,in the latest version of Pdf writer, Unicode text cannot be embedded as code points, only glyphs of the open type fonts are embedded in the pdf document. 
Tested a lot of options. The only one that worked really well was https://online2pdf.com/convert-pdf-to-rtf# .
The most likely answer is that the text in the PDF document does not contain the right characters. What you see isn't necessarily what you get with PDF, the text that you copy from and the image that you see are two different things, and in many cases that text is just an OCR reading of the image, which probably doesn't recognize the non-latin characters.
So recommend you using it if you don't want to waste time trying to convert things with other solutions.
It sounds like it could be an encoding issue. Make sure that both files are set to a Unicode encoding (probably UTF-8). I'm not entirely sure how to do this in Acrobat Reader, but Notepad and Word allow you to set this.
