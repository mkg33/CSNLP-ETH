I typically require multiple SharePoint virtual machines for development purposes. I currently manually build these every time I need one, either starting from a fresh OS install or using sysprep when working with SharePoint 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2. I currently use VMWare, but am open to VirtualBox or Hyper-V.
What I usually do in situations like this, especially if I have a virtual machine system running, is to create one that looks like I want it -- then copy that VM when I need a new copy.  Make changes to the copy so that it looks as different from the original as you need.
If you are using vmware server you can look into the snapshot feature to create a primary VM then take the snapshot as you have tweaked to your liking. Then you can utilize the snapshot manager to "revert" back to a clean vm when your project is complete.
Note this won't work if you are trying to iteratively create sharepoint instances (ie each instance is different due to something you learn while playing with the previous one).
Virtualbox too has this ability and it is included free, so if cost is an issue perhaps that is a better choice. 
I'd like to be able to go from zero to a working VM with SharePoint, SQL and Visual Studio all through script. Is this a feasible task? Or are there more practical methods which would start from a VM with a fresh installation of an OS, and then use more standard unattended installs.
