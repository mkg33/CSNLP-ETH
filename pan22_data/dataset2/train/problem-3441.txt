I do however believe in this case Jeff Albert is correct when stating this is probably an automated login from some service.
I personally do this and if at some moment I do require password authentication, (like in emergencies when I do have a computer but no keys at my disposal), I simply login through my VPS control panel and enable password auth via SSLVNC.
This is a real login. And to answer your question "how you can suddenly use a password login", It is because you simply have not disabled password authentication.
If you DO have some users that need to be able to password authenticate, you can use Match User or Match Group like so:
If you do not require password authentication for any of your users, you should set the PasswordAuthentication flag in your sshd_config to no, as password can be keylogged or bruteforced.
It's good practise to know what is connecting to your server in case of a breach of the application. (Memory can very easily be read out, and so can your stored passwords).
Finally, If you're really paranoid, check all allowed SSH keys on your server, change ALL passwords and users for all your public services.
Another option you have if you REALLY need password authentication, is something I have done in the past, nl create a very long user name that is close to unguessable to reduce chance of someone guessing that user.
This is still prone to keylogging or clipboard hijacking. But obviously reduces the chance for someone to guess your user to a nihillum.
