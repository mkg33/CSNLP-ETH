Their support is excellent, and their forums are very helpful for doing non-standard things (hackers that set up SVN servers, media streamers, etc. on their NAS are not uncommon on there).
Quite a large community has built up around their online forums, and I have been blown away by the level of support that their staff provide over the forums. They also release somewhat regular updates to the OS, which still apply to my old Readynas X6.
I'll post the full spec of the machine I built if desired (I honestly don't remember the full spec off hand, but it cost me £300-£350 from memory, with 3.5tb worth of disk space on top of the hardware.
I bought a Readynas 4 years ago and I have been nothing but happy with it. Their current home/office products (the NV+ abd NVX) meet all your requirements, and then quite a bit more. Some features include:
I almost bought a Tranquil PC SQA5H, which looks awesome and comes in a bunch of similarly awesome configurations (Atom + 5 drive bays + SATA expansion) but at the end of the day it was just starting to cost too much for a small device.
I personally have a QNAP on my network (4-bay model), and although mine had a relatively low-powered processor, there are models ranging all the way up to 2.4GHz.
In the end, I realised that for the same money as a Tranquil PC I could put together a full spec PC running a low power Celeron (stupidly low power on idle), in a case of my choice and passively cool it making a silent almost eternally upgradable NAS.  Plus, because it's more powerful than an Atom, I could actually have it do some more heavy lifting like media serving / transcoding and running a number of different types of services for the same power footprint.  I sacrificed size for power and performance.
