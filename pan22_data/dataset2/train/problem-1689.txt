Note: The fourth step disrupts connectivity from TEMPDNS to your 192.168.10.* LAN, but your remote session is stillworking because it is actually originating from TEMPAD in the 192.168.11.* LAN
The problem is, we cannot login except with a cached domain credentials of a non-administrator user that hasn't the privileges to change IP address. Is there anyway in this situation to change the IP address of the machine? Note that:
Now proceed as follows, using two boxes TEMPAD (with ip 192.168.11.100, say) and TEMPDNS (with 192.168.11.200, say):
In the spirit of this question, I have a windows machine that is a member of an Active Directory network, but the network is unreachable due to mistake in the network configuration that is not yet resolved. However, we can restore connectivity easily if we were able to change IP address.
You could try to boot some linux distro (i.e. PartedMagic or Ubuntu Live) and use a tool to reset/unlock/remove password of the local Administrator user account. Then you would be able to login to the local user with blank password by typing .\Admisistrator into the username box.
In step 6 the following magic happens (I hope):  The machine asks its configured DNS server 192.168.10.2 (i.e., TEMPDNS) for the address of an AD server. It gets as a reply your original AD servers in 192.168.10.* and 192.168.11.200 (i.e., TEMPAD). Connection attempts to the 192.168.10.* AD servers fail, so ultimately 192.168.11.200 is tried (as I said, it may be better to avoid the attempts to connect 192.168.10.* by crippling the DNS on TEMPDNS). The connection to 192.168.11.200 succeeds: We have a working forward route 192.168.10.36 -> 192.168.10.1=TEMPDNS -> TEMPAD and backward rout TEMPAD -> 192.168.10.200=TEMPAD -> 192.168.10.36.
NOTE: Only do this if you are familar with Linux, because using this method you could easily broke your Windows OS!
