The most important thing you should do right now is nail down those beep codes. HP has beep codes which translate to video problems. Everything you need to know is in those beep codes. Listen for breaks. They might be about 1 second long.
The other comments are good. What you should also be aware of is that the hp dv6 series laptop are incredibly notorious for their graphics chips overheating, causing the solder to soften, resulting in a slight separation from the motherboard. This is not visible to the naked eye. This is caused in a design flaw by HP, the video chip is too close to the processor without enhanced cooling.
15 beeps? Are you sure there is no pause in between possible sets of beeps? I'm certain there is no beep that is 15 long.
In my case it was simply that the RAM was released and I simply have to re-seating it and it start working
The symptoms of this problem vary from laptop to laptop. But generally they begin with the wifi card having problems, the unit rapidly becomes very slow, then eventually they may result in the unit not POSTing, no video (although possible power to backlights), possible beep codes.
I open it to put thermal paste on the processor (I wasn't able to do it) and when I reassemble it, It beeps 15 times and the Caps Lock LED flashes continuously.
