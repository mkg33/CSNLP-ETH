I would guess reducing any new fields value by the summed up value of all accounts of access you have to the given resource already. 
Now you still would want to give the harbours some value in your calculations unless your algorithm/AI cannot yet interchange resources.
But you can go further by factoring in the increased amount of wood and clay needed in the early game and the increased amount of ore needed in late game by additionaly factoring in the amount of points or settlements you already have. 
Your could as you mentioned go for a ML approach here, but you might as well assign each adjacent field its expected value if rolling a set of dice, i.e. its chance [since you get 1 per roll] and maximize over the sum of chances.
If you now want to account for different resources you would factor in your current chance of getting said resource on any roll 
If you use expected values you would not need to use chances explicitly although you would calculate a risk neutral entity.
I am already adjacent to a forest with a 2, resulting in a 1/36 value, therefore another forest will be less good as if it was my first on, but it would still be very beneficiary for me.
