Ok, so I have a stupid question...  The cap came off lipstick in purse,  the thumb drive, also in the purse,  now has lipstick inside it about 1/16 of an inch. Ideas about what to do? I really need the content and am afraid to do anything that will destroy the content if any is still intact. Was getting ready to back it up as my back up thumb drive died.... (age - no abuse)
Mineral oil and a paint brush? Non-corosive, non-conductive, probably compatible with the ingredients (may actually be an ingredient). Won't rust anything.
Buy some rubbing alcohol from the supermarket.  Get the lowest percentage alcohol you can find - usually 70%.  The other 30% is benzene, which lipstick will dissolve in.  Neither are harmful to electronics and evaporate quickly.  Dip a Q-tip or similar object in the alcohol and rub away the lipstick.
Note that mica or other reflective ingredients that may be in the lip stick may be conductive, so you want flush it really well, then "dry brush" it to remove as much excess oil as you can before attempting to plug it in.
