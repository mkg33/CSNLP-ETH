I recommend you just delete all the existing ones, then create a new one, letting it use all available space.  It will then (in my experience) create a very small boot partition in addition.  And you're all set.  I'm pretty sure it gives you the option to actually format the partitions, if you want to make double sure the data is cleaned off (and verify the disk's surface is all usable).
Time out.  Why do you need killdisk?  If you want to install Windows cleanly, you do not need to do any disk erasing nor partition removing with a third-party utility.  Windows can do it for you.  Just boot the Windows install CD, and when it gets to the part where it asks what partition to install on, you can change the partitions (and remove existing ones to start completely clean).
Look at this page for the screens involved.  Notice they choose the "Custom" install option to get to the screens where it asks about partitions.
