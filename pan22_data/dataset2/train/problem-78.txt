understanding the similarities and differences in the models, the application layer in TCP/IP corresponds to layers 7/6/5 in the OSI model... 
The models are just models. The real world doesn't exactly match any of the models. There was no abandonment of OSI, or any other model. The models were created to try to explain how things would ideally work, but reality has a way of rearing its ugly head.
so what was given up with OSI when that was abandoned? did the different layers of the OSI models use different protocols, did the session layer of OSI not use HTTP, but something like HTTP? did the transport layer not use TCP but something like TCP? not IP but something like IP? 
or was the difference between the models different than just different suits of protocols (obviously OSI used the application/presentation/and session layer where TCP/IP combined all of those functions into the application layer with the web browser and the like...)
so my question is this; the TCP/IP model itself is a representation of the different protocols used in the different abstraction levels of networking. protocols of the application layer are things like web browsers, protocols of the transport layer are TCP/UDP, protocols of the network layers are IP and others, and on the link layer are protocols like ethernet and others... 
so i am going through cisco ccent/ccna. working through the text on my own just for general useful knowledge. so in the early part of the book it goes into describing the different layers of the TCP/IP suite, the protocols associated with each layer, how those layers interact with each other, and at the end compares the OSI network model.
