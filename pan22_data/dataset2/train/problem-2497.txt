Note that 2.4 gig stuff can "go further" then 5 gig equipment, but there is generally less noise in the 5 gig band.
Does anybody have any thoughts on some example technology I could use to solve this problem?  I'm currently thinking of using a mix of repeaters/high gain antenna/wireless cameras, but I'm unsure if that is realistic.
Our municipality currently has microwave linked cameras, but that's far too expensive for this temporary operation.  So I was hoping to use some sort of long-range WiFi or whatever the cheapest option is.  If necessary, I can setup repeaters along the way and I would use whatever the building had for power.  I thought of using high-gain antennas, that would totally be an option.
If its a big city you might be better off just getting a DSL connection put in though, as its a lot less work and will provide you greater reliability - particularly if there is a lot of interference.
I work for an urban municipality and we are scheduling an event where we would like to setup a cheap, temporary camera network.  I need to send the signal from downtown (where all of the cameras are) to one specific building.  This building is a minimum of 2250ft away from the most vital camera and if possible I'd like to reach 2500-3000ft.  I can most likely position a WiFi device on a large building, so I should be able to get line of sight.
If you have Fresnel clearance (ie better then just marginal line of site), and there is not too much interference from other devices, a link of that distance should be trivial by using 2 external directional antennas, as that distance is well less then 1km - indeed you should be able to get more then 5 times that range with a couple of decent antennas  (10 x that is not unheard of).
