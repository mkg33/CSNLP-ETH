After logging in to Openpanel with your openpanel-admin user, click on the User tab and in the bottom left corner, click the + symbol to create a new user (for example "user"). Just fill out the form and select openpanel-admin as the owner.
Under Domain, click on the Website tab. Click "Setup Virtual Host". Fill out the domain name (optionally enter the site admin email address) and hit Create.
Then go to the Domain tab, create a new Domain (eg. "domain.com"), and set the user you just created as the owner. Select the newly created domain in the panelâ€™s side bar and click 'Setup DNS Master'. Fill in the domain name and hit Create.
When you're finished SSH on to your server, go to your /home directory, and apply the following commands to your domain directory.
Here's a forum post from the openpanel forums regarding a similar case: http://forum.openpanel.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=439
Under Domain, click on the FTP Account tab and then "Set Up FTP Account". The username must be in the format, "user@domain.com".
Now you'll be able to upload files with your new FTP user, to your username's home directory with the appropriate permissions and the ability to make them writable for Apache.
