Find and possibly send them to a training on Incident command system.  At the Cascadia IT Conference 2011 Brent Chapman gave a great talk about "What We Can Learn from the Fire Department".  Some of the slides, and materials from a presentation of his, at a different venue can be found here.
Basically the fire department and other emergency response people have a very structure set of techniques to handle making decisions and getting things done in an emergency situation.
Make sure everyone on the team is aware that if the first line support people escalate, even incorrectly they should assist them.  Be willing to harshly punish any 2nd tier support people who are unresponsive or mistreat the NOC personally when they escalate.  (This is a major problem, the second tier person is going to resent any intrusion in their off time, but if they are not responsive the NOC will become "gun shy" and will stop escalating, or will avoid escalating to that individual.)
The best thing you can do is have good runbooks.  "If A happens, do B"  Every alert from monitoring should have a procedure, even if that procedure is "Call Bob at: "  Bob should know that if he wants the calls to stop he needs to create procedures or tools.
For NOC operations it is often helpful to "apprentice" new team members, have them work the desk with an experienced person for 2-3 weeks.
One of Brent 's recommendations was to have people be responsible for coordinating some major project or upgrades.  The point is to put them in charge of major things in a more controlled environment, then they will be better prepared to handle operate in the more chaotic situation when things break down.
