For customers using simple recovery model I'll require a copy of MDFs & LDFs extracted from a temporary disk snapshot taken at T0 at the hypervisor or SAN level. I can use these to recover the dbs at the state from T0.
To do this through Windows Server Backup you will follow the wizard steps for a manual backup ensuring that you select VSS copy backup on the custom configuration settings under VSS Settings.  This will allow your Windows Server backup to not interfere with any other backups taken on the server.  See Windows Server Backup reference for details.
Under the circumstances that you have indicated have you looked at VSS backups through a VSS provider that is either 3rd party or Microsoft based?  You can perform a COPY_ONLY backup that will not break your production recovery chain and you should end up with a backup that of all of the databases that you can then recover elsewhere to within your reasonable margins.  Keep in mind that a VSS backup has some of the same mechanisms and downfalls as database snapshots in that a very active database could cause a disk space issue due to the sparse files used.  Take a look at the TechNet resources on the SQL Writer service here and VSS backups of SQL Server here.
I do this several times a year for QA and other environments that are copies of production.  For restores, full recovery mode is really necessary and restoring to a point in time works well.  There is also a lot of replication and it is rare that we have 'row not found' errors after restoring to a point in time.  We also use the SAN clone/snapshot method for a geographically distant copy of production and that also works well for having the databases synchronized.
I'll vote @Kin's as the answer because it was the first one matching what the question asked. I ended up finding an additional answer and I'll describe it below.
