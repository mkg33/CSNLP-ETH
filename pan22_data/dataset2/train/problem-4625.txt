Lots of good answers already, but they all refer to floppy drives in the past tense. The fact is that floppy drives are still sold, though I have no idea who buys them.
Another fun fact: if you have a single physical floppy drive installed, you actually have both an A: and B: drive. If you do
A:\ and B:\ still defaults to floppy drives, of course only visible if you have one installed (only have that for fun in some of my virtual machines)
It was a virtual floppy used when copying a floppy when there was only one drive. So you would copy from A:\ to B:\ but keep taking the source and destination disks out of the same drive as the memory buffer got full.
If I remember correctly on my DOS systems they were used for floppy drives but B:\ was not generally not an actual physical floppy disk but rather a virtual one. 
While it is clear that these are used for legacy floppy disk drives, I should note that they're still used to this day by default for these ancient storage media:
The first pc I used professionally was an Apricot Xen. The internal hard drive was A: and the 3.5" floppy was B:. This was back in the day of MS-DOS 2.11, before Ibm pcs came along.
