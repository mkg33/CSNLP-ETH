For mobile storage of passwords, consider TrueCrypt volumes or files that you can store where ever convenient -- like your pendrives or even e-mail attachments. TrueCrypt is supported on almost all platforms and provides very good security when you decrypt the files for viewing. Then, you have to just take care that you do not copy or leave the file on some system (or deleted files folder).
Having said that, do not keep it encrypted with some web-space provider that gives you encryption support either -- unless your really trust them.
Lets assume that you have a lot of (different) passwords for various on-line services and equipment you own. You would want to store these in a file.
I use the diceware method of generating passwords (so that they are easier to remember than true random garbage):
I try to use password groups for access to different types of systems, to both limit the number of passwords I have to remember at any given time and to limit damage if one is compromised.
Then I change them regularly.  How regularly you change them depends on how quickly you can train yourself to remember new passwords.
If you absolutely have to, you can keep the results of the dice rolls locked up somewhere like a safe or a safety deposit box.  Re-creating the passwords from the rolls (just doing the word list lookups) is an annoying enough task to serve as a deterrent to forgetting.  And the worst part is that once you've looked up the first couple of words, you usually remember the rest anyway.
We have a PGP encrypted text file. It is encrypted to each of the sysadmin's keys. We use a vim plugin to make it easy to update.
At a previous job we used a similar scheme, but used symmetrical encryption because we hadn't discovered the plugin (or it didn't exist yet) and no one had spent the time to work out how private keys would work.
