Your problem might be that your new computer is missing some root certification authority (CA) certificates.
where you can manually download and install all third-party root certificates that are distributed via the Windows Root Certificate Program. 
The solution may be as simple as looking on your control panel for the newest programs that were loaded most recently on the same day and deleting them.  About four days ago my browser started posting an invalid certificate on every web page.  Yes even the good owes like Google, Yahoo, AOL... etc.  No matter what web page I went to, the invalid certificate warned me of the web page.  Windows defender missed them in the scan.  When you look at this issuer of the certificate it says DO_NOT_TRUST_FiddlerRoot.  There we about four or five programs that were installed on the same day.  Once of them was named Browser Safeguard and it was installed on the same day as the other four programs so I deleted it too then rebooted.  I also went to:
I am not sure why ESET thinks this is a good feature. I already sent and email to their support, but according to them the problem is with my system. This is interesting, since the same problem occured on 3 other computers since I sent that email. Maybe the next update will fix it.
With an old Notebook (Samsung N150 - win7 starter), I have successfully used the freeware version of Windows repair.
Some antivirus overrides the root certs too. For example I had the same problem by ESET Smart Security on win7 and win8.1 systems. The solution was to turn off "SSL protocol filtering" completely.
Internet Explorer/Internet Options/Connections/Local Area Network (LAN) Settings  and uncheck the Proxy Server box.
I first rebooted in safe mode as told by the software and re-installed the windows version (Win7 32).
