Certain resources can only be monitored via Classic API (such as Classic VMs, Classic Storage, Cloud Services, Service Bus and WebApps).  Classic resources require a certificate to communicate with Azure API and this certificate enables access to everything in the Classic model.  This was one of the shortcomings of the classic models in Azure which is why ARM API was introduced with its role-based access.
Furthermore, depending on the resources you're monitoring with CloudMonix, they maybe monitored without talking to Azure API at all (such as SQL Azure, VMs, Service Bus, Storage, etc).  This may mean less functionality but still workable for monitoring and automating purposes.
When dealing with v2/ARM resources, such as v2 VMs, Storage, Backup, Stream Analytics, etc (Setup Wizard in CloudMonix clearly identifies which method supports which resources), you can provision CloudMonix via the Setup Wizard to create a "CloudMonix" user account with your Azure AD.  After Setup Wizard is over, you can remove certain permissions from CloudMonix user whereby limiting its reach.
