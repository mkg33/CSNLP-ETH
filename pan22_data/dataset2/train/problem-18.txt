The proof consists of deriving a lower bound on $B(n,n^k)$, the number of boolean functions on $n$ inputs computed by formulas of size $n^k$. By comparing $B(n,n^k)$ to the number of circuits of size $C = n^k/k$, which is at most $C^{C}e^{C+4n}$, it can be realized that for large $n$, $C^{C}e^{C+4n} << B(n,n^k)$, and the result follows.
(Recall that a nondeterministic circuit has, in addition to the ordinary inputs $x = (x_1,\dots,x_n)$, a set of "nondeterministic" inputs $y=(y_1,\dots,y_m)$. A nondeterministic circuit $C$ accepts input $x$ if there exists $y$ such that the circuit output $1$ on $(x,y)$). 
It looks to me that the result could be strengthened by noting that the number of nondeterministic circuits of size $n^k$ with $m$ nondeterministic inputs is not much larger than the number of deterministic circuits of size $n^k$ (for $m$ not too large, say $m=n$). Hence, I think the following corollary holds:
Obviously, the lower bound on $B(n,n^k)$ is also a lower bound on the number of boolean functions on $n$ inputs computed by circuits of size $n^k$, hence "formula complexity at most $n^k$" can be replaced by "circuit complexity at most $n^k$" in the corollary. The corollary can also be stated as: for functions with polynomial circuit complexity, switching to nondeterministic circuits cannot, on average, decrease the complexity by more than a constant factor.
