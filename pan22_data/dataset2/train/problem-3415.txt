Pulp is a more modern solution to the problem, which specifically targets package & patch management, audit etc. This is something that puppet/chef can do on their own with some amount of effort. Pulp only does packages and Yum, and leaves the Config management to puppet/chef, which is how it should be. It's got a Rest api for scripting etc.
Yes we use puppet for a large cluster patch and administrative management. Another alternative for small sets is to create a local yum repo and deploy changes with custom RPM packaging. 
Can anyone suggest a method of centralising patch management for these servers? I've heard that Puppet is often used to do this but I've never used it myself, and would be interested in hearing from other system administrators.
I would recommend something along the lines of Spacewalk. It is basically the free version of Red Hat's Satellite software.
The environment consists of CentOS 5 & 6, and Oracle Linux 5 & 6 boxen. All of these are patched individually via their appropriate yum repos.
