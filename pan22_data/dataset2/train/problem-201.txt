Of course if neither is possible, I may set up AutoHotkey or something to associate Ctrl-Ctrl with Google.com.
Although Google Desktop was discontinued long ago, I kept the installer and was able to continue to use it. The functionality that I used the most was "hit Ctrl twice and bring up a Google search". This is not "bring up Google.com in the browser" but it is a search box that appears on top of whatever windows I have open, and after typing the query and hitting Enter it directs me to Google.com with the search results displayed.
You can configure a hotkey to directly start your browser, then search directly from there; usually most keyboards and laptops have a dedicated "home page" launcher key that serve this purpose.
(Note that this hotkey does not always bring up the search box, such as when running a browser in fullscreen mode.)
An alternative could be the free or paid tool Lookeen. The free version offers all features of the paid version but only indexes drive C: . Another nice feature you may like is the the start on double ctrl tap ;).
I still have it installed, but somehow the Ctrl-Ctrl hotkey stopped working. (Maybe because of a Windows update.) What I'm looking for is
