One thing to note however: ProgramData is the “All Users” data folder, so it applies to all users on the system. This isn’t an issue if you are the only user, but for a shared system (or one in which you have more than one user account), the files will be removed for all users. (Ostensibly it wouldn’t matter since the whole program is gone, but it’s still worth remembering.)
Not really. That would require some kind of program that has a (massive) database of leftover files, folders, and registry entires of thousands (millions?) of random, third-party programs. The best you can hope for and “easy, automated” solution is to use a “clean up” program such as CCleaner to scan for for some application residue. The problem is that these tend to have two limitations:
I’m afraid that your best bet is indeed to go through the folders and manually examine them and delete anything you no longer need. It’s not nearly as bad as it seems though; I’ve done it countless times over the years and it’s actually a fairly simple, pseudo-mindless chore that can be done while watching TV or something.
