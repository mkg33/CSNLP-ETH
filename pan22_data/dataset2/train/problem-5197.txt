There is no way to "upgrade" to USB 2.0, if you see yellow triangles in Device manager, it means that the device is not installed, so you can go to the manufacturers website (for example Intel.com) and download latest drivers.
It says, "look into 'Device Manager - Other Devices' but the problem is, I don't have 'Other Devices' listed there.
If however there are no triangles and it is fully installed, you cannot upgrade a USB 1/1.1 socket to 2.0
If you really want USB 2.0, you can get a card that can give you 4 for really cheap (less than Â£5) if you look online, and possibly cheaper for eBay, won't be a named brand, but nearly all the designs are the same and should get the job done.
If your controller (talking about the hardware part) is following the USB 1.x norm, there is no way to upgrade it to USB 2.0, it's linked to the hardware, not to a software or driver upgrade.
A USB controller, and associated ports can be made according to the USB 1.x, or 2.0 norm. In each case, as long as you use a recent operating system (from Windows XP), drivers for it will be automatically installed.
