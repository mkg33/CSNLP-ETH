I don't know why, if someone could explain why. I thought ./vars would just run all commands in the script, including the exports, so they would be in your env. Anywhay, putting an extra .  in front of the command works for me. 
Check your permissions to the requires easy-rsa folders and /etc/ssl... In my case I had to run this as root:
The KEY_DIR environment variable specifies a directory that needs to exist, which I had to create and initialize.
If you're using OpenVPN 2.x you might check whether you are making changes in the correct directory, possibly you may need to be working in:
You should be able to determine the correct scripts by looking at the 'vars' scripts finding out which one points the KEY_DIR variable to the one you actually use (e.g. /etc/openvpn/keys, or /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys, or /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/2.0/keys)
I don't know how CentOS packages their install, but I've seen the above as the solution in a few places.
For me, the solution was to create the keys directory. I also needed to create index.txt and initialize serial.
