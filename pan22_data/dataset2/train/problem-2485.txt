Okay, we kept on trying to resolve it and eventually found out what caused it: The Word file that was being spell-checked was apparently somehow corrupted.
Note that if the average number of fragments by file is low the slowdowns are probably not caused by it.  
The content displayed, but there were some incorrect fonts and other weird artefacts. When the user switched to a different file, the issue was resolved.
If that works OK, then perhaps try copying/pasting the contents of the old file over top of the new file (again using Notepad), and see how that works.
Since it's plain text, you can rename it (with Word closed), make a new text file name CUSTOM.DIC, add a few words via Notepad or another text editor, and try Word again.
To do that grab Contig on Sysinternals site and use it like this to get the number of fragments of that file:
Note the "Average fragmentation" value and if it is above 1 frag/file run that command again, this time without the "-a" argument:
Word seems to have a problem with "big" custom dictionnaries and that reflects a bad development practice, every modern app should handle multi-megabytes files like this gracefully.
