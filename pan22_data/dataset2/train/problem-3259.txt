Instead of setting your DNS to automatic, set it to manual and put in your primary DNS servers.  Then you can input as many DNS servers as you want.
While I'm not sure how Group Policy will interact with this, you can manually edit the registry value HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\SearchList to contain a comma separated (no spaces!) list of domain name suffixes that get appended to your DNS.
After making the change, you have to renew your DHCP lease as a way of getting the DHCP client to run so you can apply the change:
What are you trying to accomplish with the additional DNS? Are you trying to get to another resource? The answer is likely no, as workarounds like adding an entry to a host file, or creating a static route will be disabled if you are a standard user. 
Personally, the way I do this, is have my DNS servers setup with forwarders, i.e. they forward requests to other domains to get the answers and I simply put my suffix list in there, but my PC only queries my domain's DNS servers.  I don't have to type FQDNs.
Add to the end of that key any domains you want to add to your search list -- although this key may entirely replace your search list.  This list should be comma-separated with no whitespace.
I found a way to do this which is probably a workaround and which won't work on a locked-down box where you don't have admin rights.  Edit the registry key:
You'll probably want to change your suffix behaviour so it looks up the other domains too - this bit is probably more important in terms of helping you avoid typing FQDNs and instead just type hostnames.
