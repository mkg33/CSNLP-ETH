For example, I use Empathy, but if I happen to have a Gmail page open, I see the conversation in both places.
instead of enforcing the message to be delivered to ALL running clients, the protocol should leave it up to the developer to decide whether he want the message to spread among all clients or just the active one.
I believe that's actually standard Jabber protocol handling. It's not a chatroom, it's designed to only send it to the place the person was last signed in, not be spammy to all devices/sessions. 
the fact that many clients also cache the session is an additional security issue that needs to be addressed.
We're using Google Talk as our unofficial-official chat client around the office at work.  One thing that poses a big problem almost every day is the fact that Google Talk only sends a message to the clients that you last used.  Even though you may be logged into GTalk on 3 different machines, if you start talking on one machine, that becomes your "active" machine, and if you go to another machine, you will still only get messages on the last active machine.  Is there a way that you can force Google Talk to send messages to ALL logged in clients, regardless of which client you are actively using?  That way, you don't miss any messages during the time between when you get up from the active machine and then make the new client "active".
Google Talk speaks the Jabber Protocol. Perhaps a different jabber client would work better for your purposes.
