Since then, as time has been passing, the number in those parenthesis have been incrementing, and today I am up to [MyName]'s Macbook Pro (4). 
I am still using the default screensaver, which (when the computer was new) said [MyName]'s Macbook Pro followed by an image of the apple logo.
After a few weeks of owning the computer, the screensaver just changed, seemingly on it's own, to say [MyName]'s Macbook Pro (2).
This is a glitch I've experienced caused by your mac reconnecting to your local network and thinking another computer of the same name is already connected. I'm not sure why it does that, but your computer adds a number to change it's name and avoid what it thinks is two computers with the same name on the network. You can reset the name by going to System Preferences-> Sharing, and editing your computer's name. 
If you go into System Preferences > Sharing and change the computer name to something other than the default, I would guess that name would be used by the screensaver, instead of your current string, and not keep getting re-assigned.
Resetting my router solved this problem for me- it's usually done by putting a paper clip inside a hole on the back of the router
