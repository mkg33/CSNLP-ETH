A good frequently-tested and well-maintained UPS is often worth much more than all the work that goes into redundant protocols.
HSRP is good and not difficult.  But be very wary of putting in fault-tolerance you're not monitoring -- it's very easy to be lulled into a sense of security ("it's okay, we have HSRP") when perhaps one of them has been off for a year.
Consider half the switches/users going to one router, half to the second, with some very easy method to move the users.  When you reject this, ask yourself how you'll test and monitor the HSRP.
Think carefully about any complexity that you're adding, and when thinking of risks, don't allow yourself just to think that all downtime is bad.  "Mean Time To Repair" is often much more important than "Mean Time To Failure".
if the question is it will HSRP work with a TP-LINK switch, then yes, just make sure that both routers can see the same VLAN you are attempting to provide HSRP,  if you are looking at HSRP for multiple VLANS, you'll need a dot1q trunk from the switches to the routers.
As a generalisation, I'd say half-a-dozen smaller switches is better than only a few larger and more powerful switches.  It's simple, and growth is in smaller chunks.
as a side note, this is basically a Â£100 switch, you might be asking a lot for attaching 250-300 hosts.
