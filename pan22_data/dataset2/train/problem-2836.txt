You really should look at http://foldersize.codeplex.com/releases?ReleaseName=FolderSize.Win32.1.0.7.0 it rocks!  Easy graphical way to see who is chewing up what space.  
You can see that WinDirStat shows 14,9GB for the winsxs directory. These 14,9GB equal the amount of what du (see earlier answer) return as size (if you take 15.620.679.650 and divide it by (1024*1024*1024) you get a rounded 14,9) 
Have you looked into the Microsoft tool diruse? It's a command line tool that does exactly what you're looking for. It's part of the server tools for Windows 2000 & 2003, but is still available for download: Microsoft Diruse TechNet article.
The only thing I'm not sure about is how it handles hard-links and junction points. It might be worth experimenting with.
Today I had to check how much space certain directories consume and found out that one of them makes heavy use of hardlinks (which could cause certain files be considered in the sum more than once).
It may be a little lowbrow for Server Fault, but Tree Size Free (http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/) will do that quite well, especially if you're just trying for a one time use.  The Professional version has a lot of nice features that I use for ongoing maintenance.
An all-default install of Cygwin (a POSIX emulation layer for Windows) includes the du utility from the GNU core utilities collection, and it is fully hard-link and junction-point aware. I believe Cygwin (and thus du) treats junction points as soft-links.
