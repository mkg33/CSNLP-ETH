A few other things include the optional () around arguments of arrow functions only when the arguments is just one (() required for none or multiple). {} is also optional if you just do one-liner arrow function bodies.
Also, your configs are in a file? I suggest you use environment variables instead, especially when you're dealing with API keys. Config files are easily accidentally checked-in into the repo and we all know Git doesn't forget anything that's checked in. You wouldn't want anyone using an API under your name for malicious purposes.
This is a simple repository where I want to save all the invoices of some queried users. I wanted this module to only expose a simple saveInvoices method and return a Promise. 
As a DB, I use Firebase whose API is async but does not return standard JS promises so I promisify the db queries.
I see you're using modules. Consider moving Repository to its own module. That way, you can take advantage of encapsulation inside a module file and remove the need for an IIFE.  You can then export only the APIs you want exposed. I even don't use _ anymore to mark private functions as export is a good enough indicator that it is exposed outside the module.
