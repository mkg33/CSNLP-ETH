If it turns out to be CPU bound and you have a 2-core CPU, try turning down the number of CPUs in the VM configuration to 1.  I don't know why exactly, but I was majorly CPU-bound on my laptop, and that turned out to be magic change.  A lot of others on the vmware forums have found this to be true as well.
I have a similar setup.  The RAM is ok, and the CPU is ok, but the high disk queue causes the guest OS to be very slow.
Your issue is almost certainly disk I/O.   Upgrade to a 2nd gen SSD or use an external drive to run the VM.  
Watching the CPU meter is an easy to way to know if it's CPU-bound.  To know if it's disk I/O bounce is a little bit more work (at least for me).  But it's not hard at all.  Use a tool called Iometer, which is a storage performance testing tool.  You should be able to get a decent comparison of performance by running the same test in your non-VM OS against your VM OS.  I have a little blog entry on the subject here.
I would suggest starting performance monitor on the host, and then starting the guest vm computer.  My guess is that you'll see the Disk Queue pegged at the top most of the time, causing the slowness.  If not, post what you do see as the bottleneck.
If it turns out to be I/O bound, and you really need the performance, you can either use a fast external drive for the VM, buy a solid state drive, or use a different solution like bootable VHDs (if you're on windows).  (Sorry - I'd post links to more of this stuff, but as a new user, I can only include one link.  For the VHD solution, google for 'Hanselman bootable VHD')
