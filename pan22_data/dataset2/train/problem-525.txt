You could take www.opendns.org for a spin, you can use it to block social sites and timewasters like youtube. It logs how many hit's the sites get and when. And oh, it's free and would plugin your crappy D-link router.
This is not a problem with a technological solution. Your activity logs, both of theirs and yours, are so easily falsifiable as to be useless. Attempting this would not reflect well on you, and if I were an investor, I'd see such an attempt as pure poison to the working environment.
If I were you, I would just outright block social networking sites during certain time periods. If you want to dick around on facebook all day, stay at home, when your at work, you work. And if they don't like it, skilled programmers are very easy to come by. Well, the second part isn't true (my whole college is filled with computer science students who can barely remember a statement in C++). And ironicly many of those same students surf on facebook during class. But, I am available :D.
But, seriously, I would block social networking sites. If they complain, block more. Though, I did read it CAN boost productivity if you let them on (as they won't be thinking about it all day long...kind of like drugs), so as a compromise I would say open it during opening time, lunch time, and closing time.
