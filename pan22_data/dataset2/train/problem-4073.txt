For example, I had a bunch of folders, say they are named 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. and inside all of those folders were more folders which contained files. I wanted to move all the files in any given root folder (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) up to that top level folder (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.). I found that using WinRAR I could zip all those top level folders up (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc.) using "store" for compression to minimize processing time. Then I simply unzipped them using the right click button menu again "extract each archive to separate folder." Before doing the unzip though I had to "save settings" in WinRAR with the setting Extract-->Advanced Menu-->File Paths: "Do not extract paths" and every zip file was unzipped to it's own folder with all files inside (no matter how may folders/subfolders inside) in the top level. 
I found another way to do this...it takes more time and HDD space but it allows you to do this without knowing the lowest level directory name. So instead of having to know the lowest level folder is named "images", it can literally be anything.
