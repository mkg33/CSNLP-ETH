Via Ubuntu HWE I was running 3.19.x kernel for a good while; it'd end up swapping out like 200-300MB of stuff, but apparently it was unused stuff, there wouldn't be any swap activity from it having to swap it in later as far as I could tell.   
Short story - try a different kernel version.  I have a system that showed OOM errors with 4.2.0-x and 4.4.0-x kernels, but not with 3.19.0-x.
I've got a Compaq DC5000 still in service here -- currently with 512MB of RAM (and some portion of that, like 32-128MB, being given to the onboard video..)  Mostly serving NFS, I do have a monitor hooked up to it so occasionally I'll log into it (Ubuntu Classic, no Unity.)
4.2.0-x kernel and now 4.4.0-x kernel, I can start a chunky NFS write to it, only 220MB into the swap (i.e. 1.3GB free), and it'll start OOM killing things.  I won't claim if it's a kernel bug or "tuning issue" (like a 64MB reserve that's normally fine, but too high on a ~400MB or so system?)
No disrespect to those who are saying it's somehow breaking just because he expects to use swap; with all due respect you're wrong.  It won't be fast, but I used to go 1 or 2GB into the swap on a few 512MB-1GB systems.  Of course some types of software mlock's a bunch of RAM but in my case (since I'm running the same software just on a different kernel) this is clearly not the case.
