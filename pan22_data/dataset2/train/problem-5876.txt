Perhaps you're performing backups to disk or tape in which case you might have to perform a full restore to get it back.
This is a bit old, but haven't heard of anything else: http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?21,135990,137776#msg-137776
Perhaps you're logging/auditing such operations using a trigger or similar, in which case you could find the data that was changed and do the 'opposite' to restore it.
Perhaps you're replicating the database every so often to another server - you could restore the data from there.
I want to know that is there any way that I can can recover the deleted or updated record in the sqlserver and mysql as well?
The exceptions to this are if you are doing a delete inside an open Transaction, in those cases you can "Rollback" the transaction to undo any changes made inside the transaction.
If the above url did not help you, you can try to recover this third party RecoveryFix for SQL Software. This software will restore data in working condition.
If you are performing the DELETE within a TRANSACTION, the action can always be rolled-back until you COMMIT it.
Failing all that - and short of forensic recovery - unless you can remember the data that was there, it's gone.
