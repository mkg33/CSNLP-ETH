Use SysrescCD which comes with gparted and huge amount of other hd utils. You also can install Gentoo linux using it (you can install gentoo using almost any live cd with 2.6 kernel).
Ubuntu supports resizing an existing Windows partition during installation, that's probably going to be your best bet. Just defrag first so that all the data gets moved to the beginning of the disk and you'll be OK :)
Also you can buy Acronis Disk Director Suite and repartition your harddrive using it (it's also great tool but it's not free).
Also of note if you're just wanting to "try it out", Ubuntu offers a Live CD that you can boot off directly. You can also install to a USB device if you're looking for a temporary/test solution. 
If you're willing to shell out a few bucks, then Partition Magic will give you more flexibility in resizing partitions (including auto-defrag, well at least last time I used it)
It allows you to resize partitions without reformatting. The home edition is freeware and it often compared to Partition Magic as a free alternative.
Partition management software such as Partition Magic will allow you to do this. However, make sure you have a full backup of everything important before you do this, it usually works fine, but when your altering disk partition data it pays to be careful.
If you can empty one of the partitions, you can delete it (My Computer => Manage => Disk Management) and then you can Linux-format it.
Please give serious consideration to installing virtualization software. Microsoft's Virtual PC and Sun's VirtualBox offer free virtualization solutions which provide quick and safe ways to "install and try out" systems/installations without hacking up your system into little pieces.
