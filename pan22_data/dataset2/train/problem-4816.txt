I think that there is an iroute conf missing. Simply put you need to create a ccd folder and specify the path to it in the openvpn conf file like so:
The Amazon server is able to communicate with Router A on our LAN without issue (ping, ssh), however when we try to ping from Router A to the private IP of the server, it does not get through. Using tcpdump we see the echo request on Gateway A's eth0 interface, but we do not see anything on the tun1 interface. It seems like it is not being properly forwarded to the tun0 interface. Using OpenVPN's configuration we have made it so that clients should be able to act as a Gateway.
We are trying to configure an OpenVPN tunnel that allows devices on our LAN to communicate with servers in an Amazon VPC. We are using the turnkey OpenVPN access server instance on Amazon and have followed documentation to set up our local server as a Gateway. 
Into that folder you should create a single file which would correspond with the specific vpn conf ( if you have username-as-common-name in the conf then the name of the cert is the name of the file) and into that file put the internal subnet e.g.
