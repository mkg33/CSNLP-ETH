Since you said all tiles are 16x16px you will likely have very many of them in each level of your game. This would mean that you would have very, very many Sprites.
Having all Tiles be Actors that draw their sprite in the Actor's draw() call is an option. Of course there are many ways to draw a map, but this definitely is one of them. However I would warn against using Sprites.
With this class I can very easily ask it for a Texture, and if the Texture has already been loaded it will give it to me, if it has not yet been loaded, then it will be, and it will also be added to the ObjectMap for later use. This ensures you only load each texture exactly once and can re-use them for every Tile (just store a reference to the Texture in each Tile and draw it at the Tile's position in its draw call).
What I would advise is for you to use Textures because these are very basic objects that do not hold any data besides their image, which means you can easily recycle them. What I do for my games is have one local class that handles all of my textures, because I do not want to be creating a new Texture for every Tile, if they are using the same image.
