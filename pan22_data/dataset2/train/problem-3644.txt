If I were you I would do it in python, for me it's less confusing then BATCH Files (*.bat), and you can find recepies for almoust all that you want to do, all you need to do is glue then togheter(the right way :) )
If it were possible to merely remove passwords, without extracting, winrar's encryption would be broken (from my understanding, anyway).
Since each file is encrypted using the passphrase/password, it logically follows that in order to un-encrypt you need the password, which you have.
WinRAR use real hard encryption. "Remove" password mean decrypt all data. I dont know, but wery possible encryption done in one operation with compression. Therefore "remove" password require decompression.
Use a DOS Batch file with the command FORFILES, to cicle all files, with the command to unrar with the password and thn rar it back up again without password. And finally delete the unnecessary files.
So I don't really see how it is possible - just write a batch file to un-encrypt them all overnight.
