My boyfriend was burning disks for a guy and he thought they weren't burning because after he burned one he looked at it and the computer showed it as blank... luckily for him I stuck it in the dvd player and it worked just fine... the computer could burn it but not read it, which was very odd.
I burned an ISO image of a Linux distribution in a DVD-RW disc that I had. The disc is quite old (it only supports up to 2x burning speed), but after burning it, the resulting disc was recognized in both of my computers, a PC and a Macbook Pro. However, when I took it to a HP G62 laptop, it didn't recognize the disc at all; instead, it shows up in the DVD drive as an empty disc ("4.3 Gb. free space"). The laptop's DVD drive, as far as I could find out, supports both +RW and -RW.
Why causes this? I thought that perhaps the disc is too old, but as I mentioned, both of my computers can read it perfectly.
Some brands of disks just don't work on some computers... if you have another of the same disks I would burn it again just like you did the first one to test this theory.
