There is no built in file unlocker however the unlocker gui utility mentioned in another suggestion can be called from the command line once installed.
You cannot delete a file from cmd that is in use. Try re-booting and deleting right after the boot, when some services aren't running. Otherwise, look for the process that is using the file and kill it and then the file, or find online software to delete a file that is in use.
If application can't be deleted because it is in use by your system, You could try locating file (if you know the location of the file, if not find it via Task manager/processes bar) and "cd" via cmd to its folder. Then try "TASKKILL /f /pid "appname" & del /f "appname"", this will kill the running process and try to immidiately delete the executable. If it doesn't work, try a couple of times so it doesn't have time to restart the process and can be permanently removed in that time frame.
If the file is not a library, there's no easy built-in command to figure out who is using it.  In that case, I would recommend Process Explorer from Sysinternals.  From there, you can search for open handles and find out which programs are using which files.
