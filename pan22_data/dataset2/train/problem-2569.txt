You may try autologon form sysinternals. It permits you to make windows logon automaticaly under a specified account with the credentials encrypted.
For a Windows 2008 domain member, add AutoAdminLogon as a string value (REG_SZ)  with a value of 1 to the key
Are you absolutely sure you need to do that? It's always a security risk to have a user (or administrator) logged in locally to a server. If you need to start a program or something that is not available as service, have a look at Group Policy (Active Directory) or the Local Security Policy (if not in a domain). You can define scripts that will be run after boot (or before shutdown, after login/logout, etc) without user interaction.
Have a look at http://sourceforge.net/projects/runasservice/. It's a tool to run an existing application as a service. This service should use your desired user account. This should solve your problem.
On the Users tab, uncheck the box "Users must enter a username..." and then add the username and password to autologon with.
You say you need the program to run in a specific user session.  Can't you just schedule a task for that program and use that user's credentials?  You'll get the whole user settings: my documents, settings, etc, just as if the user was present.
