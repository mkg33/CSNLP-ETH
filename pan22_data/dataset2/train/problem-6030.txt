Since there seems to be no icon for it (or I can't find it at the moment)... I don't remember what it's called or where it's loaded, how to find/download it again, etc. I've tried googling a couple times...
Anyone know which 'utility' does this?? Or... how to isolate what software is running (on old laptop) that allows this to happen?
In start menu, type netplwiz, then run it. Clear the check box on "Users must enter ...", when you click Apply, enter your password on the dialog box.
I got a new laptop and can't figure out one of the tweaks I installed on my old laptop... to copy it to the new one.
It was just nice to start the computer, walk away... then come back and log in...right to a fully loaded desktop...without waiting for everything to load up.
What it is: Windows 7 would start up to the Login screen, but would continue booting to the desktop (in the background), essentially turning the Login screen into a Lockscreen.
Now, on Explorer, open %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup create a new Shortcut there, on Target, enter rundll32.exe user32.dll, LockWorkStation
nice idea. The way I see it, you can duplicate the functionality by setting the Windows 7 to automatically logon, then set it to automatically lock upon logging in.
Of course, the security risk would be if someone disable or delete the shortcut you just created (easy if they access your computer when logged in or they have administrator access), or just simply disable it while it just logged in before the lock command executed, then your computer is now wide open for anyone without password.
