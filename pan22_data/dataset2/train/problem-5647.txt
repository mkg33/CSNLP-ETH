If you just want a machine that works and do not care if its a Windows machine, then download Ubuntu Linux.  If you havent tried it before, give it a shot.  The install is easy, but it will erase everything on your drive.
I would not recommend keygens or anything that isnt legal.  You are asking for malware issues on the machine used to download the  keygen.
It's really simple - if you have a "Certificate of Authenticity" either stuck to the case or with the discs, then Microsoft will always (in my experience anyway) activate windows.  If they refuse then morally and probably legally (I'm talking about a court of law not what MS's license may say) you are fine to install Windows in whatever way you can.
If there are files that you need to save, then the Ubuntu Live CD will let you retrieve those before performing the install.
If not, unless you are the statistical anomaly one in a thousand that has legitimately lost the serial, then you have a pirate copy of Windows and MS are quite rightly not going to help.
As suggested you may be able to use a Nisoft or Magical jelly bean Windows key recoverer, perhaps from a boot disc or safe mode - call Microsoft with this and at least they will able to tell you if it is legit - if so they will help you.
If you don't have the serial/key and you are not the original purchaser no software company will ever help you.
Try the new Ubuntu 10.04! It is free to download and install, perfectly legal. No activation code needed and it will always be genuine.
