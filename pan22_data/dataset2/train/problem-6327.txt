I'm also seeking a solution for this problem (using Strikethrough for a to-do list).  I couldn't find a plugin and I think creating one would be the best way to go. 
I know this is like a year+ later, but there is a feature in Notepad++ to "Hide Lines" just highlight and right click. Then at the bottom of the menu, there is a Hide Lines feature which Hides a specified line and then can be clicked to be reopened. Also, On the left side next to the line number you can click on the line number and it will put a blue circle which can act as a checkbox.
As a work-around until that happens, what I'm doing is setting the language of my to-do list (a .txt file) to the "Properties" language.  Then, when I'm done with that task, I put a '#' in front of it to make a comment (which color-codes the line as green and you can customize the color).  Not as good as a strike-through but it gets the job done.
If you don't have option to strikethrough your style, you can set style to use some strikethroug font. This should be easy to find and download.
I didn't find strike through feature within notepad++ plugins.But I press CTRL+T which makes the line go up and then I select all the lines together, right click and select some style which separate the specific lines from other. This is useful for a list of work and divide it in done and undone work lists.
You could right click on the line and use one of the marking styles (Using 1st Style, etc.). That won't do strikethrough, but it will highlight the line in a background you can choose by selecting which style and configure the styles in Settings > Style Configurator.
