I personally would prefer to just get the source from http://subversion.tigris.org and do the usual "configure && make && make check && sudo make install" dance.
The subversion 1.4.0 tar file includes spec files for building RPM's under RHEL3/4 as well.  You should be able to use those for creating the RPM.
But, I agree with the previous answer, if there's no really overriding need for the RPM, just do the standard "configure && make && make install".
The easiest method would be to find a source rpm for a similar distribution. You should then be able to rebuild on your distribution. I believe there is a script called rpmbuild which will do most of the work for you.
If you really need and rpm for later package management ease, I would try getting this source rpm svn 1.4.0 sources for SuSE 10.2, install that, cd to /usr/src//SPECS then
Creating an RPM from scratch is probably more work than you'll want to do and more involved than can be described here.
Unless you need to distribute this to others, I would just use configure, make, make install. I typically set prefix to something like /opt or /usr/local, and I keep all the original tars in a directory like /root/packages/ so I have a reasonable audit trail and know what I have installed and therefore what to uninstall. 
The OpenSuse project provides a build service that can help you easily package RPM's for not only OpenSuse/SLES, but Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu and Mandriva.  All in one fell swoop.
