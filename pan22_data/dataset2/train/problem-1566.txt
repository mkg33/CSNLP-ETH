Conventions like the FHS leave entire trees under /opt for site local software or /srv for serving data. Remember you can also mount at deeper points of the tree, like /var/lib/pgsql or /var/mail.  /home, convenient for your users even if you don't need to put system service data there. Any or all of these can be data mount points.
Behavior of EC2 root devices is well documented. A benefit of data volumes is not being a root device implies unlikely to be automatically deleted. Test instance termination on less-important instances. If this deletes an important volume, test your backup restore processes too. Do not fear unknown behavior or change, that is what test environments and a business continuity plan are for.
Where your data is and how big your volumes need to be is your decision. Separate data volumes allow mobility between instances, and easier resizing.
Create data volumes. Optionally mount them somewhere temporary (/mnt) if you need to copy data from the old location. mount them permantly in fstab, ideally identifying volumes by stable names like LABEL or UUID.
