Sending firefox over the VPN is easy if you set up a proxy at the far end and point Firefox at that proxy. By virtue of needing to go to the ip of the proxy server, it will get routed over the vpn, or to nowhere if you aren't connected.
Most VPN's are able to push to the client whether they become the default gateway or not for connected clients. This is a little misleading since you can't just change gateway's or you're dead where you stand, but it does intercept traffic headed to the internet and points it at the PPTP/VPN endpoint/whatever. The opposite of this is called split-tunneling where you allow, say, internet traffic to proceed normally, but anything destined for the internal network gets shoveled over the VPN.
As for a SOCKS type of proxy for Ubuntu, you can usually bend SSH to do this with the -L or -D options, or you could try tsocks.
It sounds like you may be looking for a SOCKS type of proxy. That's the only thing under Windows that I recall being able to route based on TCP port. While not application routing per se, it was able to route some things independently of others.
