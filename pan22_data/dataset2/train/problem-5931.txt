However, it must be noted that different cluster validation measures may produce different validation results, and as a consequence, your best clustering solution may vary depending on the chosen measure. Therefore, even the choice of a validation measure is subjective. Once again, knowledge about your data is very important to take this decision.
It is very hard to evaluate the correctness of the results produced by an unsupervised algorithm. In many cases, such evaluation will be totally subjective, and it will require some knowledge about the domain of the problem.
If we focus on clustering algorithms (as stated in a previous answer, PCA is not a clustering algorithm), many cluster validation measures may be applied, like the ones enumerated in the "Evaluation and assessment" section in the "Cluster analysis" Wikipedia page. These measures return a number that you can use to compare different clustering solutions, in terms of cluster compactness (how close to each other are the elements within each cluster) and separation (how far to each other are the elements from different clusters). You can, of course, use these measures in order to perform hyperparameter selection (lattice size, structure, learning rate, etc.) by means of cross validation.
