When starting with a new mail profile (which gets created when you configure your new computer), Outlook is unaware of what has been downloaded already by another mail profile. That is why Outlook starts to download all the messages again.
You say that it results in tens-of-thousands of messages being downloaded. Which indicates that you are using "leave on server" and should follow Mike's advice about IMAP!
OE is retaining your messages for some reason. Check the option to remove messages (or to remove messages after X days). I'm on Vista w/ WinMail so I don't recall where that setting is, exactly.
Whats happening is you have a corrupted email, this happens only with POP.  If you use IMAP it will never happen, but with imap you cannot store copies on the server...
I also recommend IMAP over POP, simply b/c it's easier to use multiple computers to check your mail, and you see the same messages regardless which computer you use.
Update: Outlook 2010 stores the download history in the pst-file itself and should not re-download the mails when you configured Outlook to download your mails to your existing pst-file instead of a new one.
A quick fix that you can do is go onto your mailserver (or whatever source is sending you the 5000 emails to download) and create a new folder (i.e. old inbox).  Then move all of the messages to that folder.  That will fix the problem because there will be nothing to download.  This fixed my problem.
