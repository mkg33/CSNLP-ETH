I've tried the repair of the system through the recovery mode, only first just that the server can only acknowledge the system include the RAID driver manually. I've done repair and I still couldn't solve the problem. Anyone have an idea to solve the problem?
Migrating between physical servers in the way you're proposing isn't really a thing. Can it be done? Sometimes. It's nearly always quite painful though.
You can do backup of your existing Win 2008 R2 (over network) and then new install. And when you do new install - you can do recover from backup.
Instead, install a fresh OS on the new server and move services over gradually to the new server until the old one is idle. 
In fact, while you're at it, you might as well start using a virtualization layer (either VMware ESXi or Hyper-V), after which you'll never have to deal with difficult migrations in the future. 
Have a look at this article where the whole process is explained rather nicely https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755163 
I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 installed on a HP Server with Simple 1 TB HD (no RAID). I need to migrate to a new Dell server with RAID 1 level T630 (2 x 2 TB), just that I'm having a hard time to migrate because the system does not boot.
