This doesn't really sound like a false positive if your site cannot be reached from that network.  But you might be getting notices that are not useful if you don't have your dependencies/notifications setup in a way that is useful.
Question - is there a solution to some kind distributed monitoring? In example if there is network problem between monitorA and WWW server notification will not be send until there will be same problem on monitorB ?
Do you have parent hosts set up?  If so, Nagios can detect the difference between down and unreachable, and you can decide how to handle unreachable vs. down.  http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/networkreachability.html
I have two Nagios (monitorA and monitorB) servers in different datacenters. On both I have configured same WWW host.
If you are monitoring the right things your nagios system should be telling you that the Internet link has failed at one of the datacenters rather then notifying you about all the services it can't reach because the network link is down.
Can you setup a check to verify that the network link is good, between nagios instance and the network your web site is hosted on?  Then setup your dependencies and notifications so that you are notified that the link between the nagios system and the is the problem?
When network problem occurs, I am flooded with false-positive notifications about unavailability of WWW host.
