I'm curious as to what your plan is here. You're trying to run ESXi PCI passthrough of a wireless NIC to a guest virtual machine? What is the guest OS? What is the purpose of this setup?
I have a Supermicro X9SCM board with a Atheros AR5008 PCI Express card (D-LINK DWA-556, Device=0024&Vendor=168C). The card can successfully be marked for PCI passthrough in ESXi (I tried versions 4.1 and 5.0) though each time I start a VM with the Wifi card associated - the entire host freezes and requires a hard reset.
Again, my real question is: How do I go about understanding why this device is causing the hypervisor to lockup when it is assigned to a guest?
Note 1: The first and second fields here are vendor and device specific but I got the values (already in hex) from the ESXi web interface under Host>Manage>Hardware>PCI Devices
There is a good chance this card is just not compatible for some reason - though there seems to be at least one report I could find of it "working", or at least the guest being able to boot. I would really like to understand why it is failing though. I have tried digging into some log files and other resources to see if I can glean any knowledge on how to best troubleshoot this, though I am far from an expert with VMWare tools.
in the .vmx file for the guest but before getting the passthru.map fixed so I'm not positive it's necessary.
I haven't finished configuring the card or making it useful but my host now stays running when the VM starts and the guest detects it.
Realize this question might be dated but still came up as a top google result when I hit this problem. Found a solution here so figured I'd share.
