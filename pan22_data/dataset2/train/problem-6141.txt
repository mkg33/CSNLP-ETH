N.B. I think it should be realized through VPN. Related to this, I just want to make you aware of one thing: the LAN network is provided through a tunnel that is created by CoovaChilli
On my server(CentOS 6.2), I have installed *CoovaChilli** software. Bellow, I will present what I need to do, and put my questions:
My LAN that is managed by server is 10.1.0.0. The Internet IP address of that server (the WAN) is 11.11.11.1. I want to make possible an Internet client, let's say with Internet IP address 12.12.12.12, to access the Internet like he is a client in my LAN(10.1.0.0). That means (one of them), when he wants to access the Internet, he needs to authenticate first.
Question: Is that possible? If yes, how? (some guidelines). I need to provide me some guidelines and thoughts on this, because I'm really new to VPN.
**CoovaChilli* is an access controller for captive portal software. That means that when you try to access the internet through it, you will be required to authenticate yourself first.
