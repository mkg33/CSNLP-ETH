Note that this applies also if an 802.11a/g/n client is forced to use a reduced rate due to signal strength issues. If the rate is dropped to, say, 27Mbps, then 27Mbps will fill the channel. If its transmit rate is 27Mbps and it's transmitting 5Mbps of data, it will consume the channel roughly 5/27th of the time.
However, there is a critical complicating factor. If there simply exists an 802.11b client on the channel, all traffic must be preceded by a burst (called a 'preamble') sufficient to let the 802.11b client know that the channel is in use. The 802.11b preamble, naturally, is much longer than the 802.11n preamble. So the mere existence of an 802.11b client will slow down the network for everyone.
An 11Mbps client will tie up 100% of the spectrum space it is using when it transmits 11Mbps of data. It will tie up the channel 50% of the time to transmit 5.5Mbps. However, modern 802.11n access points are capable of sustaining multiple streams. So while an 802.11b client will tie up one stream, others will be free to run at higher speeds.
