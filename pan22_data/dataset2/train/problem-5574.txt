If you want to absolutely sure that nobody will be handling the drive again, a generous application of suspect liquid to the circuit board should take care of both the data on the chips and prevent people from handling it.
Sometimes the flash drive is damaged and you can't delete/overwrite data on it and you just want to destroy it before disposing of it. 
If physical destruction is warranted I would go for an angle grinder - a cheaply available tool. Hold the piece with a pair of pliers against the rotating disc until the chip is consumed.
Just encrypt your files, and don't worry about deleting them if the drive is ever lost - no one will be able access them without the password.
Because of wear leveling of modern flash devices, it's not under your control. You think you've overwritten your data 25 times, it may still be there. If you want to store sensitive data on a flash device, use an encrypted container like truecrypt, so you won't be in trouble when you lose the device (unless you give away the key).
at the time of frmating unselect the Quick format and start. It will take time but fully delets all the deta an no other recovary app can back it up.
