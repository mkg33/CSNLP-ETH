i.e. your registrar holds the details of your DNS Server settings and tells the world what they are and where to go.
Typically the registrar provides a 'primary' DNS entry that points to the DNS servers. The DNS servers provide the DNS records. Among other things, the DNS records include IP address or addresses of the server for various domain configurations, such as example.com, www.example.com, forums.example.com, etc. It also includes MX records, telling mail servers where to go, anti-spam entries, and several other records for varying purposes.
And othewise - yes, there is a reason people get paid for administering machines. Consider hiring someone.
Well, talk to your registrar - where you registered bookmyname.com. They normally offer DNS servers as service for their customers. Otherwise use a free DNS service, or a cheap paid one.
If your VPS provider does not provide DNS management service, I would recommend using a different provider. Rackspace, Linode, DigitalOcean, and many others offer easy to use DNS management tools as a part of their VPS/cloud server service.
Do NOT put up your own DNS. Regulations say your domain must have 2 DNS servers in TWO DIFFERENT NETWORKS - your VPN will be not following regulations.
I use entrydns.net those guys have done well and love the simple admin interface. oh and it's free! Basically log in to your registrar control panel change DNS servers to entrydns.net ones (you'll be told them when you sign up). Then create a root A record pointing to your new VPS server and away you go :)
If you arent't that technically minded and don't know how DNS works in the first place, I would use a third party because if your vps goes down or get's DOS'd then your dns goes down and if you haven't set up a backup dns server then you'll lose it all!
