For Unicode programs the codepage is ignored completely and chcp has no effect. It's used only for older ANSI programs which rely on proper codepage being set. It doesn't matter anymore for Unicode, because it's well-defined and supports everything any reasonable program could output.
As you have already found out, the culprit was the default font. This problem is mentioned on Technet page on chcp:
When cmd calls the system function to retrieve directory listing, it already expects it to be returned in preferred encoding (which is not necessarily your encoding of choice - more on that later). It doesn't care what encoding is used internally in the FS, because OS provides additional abstraction layer to simplify things. FS can use any encoding you can imagine, but as long as OS supports it, cmd will receive filenames in its preferred encoding, not FS's encoding.
The "preferred encoding" I've mentioned is either ANSI with codepage applied or Unicode. ANSI was used as default encoding prior to Windows 2000. Windows 2000 and newer versions use Unicode by default, but still can run ANSI programs.
When you dir in command line it doesn't just copy bytes blindly. It first has to call appropriate OS function to list the directory, then print received file details to the console.
