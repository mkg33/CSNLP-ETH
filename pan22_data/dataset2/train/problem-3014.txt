Sence you cant generate a .spritefont in vs2012 I generated a spriteFont file in my vs2010 and then added i to my vs2012 project....BUT it did not work.
The best alternative is to pre-generate the font xnb via XNA first then just use them in your Monogame for Windows project or you can do the old trick of getting the Window.Handle and the screen coordinates ScreenToClient then use the GDI to draw your text with the System.Drawing.dll.
The strange thing is that i have added pictures with this way and the have ended up in the right folder but not the *.spritefont, you have to manully add it in the later folder to get i to work..
(Disclaimer: I tried building the XNA content pipeline for MonoGame 3.0 beta as per instructions, and after a few hours, I gave up; it wouldn't include the project properly in Visual Studio.)
I ran into the same problem as you. Thankfully, I had an existing XNA project that already used a .spritefont file, and generated the XNB file. I just compiled it, and copied the XNB into my MonoGame project, and I can use it without any problems.
You can now do this without installing anything extra. In a brand new MonoGame project you should have a Content.mgcb file. That should bring up the MonoGame Pipeline app. You can right click on the Content node in the tree and add a new item. Select `SpriteFont Description'. That will get compiled correctly and you should be able to load it in your code.
When i added it through solution explorer..content-->add exsisting item...then the url was wrong.. "C:\Users\admin\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Projects\MyGame\MyGame\Content"
I hope some of this makes sense to someone because this has given me the biggest headache these last days. I may have forgotten some steps and all this may be useless, but I hope that I may ease the headaches for some out there
I have been working on this for several days now, trying to fix this and eventually i got i to work.
