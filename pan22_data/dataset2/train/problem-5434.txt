We've seen somewhat similar issues here, but outside of a few high-end plotters that we print directly to IP for, we're hosting the rest of them off of a printserver, and your symptoms are not exactly the same as what we've seen, but close enough. I've got a few ideas for you, in the hopes that they'll help but nothing really conclusive :)
the problem might be that your router is reassigning the ip that the printer has acquired. this might be because you turn off your printer after use and also your router. you only have to reassign an ip to your printer and my advice is that you reserve it by your router. 
Another site suggests restarting the Print Spooler service, which should reset the offline status. Also in the properties of Print Spooler / Recovery try setting the 'Recovery on Subsequent failures' to Restart. The default is it stops restarting after 2 failed attempts. 
Had the exact same issue in server W2K8 also. Local network, no routers, no filters, no firewalls, no natting. All on the same broadcast segment. Since last friday (5/24) all network printers stopped printing from the printer queue in the server. Restart print spool service had no effect. Unchecking the snmp option in the server's port settings did the job.
Had the exact same issue in W2K3. I unchecked the snmp option and the printer went back online.  (Had the regedit as well.)
This vista forum has two suggestions, one is to try and setup the printer port as 'persistent' using the dos command
