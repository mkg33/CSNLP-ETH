The one downside is that these switches generally require a neutral wire in addition to the hot that is switched.   Depending on the age of your house and the habits of the electricians that wired it, you may or may not have that wire available.
I would avoid building your own components and consider using an established (and UL-listed) solution that you can manage with your Pi.   You could replace your existing wall switches with (for example) Insteon switches, and use software like Openhab to manage them.   The switches still have local control, and Openhab can tell what state they're in and turn them on/off or adjust dim levels.   In addition to Insteon, you can look into UPB and Z-Wave controlled switches; each of these systems has their advocates.
This doesn't have quite as much DIY mojo as what you are planning, but it avoids the (small) risks associated with switching high-voltage with non-conventional devices.
for your own Jarvis look up jasper for the raspberry pi add some code for the Belkin wemo switches and you can say
there is a bit of a delay because these switches are meant to be controlled with an android or iPhone over the network but there is a python API avaliable
