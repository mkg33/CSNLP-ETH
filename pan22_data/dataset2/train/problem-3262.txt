For the rest of the configuration in /etc that is not managed by debconf, it is hard to track what was manually changed, unless you have used something like etckeeper (perhaps an idea for the future).  For that reason, I tend to keep most of my configuration in my home directory.  But since you know which programs you are interested in, it should be easy to find the relevant files in /etc and check and copy them manually.
You can take your home directory without any changes.  Almost everything that goes into a home directory is designed to be sharable over something like NFS, so you are good.
Most modern kernels autodetect hw on boot, so usually even drivers should be ok, but if things fail, you can usually boot in single-user mode and fix any driver issues.
What leads you to this conclusion? At least for x86, the packages installed by Kubuntu are compiled to run on practically all non-prehistoric CPUs. I believe they will run on anything newer than a 486, which probably does not pose a problem in your case :-).
A vast majority of custom configurations will be in /home/, with most of the rest in /etc/. some of the /etc files have machine or hardware specific information (/etc/X11/xorg.conf, /etc/hostname, /etc/fstab off the top of my head), but much of it can just be copied over if you are going to be using the same OS version.
You can backup your home, and restore it to the other machine. This cannot fully fulfill your need, but it will restore all the configuration. You have to reinstall the packages yourself, though.
