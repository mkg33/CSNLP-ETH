I have used SharePoint extensively over the past 18 months in several small teams, and it has worked wonderfully.  It even includes both its own workflow system, and Windows Workflow Foundation.
Some kind of Wiki based solution could meet your requirements.  Windows SharePoint Services may also be suitable (pros would be integrated AD authentication and strong Office integration), but it comes with the advance warning that if it requires any kind of customization at all it can very quickly gain a lot of admin and development overhead.
We keep moving everything out of files and into our wiki (Atlassian Confluence), the the MS Word import module its taken everything we have thrown at it.
We use worldox as a document management system.  It is easy to use and integrates well with Microsof OFfice and WordPerfect.  It allows you to categorize and tag documents.  It also comes with a full text search that helps you find documents when you can't remember what you tagged it.
That obviously doesn't work for everything, but a good file structure (maintained in a VCS mostly) is enough for what's left.
