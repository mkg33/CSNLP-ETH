At my work we found an old floppy disk with a pretty powerful magnet stuck to it that'd been that way for years.  I could still read off the floppy just fine.
The only thing that I can think of that could (in a reasonably scenario) be hurt by a magnet is floppies and cards with magnetic strips. 
i suspect the most would need some kind of modulating magnetic field to create sufficient inductive properties
As hard drives store data with an alternating magnetic field, a nearby single magnet is, if anything, going to alter the magnetism of the entire disk equally, meaning that the field will still alternate in the correct pattern to represent the data.
That said most electronics today is pretty well shielded so if you don't stick your magnet to stuff or let it rub against it for a prolonged time you should be pretty safe. 
You're being paranoid. It would take a pretty significant magnet to permanently affect most parts of a computer these days. As long as you're not working around industrial magnets, or sticking things to the side of your case with powerful rare earth magnets, you should be fine.
