You will actually want to setup stateful fail over (at least for the PIX/ASA) instead of just copying the config, that way if one device goes down at most you have a blink of non-stateful protocols. 
If you do "copy running-config ?" you'll see a list of different options for copying the config. Easiest one to use depends on your situation, but I'd recommend setting up a tftp server on the same network. Then you can do copy running-config tftp: and follow the prompts.
Cisco newb question here. My company currently has one PIX and one VPN concentrator at our colo site. We purchased duplicate devices for redundancy. I need to copy the configs from the running devices and slap them on to the new duplicate devices. How do I do this? 
Sorry I can't speak to how to how to setup failover on the VPN Concentrator although the quick google search seems to indicate the use of VRRP for the Cicso VPN 3000 concentrator.
One thing that often trips people up when using tftp: Create a file of the same name as the one you want to copy over beforehand. It can be empty, it just has to exist and be writable.
