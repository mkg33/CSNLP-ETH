I'd go 2008, and would have a healthy dose of suspicion that your provider's motives might not be 100% honest.
SQL 2008. For one reason alone: Page Compression. On many loads the benefits can be spectacular, and it comes basically for free (no application change required). Truth in advertising though: not all workloads will benefit form it, and it requires enterprise edition. but if you do have EE deployed and plan to upgrade, testing your load on an eval version of SQL 2008 after you compressed the big tables may reveal some very nice results.
My company has a Server with Windows Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000. We are planning to migrate just the database server, a provider said us the migration would be better to 2005 first, and then to 2008, because "the SQL Server 2008 is best suited for Windows Server 2008".
SQL Server 2005 is leaving mainstream support early next year (>clicky<) so if you were to use that you may be looking at another upgrade sooner than you would like.  Additionally, Microsoft's Hardware and Software Requirements page for SQL 2008 indicates that it works Just Fine on Server 2003 (SP2).
