I'm experienced with debian and apt-get, and I can hardly believe that I did this in my first 30 minutes on a centos machine with yum. Now I have no idea at all how to fix that.
But I think it doesn't solve your problem. You could try to download —Åentos dvd, mount them and install all necessary packages 
and then just copy binary files with scp/wget/rsync. I have tried on vmware workstations and all works fine
Now I still have ssh access to my box but apache, mysql, php, was gone, a lot of other stuff was deleted too, including development package, rpm and yum itself.
Weirdly my sqlite was 3.6 what is newer that 3.3 that is listed as a dependence for newer PHP, Apache and subversion, so yum stopped upgrade and complained about that.
I have (or had), a linux box with CentOS 5.9 and a pre installed LAMP configuration. It was working but was too out of date, for instance mysql was version 4. So I decided to upgrade everything with yum.
In my root I have this file: initrd-2.6.18-308.13.1.el5.centos.plus.img I imagine it is a image of my system as preinstalled but I have no ideia of how to recover my system from this file.
Then I did a very wrong thing: I used yum erase sqlite to remove the old (yet newer), sqlite from my system. At this point yum removed sqlite and ALL other packages that have it as a dependence. This included basically everything :)
