You could add those 2 programs to the rc.local file. This will run them at startup. More info can be found at http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/rc-local.md.
The answer by Xer0FyT is probably the simplest way to automatically start a program on the PI. But problems occur once the started program crashes for any reason because it won't get restarted, since there no process monitoring. I personally would recommend using daemontools instead. It's pretty simple to setup (and is included in Raspbian). Basically you create a service directory which contains a run shell script that starts your program. daemontools will then make sure that your program is started and restarted should it crash for any reason.
It's also possible to log to (for example) syslog. So the output of your program doesn't get lost. I wrote a more complete blog post about this here: https://info-beamer.com/blog/running-info-beamer-in-production
Have a look at /service/my-service/run and edit it, so it starts your own program instead of running echo. Once that's done, symlink that directory into /etc/service so daemontools automatically (re)starts it:
You might want to research service. You can create an init script that is a part of the system's init, and put it at an appropriate runlevel.
