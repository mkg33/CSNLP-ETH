We have been working in our new environment for a couple of months now and everything works just great. The only problem is management. We have multiple departments, multiple companies, multiple locations/offices, etc. and find it challenging to manage the spaghetti that currently exists.
We cannot figure out how we can apply some sort of Item-level targeting at the folder level to ensure proper access.
The above configuration (untested as of now) should theoretically work for things such as printer assignment, where we could add even a Floor to each Office if desired and group users by floor to assign default printers, secondary printers, etc.
We would like to be able to apply some security groups according to the OU the user is placed in. Our current OU structure resembles the following (which closely matches some security groups such as Company or Office).
Unfortunately, this problem exists on a much larger scale when you add multiple departments (some of which may overlap), and the possibility of title/departmental role (such as Manager who should have access to management-level documents for their respective departments).
The DFS has a bunch of subfolders, which, in turn, have more subfolders. The structure looks similar to the following:
We would prefer to hide any folders that users don't have access to. In the example above, for example, User2 would not even know about the existence of \\example.com\Shares\Users\Accounting\Company1\Office1 since the user doesn't belong to the respective security groups
