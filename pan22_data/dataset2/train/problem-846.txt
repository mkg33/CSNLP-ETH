I am not experienced, so I was experimenting on different sheets. And now I have three different sheets and don't even know how I got there. Can someone tell me what happened? 
Freezing Panes0 - Seems to be my original sheet. The only thing I did consciously was to freeze the leftmost column.
Freezing Panes2 - I arrived here by accident while fumbling around. This is what I want, to have some frozen rows and some frozen columns. But I don't know how I got here!
Just to add, before I made this post, I visited Libreoffice's help page at https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Freezing_Rows_or_Columns_as_Headers
Freezing Panes1 - When I pulled on the top left gray line by accident, I discovered it created some sort of frozen pane. But I don't know how I got here. That gray line doesn't appear on my other spreadsheets.
I definitely did not do the stuff they said, such as 'view - freeze cells'. So I honestly don't know how I got to Freezing Panes2. But Freezing Panes2 is the result I want, so I hope someone can help! Please tell me the steps to get to Freezing Panes2 so that I can apply it to my other appointment book sheets!
