I know it might not be the problem that you are facing, but just for the sake of clarity, don't be as dumb as I was, making a backup file in the same directory of apparmor sbin directory.
While doing this, I created a bak for the usr.sbin.mysqld file called usr.sbin.mysqld.bak and kept it in the same /etc/apparmor.d/ directory.
I reinstalled Ubuntu Server on my machine, made a full backup of /etc/ on a hard drive, after reinstalling I made a copy of all important files from /drive/etc/ to my systems /etc.
Installed apparmor-utils and tried to aa-complain on /usr/sbin/mysqld and it said that I have 2 apparmor configs defined (both of my files).
The issue happened to me when I tried to move /var/lib/mysql to another disk and replace the original directory with a symlink.
I ran into this problem when trying to run multiple instances of MySQL, but instead of removing apparmor, I updated the usr.sbin.mysqld file:
For example, this is what my file looks like, and once I added the folders that need write permissions, all worked as it should.
