The problem for me was the  Intel Smart Connect Technology Agent that wasn't connected from my new MSI mainboard (z87-g45). Uninstalling that fixed it right away. 
In another thread on the same forum they discussed that when this application is trying to connect and fails it takes the focus. Two years ago...
I worked out the problem just to a downright fluke. I was doing some document work, and I happened to press Ctrl-C just as the problem occurred.  When I pressed Paste, I got this:
If it is not this particular program you should still be on the lookout for something similar. (BTW, the Task Manager may not show you this process because it can run as a dll as part of Explorer.exe. :( )
It is possible that a backup program might be stealing the focus, which has no visible window. One such a program is Gladinet Cloud Storage, which was used by other third party vendors like Nuance Cloud Connector. 
It was then a very easy thing to look up the solution, which was that, as it turns out, the HP printer's automatic scanning facility had malfunctioned. I turned it off, and the problem was fixed.
You have the choice of removing the application or upgrading to the latest version and see if that helps.
I just had this problem where a window would lose focus every 5 seconds for a split second. For games where the sound turns off when the game doesn't have focus, it's super crazy annoying.
Even if it's not the same program doing it, it could be a similar thing where it throws an error every X seconds. Check the event viewer in your Control Panel\System and Security\Administrative Tools and see what's in Windows Logs -> System. That's where I found my culprit.
