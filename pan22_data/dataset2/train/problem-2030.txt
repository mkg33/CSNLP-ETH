Unfortunately Windows 10 does not show the full path when you navigate to the file location via the Library folder.  In Windows 7 you can. With Windows 10 you have to navigate to the file from the root: c:\users\username... and then you can see the full path. I don't know why there is a difference between the versions.
As it's missing the C:\Users\Username\ prefix, I can't manipulate the address at all. If I want to navigate to C:\Users\Username\FolderX, I can't swap "Downloads" for "FolderX" in the address bar because the full path isn't there -- typing in "FolderX" takes me nowhere. Typing ..\ to get to the parent directory takes me to This PC instead of Users. I have to manually type out the full path in order to do anything.
If I open certain folders (seems to be User folder and any default folder inside it) in any way but manually navigating from C:\ (quick access, shortcut, etc), clicking on the address bar of the explorer window gives me an amazingly useful address:
By default, they will be pointed to the user profile corresponding location. We could right click those folders, choose "Properties", "Location" to verify this. We could open a sub folder in those libraries folders then we will get those folders' actual location.
I've tried Enabling "Display the full path in the title bar" in Folder Options>View, but that (unsurprisingly) doesn't change the text of the address bar when focused -- only the title. Is there any way to force the address bar to show the full path when focused? Preferably without adding the full path to the title bar, if possible.
