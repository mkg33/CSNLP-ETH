Would we be able to get another certificate issued (but keep the old one running)? Does this vary by provider?
You should be able to generate a new ssl key and get a new certificate that answers to the hostname in question if you control the domain dns. End users will not notice that change as long as the new ssl cert is valid - IE issued by a CA like Entrust
We are helping a new client migrate their site from a previous unreliable host, over to a new host (cloud based). They run an ecom site with an SSL Certificate  (GeoTrust SSL). We plan to move their site for them and then just update the D.N.S to the new server.
If I understand your question correctly your situation is that the old hosting provider will not give you the SSL certificate and private key you are currently using?  That seems VERY shady to me.
The issue here is that the current host is not playing ball (with us or the clients). Our client owns the domain name but did not register the ssl certificate. We don't have access to their current server.
Having worked at an ISP/MSP that did hosting and SSL Certificate registration I can see no legitimate reason why they would not give you the key pair for your certificate (provided your account isn't in arrears).
