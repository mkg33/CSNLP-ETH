A surface scan with Windows Scan Disk or chkdisk should mark sectors as bad and not use them.  Not sure what other utilities do this.  But as Brandstaetter noted, you are taking the risk that the harddrive is going to get worse.
I would recommend getting a new hard disk for this, or have the whole system looked at by someone who knows about the hardware better, perhaps you know someone who can do this for free :)
Backing up what brandstaetter said (Backup and replace!!), but there's also the option of using the diagnostic/repair tools provided by the manufacturer which may be able to reallocate the bad sectors to redundant space on the disk. Find out the manufacturer of the disk and there will usually be a downloadable ISO on their site.
Usually, once something goes wrong with a hard disk, it will quickly spread over the disk if you do not stop using it. If it is a head-crash or electronic malfunction, you will ruin the rest of the disk quickly.
I prefer these tools to chkdsk/other OS based scans as a reformat of the disk won't reactivate sectors marked as bad in the FS - the reallocation is done on a hardware level.
