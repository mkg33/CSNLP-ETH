To satisfy this requirement we were asked to look at a number of DLP solutions which are turning out to be relatively costly.
We run a Windows shop. Our IT dept. (the Domain Admins) have access to both our PROD and Non-Prod (Corporate) domains.  When builds or files need to be pushed to production, IT is required to perform any file transfers.
We have a security/compliance audit that we are preparing for and since we deal with financial institutions, one of the potential flags mentioned was how we track/monitor files that are transferred between our Production and Non-Production environments.
We have also explored potentially requiring the IT team to use some sort of FTP or Managed File Transfer system in order to move files between the environments, but that just seems cumbersome.
Are there any other potential solutions we can explore here?  The main requirement is that we have some sort of TRACKING or LOGGING of any files copied between the environments.  Aside from doing a giant "DIFF" of the environments at the end of each day, not sure what we can do.
