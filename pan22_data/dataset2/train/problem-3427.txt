This works fine for me (hidpi client to lodpi server) with not configuration on the server: Remote Desktop Connection Manager (by MS)
RDP 8.1 introduces something called DPI remoting. This basically takes the DPI settings on the client machine and can send them to the server machine such that the aspect of the desktop is maintained. RDP 8.1 requires Windows 8.1 / 2012 R2 running on the server side and an RDP 8.1 client (it can be Win7 + latest QFE for RDP).
Here are more details about the feature: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rds/archive/2013/12/16/resolution-and-scaling-level-updates-in-rdp-8-1.aspx
Note that /v:servername[:port] means /v: (enter name of the server and optionally add : + portnumber)
This means that the view should be the same, unless you changed the DPI setting locally. You can hack this on a terminal server, but note that it'll work for all users.
In an RDP connection file (you can make one if you open RDP, and then choose the button Save as) you can store options such as resolution, going full screen, etc.
If you go full screen, the RDP session will automatically set the remote resolution to whatever you use. So if the laptop uses 1920x1080 then the remote resolution will become that as well.
