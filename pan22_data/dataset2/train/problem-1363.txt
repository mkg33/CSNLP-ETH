As Tomek said, you can't make changes to an account you don't have access to, so stopping the forwarding yourself is likely not possible. (You could perhaps make a support request to the operator of the service, asking them to stop the forwarding. They might do that, with sufficient proof that you're the owner of the recipient account.)
But assuming you want to do this yourself, the best approach would indeed be to configure your gmail account to automatically discard those messages. The first step would be to find a way that you can match all of those messages, and only those messages, in order to filter them.
Gmail has multiple search keywords you can use in search/filtering, and one handy one for dealing with forwarded messages is deliveredto. For most types of forwarding, searching for deliveredto:original_recipient@forwardingaccount.com will find any messages forwarded from that email address to yours. 
If you perform that search and it does match all of the correct messages, then you can choose "Create Filter", and select an option like "Delete it" or "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)" (along with "Never mark it as important" and "Mark as read" just to be sure it stays out of your unread/important messages) to have Gmail handle the forwarded messages automatically in the future. (And you can also apply it to the existing forwards, if you choose.)
