What I learned after getting set up on Comcast is that the Comcast supplied SMC router has firmware that disables DNS Settings, therefore I cannot assign the OpenDNS static IP without doing it on every device. Thus phones and tablets were left wide open. Not good with smart & curious teens in the house. Adding to my complications, I have some HP Touchpads and they run both WebOS and Android but when I set static IP addresses on both platforms of those devices, they quickly reset to the Comcast IP address which is open. 
Previous, I had my network set up to point to a static IP that from service called OpenDNS. If you're not familiar, it's a terrific low cost filter service that lets you set up filtering on the network at the router rather than by using client side software on each device. This allows me to filter anything wired or wireless simultaneously, phone, tablets, latops, equally. 
I understand that I can add a second router to my network, but I am wondering that if I go that route, can I bypass or disable the SMC router settings?  Basically I just want to know if I plugged my Belkin Router into the SMC Modem/Router, will the Belkin static IP pointed to OpenDNS still protect my network or will the SMC router farther up in the chain override it? It would be nice to get my network protected again without getting new equipment.
