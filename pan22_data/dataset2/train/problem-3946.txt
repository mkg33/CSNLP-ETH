We are trying to analyze the cost/benefit of either solution.  Of course, if there is no benefit to replicating on a cloud, then the benefits the cloud has to offer outweigh the hardware solution.  However if a replicated solution on the cloud is a better option, then the hardware solution will be far less expensive, including physical management time.
We currently are in the research phase of building a "Master" database for our e-commerce business that will centralize all data, including product information, vendor information, Magento information, Amazon, etc ....   We have looked into both "physical hardware" (Two RAID 5 machines, master/slave, with a HDD backup off the slave --  and a separate application server)....   Or we could do a "cloud based" system.
The heart of the question is, is there any benefit with replicating on a cloud?  The whole point of a cloud is scalability and "no hardware downtime" therefore no lost data due to bad hardware.  The data loss that would occur, if any, on a cloud based system would be software based.  With that said, being a software based issue that would cause loss of data, this issue would most likely get replicated right?  Therefore we'd have 2 machines with the same corrupted data?
