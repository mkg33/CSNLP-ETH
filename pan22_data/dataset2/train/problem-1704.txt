but a quick test on a CentOS 6.2 with Sudo version 1.7.4p5 doesn't pass LD_LIBRARY_PATH but does pass FRED. The sudoers man page has this to say 
Alternatively, if you want a sure-fire persistent environmental variable, consider appending it to your bashrc (~/.bashrc) file, then opening a new terminal session.
This is happening not only for LD_LIBRARY_PATH but a few other environment variables that could temper with your build environment. In my case, sudo has become:
It sounds like you haven't you done export LD_LIBRARY_PATH yet. Doing so will make environmental variable available to everything, and solve this problem you're having. 
My %group currently has ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL as its access in sudoers. I would like this specific environment variable to be kept for any command I run.
No matter what I try, it seems that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is not kept after I run a command with sudo. The only way I managed to have it stick, is to prefix my sudo command with LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/the/path whenever I call it from the command-line, but I would like to not have to do this every time.
