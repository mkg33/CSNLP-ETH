The home versions of CDs have an alloy layer that bends at the heat of the focused light beam during recording and thus mimic pits and land that would be on the commercial pressed disk surface. Again, non magnetic.
While that fact is true with floppy discs, CDs and DVDs do not suffer the same problems. When CDs and DVDs are written, they are written permanently and then sealed with a layer of plastic. 
Magnets will not affect a CD or DVD. In comercial pressed CD and DVD they have made pits in an aluminum layer that is simply, non magnetic. 
no normal magnet can damage a CD/DVD.  If you have a magnet powerful enough to lift 100lbs there could be a tiny chance.  Now a floppy disk is magnetic and could get damaged.  The CD/DVD is physically burned into the surface of the disc in a non-magnet way.  However CD/DVD still contain metal so if you had a ridiculously strong magnet there is a minute chance of damaging it. 
This structure of the discs stop them from becoming warped. Extreme heat and cold on the other hand will warp the plastic and cause the disc to become unreadable.
