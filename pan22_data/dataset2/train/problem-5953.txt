And here's what they give you when you unarchive them (these results are consistent across multiple attempts):  
I'm still digging into this, but as far as I can tell the differences involve MIME types and the organization of the XML data archived into the xlsx file:
NB: The possibility is that a change had to be made. The simpler the spreadsheet, the more your file will resemble what you created in Excel.
I'm working on a process that takes data from customers and parses it into our product. In this case, an xlsx file. Unfortunately, our product is having trouble reading it because it was coded to read xlsx files created in Excel for Mac instead of Excel for Windows, and our customers are using Windows.
Here's a screenshot of two files with identical data, one saved locally on a Mac and one from a Windows machine.
After doing a ton of googling, this thread leads me to believe that the order that the files are added might make a difference as well.
I'm showing the easiest method and it will help you to convert Window's .Xls, .Xlsx and even .CSV file into Mac Numbers(Spreadsheet).
My question is, is there a way to programmatically convert a "Win-based" Excel file into a "Mac-based" Excel file without manually opening the file and resaving it? Ideally in the Terminal? I can't find any existing tools. As a middleman sysadmin/ops type I'm not in a position to ask the customer to generate these on macOS and I'm not in a position to ask Dev to rebuild the portion of the product that reads these. I need to automate this or it'll drive me crazy.
