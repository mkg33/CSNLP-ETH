Worst... i put a demostration: VHD / VHDX can be Dynamic using only Windows software (and VirtualBOX)... VirtualBOX is acting as a layer to lie to windows and make windows (the guest) think they are normal internal SATA disks and not VHD / VHDX files... Why windows do not lie to itself (on host) and do the same?
Of course, if you use VHD / VHDX files on VirtualBOX, they can be stripped or mirrored inside the guest, car reside on compressed NTFS folder or inside compressed and/or encrypted containers like Pismo File Mount, etc... but if you want Disk Mangment to let you access them, they must be on a non compressed, non encrypted media with direct low level linear access (like Linux loop needs)... i could not try to force them to be fragmented and see what happens.
I am with you, but i also think that M$ really sucks when applying such limitations for aparent no reason!
But do not try to mount them on the HOST... Windows will not let you, as soonas it see it is a Dynamic (not Basic) it refuses to let you use it... windows disk managment sees the VHD/VHDX mounted, also DiskPart, but no me can you do with them except detach them.
