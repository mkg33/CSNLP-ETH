The faster version of the min-cut algorithm is very recursive indeed. See figure 2.5 here, or any standard randomized algorithms textbook.
How about Welzl's randomized algorithm for minimal enclosing ellipsoids? It has recursion depth O(d) where d is the dimension of the space.
As Per Vognsen points out, and more generally as well, there are many geometric algorithms that operate as follows: Pick a random sample, and run recursively on the sample and on other structures derived thereof. Clarkson's randomized algorithm for linear programming, as well as Seidel's, and indeed the Matousek-Sharir-Welzl series that Per mentions, all operate in this manner, and Clarkson's paradigm extends to other situations where you build some kind cutting or epsilon-net and recurse. 
I know next to nothing about derandomization, so this might not be what you're looking for. If my example doesn't qualify (maybe by your definition it only makes inessential use of recursion?), perhaps you could clarify why that is. That would increase the chances of higher quality, more pertinent answers from others.
p.s this is probably the most boring example possible, but does your method work on quicksort, or any of the randomized median finding methods ? 
Unfortunately, you're unlikely to get a new result from this, because there are optimal derandomizations of these algorithms, due to work by Matousek, and Chazelle. Chazelle's paper is a good reference point for this work and prior work by Matousek. But it might be a good test of your method: it was hard to come up with these derandomizations, and if your method provides a black box approach starting with the (easier) randomized algorithm, that would be neat.
