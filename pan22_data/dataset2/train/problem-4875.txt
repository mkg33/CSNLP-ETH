This will not work if the exe has an embedded manifest requesting a lower execution level, but will work for an manifest-less application.
Another method is to create a self elevating script. This can be a fragile method but it basically assumes you have write access to the %temp%
I'm not sure why you want to turn this on and off with a batch file, but you can easily do it by having your batch file rename this file to foo.exe.notmanifest and back to foo.exe.manifest.
If you accept bundling such an utility with your bat file (or installing it system-wide), check this out: http://www.winability.com/elevate/
I don't think it's possible in plain windows without installing an additional utility to elevate priviledges from the command line.
The name of the file must be exename.exe.manifest, in other words if you have foo.exe then you must name the file foo.exe.manifest. The contents must look like this:
Right-click the BAT file and press Create Shortcut.  The shortcut will appear.  You can edit the shortcut's properties and set it to always run as administrator.  Of course, you have to run the BAT file through the shortcut now.
For an exe, if you put a manifest in the same folder as the exe that requests elevation, every time anyone runs the app they will be prompted to elevate it. Deleting the file from the folder will put the behaviour back to normal.
