I got to know the exact location by opening up the file in the dialog box thru my text editor. I then went to that location in windows explorer and "rescued" the files off to where I wanted them originally.
Windows virtualizes files saved to Program Files (and some other directories) in certain programs for compatibility issues. Click here to read more: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927387
I had the same issue with the print (& save to file) dialog box in IE. I could see the file in the dialog box, but not thru windows explorer.
The files that you downloaded were virtualized. To view them in explorer you have to click Compatibility Files button that appears on the explorer bar. This button only appears in directories that contain virtualized files.
C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Virtualized\C\Users\username\Documents\
The software might not be saving the files actually, because saving to Program Files requires UAC elevation (unless you have UAC disabled). Are you running metatrader as an Administrator?
