What kind of slowness? Typically, you're better off upgrading the ram. Certainly don't upgrade to another windows release, the increased footprint would be fatal.
Typically if a computer Was Fast and now running the same programs more or less it is slow, I am going to point my finger at MALware/Junk or Lack of Swap space on your Drive.  
Adding a new hard drive shouldn't make your computer slower - if windows are drawing slowly then you've got a pretty serious problem.  I'd recommend re-installing Windows - you'll be surprised how much faster your system will be.
Hardware wise my first recommendation would be more RAM - you'll find that Firefox can take a couple 100 MB's just by itself. 
A CPU upgrade probably won't be cost effective, they're are that much faster P4's out there .  If you have a newer socket 775 board that can run Core 2 Duo's, then that might be a consideration. 
After that I'd upgrade the hard drive.  Newer hard drives are not just larger, they are faster.  Having a fast hard drive makes a huge difference in program loading and a large number of slowdowns are from hard disk reads.  That's why everyone is going crazy over SSD's.  If you do a Windows reinstall, reinstall to that newer hard drive you mentioned - it's most likely faster than your original drive.
Upgrading the OS (to Linux) is more likely to speed up Firefox than anything else, and it's free. But if you want to stick with Windows, the most effective upgrade would be another GB of RAM. (It would help Linux too.)
