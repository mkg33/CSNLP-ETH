As to which one suits you best, it depends on what want to do with them. If you want to run VMs on your workstation, for development or testing purposes, then one of the hosted platforms (Virtualbox, VMWare Workstation etc), is ideal.  
Virtualbox, VMWare Workstation/Player/Server, QEMU, User-mode-linux etc fall into one category of VM - they're hosted within an existing OS, such as windows or linux.
If you actually want a dedicated server environment for production systems, then you should be looking at the second category of systems, as they offer more advanced features which you may want down the line (server pooling, shared storage, live migration, high availability)
The only requirement from your list it doesn't fulfill is that you need a separate machine as a VM server. Then you can connect to the machines over the network using XenCenter admin console, which is very similar to VMWare one. The console is available for Windows, don't know about linux as I use Windows as a client.
This shouldn't be a concern. You can generally mount any kind of file-based VM image using Linux's loopback device should you need to do so. This is true for raw, VHD, VMDK, qcow, etc.
I really like VMWare Server.  I use it on my Ubuntu box to run a 2003 Windows server and 2008 Windows server.  It is pretty rock solid.
Xen, KVM, VMWare ESX, fall into a different category - they're hypervisor based virtualisation stacks. They still have an OS that gets booted first, but they operate at a fundamentally different layer.
Try Citrix XenServer (it's free!). We use it at work and it does the job really well. I've found it much faster than VMWare.
