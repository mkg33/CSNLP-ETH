The root cause in my case was that my password for my Hotmail account was only 7 characters long, and the new Office 365 servers require a minimum of 8 characters. This was never a problem until I needed to add my Hotmail account to a new version of Outlook on my PC. There was no information leading to this solution - I just figured it out through trial and error. 
It is currently November 2016, and by now most, but not all, Hotmail and Outlook.com accounts have been migrated to the new "Outlook Mail" Office 365 servers, as described here:
You can tell if your account has already been migrated, by looking at the top left of your browser when you are logged in to the web interface. If it says "Outlook.com" you have not yet been migrated. If it says "Outlook Mail", you are running on the new (Office 365) servers, and therefore in theory you can setup your Outlook desktop client to connect to your Hotmail/Outlook.com account as a full 'Exchange' account type (to clarify, this is more fully featured than the 'Exchange Active Sync' type) using the automatic method in the Add Account dialog. 
In my case however, this was not working - and even if I added the account as an 'Exchange Active Sync' type instead, Outlook failed to connect to the server afterwards and therefore could not download mail or other items.
