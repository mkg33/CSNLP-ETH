Based on the comments to the answer by Dougie, it seems that there may be some confusion / linguistic issues with what's meant by "counterfeit" and therefore disagreement about even basic things like whether or not any exist.
Seems like Dougie is only including the first and maybe the second above as "counterfeit", whereas it's more common (at least in US-based industry - maybe other countries have different standards or different words in use for the various cases) to call any of the above "counterfeit".  If any part on the device has been changed or modified after it left the OEM, then the whole Pi is "counterfeit" if sold as new even though some components in the Pi - like the processor - may be authentic. (In the latter two cases, if you mark that same used / reworked Pi as used / reworked, it's no longer counterfeit.  It's just used / reworked.)
(I was going to provide a link to the US Commerce Report "Defense Industrial Base Assessment: Counterfeit Electronics" as a reference, but it seems to be gone from the web.  If that comes back later and you really want to see it, you'll have to search.)
