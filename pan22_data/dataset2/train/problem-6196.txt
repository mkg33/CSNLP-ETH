I suggest that you look into KVM http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page . It is the choice of virtualization for red hat in RHEL 5.4 and it is also available in Debian. The specific thing here is that you do not need a modified kernel to run the host and the virtual machine so you can use any OS that you wish as a guest. The KVM virtualization technology is built-in in the recent linux kernels, so you won't have to worry for any patching, custom kernels whatsoever. As Rajat suggested visit www.howtoforge.com for specific tutorials. Oh and @Michael Dillon - i'm eager to see RH running with 512k RAM :D
If you are asking this kind of question, then it means you are not the kind of person who will find it easy to set up XEN. I suggest that you look for the virtualbox-ose package which is available for lenny. It runs like an application with a GUI for creating virtual machines and managing the virtual hardware. Then get an ISO of a Redhat variant, or use a real CDROM if you have one, and install it into the virtual machine. You'll have to go into Settings and tell it what to attach to the virtual CD drive before you start up your virtual machine. 512k RAM should be enough to get Redhat installed and runnning.
If you want the official "Red Hat", you will need to get that from Reg Hat. If you want an unofficial "Red Hat", you can try Fedora or Centos.
