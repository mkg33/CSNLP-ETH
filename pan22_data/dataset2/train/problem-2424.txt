Skills in how to use spreadsheets are invaluable for the inevitable maths projects about statistics.
On the topic of teaching web design, I would suggest that it be taught as a markup language along with CSS. With these 2 things, I found making web pages became a lot easier.
I don't think kids need to be taught how to use computers. However, students should definitely be taught how to type at a young age, but other computer skills will be picked up as time goes on.
When I was in school (I'm a second year cse major in college now), we weren't taught anything related to computers except how to type. From my experience, people (of all ages) are not going to learn how to do anything with a computer, except through using one.
So I think the best solution is to give assignments which require students to use computers (essays, presentations, etc) and provide the facilities for those who don't have access to computers or the necessary software. The teachers can then give demonstrations and assist students who need help. But asking elementary school students to do such assignments seems a little extreme, although middle school might be a good place to start.
How about Internet safety?  Teaching students not to revel too much information is a good lesson.  Most parents teach their children to not talk to strangers on the street, but neglect to tell them the same applies to Internet interactions.
