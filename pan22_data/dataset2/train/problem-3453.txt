Be aware the installer comes with OpenCandy adware, just uncheck it while installing or use the portable version.
I had the exact same issue. Couldn't open file on a network share to edit. But none of suggestions helped.
Turned out that the issue was as follows: Previously computer was being used and logged in by a local account. After I joined AD, i copied Application Data and Local Settings folder (on Windows XP) to AD user profile. After the operation i later discovered that Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Office didn't have permissions for newly created user and thus office was prompting me with this dialog for every file. I had previously tried disabling firewall/antivirus on host and client machines, disabling indexing service on host machine, but none helped.
Another way, if you have access to the file server is to use the command openfiles.exe. In my case Word said I was locking the file, but openfiles.exe showed that it was a different user. Eg if part of the filename was "birthday", you'd use this command:
The pop-up tip displayed by explorer also causes the problem (same effect as the details pane). Disable it in Folder options > View tab
