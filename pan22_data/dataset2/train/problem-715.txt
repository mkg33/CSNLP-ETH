We intend to move to Windows Server 2003 (2008 won't support our old Win98 workstations - we can't get rid of them for 3 more years when our legacy software is converted).  However, I'm wondering if it makes more sense to buy a SAN instead of buying a newer machine with faster drives?  
SAN is probably overkill as another person said. Likewise make sure you go x64 on the Windows boxes.
Buying a SAN is a very expensive operation.  Depending on the SAN solution you look at it can easily run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Buying a SAN as per me buying "a380 airbus" and other way if ur using for last 6year HP server with "linux" only Linux can give such work not Windows i feel u should buy new server H/W install same Linux on that. And normally IDE work for 4year not more then that in same way SATA also have same life after that it start giving problem.
in the meantime, while you're deciding what to do in the long term, you can probably significantly improve performance on the current servers by:
As far as Windows 98 - what says WS2008 won't support Win9x clients? You just need to scale some default security settings back.
We currently have two 6 year old linux file servers (an HP DL320 and DL380) that are starting to be dogs.  The DL320 just uses 10K IDE drives set up in RAID1, the 360 has 6 drives set up in RAID10.  File services are via Samba, and the DL320 is having far more problems at the moment.
