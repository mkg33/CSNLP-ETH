Also on this network is a Windows Server 2003 machine with a shared drive.  The server has no firewall/virus scanning, and the drive allows full permissions for all users.  All of the computers on the network can modify, create, or delete files from this drive, except for the Windows 10 surface.  When trying to create or delete files with the surface, I get a "Destination Folder Access Denied" message.
On the Windows 10 surface, I can see the drive and all of the files on it, but I cannot create/delete any files on the drive.  This is a problem because I cannot open any databases, since I can't create the lock file.  Again, this is only a problem on the surface none of the other machines.
What could be causing this problem?  Why would this only happen on the Windows 10 surface, not the Windows 8.1 surface, the windows 7 machines, the windows vista machines, or the windows xp machines?
I have a Surface Pro 3 / Windows 10 connected to a closed network (i.e. no internet access by design) via wifi on a static IP IPv4 address.  The network has 11 machines on it (Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows 8.1), all on the same work group "WORKGROUP" with the same network adapter settings as the surface (of course, different static IP addresses).
