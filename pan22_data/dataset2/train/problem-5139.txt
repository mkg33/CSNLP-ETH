I had to turn 'Always show icons, never thumbnails' on (checked) and then back off (un-checked).  Thanks to Chris H Sep 1 '16 at 8:36 for the idea.
Note - prior to this I did change the default association for PNG to be Photo Viewer.  Not sure if this step was required.
2. Get rid of the current set of cached thumbnails (in '%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer'). 
- Just Right-Click on your png file -> Open with -> Choose another app -> Choose app Photos & stick to Always use this app to open .png files -> Restart your machine. 
I don't know if its the same issue but it seems to be a few easy steps that could potentially resolve your problem
I was however able to delete the Windows 7 thumbnail cache by going to Start/Accessories/System Tools/Disk Cleanup, and selecting the option in the options list.
By following the next two steps, I was able to have the .PNG thumbnails restored. I am not sure whether both of them are necessary to fix the problem, though.
By turning off the function to generate thumbnails inside this third-party software, the cause of the problem was - presumably - gone.
Trying to delete them manually didn't work, nor did selecting the option in CCleaner ('0 bytes removed' message).
The reason my png wasn't showing was that I was looking at the file inside of an archive(.zip).  I simply needed to extract the png file and then the thumbnail was visible.  
1. For me, the problem was caused by installing another piece of software (SageThumbs, in my case), which allowed me to display thumbnails for graphic file extensions that Windows 7 doesn't support natively.
This is caused by having a program installed, such as Adobe Photoshop, that takes away the "default program" from Windows Photo Viewer.
