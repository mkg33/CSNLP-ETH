You may want to enable optimize for fast removal somewhere in the Device Manager for the device. That turns off the journaling.
I believe Daniel and Adam are on to something. I had a similar problem with an external drive. I solved it by removing the hard drive and installing it into the PC. It worked fine although there was some bad data on it caused probably by some of the bad writes. In this case, the drive (Western Digital) has since functioned well, so I'm left thinking the external case's circuitry (third-party cheap enclosure that I got for the price of a visit to the Chinese buffet) was poor quality.
Your external hard drive has probably gone into power save mode and its power up sequence is taking a fraction longer than Windows is prepared to wait. Once Windows has decided that the device had a serious error, it's probably forceable unmounting the drive and reattaching all over again, which is why it shows up on the desktop again.
What length USB cable is connecting the hard drive to the PC? I had a similar problem and eventually Windows (XP) decided it couldn't connect to the drive altogether. However, I was connecting the drive via an extension cable. When I used the short (< 1m) cable that came with the drive I had no problems connecting or writing to the drive.
