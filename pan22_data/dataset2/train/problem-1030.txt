I know it's possible to tail -f /var/log/mail.log, but when there becomes a large amount of connections and internal steps (client authorisation, recipient authorisation, relays, bounces, etc.) this log can become quite time-consuming and prone to missing steps.
Exitop is a perl script that can tell you everything that is going on when using the exim MTA. qshape gives you some indication of what is happening with items in the postfix queues and you could put hooks into the postfix policy
Try pfqueue, it's not exactly -- or nowhere near :) -- you want, but a very useful and similar tool anyway.
This reminds me a nice tool pflogsumm - "Postfix Log Summarizer" - but it's only for Postfix MTA. It generates summaries and detailed reports of mail server traffic, rejected and bounced email, server warnings and so on.
Last but not least, mailstats (or mailstats.pl) should show you some nice statistics about delivery times, error/return codes etc.
Is there an application that can link all the mail processing steps together from connection to delivery in a way that shows the whole process and the decision live?  
daemon or write some kind of parser for the log files, but I'm unaware of any tool that does this already. I'm not really familiar enough with sendmail to know how it could be done if you're using that MTA.
Then there's isoqlog. It's a command line tool which produces HTML pages and thus is not a top clone, but of course you can browse the results with elinks or other text browser of your choice if you so will.
Additionally, this could be used to build/store statistics on mail acceptance/rejection which could, in turn, be used to spot accidental misconfiguration.  Has anyone seen anything like this?
