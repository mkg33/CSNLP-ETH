Example, is the gateway that you are pushing, reachable when the network is down? How about DNS server being pushed?
That's REALLY not how it works at all, there's zero reason why any form of upstream routing issue or misconfiguration would lead to a DHCP problem. Maybe if you were like a home user or a two-man business using the cheapest of DSL router then perhaps I could see why it may cause problems but in any other scenario these two things have no impact on each other.
Best guess is that you've got FQDNs in fields where DHCP only pushes IPs, so DHCPd is doing the DNS lookup for you in the background. If the DNS configuration on that server is to loopup externally then it would fail anytime the "Internet" is not available.
I suggest you call in a pro sysadmin or network admin to get this fixed once and for all as I suspect there'll be other issues about if you're seeing this problem.
Not how it works on my end. Is the info that the server is pushing possibly pointing to an external resource that is vanished due to the lack of internet at the time DHCP is trying to serve the request?
