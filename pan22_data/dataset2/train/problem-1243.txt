To answer the last question, files in ~/.vim are not automatically loaded, but all files in ~/.vim/plugin are.
Rather than put your names in files, though, you could use $USER as akira suggested, or set user using whoami, like this:
You can have your ~/.vimrc load another file using the :source command. For example, you could each put your unique commands in ~/.myvimrc and load those commands with
Since asking this question, I've come up with another use case for loading an external file: machine-specific tweaks. 
I'm not sure what your vimrc looks like so this may not be feasible, but if there are large parts that you and your friend share, you might want to break them up into separate plugins. You can add files to the ~/.vim/plugin directory to have them loaded on startup. (They're loaded in alphabetical order -- use :scriptnames to check.)
The substitute() function is needed because the output of system() usually has a '\n' tacked on the end.
That way you can each have a vimrc that's completely unique, but all of your common configuration are in plugins. If you break them up logically, then it makes it easy to share with others too.
the name of the logged-in user is available in the $USER environment variable. you can access that variable easily:
Since I may or may not need to make tweaks on a given machine, I'm using a try/catch to load the external file; if there's no such file, I let it fail silently.
