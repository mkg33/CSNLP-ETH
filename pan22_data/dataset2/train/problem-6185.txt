How can I provide a user with a drop-down menu in a cell that displays the contents from one column but actually writes the value from a different column to the cell and validates against the values from that second column?
The advantage of this is that the drop down will hide the actual cell, so the cell itself can still be edited as normal.
This code (from here) will add a drop down, and when an item is selected, put that value in the cell, change another cell based on the item selected, and then remove itself so no drop down exists. You should be able to use this code for your own fun.
Everytime you focus the cell it appears as a dropdown in cell validation, once is selected it stops being it and you write the value you want it to be.
The drop-down displays the values from one column, for example Column B, but when selected actually writes the value on the same row from Column C to the cell. However, data validation is actually validating against Column B, so if I manually enter something from Column C in the cell and try to move to another cell, data validation throws an error.
