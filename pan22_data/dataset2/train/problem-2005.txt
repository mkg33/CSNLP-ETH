If you cant see the Bluetooth Radio's drop down, it may be because the drivers arent installed. If that's the case, the radio should be listed somewhere down the list with a question mark next to it. Go to the manufacterurs website and find the drivers for the bluetooth module and that should fix it.
If that is there and there are no question marks next to the items, it means the bluetooth drivers are installed and it should be working. You should also see some bluetooth items under the Network Adapters drop down.
Even though in Device Manager both Bluetooth items show up for me, the Bluetooth light was off. The only way to turn it on was to disable the "Bluetooth adapter" item from "Bluetooth radios", then enable it again.
Head into Device Manager and check to see if the bluetooth drivers are installed. I'm guessing you are using Windows 7, so go to the stat menu, right-click 'Computer' and press 'Manage'. This will open the Computer Management window, from here click Device Manager on the left coloumn. There should be a Bluetooth Radios drop down menu.
Have you tried pressing Windows Key+X?  It brings up the Mobility Center in Windows 7.  Your Bluetooth may be off or something, but as I don't have Bluetooth on this machine, I can't tell you for sure.  Give it a try...
After uninstalling and installing the drivers a few times and rebooting in between, the bluetooth device was not appearing at all in the device manager.
Shutting down the computer, waiting a couple seconds and turning it back on made it re-appear. I guess the device must have gotten in a bad state, and rebooting was not cutting the power to the bluetooth device.
