The more important reason transmit power is not a very useful gauge of a router is that there are very strict legal limits (put in place by the FCC in the U.S., and other governing bodies elsewhere) even on the unlicensed frequencies used by wireless networks, to avoid interfering with other people using Wifi in the same area.
As a general rule of thumb, the slower your network transmission speed is, the greater range you'll have.  To a large extent, your router and wifi card will auto-negotiate the fastest speed it can, so you should always get the best speed/range combination at any given time.  You can improve this situation by allowing your router to use as many 802.11 flavors as possible--i.e. by allowing b and g, and not forcing it to use g.  I wish I knew more about 802.11 so I could give you more specific information here.
What is more likely to affect your usable range is which form of 802.11 you use.  802.11n is advertised as being much faster (and it is--under the right circumstances), but generally has a much shorter range--for reasons that I don't fully understand, and are somewhat off-topic on this question, anyway.
First, from a technical standpoint, RF output is only about 1/4 of the story... The receiving sensitivity is also important (what good is it if your router can speak, but can't listen?).  And the transmit and receive capabilities of your wireless card in your computer/laptop are also important.
Obviously, RF (radio frequency) Power and Antenna Gain are related to how "loud" the RF signal is when it leaves the router.
Generally (probably always) every router manufacturer will broadcast at the highest legal limit--doing anything less would make their router appear to be obviously less useful, so they wouldn't sell much.
