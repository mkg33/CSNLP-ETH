I have a problem opening Excel 2007 documents in Excel 2010 where when I open the document, Excel gives me an error of "Current printer unavailable, select a new printer" and Excel presents a dialog window with all my printers, including my current default printer, which is an HP OfficeJet Pro 8000.  If I select any printer besides the OfficeJet, Excel will take about 30-45 seconds, then open the document.  
My computer is a Windows 7 x64 bit with Office 2010 Professional, fully updated. The person I'm receiving the Excel 2007 documents from is using Windows XP with Office 2007 Professional, fully updated, and this user also has an OfficeJet Pro 8000 as their default printer.
You can switch your default printer in the Windows Devices and Printers pane. Right click on the printer and hit set as default printer.
Almost sounds like a macro, make sure you are NOT allowing any macros to run by default from that author, or in just general. 
I had the same issue. What fixed it for me was to switch my default printer to a different printer, and then switch it back.
