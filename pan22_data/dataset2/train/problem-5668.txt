I see lot of small companies having a NAS willing to exchange large files with their customers. They spend an incredible amount of time dealing with big email or websites like wetransfer.
I know FTP can be used for that but lot of users don't know how to use it and/or don't want to install a FTP client.
Do also consider OwnCloud first as it is just a software to re-use your existing hardware. Synology means you have to purchase additional hardware which may/may not in your scope.
But if you insist on not having FTP at all then you could checkout a native Synology web interface to their file sharing service (as described here on page 61) or if the companies have their own web server with the PHP installed then http://owncloud.org/ could be worth checking out.
Idealy, there would be a mini website on the NAS. Company employees will give a user account for each customer. Then they just have to copy files in the corresponding folder to make them available to customer. Customer could download and upload files using web. The employees of the company directly found the uploaded files in a folder named after customer name.
And after the user uploaded things, you as the NAS Admin can go under /Home/username and pick up the files you need. 
If the only problem of the customers is installing the FTP clients, then they can use their web browsers or a web client like www.net2ftp.com
