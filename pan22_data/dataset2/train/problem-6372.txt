I suggest opening up Task Manager (Start -> type taskmgr -> Enter) and checking what application is using all the memory when it happens.
Go to the processes tab, then the menu entry of View / Select Columns, put a checkmark next to "Memory - Working Set", and click OK. Back in Processes, click twice this column to sort it by descending order.
Steam is a hog. If you have problems after ending steam, then you need to look at AVG. If you still have problems, you may need to check out services. If all else fails, get more RAM or increase your page file. Both aren't that difficult.
this is happing with ALOT of Windows 7 systems and it has to do with the wmpnetwk.exe. my friend streams media to his computers and Xbox. we see that this process uses one core and ALL of the memory and the computer crawls to a stop. Start up in safe mode and turn OFF media sharing. pressing ctrl+shift+esc will bring up the task manager and look if this is indeed the problem. at least this might get you going enough to find another solution if this doesn't help...   Good Luck!!!
Run Task Manager before this happens, set it to always-on-top, sort processes by VM Size. (Task Manager automatically sets its own priority as 'high'.) Then wait for the "explosion" to happen.
