It's called interleaving. Simple implementations use two banks of RAM (two separate RAM sticks) but I've seen motherboards with up to four banks interleaved.
For reads it works a bit like DMA where the memory controller will be told to prefetch the next values from RAM before the current data read is complete.
Like Raid 0, it exploits the fact that the CPU is often much faster than RAM and that there are lots of instances where you are basically streaming data to and from RAM. The memory controller allows the CPU to initiate the next write without waiting for the current write to complete.
With hard drives, you can put them in a RAID 0 configuration to split data between drives to increase read and write speed.  Is there an equivalent of this for RAM?  If I have 16 GB of memory, for instance, can I split it into 2 8GB sections and implement striping across them?  Note: I am not talking about using ramdisks at all.  I am not trying to treat ram as hard drives but rather to speed it up.  I have heard that there is a RAID 1 equivalent for RAM called mirroring, but I have not heard of a RAID 0 equivalent.
