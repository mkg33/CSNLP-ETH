The Windows audio service should now have no saved audio settings for Chrome and the next time that Chrome makes noise, it should do so at full volume and show up in the full mixer.
You can access the Chrome mixer through the Mixer link in the master-volume mixer from the audio icon in the notification area (figure 1) or by running (⊞Win+R) the full mixer directly with the command sndvol32. Make sure that Chrome is making noise (e.g., by playing a music-video on YouTube with the volume cranked up to the maximum in the player), otherwise it won’t show up in the full mixer.
If that doesn’t work (for example, if Chrome simply does not show in the full mixer at all), then what may have happened is that the persistent audio level for Chrome got stuck somehow. You can try to reset it manually by finding and deleting Chrome’s audio setting in the registry.
If by “missing from volume mixer” you simply mean that it is not producing sound, then check the actual volume-mixer applet. Starting with Windows Vista, Windows allows you to adjust the volume of each program individually. You may have lowered the volume of Chrome to an inaudible level and forgotten to raise it back up.
