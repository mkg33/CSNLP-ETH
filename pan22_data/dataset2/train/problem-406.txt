If you want CentOS - you can try to install same system with newer/different kernel via other medium (PXE boot, USB etc), or use custom spin built with anaconda including newer/other kernel.
And while we're at it, strongly consider not using a cheap desktop-class motherboard for a server that you aren't going to have physical access to. Consider at the very least a SuperMicro server motherboard with IPMI so you have some sort of remote management capability.
Some BIOSes allow you to turn off selected cores on multicore CPUs and you've got probably only one core turned on. Also make sure you've got the latest BIOS version.
If that does not work, they suggest booting with less cpus to see if that works. Once you get the system booted, you may be able to find additional information.
Assuming you've actually updated the BIOS as several people have recommended, this leaves you with two possibilities:

Aside from checking if you've got the latest BIOS for your motherboard, this forum post on arch linux suggests trying to disable C1E in your BIOS.
In no circumstances should you try to co-locate this thing as is. You'll just have an unresolved problem that you'll have to actually go retrieve your hardware to fix.
Go pick up a Sempron 140 or something else cheap from a shop and drop it in. If it's the motherboard, you should continue to get these errors; while if it's the CPU the errors should stop.
