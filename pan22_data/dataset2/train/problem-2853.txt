I have the exact same problem and MandoMando's idea of disabling bootcamp.exe fixes the reboot-on-login issue; but I've no idea what's causing the problem considering I've been using this Windows 7 install for about 3 weeks without issues. (I'm using Windows 7 64-bit) (I would have simply upvoted MandoMando's answer but SO/SU is so fickle about rep).
You may be getting a BSOD on boot. I think XP and Vista both reboot automatically by default when this happens. You'll want to disable this "feature" and google whatever error message you are receiving. 
Now, however, every time I boot into Windows and login it hard reboots itself as the desktop is appearing. After this it works fine again. Until the next power off.
I have a 2006 vintage MacBook Pro (Intel Core 2 Duo) and have been using Boot Camp since it was in beta. I had been running XP SP2 on it with Tiger quite happily.
I've recently wiped and reinstalled everything to upgrade to Leopard. After installing Leopard, I fired up the Boot camp assistant and used it to install the Windows 7 RC. That worked really nicely, but my HFS+ driver didn't work under Windows 7 yet so I decided to install Vista instead.
I didn't repartition the drive, just launched the Vista installation disk from BIOS and told it to overwrite the existing Windows 7 install. It installed fine and I installed the Boot Camp drivers, still all fine.
