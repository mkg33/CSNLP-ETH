You could run Perfmon and capture bytes sent/received/sec; you'd have to capture to a file to aggregate the data, but it will show you your peaks. It will include all traffic, not just SQL. 
If you don't have access to the switch, you can use a network analysis tool like Microsoft Netmon or Wireshark. There are probably easier tools to just measure data throughput, but since I am comfortable with Wireshark I usally use it. I would set up a capture on the relevant network interface using this capture filter on the SQL Server:
I have 2 servers : a database server (SQL Server 2008, called server A) and an application server (called server B) which send SQL queries to the first one.
You would want to enable netflow on the switchports the two servers are connected to and analyze that flow.
I try to estimate the minimum bandwidth required between the 2 servers, so that my application doesn't suffer from performance issues.
Replace ip adress of server B's actual ip adress, change the port if it is not a default instance, uncheck 'promiscuous mode' and start the capture, and then view the size captured in Statistics->Summary. 
I'd like to have, for example : for day xx/xx/xxxx, there was approximately 1.5 GB of data send from A to B and 750 MB from B to A.
I agree with the other posters that it might not be a good idea to split the servers, depending on the architecture of the application. A slight increase in response time between the servers could degrade the performance a lot, especially if there are many sequential SQL queries. That is also something you can observe in your Wireshark capture (but might be easier in SQL Profiler). 
They are actually in the same LAN, but we planned to separate them in 2 different geographical sites.
