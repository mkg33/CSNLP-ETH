Tip: If you have a cable with a Type-A connector on it and you want to know if it probably supports USB 3.0, see if the plastic inside the connector is blue. USB 3.0-compliant connectors are usually color coded blue inside. If you’re still not sure, look deep inside the connector and see if you see a row of 5 square contacts behind the usual row of 4 oblong contacts (on female USB 3.0 ports, the 5 square contacts are near the front). Manufacturers are unlikely to pay for the slightly more expensive connectors with the extra contacts if they didn’t intend to make a USB 3.0 cable. Of course, even if it’s blue, has extra contacts, and even carries the USB SuperSpeed logo, you never know if it might have been made by some ripoff artist company. There are a lot of crappy cables of all sorts out there, and some manufacturers have even brazenly pirated and misused the copyrighted official certification logos of the USB-IF. 
However, I would expect such cables to be exceedingly rare, especially a C-to-A USB 2.0 only cable, because there is no market demand for them, they aren’t much cheaper to make than one that supports USB 3.0, and anyone who picked one up accidentally would feel ripped off and return it as defective as soon as they realized it didn’t support USB 3.0. 
The official USB Implementers Forum standards for USB Type-C connector usage do have provisions for creation of USB Type-C cables that only support USB 2.0. So you can have a USB Type-C cable that is correctly designed and manufactured and fully within spec and passes USB-IF certification and carries the official USB logo, but only supports USB 2.0. Not only for C-to-A cables, but even for C-to-C cables.
