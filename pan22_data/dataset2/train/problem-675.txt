I currently have a Wireless N router + DOCSIS 3.0 modem on the 3rd floor of my home, and would like to have wifi access on every floor.
I used a set of 4 Netgear EoP units for my townhouse, before I invested in Ethernet cabling last year. While YMMV, depending on the electrical cabling in your house, EoP did work quite well for my general usage, including streaming HD movies from my NAS. I only invested in the cables because we renovated our house.    
The Unifi range (and many others), have zero hand-off, allowing your devices to roam between each floor. 
We don't necessarily need to have a single network throughout the house, if it helps (we could configure multiple APs). We just want every floor to have internet access.
In the long run, it will be well worth the investment. Once you have the Ethernet cables in place, you can put an AP on each floor. 
We've considered getting a repeater, but have also read that they cut bandwidth in half (we'd like to avoid this). We've also read that we can flash DD-WRT onto our $20 router and configure it as a repeater, which makes me question why people would buy $20 repeaters in the first place.
I have very little background in networking, and was wondering what the best way would be to do this at minimal cost.
If you own the house, it might be worth looking into getting Cat5/Cat6 cables installed to each floor or even each room. 
Alternatively, I'd recommend looking at Ethernet over Power - EoP. A much cheaper solution but similar to the above Ethernet option, you can put an AP on each floor, connected to your main router via EoP.
