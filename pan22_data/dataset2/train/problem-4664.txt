When I put more than one sheet in the tray, the printer takes a sheet, then when half of the sheet is picked up it picks up another sheet. That way the printer stops working and I have to manually remove the paper from it.
The problem is that one or two solenoids that control the paper feed mechanism are sticking. The foam pads on the solenoids get sticky over time. To fix them, you must disassemble the printer.
My experience on other printers has been been that carefully cleaning feed rollers with alcohol helps.
What happens is that if I insert just one sheet in the tray it takes that sheet correctly and prints out everything.
I have the exact same printer with the exact same problem. I tried different paper, different humidity, replaced all kinds of rubber parts, etc. to no avail. I fixed it yesterday by following the link in user3269930's answer. I'm writing the steps here in case the link goes down.
Another tip might be to run a dehumidifier or Air-conditioner in the area of the printer.  I had a Samsung printer that would always double-feed in the summer months when the humidity was high (>50%), but would work fine in dryer months.  Keeping your fresh dry paper in an air tight container before its put in the printer can also help as paper seems to stay "sticky" for some time after getting damp.
As was also said experiment with different paper types that same printer I had was also picky with the type/weight/grain of paper.  I eventually found that the a particular Domtar worked best and all my other printers were ok with it too.  Of course you should always "fan" the paper before putting it in and pay attention if there is static cling between the sheets.
Put it back together in reverse order and you're all set! You can test operation without the side cover on, but you will need to put the front door on. Obviously, don't touch anything that could shock you.
