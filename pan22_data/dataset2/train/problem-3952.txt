When used this way, VarChar only uses the number of bytes + 1 to store your text, so you might as well set it to 255, unless you want a hard limit (like 50) on the number of characters in the field.
Also please make sure that data in MySQL server is really stored as latin1, this can be accomplished with:
Also, don't forget that 233 limit is not character limit, and as some character might need more han 1 byte to be stored, you might see less than 233 characters.
MySQL is not cutting it at 233. The problem is likely in your save method which cuts it to 233 before the data even reaches MySQL.
I assume that either your MySQL version is different or your front end is displaying only 233 characters. 
255 is used because it's the largest number of characters that can be counted with an 8-bit number. It maximizes the use of the 8-bit count, without frivolously requiring another whole byte to count the characters above 255.
After that I execute your alter query and after successfully execution of query I added two records with more than 255 character.
