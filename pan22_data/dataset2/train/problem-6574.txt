I do it now by drawing triangles or flat models on top of it. But for this I have to draw them at - for example - y = 0.05 This causes problems, because too small value makes z-fighting, especially on Android, and I'm going to have more of these drawings, so I would need to use different Y levels. I want the object to be perceived that they are exactly at the table level.
A possible way to solve this problem is to draw your shapes on the table texture, and then apply that modified texture to the table geometry. This would allow you to keep the shapes at the exact same level as the table, and removes the need for extra geometry to handle them.
Additional bonus of this solution is that all 2D geometry drawn on the table is automatically clipped to the table bed shape (which is not 100% rectangular in my case and would be hard to clip otherwise). This is because 2d geometry doesn't write to depth buffer, so gets erased as soon as anything else is drawn in this place (ie. room walls).
I want to draw shapes (arcs, circles, lines) on a table, which is in 3D space. The table top is at Y=0 level and oriented so it points to (0, 1, 0). There are some other 3D objects on the table, so depth buffer has to be used. What is the best way to do this?
