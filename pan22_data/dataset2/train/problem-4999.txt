I'm also assuming that there are only a few hosts at each company and that 'Rtr A' is already doing NAT. If these assumptions are correct and you want to keep company X and company Y completely separate from each other why not enable DHCP on routers X & Y (using different IP ranges)? Putting in appropriate routes so that the routers know where each subnet is should finish off the job. Unless I have entirely misunderstood your requirements!
Connect each subnet router's WAN interface to a switch. Connect the Comcast router's LAN interface to this switch. Configure the WAN interfaces on the subnet routers and the LAN interface on the Comcast router to be on the same subnet (something other than what's in use already. Set each subnet router's DG to be the LAN interface of the Comcast router. Configure each subnet router to act as a DHCP server for it's respective subnet.
I'd approach this from a different direction, sure you could do all manner of routing but why not pay Comcast to give you two static IP's - it won't cost too much more and you can just carry on as you were.
