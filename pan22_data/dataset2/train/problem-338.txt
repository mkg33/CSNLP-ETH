This will let you leave the DDP enforced without any ill effect since there are no user settings in the DDP. It isn't pretty and I'd still like to know how to get rid of the settings entirely, but it will get the policy to function correctly.
please verify this process yourself it can cause one helluv a lot of problems if not done correctly !
I had the exact same problem. I also tried deleting fdeploy.ini file and got a message in GPMC that it failed to locate the settings, so clearly they're defined there but some setting elsewhere is enabling those settings and pointing to that file.
your trying to migrate users one at a time correct?   So you move the users into this ou that you created a new gpo for correct? And during this you don't want to hose up other users correct?  If these are all true then create another gpo that matches the ddp folder redir settings and place it higher up the ou structure thus impacting all users.  Then remove the ddp settings for Folder redirect.   At that point your new gpo settings will apply to the users within the ou that you created all the other users will get the old folder redir settings.
Find the GUID/(Unique name)  of the policy and go to \(your domain)\sysvol\Policies{GUID}\User\Documents & Settings\ and it should be there. 
Migrate data from the machines and reimage them. Sounds like that environment is the wild west anyway. Just wipe and start fresh. 
While I haven't found a way to completely remove the settings, I did find a better workaround. Instead of unticking Enforce on the DDP, expand the Group Policy Objects folder, right-click the DDP, and under the GPO Status submenu tick User Configuration Settings Disabled.
