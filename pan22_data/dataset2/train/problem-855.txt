I'm running some tests for a security project and here is the scenario. I have a SIP server (SBC) that accepts calls from a list of IP addresses. 
If your router has a non-stock firmware like DD-WRT or OpenWRT it's probably possible with some iptables commands to tell your router not to NAT your packet from the LAN given certain conditions - especially if the router hardware is VLAN capable and you go through the trouble of setting it up.
I'm not sure what security mechanisms residential ISPs can/will have against spoofed IP datagrams but if they have any measures in place you will trip them and possibly catch attention/get you in trouble.  You should really set this up on a private air-gapped lab and test there.
I don't care where the packet is being sent from and I don't care about getting any replies. I only want to know how to send this packet to the destination with this spoofed IP address that I choose. Please help!
I run wireshark and I see that I'm sending it correctly but my router changes the source IP that I spoofed to the public IP address and I can't find anyway to bypass this.
