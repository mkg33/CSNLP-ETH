In your example, your dealing with ANALOG data.  The previously recorded magnetic data wasn't erased, so it partially cancelled out or amplified your new data, since it wasn't virgin media.
Now, I believe that the issue here, is can magnetic traces still be recovered or have an affect on the data that you overwrite it with?
As Godric states, hard drive data is digital.  The media it is recorded on is magnetic, but we are dealing with 0's and 1's.  You can't have a 0.5.  So the previously recorded data has no impact on the currently recorded data.  
Since we are dealing with digital data, the drive mechanism writes the chunk of data, and a checksum.  That checksum is used to verify that no data integrity has been lost, and if necessary is used to help rebuild the data, if it has been damaged.  
If during read, that Checksum doesn't match the freshly generated checksum of the read data, then the data is silently repaired using the existing checksum.  So you can't get distorted data due to the previously recorded & overwritten data.
The issue also occurs with data recovery.  Once the data is overwritten once or twice, it will be nigh impossible to recover...  (See http://www.schollnick.net/wordpress/2009/04/oh-my-gosh-they-are-stealing-my-data/ ).
