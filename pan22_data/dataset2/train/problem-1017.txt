Your wording suggests that perhaps those users have never logged on to those laptops while the laptops were connected to the network. In such a case their credentials have not yet been cached. The laptops must be able to communicate with the domain controller for at least one login per account.
Firstly when you are setting up the VPN connection on the laptop, ensure that all users can use it. Next log off Win7. At the logon screen select switch user. Now you will see another logon option in the bottom right of screen. (Network login (Icon is 2PC's one behind the other and slightly offset)). Select this and your default VPN login dialog should appear. Sign in and the VPN connection will initiate prior to Windows login. Should you have more than one VPN connection, select the one you wist to initiate.
Also doublecheck DNS settings: is the default DNS server the same as (or trusted by) the login/domain server?
To overcome this, Simply connect a network cable to the laptop which will provide the DNS and domain information initially and try log in. Login will be successful. Now I can remove the network cable and use the laptop normally, because the credentials are cached back.
"If the issue persists, you can check “Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon” policy is disable under Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/System/Logon in the Group Policy."
For some reasons, the workstation's (in my case laptop) wireless network connection was not up during the log on stage. This prevents laptop to get DNS and domain information from network. Furthermore, the cached logon information was not available/corrupted.
Have a look to see if you can't launch the VPN tunnel before user login, that would be the best solution.
