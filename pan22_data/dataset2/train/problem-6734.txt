Your obstacle is not in implementing this concept (simply having a stat decrease every level is trivial).  Your obstacle is in explaining this mechanic to the player.  Simply having a "Focus" stat decrease every level with no explanation could be frustrating, confusing, and conflicts with any other RPG they might have ever played.
What jhocking said in the comments is what's common in games.  I don't think I could name a single game that uses the concept in the question.  By that I mean that games commonly have increasingly difficult challenges/enemies such that a protagonist who does not "level" appropriately finds the challenges more and more difficult.
One reasonable solution to relaying this properly to the player is to wrap the statistic in language explaining it as a skill specifically relative to level.  That is, explain that the Focus stat at level 1 is maxed at 1.  Upon gaining the second level, the Focus stat remains at 1, thus lowering the effectiveness of all abilities.  Couch that statistic in the same numerals used for "levels", always ensuring that "100% Focus" is "Focus = Level".  You could explain that each point below Level lowers the effectiveness a fraction, or you could give the percentage to the player ("Each point Focus is lower, all abilities are 10% lower in damage!")
