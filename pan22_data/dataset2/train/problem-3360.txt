I assume most servers are fending off stuff like this all the time, but is it unusual to have someone sit on a port like this? And is there an way to block certain IP's at the server level?
To figure out what's actually happening, you'll need to spend some quality time with your logs.  Spend most of your time looking for successful and failed logins.  Also just running "who" will let you know if someone is actually logged in via that connection.
I did Reverse DNS lookups on the address...and it seems to oringnate from China according to this resource...
All "ESTABLISHED" means is that the tcp session is open.  It does not mean that they have successfully authenticated.  Nmap, for example, will create a complete, legal TCP session when scanning port 22.  (It's verifying that the daemon is sshd, checking version strings, etc.)  This person could be running a simple port scanner or even attempting to brute-force your passwords.
I run a program called fail2ban which reads the logs of common daemons such as ssh and ftp. It uses regular expressions to monitor failed login attempts in those logs, and updates firewall rules to block the ip's of would be intruders.  You can customize the behavior of fail2ban in ways such as how many failed attempts before an ip is blocked and how long it stays blocked.  It works very well and I'm quite pleased with it.  Check it out here.
You can use a package such as BlockHosts to stop all unsolicited connections of this kind.  Here's a nice tutorial - it's for Debian Etch but nearly all of it applies to Ubuntu as well.
I've have had an Ubuntu 8.04 server running and on the Internet for a few days....I have Ports 21 and 22 open for FTP and SSH...All other ports are closed. 
It appears as if 125.211.221.145 has established an SSH connection to the server...and is sending packets out... Is it possible for someone to establish an SSH connection without  authenticating?
