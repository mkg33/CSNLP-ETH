Most players and metadata tools check for the presence of an Xing header to determine if the file is VBR or CBR. Note that you don't actually need an Xing header to have VBR, but without it, almost all players screw up and show the wrong duration. The Xing header isn't formally standardized, so you'll have to view the XMMS source code for the definition of what the Xing header should be.
This is my trick, it works only if you have a directory containing multiple mp3 files, and you know that they have the same encoding (VBR or CBR): If the files show different bitrates then you know they are VBR encoded.
Based on my tests, ExifTool doesn't actually report a file to be VBR when it's missing the Xing header, so it too is just checking for the presence of the Xing header as an indicator of if it's VBR or not.
This will tell you precisely whether a file is CBR or VBR. If it's CBR, you'll just see the bitrate, and if it's VBR, after the average bitrate label you'll see (VBR).
Install Checkmate first (the .deb file) by double clicking it and selecting Install in Ubuntu Software Center.
