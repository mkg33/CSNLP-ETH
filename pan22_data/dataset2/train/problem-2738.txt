If the account your kid used is a Microsoft account, you need to reset it online via Microsoft webpage.
My kid tried to set a password for their standard account on a Windows 10 system. Unfortunately the log in fails. I can get in as admin, but going through the settings interface only seems to allow me to set the admin password. My web search feels like it is leading me down the proverbial rabbit hole, telling me to go to the command prompt and type 
If it's a local account, press the Windows + X keyboard shortcut. When the WinX menu opens, select Command Prompt (Admin). At the Command Prompt, type the following command to reset the password of any local user:
If you're using Windows 10 Pro, you can manage your user accounts from within the Management Console. Open the management console by opening the run command "Win + R" and entering "mmc". Press enter to open. Once MMC opens, go "File -> Add/Remove Snap-in -> Local users and groups -> Finish -> Ok". From here, the MMC will list all the active groups and users on the machine, under their own categories. You can find the user you want to change, right-click on it and go "Reset Password", or similar. Hope this works for you, as an alternative method.
Note: replace user_name with the name of your kid's account, and new_password with your desired password.
