(Note: make sure that the "put your computer to sleep" time in the power options is set to the same time or more than the time you want for the lock screen to appear, or the screen saver wait time won't be saved)
After this the default power schemes will be extended with a few more settings, including "Console lock display off timeout", which you can change in Advanced Power Options as usual, or like so:
You can do it by right click on desktop and select Personalize and then under there select the Screen Saver. Now increase the Wait time according to your wish.   
First, I tried to increase the time before "turn off the display" by changing the plan settings under power options but I continued getting the lock screen in 3 min no matter what time I selected.  This was absolutely annoying because I needed to input the password many times while working. The workaround I found for this, was to increase the wait time in the screen saver settings to 15 min (for me this is enough). In this way, if the power options time off is set to 15 min or more, the lock screen will come out in 15 min, and if it is set to less than 15 min, the lock screen will come out at the time you set in power options.  I am not using a screen saver, but I needed to select one temporarily so that, the system allows me to change the wait time to 15 min, then after saving I put back my screen saver option to "none" and saved again.
Windows 8 (just like the previous versions) has a setting to display the logon screen when resuming after a screensaver is activated.
