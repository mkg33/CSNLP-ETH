If your full backups are taking the better part of a day, yes I recommend that you switch things up a bit.  But that all depends on a lot of environment specific parameters.  For instance, do you have a big window on the weekend where you will be able to do a full backup without interfering with users? (If not, you may need to look into filegroup backups)
By "log shipping" I'm guessing you're meaning log backup?  Log shipping is a high availability strategy.
(P.S. If you actually did mean Log Shipping then please clarify and I'll rework this answer.  But by judging by your question I am assuming you just mean log backups)
A full backup once a week, and diff backups daily (again, in a maintenance window) is pretty common.  As for your t-log backups, you need to determine the maximum amount of allowable data loss.  In other words, if you back up your transaction logs every 30 minutes, you will have a maximum of 30 minutes data loss if the tail of the log is corrupt and unrecoverable.  So determination will need to be made for transaction log backups.
