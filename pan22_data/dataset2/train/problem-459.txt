I used EaseUS to clone a hard drive and I ran into the same issues. I tried using the Windows 7 Install disk to repair the cloned hard drive's boot options, but without success. I tried all 4 of the BOOTREC options and got the exact same responses as jardane did. 
What I ended up doing to resolve the issue is that I used a copy of a GParted Live CD to boot the system. Once I had GParted running, I right clicked on my cloned hard drive's partition and selected the "Manage Flags" option. I then checked the flag for "Boot". After that, I restarted the computer and went into the repair option area from the Windows 7 install disc. It prompted me that there were problems with the boot configuration, and requested permission to fix the problems. I said okay and then it restarted. At that point, it still didn't work. I went back into the Windows 7 install disc repair options again and this time it saw my OS and I selected the startup repair option. Once that was finished, the computer rebooted and then successfully booted into my cloned drive.
I think the reason I had problems in the first place may be because I didn't toggle an option to make it a boot disc or something when I was cloning it. However, going back I don't see which option might have allowed it to work correctly.
