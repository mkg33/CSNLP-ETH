The reason you might consider FAT32 (keeping all files under 4GB) is if you want to be able to boot the same VM images also on a Windows computer (and on the Mac too).
If, as you say, you are not concerned about letting VirtualBox (or a real PC) mount this drive, there is absolutely no reason to use other filesystems.
Also, using FAT32 and HFS on the same disk is not that ideal solution as it seems. In order to have Windows PCs see the FAT32 partition, the whole partition table must be of DOS/Win type (Master Boot Record), so you have an HD with a DOS partition table with a Mac HFS partition inside. This is ok but has some limitations like booting (can't use it to boot the Mac). Using a "GUID" (modern Macs) partition table is good for Mac partitions, but your FAT32 partition will not be seen by any PC, making it quite useless.
VirtualBox files are plain Mac OS files, and HFS+ is the "normal"/"native" OsX filesystem, works well, is journaled (=less jamming/crashes) and has no strict filesize limits. Macs feel more "comfortable" on it.
