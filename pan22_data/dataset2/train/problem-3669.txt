Once it finds the right server to use, the client (in this case, the mail server) does a Tree Connect Request Tree to \DC\IPC$ does a get to \domain\SysVol.  You can get a list of the DCs that you need SMB to by doing a nltest /dclist:.  
I had a problem like this some time ago and it was caused by the FRS service in one DC being in JRNL_WRAP_ERROR. I discovered this after running DCDIAG and checking the eventlog if memory serves. If this were your case you could use the procedure in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315457 so fix it. Note that all my servers were running Windows Server 2003 SP2. Starting with Windows Server 2008 the replication is done by the DFS service so this could help http://support.microsoft.com/kb/292438 instead. Good luck!
It turned out to be a invalid Journal Entry or something of the likes. All I had to do was set the reg value ´HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NtFrs\Parameters\Enable Journal Wrap Automatic Restore´ to 1 and wait five minutes.
Group Policy processing is done as the user the relevant portion of the policy applies to.  If they cannot read the policy files, they cannot apply the policy.  Therefore, the users need to have read permissions to SYSVOL on the DC, and they also need to have SMB access to the DC so they can retrieve SysVol.
