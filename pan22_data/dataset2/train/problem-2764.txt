I have 2 nameservers running Windows Server 2008.  On these servers we have routeable and private/non-routeable ( 10. _ . _ ._ ) IPs.
Right-click on the server in the DNS management snap-in, and choose properties.  You can then select the interfaces you would like.
The problem is that a query for the nameserver's network name returns non-routeable ips.  These IPs need to be on the computer but shouldn't be returned by DNS.  I have selected the option to not automatically register these IPs in DNS.  
Also, I have tried fixing the nameserver ( NS ) records on the zone to be the 2 IPs we need them to be.  But sure enough, the non-routeable IPs get added as NS records repeatedly after being deleted.
I forgot to choose the interfaces that DNS listens to on the new server.  By default the DNS server listens to all network interfaces.  Because of this, it seems to register all interfaces that are enabled.
My problem is that everytime I delete these IPs, they are created again in DNS.  I have turned off dynamic updates on the zone on the server side and set the interface to not register in DNS on the client site!  But the IPs still show up.
