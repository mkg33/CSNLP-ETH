It uses Javascript to do RSA encryption. Therefore, your password never leaves your or your friend's machine. Please see FAQ in the above page for more info.
You don't give a lot of details regarding what's needed, but I keep my passwords in a Keepass file that is stored in a Dropbox. 
You might want to try NoteShred.  It's a tool made pretty much for your exact need.  You can create a secure note, send someone the link and password and have it "shred" it self after they read it.  The note is gone and you get emailed a notification to let you know your info is destroyed.
I'm looking for the best way to send passwords over the internet safely.  Options I've looked at are PGP and encrypted RAR files.  There are no real parameters other than getting from point a to point b over the internets without too much risk.
I tend to use synchronous methods for password transmition.  Often I just IM someone and tell them that the password they are waiting for is xxxxxx.  That way there is no identification of the server that the password works on and I can send it when I know the person is sitting there to change the password immediately.
To do it regularly, you'd be better off using PGP or SSH keys, so that you don't have to generate a new pair of keys every time.
