If it's for local use only and you can't get entries added to DNS you and your colleagues can also have a play with your hosts file to configure some new uris.
I am looking for a way to configuire a development webserver. My main goal is to be able to provide internal personel with access to these development websites for review and testing? I'm not sure if its possible to configuire something that would allow for the existence of urls such as dev.someprojectname.com that could only be accessed interanlly. I'm not sure if I need to have entries put into a domain controller or if there is a simple way of implementing this.
It can be configured just like any other IIS web server, except use a domain name local to your network (dev.mycompany.local) or some other DNS name that exists only for your local network.  If it needs to be accessible from the outside, use a standard domain name that will resolve externally, and disable anonymous access to the site in the IIS web site properties (use Integrated Windows authentication if possible).  Then, your developers can use their domain accounts and passwords to authenticate when they first access a dev site and use it normally from that point forward.
