Make sure your BIOS is up to date and chipset drivers and graphics drivers are NOT raising any issues. Disk has to be formatted as NTFS. This can be easily found from using performance counters/reliability monitor and event viewer system logs. In case if you are using nVidia systems, use the drivers from nVidia (not from MS Updates. However, there were instances where default Windows or older drivers not resulting issues). Then examine the logs. If you encounter nvstor64 this is due to the driver issues or disk failures (future). Note that nvstor64 report errors related to RAID or Non-RAID devices. 
You need to also check the hard disk by using either a live cd and performing disk checks (or with in built tools - computer manufacturer). You can also use tolls like hdtune or seatools (which is free). This could be an IO error or BIOS faulty configuration (RAID if used or SATA and power Raid or AHCI settings). Carefully examine the settings. All the firmware should be up to date. Make sure you perform a malware scan along with that. With that, check whether any process takes too much resources.
