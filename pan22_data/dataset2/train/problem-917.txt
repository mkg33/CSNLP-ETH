A 7200 RPM is going to read faster than the 5400 because of the spindle speed, however a lot of benching has been shown to show that the benefits are minimal. While a 7200 RPM drive will give you slightly better performance, focus more on cache size. A 64MB cache will give you considerably better performance than a 32 or 16MB cache.
This is only my suggestion, but stay far away from Western Digital if at all possible.   I've done hundreds of RMAs over the past 10 years and 85% have been for WD hard drives.   I do not work nor have I worked for any hard drive manufacturer, nor am I a consultant or spokesperson for any computer hardware manufacturer.   This statement is based only on personal experience.  Your mileage may vary. 
The actual benefit in regard to speed between the two drives is negligible.  If I were you, I would suggest taking a look at an SSD if you need to replace a laptop hard drive.   You will get a huge performance boost from any SSD when you compare it to a spinning hard drive.
