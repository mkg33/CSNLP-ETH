Your wireless LAN adapter Wifi does have an IP address.  ipconfig /renew will not renew adapters that have no connection.  Every computer with wireless and an Ethernet port will have an error like this if they are not both connected.
Wireless Local Area Connection 3 is a Microsoft Virtual Adapter as you can see in your second post.  It will not renew because it is not connected to anything.  
That's all you asked about but you mention, this has been giving me problems for quite a while, have you been seeing this error a while or is there a real problem?
It is usually better to do an ipconfig /release before doing an ipconfig /renew just to make sure it clears,  look at your adapters when you do the release first and you will see your IP is getting renewed.
The simple solution is open the device manager mmc devmgmt.msc - highlight the problem hardware and hit the delete key - do not put a check in the delete software option - At the top click the Action section and click on Scan for hardware changes.  Your network adapter will be reinstalled and the ipconfig utility will work again
