I am trying to use RPi to forward traffic to my home webserver. That is, a remote user should connect to the webserver through internet from anywhere. The setup is as follows: the RPi gets the internet access through the ppp0 interface (cellular internet). The webserver is connected to RPi on eth0 interface:
Since I do not see any incomming ping packages in the wireshark on ppp0 interface, I assume that they do not reach my RPi. But why not? I have a working internet access on ppp0.
I can see from ifconfig that the IP address on ppp0 is changed every time I restart the internet connection - I find it reasonable since the cell provider does not reserve static IP address for me. On the other hand, googling "what's my IP" gives me a different IP address. I assume that the later one is my external IP address. Therefore, I use it to ping my RPi, but I do not see any incomming ping traffic in the wireshark. In fact, I tired pinging both IP addresses - obtained via ifconfig and google, but pings timeout.
