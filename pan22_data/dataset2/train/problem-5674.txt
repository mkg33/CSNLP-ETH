Your computer will map areas of memory in order to access other devices quickly. In your case, your display is mapped to 1473 MB which means, yes, you do have 4GB of RAM installed however 1473 MB is reserved for Display operations. Normally, on-board graphics will take a larger slice of your RAM than a dedicated card however its not just display that can take out a chunk of RAM.
Thanks to everyone for their valuable suggestions. I guess the problem was with the OS.Because after increasing my ram from 4 gb to 8 gb still the usable memory was 2267 mb out of 8 gb, then I did a clean install of Windows 7.Now everything is fine and smooth, and usable memory is 7.9 gb out of 8 gb.
Or it  could be that your 4096 MB (RAM) - 1473 MB (Display Memory) = 2623 MB something (Available memory)
From what I know Available OS memory basically means the amount of RAM that's not being used right now. Please check your Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), go to the Performance tab and check how much memory is being used out of that 4GB of RAM. You might find your answer there.
