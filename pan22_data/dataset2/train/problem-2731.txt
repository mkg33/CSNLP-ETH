If the ldap server would allow you to query the password-attribute(s), depending on how it's stored it might be difficult to write a search-filter to match for an users password. The reason is that the userPassword attribute (assuming this is what you're using for storing passwords), may be stored with several different hashing schemes, and some of those schemes actually requires you to interpret the userPassword attribute, extract the salt, use the salt and the password supplied by the user to generate a digest, and then compare that digest against what's stored in ldap.
However, I would recommend (if possible) to bind to the users dn with the password he's supplied, and let the ldap server deal with the issue of verifying username/dn and password.
OpenLDAP has a faq-entry on the SHA/SSHA hashing scheme here, which also includes some code for verifying against a userPassword attribute which uses those schemes. It's quite possible to use other schemes as well, I do recall seeing MD5 and SMD5, which were pretty much the same as SSHA/SHA just with a different digest algorithm.
