Enabling Internet Sharing works (similar to the method you tried), but only if connected to a router.
I enabled ipv6 on my Pi running Raspbian and can connect from OS X using ssh. (Append ipv6 to /etc/modprobe to enable ipv6).
Connect from OS X using either ssh pi@fe80::ba27:ebff:fe19:5b37%en0 or more easily as ssh pi@NamePi.local
The first two numbers (192.168) represent your network address and the last two (0.50) are the 'subnet and host' numbers of the pi. If you try to connect by ssh with ethernet from the mac, the ip address of the mac must have the same network number 192.168, the same subnet number 0 but a different number for the host. In this case you might use 192.168.0.40 for the mac's ip. You can set this up using the Network icon on your mac's System Preferences panel using 'Configure iPv4: using DHCP with manual address', for example, on the ethernet settings.
Unfortunately netatalk and tightvncserver on the Pi cannot connect via ipv6, although these work using ipv4. (It may be possible using IP tunneling).
