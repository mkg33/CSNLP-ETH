Of paticular note, multimac can also do the exact same thing as veth, in a slightly different way, as multimac supports a many-to-one relationship, where veth is a one-to-one relationship.
I am adding the answer to this problem not just for OP, but for others out there, hopefully saving someone else from the grey hairs this gave me...
This is a very complex, very old question, involving several different areas, specifically VETH, Network Namespaces, ARP, route tables, and NAT...
Suffice to say, after much research and testing -- veth pairs can exactly be used this way, as they are literally two seperate virtual interfaces. However, because they are virtual -- you will encounter some really odd problems with regards to ARP tables/entries. After several weeks of tackling this exact scenario (necessary for work), I have figured out exactly how to do this, and in the process have learned way more about ARP, NAT, and routing than I wanted to.
In order to support this on without namespaces, you have to use policy routing (which is a bit more complex than network namespaces)
In order to accomplish exactly what you want, type the following (in my case, Ubuntu 16.04). Please note that once you are in the test namespace, you have to exit bash to leave, as everything (route tables, iptables, etc) from that point on is different than on the host machine. I usually open up two terminals, one that stays in the host -- the other that stays in the guest namespace.
