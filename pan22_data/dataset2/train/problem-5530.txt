The XP machine's HAL is configured for the physical hardware it came from. You have to install the appropriate Virtual Hardware drivers and configure XP to detect the new HAL before shutting XP down, then image the machine, and the image will boot under Virtual PC.
The drivers and integration components can be found in an ISO file installed wtih Virtual PC in C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Virtual PC\Integration Components\IntegrationComponents.iso. After that's installed run msconfig, on the Boot tab click the Advanced button, then check "Detect HAL". After that you should be able to shutdown the PC and image it to a VHD file.
(There is a chance your install of XP is missing certain drivers, this will cause a BSOD STOP x7B, when you boot the VM. The solution is to expand atapi.sys, intelide.sys, pciide.sys, and pciidex.sys from the WinXP CD i386 folder into the System32 folder before imaging the XP machine.)
Start the New Virtual Machine Wizard of Microsoft's Virtual PC, and give your VHD file when it asks for the hard disk, and your VM is done.
The vitual pc for windows 7 is limited at best.  You can still use that image with something called VMWARE.  Or if you like, In the settings of the vitual pc you can add a image file to the cdrom device.  with this image(winxp.iso/or other) you can install any version you like.  VMWARE has more options that will work with more formats.
I'd suggest VMware Converter. It can convert physical machines to virtual machines and supports hot cloning (make the vm while you're on the physical machine itself, just like disk2vhd). Any virtual machine it creates will work with their products. I recommend VMware Server as it is free and allows you to create and run virtual machines.
