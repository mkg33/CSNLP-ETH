I looked and most of the old mass storage drivers for NT have started fading away as many of the sites are gone or have been completely changed and the drivers no longer available.
Your other simple option would be to buy a USB hard drive enclosure/adapter/dock that has 2.5" IDE support.  You can find these things from $10 and up.  Simply remove the drive from the laptop, attach it to the USB adapter, and connect the USB to your new computer and access the files through Explorer.
The network transfer is probably going to be your simplest solution if you are familiar with setting up file sharing on Windows computers.  If you have trouble accessing the share from the NT machine for some reason, you could even go as far as to set up an FTP server on a newer PC (using [http://filezilla-project.org/](Filezilla server) for example and use ftp from the command line to upload some of your files off the NT machine.
This seems to be a driver issue. This can be remedied easily with any up-to-date Linux distribution. Boot from a Linux LiveCD, and then transfer your files to the USB external hard drive.
