I know C# decently and I'm planning on programming the computer myself, is there any E-book/web-based recource that's recommended for learning how to program a Raspberry Pi?
I'm thinking about making my first Raspberry Pi project and have some questions regarding what I will need to be able to complete this project.
If you press the second button, it will tell you all the pre-programmed events for the next 30 days, for example birthdays or appointments. It would sound something like this: "In [6] days, [it's Madeleins birthday.] In [25] days, [you have an appointment at the hospital at 5 o'clock]", where diffrent sound files are concatenated (or read up after eachother in the correct order). The sound files are manually recorded by myself and updated every month or so, based on my grandmothers plans.
So my question is, what Raspberry Pi version/parts/components are best suited to complete this project?
This machine is meant for my grandmother who has trouble remembering certain things these days, and has problems with her macula of retina, making her eyesight very limited.
If you press button number one, it will tell you the time and date with a greeting, read in my voice. For example: "Hello grandma, todays date is [XX/XX/XX] and the time is [XX:XX]."
