The worst-of-all-possible combinations is the dreaded "Click-and-Install" packages offered by many hosting companies.  This rolls an automatic install of Wordpress for you, but keeping it up-to-date is your problem.
This becomes even more time consuming if you use third-party themes and plugins to extend Wordpress functionality.  The problem will be that eventually your theme and/or plugins will no longer be compatible with some mandatory security upgrade.
There's a difference between "just set up" and "full-service".  With Wordpress, the difference is critical.
The simplest, most-secure way to deal with this problem is to use Wordpress.com as a host with their domain name.  They restrict your usage as much as possible to ensure that when security updates happen (and they happen automatically for you) they don't impede what you are trying to do.
If someone "just sets up" Wordpress for your friend, the inevitable security and version updates become his problem.  Because WordPress is so popular, vulnerabilities are specifically targeted by spammers and link-spam generators.  You have to stay up to date.
