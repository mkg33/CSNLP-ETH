The only other thoughts I have is that you have missing or corrupt file(s) on your image. According to the internets ( en.community.dell.com/support-forums/desktop/f/3514/t/â€¦ ), a gx620 should "work." The link states that packages from other dell systems have the proper drivers, none of the items in that thread look like pre-install drivers, and I see no complaints of needing to insert a driver disk to get setup working. 
The Dell Optiplex GX620 doesn't seem to have USB3 ports, so in your case this was probably caused by something else.
I ran into this issue while installing Windows 7 SP1 Pro x64 on a Q67 based Intel mainboard. The problem was that I kept using a USB 3.0 port to connect the DVD drive and the later the memory stick. Once I changed to a USB 2.0 port the installation succeeded.
Consider that it may be part of the install process to load a driver in order to probe the hardware. My guess is that is is actually telling you that it does not have a driver for the AHCI SATA controller which communicates with the drives. (dell would have them)
