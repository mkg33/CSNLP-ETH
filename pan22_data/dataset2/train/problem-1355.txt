But the next day I found that all images sent to me like the link above do not work anymore. I receive HTTP 404 error and blank screen.
Two days ago by some reason I entered a command /msnp24 to "improve" group chats. Nothing visible happened and I decided to leave it as is.
For now, you can use Skype Web beta. Note: Logging in to Skype Web beta will also fix the "Unauthenticated" issue that some people are experiencing with your workaround.
It is a well-known issue that with this old version all pictures sent by the other party are received as links like this:
After some experiments I have found that if I rewrite the link to another view it can work. But I do not want to do it for ever incoming link.
Thanks to the information provided in the question itself, I was able to create a chrome extension to automatically redirect to a correct URL.
I also use Ubuntu 15.10 (Mate) and the last 24 hours or so both skype image links I have received have been blank like yours. 
Rewriting the link as you showed says "Unauthenticated" for me even though logged into skype and manager on the web.
