Looks like an oudated system like I have some lying around. THat simple. Modern boards can handle 16gb in end user chips, and 64+ gb per socket server side.
I bought a Dell PowerEdge T310 in December 2009 with 8GB of RAM (and a 24GB maximum capacity) for $800.00 w/ a 3 year on-site warranty. There are definitely server-class machines that can support more than 4GB of RAM out ther for sub-$1,000.00.
The chipset (and, to a lesser extent processor) capabilities normally dictate maximum memory limitations. I'm sure that some of the limitations are a result of "market segmentation" efforts, but in general the higher-end chipsets that support more memory are more expensive. More memory sockets on the board can also mean a larger board, which translates into lower production line yields and more cost per part.
There is also the limit the operating system will support. 32-bit versions of Windows Server will support up to 4 GB, and 64-bit versions of Windows Server will support at least 8 GB (and much more depending the version of Windows).
