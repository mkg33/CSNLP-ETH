My question is does anyone know what the command is? I have scoured the Googles and am unable to find the information I found before and my bookmarked page has been taken down.
If all of the above are OK then you can try telnet server 22 assuming it runs on the standard port, and that Sierra is latest OSX. This will reveal tcp connectivity.
More arcane cases exist, like incompatible ciphers and mismatching versions, but if both ends are up to date the above should help you find the problem. If not you need help from the inside, i.e. root on your sshd server can tail -f /var/log/secure.
If you use ssh from the Mac Terminal you'll intend to connect to a remote server running sshd (ssh daemon). 
This returns permission denied when I enter the password (I am 100% sure the password and username are correct). I know the reason is because Terminal is not reaching out of the Mac. In the past I found a command that needs to be entered before you can enter "ssh username@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx". It is as if I have to enter a command to exit the Macs' localhost then enter the ssh server information.
