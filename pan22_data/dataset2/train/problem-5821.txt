To check whether or not your PC is "good" for a 64-bit OS, you'll have to find out which CPU you have, which you can do with System Properties (hit WINDOWS KEY+PAUSE).
Checking the specs of the computer (Intel core 2 duo) you can certainly install a 64bit operating  system. But that doesn't necessarily mean that a 64bit OS is going to run smooth. For it to run smooth you will have to add atleast 2GB more ram ie, total 4GB. Also not more than 4GB as I don't think your PC can support more than 4GB.
A 32-bit operating system will boot/run the CPU in "protected mode", while 64-bit software requires that the CPU operate in "long mode".  In short, you need to install from a native 64-bit runtime.  Which you should be able to do by booting from the Win8 install disc, assuming your CPU is 64-bit capable.
However, upgrading from a 32-bit OS to a 64-bit OS (even on a PC that supports 64-bit operating systems) is not supported as far as I know.
Is your CPU 32-bit, or just your current install of Win7?  Regardless, you won't be able to install/run 64-bit software from within a 32-bit runtime.  This would most likely rule out the ability to perform an "upgrade install" as well.
he can't run any 64-bit os,because of his cpu doesn't meet hardware requirements for 64-bit os.that cpu doesn't support Hardware Virtualization Technology,as you can see on Intel's page above.
