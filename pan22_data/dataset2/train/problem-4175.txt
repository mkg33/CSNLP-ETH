Someone posted this, and it works, I can highlight while scrolling and it adds up the number and added size on the go
I had the same problem. I figured that when you select "Organize" and then under "Layout" you click on "Details pane" it shows the file properties. I am happy to have found this out, was scratching my head intermittently [since it was not the most important thing in the world :-)]
Go to Organize, then in Layout menu check Menu bar. go to View in the menu bar, you can check the option of Status bar.

Right-clicking and selecting Properties displays the total size of whatever files and folders you have selected. If you right-click the "background" of the folder window, Properties gives you the total size of the folder, including any subfolders.
I haven't seen this mentioned but I highly recommend JdiskReport.  It is a small Java app that actually gives you a disk space report that includes all sub folder for the selected drive or folder but then allows you to drill down into individual folders.  It reports the size of each subfolder and of "Files in this Directory".  I have nothing to do with this program other than being a long time happy user.
