Unfortunately, I can't walk you through a recovery process without knowing which tool you choose, but most of them are relatively intuitive.
Of those, I have used Recuva, with success.  It is relatively easy to use and, best of all, is free.  However, that's a personal recommendation, which is not the purpose here.  All of these tools are capable of recovering data from a card that has been corrupted.
I am guessing that you originally only tried to look at the card in something like Windows Explorer, and not with Windows Disk Management. Only the latter will show you unformatted devices;  Windows Explorer won't recognize media until it has been formatted to one of the storage systems that your version of Windows recognizes.
Since your updated post shows that the card is visible on a Blackberry, you can try any of the common recovery tools for SD cards.  There is an article here which lists 6 such: http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9224577/6_data_recovery_tools_for_SD_cards_USB_drives_and_more
