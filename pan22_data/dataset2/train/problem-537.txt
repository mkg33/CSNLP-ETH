It will not fail WGA, simply because it was upgraded on another machine. If it is OEM, it will fail WGA, because it has been activated on another machine. If it is retail it will activate fine. You will, however, be in violation of the EULA, so while it may work fine, MS may not like it so much.
Legally you can't as you bought the upgrade to Windows 7 rather than a new license. This means that your Vista license is still "active". So if you girlfriend tried to activate Vista on her machine with your key it would fail the WGA check - if not straight away then at some point in the future.
As mentioned an upgrade version of Windows voids the licence it is upgrading, so you can't legally use it again. However... If you are in the EU, carefully check the copy of Windows 7 you bought. Due to the way Windows 7 was being distributed in the EU, Microsoft said that an Upgrade version would not be available until 2010, so Retail versions were discounted to the price of upgrade versions, many retailers still branded these as upgrades.
