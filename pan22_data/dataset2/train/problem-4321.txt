Simple..Just open  outlook from the 'run' command using the command line 'Outlook.exe /profiles'. The profile screen will come up...go through the advanced options and create new profile ,name it and make it the default option(very imp or u will have the same problem again!) and your outlook will open up. Once there, you can then see your corrupt profile and delete or view it and create new connection settings for your new profile. Had to try lots of stuff before i found this solution. I know how frustrating this can be so good luck guys!Post back if it works for you!
Do you have a WINS server, if so check records in there, make sure they match DNS. Again if you have a WINS server, is WINS-to-DNS configured? And is DNS-to-WINS configured?
Check DNS settings on the client, it should only have internal AD/DNS servers listed. Check on the Exchange server, should be the same (internal DNS servers only). Check the DNS records to be sure that whatever the exchange server's name is (the A record/s) correct, and there are no "extra" entries or anything strange there.
I'd run a repair on Office. You are getting errors relating to general functionality as well as connection errors.
Sounds like you may have hit the 32 connections limit with Exchange 2003.  We've been battling that for years without a fix for some users.  A reboot of the Exchange server will clean up the connections, but I've got no clue what causes it for some users.
Had this problem before and I really had a hard time getting answers for this. I found some simple trick on the net to make it work. Try disable then re-enable your NIC or flushing your dns then registering it again. But this problem will occur again if your restart your pc. I almost lost hope til I had this crazy idea. On your TCP/IP settings, i put the IP of my mailserver to WINS server settings then the problem just went away. I still dont know how did that resolved the problem so I'm still researching to get a clearer answer.
