If you don't have hardware problems, then if computer asks to push a button to boot from CD after you do the initial load, don't, let it boot from the hard disk.  Or, after the intial load, on the restart, go into the BIOS and change your boot order to boot from hard disk first.
FInally, highly unlikely but possible you have a rootkit virus.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit.  Again, I would guess this is NOT the issue, but it can be.  There are rootkit virus scanners out there though.
Is your BIOS or firmware set to always boot off the CD if one is inserted?  Try taking the CD out when you see the Lenovo screen on reboot.
If the installer is crashing while copying files (you'd see a bit of the Windows BSOD), you may have a hardware issue with your optical or hard drive.  If there was a corruption or incomplete copy issue with the CD I believe the installer would fail with a message rather than spontaneously reboot.
Also, you could download a Linux distribution (free and legal) and try to install that.  If the install goes good, it probably is not a hardware problem.  You can wipe your drive after the Linux install completes (if it does).
Do you have another computer?  The laptop drives are standard SATA connectors these days.  You could try to put the drive in another computer and load on that computer and see if you can reproduce the problem.  If you can, it is the drive or the CD, if you cannot, it is a boot order or hardware problem.
