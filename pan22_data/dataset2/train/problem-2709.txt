On my home desktop I submitted a change to opensteetmap through the tor browser and it sent fine but when I try in my regular browser it fails.
Turned out this issue was because of my MTU settings. I tested my mtu with ping -M do -s <size> <domain> and kept increasing size until it failed and when I found the maximum I switched my settings from automatic MTU to manual at the number I found.
I'm lost as to where I should check now as I cant see how some types of requests could work and some fail on a single website with https.
I have been having a strange issue on my home network where some http POST requests fail to finish. I have noticed this issue on 2 websites so far. When I try to edit a wikipedia page the edit page loads but when I hit send the post request gets no reply, the get requests all return 200. I also have this issue when submitting edits to openstreetmap. 
I have tested this on a few computers on my home network and they all have the same issue, my desktop at work is unaffected however (All computers are running ubuntu).
