A theoretical client could of course have a specific command or prefix that you would use to specify, if the command you are typing is a shell or SFTP command. Similarly to the ftp escape-to-local-shell prefix/command !.
So any solution that does what you ask for, would have to be tailored for a certain system and shell, to be able to understand what you are doing.
I know what I'm writing about, because I have implemented bit of this for my SFTP client, the WinSCP. There, within a SFTP session, you can open a terminal/console window, which starts an shell session and changes its working directory to the current SFTP working directory (by sending the shell cd command). So I know how hackish and unreliable this is.
But even then you may have difficulties matching the current working directories. If for nothing else then because the SFTP can be chrooted and the shell not. Bear in mind that the SFTP is an independent system, that in theory may use a completely different file system representation. 
There is nothing like "SSH commands". Those are shell commands. To an SSH terminal/client, the shell is just a black box with an input and an output. The client does not even understand that you type some commands, let only understanding them.
So the conclusion is, that this is doable, but it's so much hacking and so much system- and shell- specific that it's hardly feasible to make the system universal. A reliable solution would require some server-side components (like a special type of a shell).
