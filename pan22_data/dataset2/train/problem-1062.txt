However, I'm using 64bit Linux and have no problems. (My distro is Gentoo, but I think Ubuntu should also run quite stable.)
There's also the simple fact that if you ask a normal user whether they have a 32bit or 64bit CPU, they will look at you like you sprouted Zaphod Beeblebrox's second head.  This way, only users advanced enough to know whether they have a 64bit-capable machine will download it.  Otherwise, normal users might go "oooh 64, it must be better!" regardless whether they have the hardware.
A big problem with 64bit on Linux is the Flash Player. There's a beta plugin for 64bit, but it does not get security updates, so you either needs to use a 32bit-plugin (+32bit-plugin-wrapper) or you have to use the unsecure version.
Lack of drivers for your latest gadget might be a problem with 64 bit, but with 32 bit version of ANY OS you give up any use of memory beyond about 3 GB.  That was the decider for me since I need the extra RAM to run VirtualBox and other programs.
I had to double check since I don't recall seeing that warning before.  I've been using the 64 bit desktop Ubuntu for a couple years now and have not had problems other than the above mentioned Flash Player warning (Flash works for me but YMMV).  I'm on 10.4 LTS with several machines and they're all stable.
