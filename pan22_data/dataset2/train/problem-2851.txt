I recently had windows notifications that I had to change my password for security reasons, maybe some internal rule, and I did so.
The sysadmins are looking for something to solve this issue, but I'd like to get a head start on what to check in case it was some local machine problem here.
So I would like to ask if, either something on my machine may have caused that change, or a sysadmin changed my account settings from their machine?
After checking my account (the only one available on this machine as it looks like), it doesn't have the "Administrator" tag under my username anymore.
I mostly have to change the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file when I have to create new virtualhosts on my localhost, but today, I couldn't save my changes as it states only "Error: Access denied". (The last time I had to change something on it -- and was able to -- was on 02/03/2018)
And as I also set apache as a service, I cannot restart it anymore using XAMPP, Services.msc or the Task manager.
