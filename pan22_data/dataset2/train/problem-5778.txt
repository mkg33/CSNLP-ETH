I can't use the earth wire within the main socket can I? I figured it will be very very dangerous. I don't want to be connecting to the earth block on the mains either since I totally incompetent when it comes to mains electricity.
Shielding is protection from radio frequency (RF) interference, usually by a foil wrap around each pair or around the whole bunch of 8 wires (inside the sheath). Shielding works better when earthed (arguably it does not work properly when not). 
I'm going to install 5 Ethernet sockets in my house using cat5e shielded cable. I decided to use this because the sockets will be on the second floor and the most practical way up is within a trunk along with some mains wiring. 
The cable will be terminated at the router and at the Ethernet faceplate. What can I use to earth then? The faceplate/router are both plastic hence no earth wire needed. 
Earth wire of the mains would be suitable assuming a) you can connect this safely, b) you only earth in one place. Grounding the shielded cable will NOT earth your PC at all, the earth wire of the power cable does that, or PC must be double insulated (eg if a laptop). 
If for any reason the ground potential of a computer on the second floor is different than the ground potential of the router, then a ground loop will be formed via the shielding, possibly causing damage to either the cable or the router or the computer.
