Your VirtualBox network configuration sounds weird. The best approach is to configure bridged networking, which puts the VM directly on the LAN. The static IP should just be configured inside the VM.
I've set up a Ubuntu 10.04 Virtual Box with a Bind9 DNS server. The Box has a NAT Network connection for internet access and a host-only adapter for static ip connections from the host (OSX Lion). Thats the only way i managed to get internet and static ip inside the box, guess there is a better one ...
The DNS works fine from inside the virtualbox, but not from the host. The http and ftp on the guest system is accessible via both addresses, so connection between host and guest are fine i guess. I tried to add both IP's as name servers.
I'm completely new to Bind9 and DNS configuration. Anybody has a hint for me whats wrong? Or how i have to configure the DNS server?
DNS operates on port 53, mostly UDP but TCP as well. Test basic connectivity with ping and then telnet on port 53.
It should show you whether port 53 only listen to localhost (127.0.0.1). If this is the case then you have to check your configuration on allow-query.
