You can assign a customized shortcut for any specific input method. Please give it a shot. And if you guys find any bugs, I would happy to help.
On AppleScript you must only take cmd + "space" (or something other, what you change keyboard source).
Also, Karabiner (known as KeyRemap4MacBook) is a great keyboard customizer for Mac. But it's a little bit complicated and currently broken on Sierra. If you're using Yosemite or El Capitan, it would be another nice choice.
I have another solution that has satisfied me the most. KeyRemap4MacBook is application that allows you to remap your keyboard buttons. Among other things it allows for some, not at all exhaustive, support for language change. So we some custom configuration it does what I want.
I know it's an old question. But even in the end of 2016, I still didn't find a simple and nice solution. Therefore, I made IMEShortcuts, works on Sierra.
Invoke scripts however you want, e.g. use your application launcher (Quicksilver, Launchbar etc.), or wrap them in Services using Automator, and assign them keyboard shortcuts in System Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Services.
This link has a video on how to do it. It already has a hotcake with is "command + space", but the spotlight hot-key is also "command + space". Spotlight over-riders the hot-key, so the language switch doesn't occur. The video in the link will show you how to change the hot-key so that you can toggle the hot-key.
Save once for each language, switching out the name of the language. If you want to press different keys, or assign something different from Ctrl-F8, substitute with the key codes here. You can also move the Input Sources menu from its leftmost position by inserting a few right arrow key presses.
