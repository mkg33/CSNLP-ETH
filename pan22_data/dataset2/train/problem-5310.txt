In my company, we have a server that needs to run several tasks and need a user to be logged on (despite my requests to change those procedures).
Now I need to know to know who did it. On event viewer I can only see which account has made the logoff an when, but I need to find out which user did it, by knowing which computer name or ip made the connection on the server.
At the end, if you put a SERIOUS amount of effort into having procedures that are unreasonable from a security point of view, you can expect to be successfull and have a serious security and auditing problem. And this is what happened. Inform the powers to be that basically if you insist on not tracking this, do not come back and ask why it was not tracked or demand it to be tracked.
Not really. You could try to trace the machines from the logon events in the event log - but that will be time consuming, and as you say - it is already uselesss as it is not granular enough.
Honestly, it's already not an ideal setup for security to begin with, so anything you do at this point is just going to be internal communication among those involved or #2 above.
