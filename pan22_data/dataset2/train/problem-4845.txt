First, I set up two lists.  One was all of the state abbreviations and the other being all the accepted street suffexes which I found here:
User1282637, I have set up an example to show you below. I have only made it to be a starting point so you can finish with your own complete answer.  
Then select a cell that contains the address and return to the window where you pasted the code and press F5.
I display what is remaining because in your case "Courts" from "Basketball Courts" is also a street suffix:
And I need to split it up into: street address (120 Lemon Street), city (Columbus), state (OH), zip code (92738) and description ((Basketball Courts))
I used the formula that I listed simply to convert the list to start with a capital letter and then the rest be lower case, like how you had yours written.
Is there a way I can do this? All of these are in the same state, so that is not a problem. They are in different cities/towns and have different zip codes.
This part could be done many ways but I decided on this way for an example. It will simply list a number in the corresponding row that finds a match for the suffix used. 
Now I haven't done the city and state but following this idea, you can achieve this.  Also if you want a more clean option then definitely look into learning about VBA more. I do hope this at least teaches you some ideas of how to go about this.
