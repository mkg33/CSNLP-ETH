Really, go buy some cheap PCs. You should be able to find new, low-spec machines with no storage for under $100 (US).
I am using NComputing x550's(thin client) with  a single hp proliant ML110 with ubuntu 11 installed on it. Once the number os users reaches 3, the perfomaces gows down like the system responds slow.   What is the best linux distro that will work good with Firefox,phpedit or some other editor based on ubuntu or redhat.
"no i am not going to do any modification in the thinclient" (Satya) - then there's nothing much you can do to improve performance. Using Chrome instead of Firefox may help, along with the usual tuning, but its not the right way to solve the problem.
Normally I'd say that any of them would work fine since the way we use a thin client is to connect to a terminal server somewhere. However, it sounds like the thin client will contain the entire OS. In that case, take a look at Puppy Linux and Damn Small Linux. Both are extremely small distros and have applications for most uses in that small footprint. You could also take a look at Linux From Scratch, this allows you to roll your own distro.
X550's are (AFAICS) not thin clients - indeed they don't even appear to be terminals, it looks like they are additional displays/keyboards on the host system. As such they only create load on the server, they'll never take load off the server.
Using Xterminals will help with the performance - but if the access is via HTTP, then it makes a lot more sense to run a browser client at the terminal.
