Note that many modern EFO firmwares support a legacy mode. This is likely what you enabled when you selected the Legacy only in the EFI.
And maybe to late for this time, but for completeness sake: It is possible to move windows between hardware. Usually this is started with sysprep which cleans out old drivers, sets compatability drivers etc. That is not an option unless your old system is still running since you need to do that before moving the disk.
A second no because moveing an installed windows OS from one computer to another is not likely to work if the hardware is different. Windows tries (and is) smart about hardware and does some smart things in order to boot fast. But that also ties it to some hardware. 
Option 2 is likely to be accompagnied with needing to activate windows again (and hopefully you bought a full license in a shop for a windows version which allowsyou to install it on another computer. Moving the license from the Lenono setup is likely not allowed if it is a Lenovo OEM license).
You cannot swap between those. Installing in MBR mode and then moving to an EFI setup will not work. Neither the other way around.  Use whatever settings you used for the old setup.
