Here it is another groovy (if I say so myself ;-) solution, hold the Num Lk key down for 5 sec and windows will give you the choice to receive a differentiated on/off tone when you touch the three lock keys (caps lock, Num Lock, scroll lock). This feature is called Toggle Keys.
Has worked very well for nearly the last decade on all workstations, requires no fiddling programming, startup script or registry edits.
Not really an answer, but just to sympathise if you're trying to do the same thing (it might be time to remove the key from the NumLock key on your keypad ...).
Remove the key-cap and put it in your drawer.  The Insert key was giving me trouble, and the best way to deal with it was to remove it from the keyboard completely.  When software turns numlock back on, use a software keyboard to toggle it off again, and attempt to prevent that software from doing it again.
Or the quickest and easiest way since our whole company is 10-key literate and hates it when it reverts to the flippin' duplicated arrow keys.
