That is all great and dandy...but i wanna for example remove 320x200 up to 1024x768? Is there is any way to do that and how can i set/see refresh rate?
The refresh rate is an entirely different question. By default MonoGame / XNA refresh at a fixed 60fps so you may want to turn that off.
Or of course, you could get more clever and somehow include Height or AspectRatio in the filter. That parts really up to you.
To remove the resolutions you don't want you're going to have to create some custom logic. I'm not sure exactly what you want but you could do something fairly simple, like filter out resolutions with a width less than 1024.
One last thing you should know is that the frame rate might be limited by VSync. This means the game's refresh rate will be limited by the refresh rate of your monitor. To turn that off set SynchronizeWithVerticalRetrace on the graphics device manager.
I don't think your code is doing what you think it's doing. If I run that code on my computer I get 23,879,696 resolutions in the list.
