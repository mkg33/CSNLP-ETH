CIFS/Samba and NFS are profoundly different protocols with different implementations. Of course there may be reasons to prefer CIFS over NFS in certain scenarios, sometimes even out of performance considerations (CIFS offers more intelligent caching support through the use of oplocks whereas NFS lacks such a mechanism). The reasons for preferring Samba over the NFS implementation in a pure Linux environment obviously would need to be carefully weighted, but may be valid nonetheless.
For the general use, I would quote from the conclusion of a paper by one of the Samba team members, which also offers a lot of information comparing these two protocols:
I'm learning for the LPIC exam which includes a section about Samba. I'm asking myself, whether there is any meaningful or useful application for Samba in a pure Unix/Linux network without any Windows clients or servers?
As in: No people coming from outside with laptops, no small devices that can deal with a windows share but not anything else. Example? I recently installed a computer. I COULD have mounted the ISO file in the KVM from a windows share, but not from anything else - so I did use the mapping from my browser via Java remotely, but just to make the point: a lot of stuff supports windows style file shares, and you can be "all linux" as you want, when you call your supplier and get them reprogram a firmware you do not look smart.
