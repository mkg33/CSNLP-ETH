When you do this you might notice another precondition error message about the "lzop" package. This package is only in the "epel" repository. So install first the "lzop" package and then install "amavisd-new" with the "epel" repository disabled. That solved it for me.
After that, I go with yum -y update as it was said in the installation guide. However, I get errors on two packages: amavisd-new-2.8.0-4.el6.noarch (epel) and razor-agents-2.85-1.el6.rf.x86_64 (@rpmforge). When I disabled EPEL and installed Gitlab, I couldn't manage to make it run. So I want to make sure to do everything as it was mentioned in the guide.  
You can simply disable the epel repository for the installation of amavisd-new via a command line parameter. 
As it seems the "epel" repository has some problem with the "amavisd-new" package that causes this problem. As the "amavisd-new" package is available as well in the "rpmforge" repository, you can install it from there. (same version as far as i could see)
I was running into the same problems. As you have as well, I have the "epel" and the "rpmforge" repository installed. 
I want to install Gitlab 6 to my CentOS 6.4 x64 server. I'm following the tutorial and enable EPEL with this command:
