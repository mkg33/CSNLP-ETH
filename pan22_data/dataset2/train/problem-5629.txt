However upgrades become problematic.  Often an upgraded app ends up back in Applications, while the one originally installed remains wherever you moved it.
You can manually set a directory where you put aliases to your apps, just like Windows start menu. Put that directory to your Dock, and that's all!
Another option is to bring this folder down onto the doc.  Right click on it, and set view to "Grid"
I found that a better way was to let OS X put the apps where it wanted, but to create a link tree (MyApps) organized the way I wanted it.  Make aliases to each app, then move the aliases into the folder tree where you want them.  Optionally you can place apps in more than one place.  
It is free and you can just type the start of the name of the program and hit return and it will open.
I have recently started using Mac OS 10.6 along with Win XP. In Windows, applications must reside in their installed directories. However, shortcuts to the executable files can be organized as desired in the Startup menu. I have adopted this strategy in the Mac OS as other posters have suggested; i.e., by making aliases to Applications and organizing these in a "Programs" folder with subfolders. The Programs folder can be placed in the Dock for convenience, and the Applications folder can be removed from the Dock.
I have always chosen to create subdirectories in the /Applications folder for organising things. There are several options, but if you prepend your category folders with - they will always be sorted at the top (assuming you sort alphabetically):
