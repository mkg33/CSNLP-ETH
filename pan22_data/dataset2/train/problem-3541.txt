So unless everything supports hot-swap, unplug the drive while the machine is not running then start it up again, and to test the resync process again power off the machine before changing what is plugged in. If all is working as it should the controller will see the drive reappear and start a full resync.
Unless the controller and the drives support hot-swap unplugging one while the system is running is very risky. They'll probably survive but you could potentially permanently upset the controller on the drive or, worse, the machine's I/O controller.
Remember that the resync will take quite some time - unless the controller uses a write-intent map (which it almost certainly won't as it is both an advanced technique and something that can have significant performance issues so will be turned off by default if the controller supports it) or some similar technique it will read then entire 2Tb from the "good" drive and write it back to the drive that has been reinserted into the array. During the time it takes for this to happen you array is operating in a degraded state and if something goes wrong with the other drive in that period you may end up with a badly corrupt filesystem on the surviving drive.
