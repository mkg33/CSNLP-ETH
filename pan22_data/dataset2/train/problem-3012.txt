It was with this way that I managed to get a mirrored drive to be bootable(which is a problem very popular on the internet apparently)
I worked around this problem by instead of expanding the partition, I just convert it straight to a dynamic disk without messing with the partitions. 
I have a bit of an odd setup. Basically, originally in the server was an older lone 160G harddrive. We've decided to upgrade it to a RAID-1 mirrored 2 disk setup against two new 500G harddrives. It'd save a lot of time if we didn't have to reinstall server, so I decided I'd give cloning the disk a try. I can successfully clone it (manually using dd from an OpenBSD install disk). It works after that, but it has over 300G of unallocated space. I wanted it to just be one big parition, so I used GParted to resize the parition. It works after this, chkdisk runs without any kind of errors and such. 
Also, I'm aware of the needed 10M of unallocated space on the drive. I went ahead and left 100M just to be safe. 
Is there anything obvious that would cause converting a perfectly fine basic disk to a dynamic disk to fail?
However, I may have figured out how to of solved this. My theory is that you have to take a basic drive, convert it to dynamic. Then, you will get the read error. Now, you must manually copy the bootsector from a working and booting dynamic disk to the disk you just converted. 
Then, when I try setting up this one drive to be a dynamic disk, it will say it must unmount and reboot the computer and such. Consistently, however, when it reboots I just get the error "A disk read error occurred. Press CTRL-ALT-DEL to restart" or something along those lines. I've tried this 3 times, with the same thing each time.
