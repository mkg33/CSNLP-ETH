It is a common bug and I've had it happen to me back in Win2k as well. Must have snuck into the kernel somewhere back then.
In their quest to have the best benchmark times, the drivers are very aggressive at removing drawing requests that they think are redundant. Sometimes they get it wrong.
All versions of Windows have had this or a similar problem for almost as long as I can remember. It happens in Vista too.
Try turning down your Hardware Acceleration in the Display Properties Settings/Advanced. If that makes a difference, it's probably due to driver bugs.
I've noticed this before once or twice on older NVIDIA graphics cards and in Virtual Machines. I do believe this to be a graphics card problem and it is extremely hard to replicate. 
I believe it has something to do with GDI+ and how XP draws things directly to the screen. You might have noticed this when you can drag a window around and it leaves copies all over the place. In Vista and Windows 7, the Desktop Windows Manager handles those draw requests and is much less prone to that sort of behavior.
