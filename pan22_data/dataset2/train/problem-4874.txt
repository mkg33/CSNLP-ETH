Wikipedia has a fairly comprehensive list of new features in Windows 7.  I like that it has a lot more video codecs built in so I can watch my collection of video files without having to install anything extra.  Jump lists are pretty useful as well.
The rearranging taskbar buttons is nice, I only recently learn you can do the same thing with tray icons!  No more going into the stupid customize dialog to get show/hide a tray icon.
For example, clicking a taskbar icon and dragging upward will bring up that icon's context menu/jump list (the same as right clicking). Similarly, clicking on IE's address bar and dragging downward will open up your history. Dragging to open a context menu makes sense because in a "touch only" scenario you wouldn't have the equivalent of a right-click.
I haven't confirmed that this "drag to open" feature affects all ComboBoxes but it wouldn't surprise me if it does.
The ability to mount and create VHD natively using the Disk Manager. Also the ability to boot of a VHD. 
You can play a game of Solitaire, leave it mid-game, close the program, then open it back up in the same state. I haven't tried it with the other games, but I think that is a cool feature.
