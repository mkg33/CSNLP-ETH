I've found a few guides to do this with reverse port (e.g. howtoforge reverse ssh tunneling guide) but I'm concerned with security of the stored ssh credentials required for the tunnel to be opened automatically. 
I am deploying demo Ubuntu 10.04 LTS servers in environments I do not control and would like to have an easy and secure way to administer these machines without having to have the destination firewall forward port 22 for SSH access. 
You can use autossh to maintain a reverse tunnel which will allow you to log in with SSH. The tunnel should be created with an SSH key which has restrictions in ~/.authorized_keys so that the only thing it can do is setup the tunnel (see man authorized_keys for details). The following would only allow this key to be used from 1.2.3.4, and not allow any commands to be executed with it.
If the machine is compromised (primary concern is physical access to the machine is out of my control) how can I stop someone from using the stored credentials to poke around in the reverse ssh tunnel target machine?
