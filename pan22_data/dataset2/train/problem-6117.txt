However, it is the "if at all possible" part where we an issue giving a specific answer based on your question as it directly relates to the equipment you have available.
I personally don't know of a single device (small business or better) sold as an "access point" that does not have this capability. Beyond that, the question is whether your switches/routers also have this capability. Without knowing more details, no one could give a better answer.
very depend on the AP  , for example in Cisco AP you configure the port connecting the AP as a trunk and the MGM Vlan (10.0.0.0/24) will be configured as a Native Vlan on this port and just allow the data Vlan (192.168.1.0/24).   
Since you asked a general question, yes it is possible. As a matter of fact, I highly recommend this approach and all wireless deployments I have a hand in do this if at all possible.
I was wondering if it is possible to have guest WiFi network on subnet 192.168.1.0/24 and Access Points to that WiFi on subnet 10.0.0.0/24. What I am trying to do is to block WiFi users access to AP configuration sites. 
You have to configure AP's to work in managment vlan and on switch set 2 Vlan's on AP's port: tagged managment vlan, and 1 (lan) vlan untagged for users.
