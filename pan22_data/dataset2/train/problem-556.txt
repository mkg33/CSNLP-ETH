You've got the MAC address so assuming these are brand name machines rather than generics you should be able to track down the manufacturer ( http://www.coffer.com/mac_find/ ), that may narrow you search slightly (assuming you don't have all Dell or similar). 
If you have unmanaged switches your options are limited but you can always try the disconnect/reconnect trick for your segments. If done logically you should be able to track down the machine pretty quickly and disconnect it, this will get its owners attention.
You can use the IP address and a port scanner like nmap to finger print the host and find the likely OS it's running, perhaps narrowing it down further. 
If you have managed switches, you are able to trace the MAC involved and shut down the port - and then just wait for the angry user complaining about the network being down...
If the host is running Windows it will display an error if it detects an IP conflict on the network - I'd suggest intentionally causing an IP conflict and using that method to flag up an alert on the screen of likely candidates.
If that doesn't work it looks to me like you're most likely going to have to resort to some old fashioned tracking. This sort of thing used to be done by unplugging cables until the culprit was found. While that may sound excessively brutal it's part of the price to be paid for such an appallingly set up network.
If the switches have SNMP you may be able to find the PC by observing the counters. No guarantee of course but worth a shot.
