We tried Track4Win to accomplish this, and found it to pull all of the information we wanted.  However, it doesn't feel like very good software, and it scales horribly.  Once we got past 50-75 users, it couldn't keep up with the information coming in to it.  I also found a few instances when the server was disconnected for whatever reason that the clients would all freeze up for a minute.
My actual recommendation is not to monitor the employees, but rather just block them from being able to do the things you don't want them to do.  If you don't want them browsing the web, etc, block the web.  Or, you can block facebook, gmail, etc company wide.  Then just set up a few workstations in a break room that are not monitored where they can check their own email during their break time.
The cons aside, if you have a smaller group of users, this might work out very well for you because it's easy to use (can be a GPO to execute the application off of a network share; ie, no local installs) and does pull a lot of information (web history, time spent on each application, and screenshots).  Worth a trial at least.

We use VNC with all prompts off to view and snapshot desktops. Just make sure you set the default to not capture the keyboard and mouse if you are concerned about them noticing so you don't accidentally move the mouse on them.
If it's mainly about websites visited then you'd be better off installing a proxy server which all web requests go through. You can then enable logging in that.
