If it is a VM, and you can change some parameters, try to set up another type of network adapter, as that looks network related.
I've had these problems as well and the solution for me was to upgrade the ESXi from 6.5.0-standard (build 4887370) to, in my case, a Dell customized image of version 6.5.0U1 (build 7388607).
At first, I thought it could be a RAM problem. I used memtest86+ on the host and no problem was found. I also tried the debian package "memtester" which runs very well in the VM and doesn't make the OS freeze whatsoever.
I fixed it by changing the network adapter type for this host from the default "VMXNET 3" to "E1000e".
I can reproduce the problem very easily: I just have to execute wget a couple of times and the OS will hang.
I had this exact scenario going on. Created a Debian 9 VM under ESXi 6.5 and it would freeze when running a few commands. Also, when I closed an SSH session, it would completely freeze and my only option was to reboot.
Sometimes when I execute a command, the server will freeze and nothing can be done besides resetting the VM (the SSH server becomes unresponsive, all terminals are freezed, it doesn't show a KP or anything else)
Also, check also the dmesg output from time to time, even if it is working ok, as it may show other problems.
I had this problem and checked the settings. I discovered that VMWare 15 Player defaulted to only giving the VM 512MB of RAM and 1 processor. I increased it to 4GB and 2 processors, and the VM now works with no freezing.
