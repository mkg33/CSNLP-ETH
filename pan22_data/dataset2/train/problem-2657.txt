2) Download NOOBS (new out of box) following instructions install/extract to formated SD card (for format u need not worry with all lengthy scripts and softwares do some possible quick fromat).
now the latest release is pi3 it has 1gb ram, bluetooth 4.0, soo over all the board configurations upgraded compartive to previous pi2 board.
best is some shopping websites like amazon they are selling pi3 with adaptor SD card with pre loaded NOOBS  HDMI cable ..etc soo if ur new better go for like this online purchase which is better. i struggled for adaptor and OS making it to work.
An SD card of class 6 or 10 is compulsory minimum 8gb but 16gb is best because if u tend to download or save any offline it will be useful under 8gb if it sucks with update MB's again worry.
I also tried to connect the RPi directly to the router via Ethernet, hoping that it will connect to the network and then I can SSH to it, but the RPi lights under the Ethernet port did not light up.
4) now after booting u need to see PIXEL name on screen. In NOOBS they pack with PIXEL as default OS. default screen saver of some black highway road close up.
I was wondering if there are other options, because in my case, right now, the first option is not doable because I don't have a keyboard, and the second option is not doable because the laptop does not have an Ethernet port and I am not able to get one right now.
3) after doing all instructions succesfully insert SD card on to the pi module now switch on the pi with 5V 2amp adaptor upon usage of ur application u may need to increase upto 5v 2.5amp.
