You may have already found this answer from Microsoft, but in short - you need to enable Spotlight search. Outlook uses OS X's built in search engine for its own search, and apparently also for displaying Tasks. In short, a Task won't appear until it's been indexed.
I closed Outlook, went back to Spotlight prefs, removed that User Data folder from the Privacy list, and my tasks reappeared when I restarted Outlook. Only took a minute or two.
In my case, I had set Spotlight to ignore a Microsoft User Data folder (i.e., don't index it), because my Mac's "Today" and "Past Week" searches are spoiled by hundreds of irrelevant Outlook files that clog the list of search results.
It seems that Spotlight must be allowed to index that folder. Otherwise, Outlook 2011 won't show my Tasks.
I'm using El Capitan with Outlook 2016. My tasks would not show up, though I could add a task and have it show up in my phone and in OWA. I got my tasks to show up by adding and removing my Outlook profile directory to Spotlight Privacy.
