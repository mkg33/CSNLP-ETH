You'll need to specify exact location to make nginx process it before ~.php {} block, copy fastcgi parametrs so url will be passed to the php and change the uri with rewrite rule. Config block with login location should look something like this:
THere is a piece of legacy code I'm working on, I can't alter where it POSTs to so I just need to figure a way around it.
which is pretty weird given that it is posting to a directory, but anyway I want to configure Nginx to accept posts to this location and then pass them to a bit of PHP in my Nginx config I have the following inside a http block
My error logs/ access logs don't really give me to much. I was getting a 404 on the hello.php but fixed that by putting the "index" in. However that never ended up calling the bit of php. I've also tried putting the fastcgi stuff into the /authenticate/login/ location within the nginx.conf.
At the crux of it, if I post something to /authenticate/login I want to call a piece of php to return the necessary values.
