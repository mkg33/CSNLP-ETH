If windows fails to format your hard drive to exFAT, you can use third-party tools to do the formatting thing for you. For example, PartitionGuru can format hard drive to exFAT as well.
I have an internal hard drive that I use as storage where I dump the stuff I need backed up. I want to format it to exFAT instead of NTFS so that it doesn't have to deal with permissions. The problem is, it only appears to be available to format as NTFS. Is there a way to force it to be formatted as exFAT?
Well it appears that Windows 10 support for exFAT has been dropped in a recent update. The option no longer appears in the drive format dialog, nor does it appear in the diskpart utility. Any mention of exFAT has been expunged from the official diskpart documentation making me believe that Microsoft has officially terminated support for it, even so I cannot find any official announcements or confirmations of that. A very odd and stupid move IMO.
It basically means format the "X" Drive with exFAT Filesystem. Change the X to whatever drive letter the internal hard drive has at the moment.
