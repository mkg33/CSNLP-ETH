For services in init.d you cannot use /etc/security/limits.d inittab is not reading that files and it is based on pam.d which is not used in initialization startup scripts. All init startup scripts source /etc/init.d/functions so for all services you could hack that script and set limits there. I used to hack /etc/sysconfig for particular services when I needed {httpd, some brokenass oracle stuf} e.t.c.
I've found answer to my problem there. In my case the limit was not set due to an error causing the default value (1024) to be used.
Had to add both 'hard' and 'soft' entries in /etc/security/limits.conf for pam to recognize settings for rtprio (-r) and memlock (-l).
And make sure uncomment pam_limits.so from the different files under /etc/pam.d, e.g. sudo, login, sshd, ... after following above steps which you have already did.
If you want to set it permanently, especially for a particular user, change the file /etc/security/limits.conf to have the following lines (assume user = www-data)
