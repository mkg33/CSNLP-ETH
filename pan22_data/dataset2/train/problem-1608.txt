In the game i am creating as an hobby (learning is the primal goal of it all) i plan to implement a space ship that the player can enter and use to explore it. I tried to search the internet for the concept of vehicle implementation but i couldnt find anything worth mentioning, and before I start writing the code I really want a clear idea of what I strive for. So id like to ask the pro game developers how should I look at a vehicle, should I think of it as a player's body extention with different mechanics? or should I just think of it as a usable exterior object? What kind of link should be between the player and the drivable vehicle? How do games usually do it, like GTA 2 and that kind of games?
P.S. I dont think its important to mention but the game is 2D and top-down perspective, so i guess GTA 2 can be a close reference to what i wanna do, although the gameplay is very different, but ye, the vehicle implementation i want is similar to GTA 2 although i only plan to do a space ship for now.
