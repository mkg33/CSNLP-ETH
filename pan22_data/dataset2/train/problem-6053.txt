Is the cnn mandatory? Any more info, regarding the domain of the application or the nature of the problem that you could share?
First off do the information come in different forms? Meaning, different fonts, different kind of documents for the same information etc?
In Bag1, the presence of A, B, or C alone may not be enough to Pass, but together they do. In Bag3, F itself might be enough to pass.
I have a binary classification problem where I have a bag of documents (image files) that I need to classify - the bag that is, not the individual document. However, a bag can have a different number of documents and the combination of documents will determine the classification. E.g.
Finally there's a paper on a different domain, though an approach similar to theirs could be followed. They present a Bag-of-Visual Words (BOV) method for object-based classification in land-use/cover mapping.  
As I understand there is some information that needs to be present in order for the example to "pass". 
I have already done OCR to represent all the text at the Bag level. For the images, all I can think is to average the pixel values of each image in the Bag to represent it as a single image, and then train with a CNN.
