Then, you just have to import the values for that cell from a list or array of tile types that has a format similar to the following (in this case, water is the first row):
I think your question is not very clear and actually brings many mini-questions in one (what you should avoid doing in this website).
Now that's an entirely opinion-based question. Specially because we know nothing about your game. So, it's utterly impossible to give you clues on that. However, what I can do is tell that it's fairly and equally easy to assign properties to tiles in either case.
If B1 is randomly determined to be a "rocky" type, again you identify which row in the above list/array corresponds to "rocky" and imports that row into the new tile.
Choosing if you are going to use pre-generated maps or randomly generated maps is a game-feature decision. It's a higher-level game design decision that you should make beforehand mostly on the basis of what you want your game to be like and offer to players.
So, no, your choice between pre-generated and randomly generated maps shouldn't have anything to do with assigning properties to each tile.
Yes, it certainly is. Once you generate the map, for each tile you can just pull a bunch of information related to the tile type in question. For example, suppose you generate a 10x10 map, where the rows are identified by letters and columns by numbers. So, when you randomly define cell A1, it ends up being "water".
