Raw? No third party? Learn C++ and you can write a simple defragger that consolidates the partition, which then allows you to shrink the partition. You can download Visual Studios Express as a Dev environment.
If you don't want to spend money on third party tools, the resize you want to do can be done with GParted and you can download the GParted LiveCD for free.
