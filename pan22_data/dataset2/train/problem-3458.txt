The binary file is spelled with all-caps.  In my system, the MATLAB executable is installed in /usr/local/matlab/r2009b/bin/glnxa64/MATLAB (which is a slightly weird place).  The matlab root would then be /usr/local/matlab/r2009b
If you're not sure how the package is called, you may use something like rpm -qa | grep -i matlab to find its name
According to the official answer of MathWorks (See Where is MATLAB installed on my machine?) it is located in - \usr\local\MATLAB\Rxxxxx where xxxxx stands for the version. For instance R2019a for the version released in March 2019.
YAST in opensuse has a files tab, which shows all the files and location they get installed to. I can't speak for other distros.
where matlab -e will output a lot of information to run MATLAB. So we need to pipe them to sed -n 's/MATLAB=//p' to only select the MATLAB root. I use this in my Makefile document to find the path to mex compiler without start MATLAB. It is very quick command. Here is what I used in my Makefile document just for convenience:
