Basically it is freezing whenever updates run and sometimes when they don't. System recovery doesn't seem to be helping and I'm hoping to go nuclear and just reinstall windows.
Can you keep pressing F8 while the laptop is booting. Sometimes Toshiba modifies the boot options screen to add a "repair" option or similar, which then boots from the recovery partition.
I'm having problems with a Toshiba Satellite L745 which came preinstalled  with Windows 7 (According to the product key label on the bottom Home Premium QA).
But there's no disk because windows came preinstalled. I've also read online that a lot of times preinstalled windows will have a recovery partition that you can access by holding down Alt+F10 but this doesn't seem to be working.  What is my next step?
just after the computer is turned on start tapping the f8 key. After the toshiba splash screen goes away you will get the window asking if you want to repair windows. select that and there will be options for toshiba recovery or whatnot, if it is available.
