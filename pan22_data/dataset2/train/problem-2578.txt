I think you are going about it wrong.  Instead of trying RAID recovery utilities (assuming you haven't already destroyed the data by doing so) get a partition manager;  that will automatically tell you what filesystem is on the disk and, if it's readable, will let you "explore" the disk to see the files, even though it won't be able to recover them.
Promis does not use their own disk format;  they make controllers.  So the file system on the disk is going to be readable, -unless- it is a striped RAID that is missing half the set.  Since it is one disk, this would be very doubtful as that would completely defeat the whole purpose of RAID.
Something is very wrong with the NAS if getting files off it is slow even by USB connection.  Possibly the disk is failing, though you say you can still see the files on it.
It would be helpful to know the exact model of the Promis box, and whether there were really two disks but you just removed one (as your comments would suggest.)  RAID0 (1) would suggest that what you have is disk 1 of the two drives required for RAID0;  the best way to recover the data is to put the disk back into the enclosure and pair it back up with the other disk so that the RAID volume is intact, then plug it in via USB.  You cannot do this with only have the disks of the set, however.
