Neither can record from write errors unless the RAID vendor is doing some sort of checksum process.  RAID is to prevent against disk failure.  In RAID 5 when a disk is replaced the parity information is used to rebuild the missing data.  In a RAID 10 when a disk is replaced the data is copied from the partner disk.
As to if RAID 10 can support more disk failures, it can depending on which disk fails second.  RAID 10 is basically a bunch of RAID 1 array's striped together.  If the second disk that fails is the partner of the first one which failed (which is possible if the first disk failed because of a hotspot of data) then you'll loose all the data when the second disk fails because the stripe is now broken.  Where with RAID 5 is any disk fails as the second disk you've lost the array.
Where they do differ is handling write errors reported by the device. R5 reponds in a vendor specific way; it could re commit the most recent write with parity compute. With R1 the mirror pair that did not return a write error can be assumed to be correct, and that one block copied from the good member to the bad member.
I believe the case you are worried about is the one where there is a failed write that the drive does not report. This is a critical failure of a drive, so manufacturers strive to make sure it never happens. The storage stack is built on the assumption that the terminal storage device will report both read and write errors. 
I have seen some specialist systems perform a read immediately after a write to ensure the data really was comitted, but not in the last 10 years.
