Would it be feasible to place OST files on a network share? Maybe the solution exists for some other client+server pair?
As Evan says, disabling OST files/cached mode is guaranteed to place more load on your server/s, it's not something you should do lightly.
Even in 'non-caching' mode Outlook creates an OST file where it downloads everything from the Exchange server. OWA does not create any local files (except cookies I believe) but lacks some of the nice features Outlook has.
Perhaps if you describe your reasons for wanting to do this, the community might have further advice.
I'm guessing that a small ost file is being created, on the order of 265KB. This ost file is created as a result of the Offline Folder settings on the advanced tab of the Outlook profile properties. This is normal. This is not cached mode. These are Offline Folders. This is not a copy of the mailbox. The ost file you're seeing is for the Offline synchronization of mailbox folders configured for Offline synchronization in your Send\Recieve groups. If you don't want any ost file created then disable Offline Folders by selecting that option in the Offline Folders settings (again, on the Advanced tab of the Outlook profile properties. While Offline Folders and cached mode are very similar, they are not the same thing. Cached mode keeps a complete copy of your mailbox in the ost file while Offline folders keeps a copy of only those folders configured for offline synchronization.
I am looking for a solution which would allow to use a convenience of Outlook as a mail client app while at the same time have no PST or OST files on a local computer.
