This works well for having lots of space, but because the computer thinks it is driving a single external display when opening pdfs with Preview they default to stretching across the entire available 3840 display. I use additional window management software to control for this. 
I am using a Matrox TripleHead2Go Digital SE to connect my Macbook 12" 2016 to dual 1080p Dell Monitors (DVI). 
One display is connected via HDMI to Apple USB-C Multiport adapter, and one is connected to Apple TV 2nd gen.
I've got a 12.9 inch iPad Pro which I connect via the Duet application when my 2015 MacBook is also connected to my monitor. It provides an adequate second display. 
I am currently using Macbook 12 Retina with two external displays (+ one internal) with the help of Apple TV.
Drawback: sometimes Airplay is switching off, and there is some delays on Apple TV monitor (like mouse pointer slightly slow). But overall it works.

This gives me the built-in display, plus a "virtual" 3840x1080 display through the dual Dells. Theoretically I could add a third 1080p monitor to achieve a 5760x1080 display. 
I mostly use Safari for browsing so this setup works well for me. Chrome is unusable but Minecraft works well (again as of El Capitan).
I am running a dual external monitor setup on my 2015 MacBook with the help of a USB 3 to HDMI adapter for the second monitor. My USB adapter (j5 create) used to be pretty slow but is an order of magnitude faster in El Capitan.
