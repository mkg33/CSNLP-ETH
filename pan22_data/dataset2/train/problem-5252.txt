PS!!! You don't need to waste money on a SSD! just reinstall windows and shortstroke the hard drive, or figure out the service or driver causing the problem, and avoid installing any crapware that runs at boot, and manualy install drivers, especially the graphics driver!
BTW my specs are HP EliteBook 8760w, 8-core :)  Intel 2nd gen Core-i7 2.9 GHZ, NVIDIA Quadro 5010M GPU 4GB Graphics RAM, WD Scorpio black HDD 7.2K rpm
This may sound a bit nuts but I one day disabled a whole lot of services (superfetch, windows search, and a lot of other ones I perceived as pointless) to keep my speedy hot-rodded and overclocked HP EliteBook 8760w running at top speed, but then one day logging in was awful slow. I do have a 7200rpm hdd that was nice and speedy ( ~ 120 MB\s) when I first installed and I defrag a lot. so I looked in services.msc and found the Microsoft keyboard filter service. I re enabled it and now login is almost instant again! also make sure that credential manager service startup type is set to AUTOMATIC, not manual!
