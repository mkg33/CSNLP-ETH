Running IPv6 networks can be so easy once people start to use the enormous amount of address space that it provides. No more planning, requesting extra addresses etc. Just:
There are still plenty of people running IPv6 networks with an IPv4 mentality though, and they try to give as little as possible to their customers, thinking "A /64 contains so many addresses, it will be more than enough for then". And then you run into problems when you want multiple subnets... Network operators and service providers will have to change their mindset and always give bigger blocks (big ones like /56 or /48, you don't want to ask them for each and every extra subnet) to customers that want to use them.
Getting a bigger block of addresses from your provider is the correct solution. It is very normal with IPv6 to give a customer a /56 or a /48, which corresponds to 256 or 65536 subnets. That is the great thing about IPv6: always plenty of addresses! :-)
All of this makes your planning and operations much simpler, once you get used to the big numbers that are suddenly available :)
