Also, don't use the name .local. It's reserved for multicast DNS, as per RFC 6762 section 3. You may think that you're not using mDNS, but if there are devices running Android, iOS, Linux or OSX on your network, you are, you just don't know it. Pick another name, even if your DNS tree is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
From you question, it sounds that rather than a tree you're trying to set up a number (two, in this case) of isolated islands with lines of communication between them that you define from outside DNS (that is, in the BIND configuration). It may be possible to do that, but it's sure is going to be a lot harder and a lot more work than setting up a private tree. Also there will be no documentation relating to your solution, and every time you want help you'll have to explain everything you've done from scratch.
The DNS server located in net1.local does not know anything about net2.local hosts, and the DNS server located in the bigger network only knows the top domain names as it contains these records:
Let's say I have two independent networks net1.local and net2.local each of which is connected to a bigger network local through a router.
DNS is designed to be a tree, where everything can be found by starting at the top and following pointers down. It's perfectly possible to set up such a tree of your own on your isolated network. If you set things up this way, everything will work normally, documentation will make sense and you will have the least amount of unpleasant surprises.
