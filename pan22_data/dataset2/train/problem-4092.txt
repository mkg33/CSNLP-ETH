Without a bit more information it's hard to be more specific - post the output of ipconfig /all when connected via VPN and when connected to the LAN for a start. 
In the settings for this connections, go to tcp/ip properties and advanced properties and select DNS. In the connection specific DNS suffix for this connection add the domain (the domain suffix). 
If you mean the hostname (e.g. the MyPC part of MyPC.somedomain.com) does not resolve across your VPN even though it does when you are in your office then the issue is that your VPN is either not appending the domain suffix that you need or possibly that your VPN is not redirecting DNS. 
NetBIOS is a different thing to DNS. NetBIOS name resolution uses either broadcasts (limited to a single subnet on an ip network typically), WINS (wider scope, requires a WINS server to be identified generally provided via DHCP), or an LMHOSTS file. If NetBIOS name resolution is failing across a VPN connection but working within your LAN environment and that LAN uses WINS then you should look at the DHCP scope options being provided by your VPN client (these may be configured at the client end or provided dynamically by the VPN gateway).
It was dns hijacking at the ISP. The client's physical adapter was using Level 3 DNS servers. Level 3 redirects unknown records to a landing page, instead of returning no such name.
