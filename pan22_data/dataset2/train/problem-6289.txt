Since it’s quite annoying to get the invalid certificate warning every time I connect to my switch, I want to install a custom HTTPS certificate signed by a Certificate Authority my machines trust. But I can’t figure out Netgear’s ridiculous certificate configuration UI. It only gives the option to upload the following:
I’m going to assume existing knowledge of how to create a root CA, intermediate CA, and create and sign certificates (if not, see e.g. OpenSSL Certificate Authority). We’ll need the following:
There’s no option to upload a key, or to generate a CSR on the switch (like any sane security system would). The Netgear forums indicate there’s some magic combination of how to do this, but most posts are either incomplete or don’t advise how to get a CA-signed cert to work (only a lone, self-signed key). The official manual is even less helpful, saying nothing more than “[ensure] the file is in the correct format”.
First, this should work on any Netgear firmware with a similar UI, but for reference, this is a GS724Tv4 with firmware 6.3.0.9.
