I went through all my files and changed the encoding from western european to UTF8. This was fine until I noticed that SOME files revert back to western european encoding when re-opened. 
I'm using Dreamweaver CS3, and when I built an application I forgot to ensure that the encoding was set to UTF8. 
This tricks Dreamweaver into working properly: setting a default Encoding charset.  The preferences pane does not work at all.
i think if you want to remove whe BOM from utf-8 files on dreamweaver (creating files) you should do this:
No matter how many times I change the encoding back ( using ctrl+j and choosing the dropdown in page properties ) and save the files, it STILL reverts back to western when opened.
This only seems to happen on certain files, and some are fine. I've tried creating a new file in UTF8 and copying the contents of the old one into it. The problem persists so I'm thinking that the file may contain odd characters that are causing Dreamweaver to 'intelligently' change the encoding.
I add this line as the second line of all of my CodeIgniter file shards... since there is no header tag in most of the files.
If you want any file to open as UTF-8 when you open it, just add this line as the second or first line of your document:
