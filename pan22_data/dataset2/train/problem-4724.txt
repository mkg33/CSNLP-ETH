View->Choose details has a "Space Free" setting, but that shows nothing unless you're viewing My Computer. 
This is really driving me nuts.  I do a lot of moving media files to and from USB drives, and I am constantly looking to the status bar to see how much remaining space I have on a drive.  It's quick, and doesn't involve any clicking.  At least, that's what I used to do using Windows XP.  Is there a way to get the status bar in Windows 7 to behave in the same way?  
While "the size of any selected item" is not show in the status bar.  An interested user like yourself can choose to show the details pane (Organize -> Layout -> Details Pane), wich does in-fact show the size of any selected item(s), along with other details, including the item count.  It's no longer in the status bar, but it is availiable in the details pane.  
I saw in a Wikipedia article that some features have been removed from Windows 7, including these two that seem to be affecting me the most:
Are there any plug-ins or registry tweaks that can be made to return this functionality?  If not what is the quickest way to get the remaining space on a drive without having to click on something and leaving the directory you are working in?
While this is true, once you select any number of files, the total size of those files will be shown in the details page.  I can see how for the average user the it may be ambiguous whether that folder "size" includes the sub-folder sizes, perhaps this is the reason why this isn't displayed for the "folder" anymore, only actual files that are selected.
