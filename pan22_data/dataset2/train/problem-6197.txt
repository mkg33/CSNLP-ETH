Now, at some point, the engineering does come into play. Newer designs maybe completely incompatible with previous sockets which it's understandable. But I often feel like Intel has little to no regard for upgrade paths for users. Maybe I'm an AMD fan boy, but years ago, Intel was worth buying (IMO). I've owned Pentium IIs, IIIs, even Pros and even the first Xeons they made back in the early 2000s. After a while, I got fed up with their upgrade paths for their newer CPUs which always seemed to ditch the previous socket or chipset and I couldn't see any real benefits after a while. 
Most people mention good points. Heat can be an issue. Price is definitely a big factor. One factor people tend to forget is socket compatibility. AM2,AM2+ and AM3 sockets have been around for a relatively long period of time. At the very least, some AMD motherboards have a large degree of compatibility for CPUs. I can't recall how many different frickin' sockets there are for Intel CPUs (wikipedia). It's getting completely ridiculous as to just how many sockets there are for Intel CPUs.
Intel definitely has interesting technology and performance (usually) on their side, but at the price of not only the CPU, but the motherboard (socket and chipset/northbridge) and at times RAM. AMD has been fairly cognizant of upgrade paths for CPUs/sockets and motherboards and it's clear AMD positions themselves as a value brand which I believe is a very critical strategy in these economic times.
