As mentioned in a previous answer by @user2002402, holding shift and clicking the application icon on your task bar will attempt to launch another instance. This will work with most applications. This is especially useful for Remote Desktop Client and Putty; where the instance is usually a session, and new instances are difficult to otherwise launch from within those applications. It is also available in Windows 8/8.1/10 and corresponding Server products.
Also, if you organize the taskbar, you can use WinKey + number 0-9 to activate that position (1 closest to the start-menu and 0 being 10). 
As a general answer of how to open a new copy/window of any program in the taskbar that is already open, right-clicking the icon and clicking the name of the program works. 
This isn't a direct answer, but my force-of-habit is to open the first Computer window, then navigate to the desktop folder, then open another Computer window, switch back to the first window and navigate back to the Computer view via the tree-view.
On another note, for some apps that does not allow more than one window by default ... have you tried launching the app from the command line for instance using mpiexec -n 2 the_app_I_want_more_of? Trick works for me, ymmv depending on app.
You then combine this with the shift-key to get a new instance of the app of your choosing or leave out the shift to just get focus to that app.
Once the new Explorer instance has started, you can of course navigate to Computer if not already there. Of course, this doesn't answer your real question about preventing the default behaviour, which @Jonno's answer addresses.
Just hit CtrlN on the existing Computer window to open another one. You can also click with the middle mouse button MMB to open a new Explorer window to its default location.
