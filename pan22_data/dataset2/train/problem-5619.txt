This should help you, even though it is written for Windows Vista. Windows Vista 64-bit - Is it worth the upgrade? This explains the following: benefits & limitations introduced by 64-bit, what to consider when installing the 64-bit version, benchmark results and user experience changes. All things here do apply to Windows 7 as well. I've been using the RC version of 7 for a few months and i confirm that's the case.
Yes.  When operating systems move to 64-bit only (Windows 8?) you will have an easier time upgrading than if you have a 32-bit operating system.
Some manufacturers are yet to commit to creating 64 bit drivers as well. As I see it, this is a bit of commercial suicide as it is photographers with fancy DSLRs that make the most out of having large amounts of RAM available...
For most purposes you won't notice a difference.  Everything should run just fine.  Almost all recent hardware has 64-bit drivers.
I've been running x64 Vista since February, and the only hardware that I've found not to have drivers are digital SLR cameras. There are workarounds for getting the files off (memory card reader, or putting the camera in PTP mode), but you won't be able to do anything like tethered shooting.
The main advantage is of course more physical memory for the computer. The disadvantage is that applications tend to use slightly more memory due to the implementation of 64-bit architecture. Most people going 64-bit usually upgrade the amount of memory anyways so this isn't that big of a problem. If you don't multitask that much it shouldn't affect you either way. The majority of your 32-bit applications should work fine.
Yes absolutely. I haven't encountered any hardware or program issues. All of your 32-bit applications should work fine. Mine have. Windows 7 has got to have the best hardware support Windows has ever had
