Changing to landscape didn't work either. As soon as you put it back to portrait, it all goes wrong again. This is obviously a bug.
If the problem is the width of the table and it is too big, right click on the small box to the upper left of the table. Click on "Auto Fit" and choose "Auto fit to window"
The only way it can be done is to recreate the table from scratch on your Mac version of Word otherwise it simply will not work. Forget 'table properties' and 'smart formatting'. It doesn't work. If your table isn't complicated, do it again otherwise get the person that sent you it to send it again in Excel. I have scoured the internet to no avail. That is the only way I've been able to get through this document I'm working on now.
If the problem is the width of the table, try copying the table.  If it is too big, right click on the small box to the upper left of the table.  Click on "table properties" and then set the preferred width to match the width of the page in the file that you are copying the file into.
So what I did to resolve the situation is that I temporarily made the second Word document (the document in which the table was being pasted) a landscape document.
