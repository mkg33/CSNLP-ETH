As a minimum, I'd suggest that you format each 'JOIN ON' clause  with "co.group_name = new.group_name"
This may also be because of your full outer join which I'm not sure you need. I'm pretty sure Full Join will provide a line for every group which is encountered in each query and merge the results, however it's your work.
Notice two rows for Group 8214. Each group should be represented once and the desired result for Group 8214 should be:
I have 4 subqueries and each of the subquery is grouped by 'Group name'. The attempt is to have each subquery as a column all grouped by the 'Group Name'. Here is the query:

What am I doing wrong? I think it has to do with the coalesce function. I tried other methods including
This is just a shot in the dark based on the code you have posted, but I noticed your joins are inconsistent.
