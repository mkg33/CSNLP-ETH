Note: I don't have problems in technical terms of writing such proxy html page with frame with it, I am simply looking for a way to ensure/deny it is done this way for real.
However, it might be possible and even likely that your provider doesn't offer this functionality and he refers to the method you mentioned. 
Previously I bought a domain at different provider, and I simply made 2 clicks to achieve this. Now I have different provider and he explains that even if such option is done by just clicking in reality there is small page created at original address (foobar.com) with frame pointing out to target site (helloworld.blog.com).
No, this is, in general, not true. What you can do is to configure a web server as a reverse proxy, which will display a web site from a remote server like it was coming from the proxy server, without the need for some framing tricks. 
When user would like to go to sub-pages address will change, because entire site (WordPress) uses hardcoded absolute URLs. Pity, but that's OK.
I just bought domain name (let's say foobar.com) and I would like to redirect it to helloworld.blog.com in such way, that if somebody enters foobar.com in browser, the content from helloworld.blog.com is shown but the address is not changed  (foobar.com should remain).
Is this true? I mean does redirecting URL (with URL kept) is done this way? I don't want to be accussed of traffic abuse or something like this (and besides it smells bad for me).
