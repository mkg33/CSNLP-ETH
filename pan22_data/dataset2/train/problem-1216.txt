And now he indicates he wants to also install ADFS on the same box as well. I am not even sure if ADFS and AD can be on the same server, but if it can be I also wonder if it is a good idea or not.
Yes its a supported configuration to have AD and ADFS on the same box so no problems there. But as the general preference is to have AD roles on dedicated servers, its not an encouraged configuration. 
When you upgrade the AD in the future, you'd have to do in place upgrades of this server instead of demote/promote new DCs. 
I'm fairly certain you will need to specify LDAP ports other than default in this scenario.  Otherwise, it should function fine.
If you are also planning this server to be internet accessible, then its also not a good configuration from a security perspective unless you plan to have ADFS proxies too.
It should be fine to install on your Domain controllers.  As long as sane lookup caches (for DNS) and leases (for DHCP) are had, and you have a proper amount of DCs for your environment (the answer is never "one DC"), ADFS should not present a huge amount of load.
So if this is a very small environment where they have no other servers or means of even using virtualization to host roles on different OS guests, then yes you can do it.
