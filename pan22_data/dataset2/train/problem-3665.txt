I wouldn't go down this path unless I knew exactly what files & settings would need to be restored - there's a reason the real backup apps can comand the prices they do...
Unless you are restoring the whole system an image-based backup isn't particularly helpful. In my experience if you try to cherry pick components from the image you're likely to do more harm than good.
I can think of a couple different approaches.  1) Copy the backed up data into the produciton installation and cross my fingers.  2) Restore the entire machine image to a virtual machine, run an application level backup, then copy the backup to the real machine and perform an application level restore.
When using an image-based backup solution like ShadowProtect, Replay, TrueImage, etc, how would one go about restoring an application like, say, Sharepoint?
The answer will vary on an app-by-app basis.  With Sharepoint, for example, you've got to be prepared to restore databases, content repositories, registry settings, IIS virtual directories... and probably a few other locations.
