also, you could check the registry folder for the RunOnce to see if on shutting down if anything is being added to this.
If it's after you login, I'd guess a profile issue. Create a new user and profile and try with that.
Does Caps Lock work (in terms of changing the caps indicator) when it's hung? If not, that would suggest it's completely borked by that point rather than just a process taking forever to get properly started.
I've seen this when there were mounted drives to a network that doesn't exist anymore or isn't available.  Disconnecting the drives fixed the problem.  But beside that I would guess it's a network config issue (trying to authenticate to a domain that doesn't exist maybe because of DNS issues, etc).
I have been given two Eee PC 100HA to manage for some people, they are both running the same hardware and XP home but one is having some strange problems with logging on. 
The main problem is that it hangs at the login screen for ages and sometimes never gets to the desktop.  The strange thing is it only seems to do it after the computer has been cold  started, but it won't do it if the computer has been restarted. 
One other option is to run MSConfig (start -> run -> msconfig) and deselect all un-necessary services / startup programs and then re-enable them.
If that works, does Ctrl-Shift-Esc bring up task manager? That could be useful to show any processes taking a long time, if the logger isn't helping you.
I have made two logs of the start up with process monitor but every time the logger is attached the computer will log in fine.  I have also set the computer to blue screen and create a crash dump when you press ctrl scroll twice but when I do it at the hung login it just sits at a black screen and I don't get a crash dump, I have turned off the auto  system restart on failure option also.
finally does this happen if you create a brand new user and log in as them? If so then it could be a corrupt profile or other antagonist.
