If it was something written in C# then you have all the handy source control, automated tests stuff. Unfortunately, using SQL to perform external processes is possible, but painful. Sometimes you just need to chuck it in and write some middleware (in the middle of SQL and the external tools) to do the job for you.
So the simplest change you can make would be to use the SQL Agent instead of Windows Scheduler. Just make a single scheduled job that calls each of your steps in sequence (SQL scripts, command line scripts, etc). You can define the sequence of steps, and even branch to an error step if the prior one failed.
But beyond that, I think you should seriously investigate SSIS. You can create an SSIS "package", and run it from the SQL Agent either via a schedule or on-demand.
You could create a script outside SQL Server (Powershell, VBScript, console app) which does away with your text files. The script would read input data from SQL, call the external utility and write the result directly back to the database.
For example, I wrote a VBScript that extracts a list of all tables from the DB then searches through .dtsx files to find them, then writes the result directly back to the database.
You may also be able to use SSIS and SQL Agent to simplify your process. SSIS is good for defining orchestration and data transfer in a visual way, though for more complex external things you often need to resort to C# script tasks. SQL Agent can be used to run SQL and command lines in order with basic workflow etc.
