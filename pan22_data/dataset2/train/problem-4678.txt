So, as the title suggests I'd be looking for a convenient way of protecting my data while achieving plausible deniability. I've read the archwiki on the subject. I'd rather not encrypt the whole root system if I can avoid to do so, BUT I'd need to encrypt /var .
dm-crypt offers two options for plausible deniability: plain mode and detached LUKS header, but both are very unconvenient since they require long and difficult to remember cryptopen command typing. I also don't like the idea of storing a LUKS header in an non-encrypted usb drive, since if that is revealed then the whole purpose is defeated.
Result should be:  encrypted /var and /home + plausible deniability + quick&easy mount at boot time .
For Windows, it also exists a veracrypt bootloader that can be used to boot a fully encrypted system. In my case, I don't necessarily want to encrypt the whole system, but I want to encrypt /var, then I still need some way to mount the encrypted /var when it is needed at boot time.
To your knowledge, might there be some (convenient / quick) way in Linux to run veracrypt at boot time in order to mount /var before it is needed?
VeraCrypt (TrueCrypt's successor) on the other hand is very convenient since it can be used to create a hidden encrypted partition inside an outer encrypted volume (which acts as a decoy). One could write a veracrypt mount script, which once launched only asks for a password, and two different passwords can be used to mount two different partitions (either the decoy or the hidden one).
