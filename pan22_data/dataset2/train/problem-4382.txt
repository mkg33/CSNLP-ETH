That is true. Many manufacturers use low grade components especially capacitors, power ics, resistor. They will rarely last a year, giving rise to vague problems, like hanging, operating system not loading, restarting, blue screen of death, etc. Stick to top brands using high grade capacitors and components only. 
The point of that anecdote is to point out that a piece of cheap hardware can be worse quality, but it does not have to be. And that mouth to mouth experience in this case is often wrong.
I have heard in different occasions that some motherboard brands (such as PC Chips and ASRock) are cheap, in both senses: less expensive and of lower quality, because the manufacturers use components that don't reach certain standars and/or have been discarded from assembly lines with higher standars (like ASrock that would be a cheap line from Asus).
However things get quite muddled at the cheaper end. E.g. consider the Cyrix 200+ CPU. Sold very cheap compared to the pentium-1. Often found in desktops with the cheapest possible power supplies, the cheapest possible motherboards, the cheapest possible graphics cards... and often in an unstable system.
There are lines which produce very cheap motherboards. I suspect (-with no hard evidence to back that up!-) that most use cheaper components.
Having said that: Your motherboard is the backplane of all other components. Both on add-in cards or integrated. Getting a good motherboard is worth it. So do read reviews of which board you are considering, but do so with a critical eye.
Unsurprisingly it had a very bad name, yet one ran without problems for years in an old Asus boards with good hardware.
