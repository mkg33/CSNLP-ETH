Just to finish this up... I've come to the conclusion that the only option is to mod the packages.  To keep the mods as lightweight as possible we'll create a simple view on each table with a Grade column, replacing the % with letter, so the only mods should be changing table names to view names.
Is there any way to redirect queries to different tables / views based on the package that's referencing the table?  I.e. packages A and B both have "select grade from schema1.grd_tbl", but I want package A to get the percent grade that's stored in the table, and package B to get a letter grade that's calculated from the percent.  I'd like to avoid modifying the (dozens of) packages that reference the table.  I'd rather 'spoof' the table somehow if we can, replacing the percent in the grade column with a letter when called from those packages. (The column's varchar2; percents are coded as characters.)
First thought was to create a synonym pointing to a view that massages the column based on the calling package, but the code fully qualifies the table name in most cases so that doesn't seem doable. I went looking for something equivalent to a trigger on select; the closest I've found is fine-grained audit, and it's not row-based.
