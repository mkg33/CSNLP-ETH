ItÂ´s not easy to group non-contiguous NTFS partitions but you have tools to do it for you: Partition Wizard 
You can also make a RAID setup, but unfortunately, that should be done before installing your OS. It has a lot of disadvantages for you, since you only need more free space.
If I were to take a guess, I'd say it looks like you're running out of space on your C drive and are trying to solve that problem. Since what you're asking isn't really possible, you have two options:
You're looking at three separate physical disks in that picture. The total space available on disk 1 is 111GB, that's all you get. You could certainly shrink that C drive partition to get room for an other partition, but you can't physically add a chunk of one hard drive to another. If you used Disk Manager to shrink the partition, your existing partitions on disk 1 plus the un-allocated space can still only equal 111GB.
I suggest you use symlinks or junction directories for your program files directory or downloads or any other folder that's taking a lot of space.
You cannot do this unless you use something like a virtual machine where you can build out a virtual disk drive. Some VM software will let you "combine" physical hard disks into a "virtual disk" that the virtual machine would recognize as a single physical device. I believe VMWare has a software solution for this, if you need something specific to look at.
You can't. You're trying to merge partitions across two physical drives. This is impossible. You can move your operating system (if you're very careful and make backups) using special utilities.
For example, I have a VERY big iTunes library. It takes 120 Gb aproximately. Since my SSD has only 120 GB total to store OS and apps, I made a junction in the iTunes library directory pointing to my D: drive, which has 2TB available. iTunes does not even realize it's writing into another drive, which is the point of using junctions.
