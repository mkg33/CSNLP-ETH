I sent a Windows 7 Pro x64 system to a colleague that I thought was completely configured but it turns out it wasn't yet activated. When he booted the first time it came up with a registration screen that he just hit "cancel" on and then sent me an email asking about it.
If you do it with a valid product key, it will activate and will not show registration. Except when it expires. Maybe that is why this is recurring. 
Usually windows prompts for activation/validation of key every 72 hours post initial login. After 30 days your windows OS session will become inaccessible if you haven't validated it. 
My question is, how often should I expect that registration/activation window to popup on boot? Every time, or in several days? I'm trying to figure out how to schedule fixing his issue.
Scheduling this to deal with when it happens and just waiting for it is not the best approach. I don't know how limited the system is, but have you setup a way to remote assist the pc? Like using teamviewer, logmein, etc?
The product key is on the box but I expect I may need to walk him through the process of typing it the code and submitting. As a further complication, the system has been configured with explorer.exe disabled and only limited functionality available with the keyboard-----so I need that registration window to popup in order to talk him through registration.
You'll want to take control of the pc and login with a user who has administrative privileges, so you can enter the key yourself.
