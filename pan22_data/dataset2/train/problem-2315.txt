Without having more details about your network it's difficult to give any more advice, but try to eliminate possible culprits, hope this helps.
Also double check any firewall/filter rules on both devices to make sure nothing is blocking that traffic.
You mentioned that The ATT pace device is running in pass through, but was disabled by an updated. The first thing I would do is double check that it is running in pass through mode since it doesn't make sense to run two routers like that. 
When you setup port forwarding you are specifying where a connection is forwarded to from the Internet, so in this case you want to forward port 3391 to the PC's IP address, you may want to setup a static IP address for that PC if you haven't done so. You said that you "forwarded the ipv4 of the pc to port 3391" which doesn't make sense, you should be forwarding port 3391 to the IP address of the pc so that traffic from the Internet going to port 3391 is forwarded to the PC.
If the port forwarding setup isn't the issue you could try putting the ATT pace device in "router" mode and removing the WRT 32x router from the setup. You could then setup port forwarding on the ATT pace device and see if that setup works. This would at least eliminate one thing and help troubleshoot.
I'm not familiar with the ATT pace router, but I'm assuming that is the modem in your case. Your network should look like this:
