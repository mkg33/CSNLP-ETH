What I have been doing is to use `lsblk', i.e. (replace /dev/sr0 with the device file of your DVD device):
       An application for reading the contents of a DVD and printing the contents to your terminal and dump for further processing in external applications.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  LSDVD(1)

If you wish to, you can process the label to make it nicer (like making it lowercase, changing underscores to dashes):
So what this does is it filter libdvdnavs logoutput. Probably not a stable solution, because the log output of lbdvdnav is probably not to be considred a stable api. However it works for.
