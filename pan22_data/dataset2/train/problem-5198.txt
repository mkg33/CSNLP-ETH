I don't know what the graphical Mac program is for this, but see if your Mac supports the renice command: Open a terminal and type man renice to read up about how it works on a Mac.
This really depends upon how slow of a machine that you want to emulate. If you roll XP back to 128 MB of RAM, it will be painfully slow, to the point where I'm not sure if the virtual processor speed will really be relevant. You could also run your VM files off of an old USB1 external hard drive (see if you can find a 4200 RPM drive). That should slow things down.
Install a little utility in the guest XP VM to control the CPU frequency using XP's built-in dynamic frequency switching. For example, a utility like SpeedswitchXP. I have never tried something like this myself, and there may be problems potentially if the virtual CPU that VMWare presents to the guest VM does not support dynamic frequency switching.
I would entertain the idea of using an infinite loop thread with a tunable sleep command and set the process priority.  If you want me to slap together a quick chunk of C code let me know.
It's really not possible to reliably match the performance of an older machine. Even if you manage to throttle the CPU usage and the memory size, how will you throttle the FSB speed or memory speed?
Having said that, you can use the process management tool of a Mac to limit the CPU usage of VMWare Fusion itself. If you do this well enough to emulate an older machine, then the whole VMWare application will probably run really slowly--just like a vintage XP-ready machine.
By the way, XP-ready machines are probably dirt cheap right now. A real one could probably be had for ~$75. Then, you could transfer your virtual machine to a real one...
