I want to build a classifier based on MLP like in classification of MNIST using MLP for CIFAR-10 data set.Like in MNIST data set the 28*28 images to a 784 vector is given as a input to the neural network.
However, this will load the train and test dataset in the shape (num_samples, 3, 32, 32). In order to input these into an MLP, we need to flatten the channels and pixel arrays to form an array of shape (num_samples, 3072), just like with MNIST. We can do this in python like so:
I am a noob in machine learning and trying to build a classifier using keras by following this tutorial machine learning mastery tutorial 
Like wise how should I frame the data in CIFAR-10 should it be changed in the 36*36 pixels rgb values to an array? or what type of array should I make to give as a input to the MLP network?
CIFAR10 contains colour images that are 32x32 pixels. At first glance it may seem like there are only $32\times32 = 1024$ features per image, but there are red, blue and green channels in the image, which means each image is actually $3\times32\times32 = 3072$ features. 
Usually, these channels are arranged as three separate 32x32 pixel images, rather than a single 32x32 image with RGB pixels. In keras, you can load the CIFAR10 dataset like so:
