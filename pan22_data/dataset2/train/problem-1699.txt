Both approaches will work and are actively documented and supported.  FP starts to really have a significant advantage if you have more than the 4 switches in your design and, particularly, if you ever wanted to add more sites (3 sites would push you back to STP).  FP has the advantage of less configuration and the ability to do some interesting things with anycast HSRP (again - more significant if you wanted to run more than two switches in a site) and somewhat greater flexibility.  The downside is that it's not only Cisco proprietary but is limited to a smaller subset of older (and more expensive) switches - specifically 7K with F-series or M3 blades and 5500/5600.  
BUT Fabricpath brings vPC+ with it, and I use FEX on each site. So is it worth having Fabricpath to get the vPC+ or no and I must consider the vPC classic with FEX and vPC back to back between pairs?
You don't need fabricpath to run a vPC+ from a FEX.  Fabricpath is really only useful in large data centers where you have a multiple tier topology (Core, Aggregation, Access).  In a smaller setup using a collapsed core type design, vPC is simpler and accomplishes the same goal of getting rid of spanning tree.
have two DC, with 2 N5K on each DC. I want to connect these pairs with Fabricpath to have full bandwidth used. I've seen that vPC back to back can do the trick.
