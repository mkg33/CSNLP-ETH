On a CentOS install I do not see jfs listed. Note that I have zilch exeperience with AIX and this is just an educated guess.
In AIX operating system, there exist two generations of JFS filesystem that are called JFS (JFS1) and JFS2 respectively.1[2] In the other operating systems, such as OS/2 and Linux, only the second generation exists and is called simply JFS.[3] This should not be confused with JFS in AIX that actually refers to JFS1.
A 'right' question is whether the filesystem that is on the disk is supported by your linux system. I do not believe that linux natively supports the jfs filesystem, which I believe from some Googling is the default AIX fs. I did find this resource regarding compiling the linux kernel with jfs support or alternatively here. If/Once your kernel supports jfs you should be able to mount it like any other disk.
You can reference IBM's own guide for this here: http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg246622.pdf
The reason isn't just the filesystem format itself, but the AIX LVM stores data on the disk in a different partition format to that of Linux's disk partitioning and LVM options.
The best option available in general is to boot from CD on another pSeries server with the hard drive attached.
-directory to mount to would be something like /mnt/aix (or any directory you specify to be the root to mount the AIX drive to)
Yes, AIX's JFS can be mounted on Linux.  You can just mount it normally using the "mount" command if you have JFS drivers installed (definitely a default with the Suse family and definitely available for Red Hat if not there by default.)
The answer is probably No.  No commercial distribution comes with this ability to mount AIX's JFS filesystems. So you would need to get JFS modules built/deployed for your Linux.   My understanding is that the JFS technology IBM contributed to Linux stems from OS/2 rather than AIX. See this Wikipedia on JFS:
