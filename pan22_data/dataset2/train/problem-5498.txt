This part seems pretty good, however I'd say you could refactor the distinct sections into their own methods.  Furthermore, the entire "days alive" calculation can be simplified.  It's also a little magic number-y, but I'd say these are okay because they make sense - 1000 ms, 60 s, 60 m, 24 hr.  If you wanted to make these more explicit you could, but in this case I think they would just make it harder to understand.
In your main function you use a lambda, which is fine, but you could do it even more cleanly with a method reference.
Likewise, anyone who is even a little familiar with Java (and even people who aren't) can guess/know that the lines
I'd same some of your comments identifying the fields are rather inane - I can guess that private final JFrame frame; is in fact "the actual frame of this program."  By contrast, some of the other comments are pretty useful, but more because the name of the field isn't as descriptive as possible - its almost always better to have your code be self explanatory (through clear formatting and logic, as well as good names) than to comment and explain it.  For example dayLabel could probably be more clearly named as currentSelectedDayLabel and then remove the comment.
It wouldn't hurt to have some tests either, although given the relative simplicity of the calculations here it probably isn't that big of a deal.
