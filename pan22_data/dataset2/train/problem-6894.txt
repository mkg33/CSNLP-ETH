For mysql: dump data and schema structure, for web content, backup the files and server configuration.
Saving your .so files (dynamically linked libraries) would require you to restore them to a system running exactly the same architecture and exactly the same version of all dependencies with exactly the same version of compiler/linker. In one word: failure. In general, the best approach to this is having an installation documentation or script which can be used to reproduce the current set up (mutatis mutandum) on the new environment.
Apache configuration should be kept within /etc directory, or within virtual hosts directories, which you should also backup.
*.so files are shared libraries, they are created at compilation time, and unless you changed the sources, you don't need to backup them. PHP configuration can be found in /etc/php?/* directories and files (on Debian, on Red Hat it should be in a similar place).
If it's a VPS to which you have full access, it's good idea to backup /etc, /home, /var, /usr/local directories, and anything else that you had to change by hand. Other directories, like /usr are handled by the system's package manager and you don't need to have backups for them - when you will configure new machines, system will install all neccessary files for you.
As for MySQL, it's good to make a text dump of the database using mysqldump - it will be easier for you to restore the databases in different MySQL instance which may by a different version, incompatible with files from the data/ directory.
