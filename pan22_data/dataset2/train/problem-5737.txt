However, by partitioning you can actually determine whether the partitions should be on the inner or outer part of the physical disk (depending on partition order). Thus you can make one partition on the outer edge of the disk that's way faster than the one on the inner part of the disk. Putting swap there might theoretically increase performance. It might also increase disk thrashing since the disk head will have to move from the innermost part to the outermost more often.
One of the primary reasons I use different partitions is that of separating the data from the OS. Should you need to re-install windows (which we all know is quite likely) at any point you can do so without needing to move your data off to somewhere else.
However, I am a huge fan of using it to separate data from the operating system. Makes it a breeze when you need to do a reinstall.
This means that if your system goes belly up (on the Linux case you want to swap distros or distro versions) you can easily nuke the partition and start again.
Apart from that one rule though, I think the less partitions the better. Partitions are inflexible things, and the less you have to deal with them the better.
I doubt you would see any performance increase for the first or third items you have listed. Partitioning a single disk doesn't avoid the fact that you need time to seek the head over the proper track and then need to wait for the desired sector to rotate under the head.
As partitions on the same disk will be using the same spindle theres very little to be gained in terms of speed with partitioning a single disk.
So, in linux land that would be a partition for / and a partition for /home. In Windows land that would be c: and d: drive, and either actually modifying windows so the "Document and Settings" directory is on D or just learning to store my data on D.
