In ESX, it's possible to make snapshots, then manually copy certain disk files that aren't locked, in order to create a new machine. I'm not sure if you can do this in VMWare Server but it may be worth looking into.
Don't forget that you could also use any normal OS backup software like bacula or amanda to perform the backups from within the OS.
If you decide to run ESXi in the future, there is the fabulous ghettoVCB: http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-8760
It's been a long time since I have messed with vmware server (ESXi is free! :D), but I think you should be able to do it like this:
I've been very impressed with how reliably it's converted my machines. The only limitations appear to be on older machines that aren't supported (for example, a Win2k machine that hasn't been updated since the dawn of time didn't work, but would have if I could have updated it. Long story) 
Essentially, you point vmware converter at the guest VM's IP address, give it root login credentials, and tell it which ESX(i) server you want it to appear on. Then hit "go" and wait a while.
