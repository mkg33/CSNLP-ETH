This issue keep on happening the next day. I looked at downloading the Live Update 6 from the msi website. That didn't work in windows 8.1. I didn't try that hard to get that working to be honest. I just moved on.. 
Linux is a suitable OS as it supports a lot of hardware. For the USB flash creation with a wide choice of Linux distributions you can use UNetbootin. Practical Linux distribution for this use could be Ubuntu as it is easy to use, is frequently updated and has a wide user base.
I was on steam and tried downloading a patch for a game. It wouldn't connect to the steam server. My wifi was working fine at this point. I decided to restart the computer, and see if that made a difference. If did... I couldn't see any networks on my wifi when it came back on. There were no windows updates or anything like that. 
You can check the functionality of the WiFi adapter (or other hardware) in a different operating system. Probably most convenient is to use a Live OS from a bootable USB flash drive.
I have a MSI mobo and utilize this utility once a month just to check my versions. I always recommend getting drivers from the manufacturer (you may have, you didn't note it) as they are specific to the hardware you have from that manufacturer.
I then went into "system" then "Devices" then disabled the wifi device and re-enabled it and it started to work again. I assume the power switched off, and it never got the message to turn on again.
