There is no setting to change the default reply format, Outlook will always default to replying in the format of the incoming message. Changing the formatting after the reply window opens is your best bet.
Reply/Reply All an example email. Go to the Format Text tab. Right-click on the HTML option in the Format panel. Click on Add to Quick Access Toolbar.
An alternative to the problem is determining whether or not you are forwarding/replying to emails and including the referenced email as an attachment or part of the email itself. If your issue is that its being received by gmail, etc as a .eml file you've likely selected to forward emails as attachments within outlook. This function translates the referenced email into a .eml file which is not easily read by a browser based email client.
What you could do though is make a hotkey to change the formatting type. AutoHotkey is great for this and you don't need to know how to script either. AutoHotkey comes with a tool called AutoScriptWriter which can record a macro for you that you can play back much faster.
I added a shortcut to the Quick Access Toolbar to "Clear All Formatting". Then, when I reply/reply all to any email, I can select all the text in my reply and simply click the button to format exactly as my default style set.
Simply go to File > Options > Mail > Replies and Forwards and change the settings to include the referenced email within the email rather than as an attachment or any of the other options.
