When making changes on any device that requires an IP address, plug the device directly into a machine and set the machine's IP address to the same IP range as the device after changing the IP address. This way you won't "loose" connection to the actual device itself.
in trying to set up a router as a wireless access point i changed the IP of the router from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.100.46. I still have web access through my DHCP enabled router (ip is 192.168.0.1).
I had the same problem today. Changed the ip from 192.168.1.1. to 8.8.8.8 and then had difficulty in logging back to the router and also accessing the internet. (a) I right clicked on the wireless icon in the taskbar, (b) went to open network and internet settings, (c) clicked on Change Adapter Options (d) clicked on internet protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4) (e) clicked on properties (f) use the following IP address (g) entered 192.168.1.1 (h) clicked on subnet mask and it got entered automatically (I) clicked on 'use the following dns servers' (j) entered 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Finally, I clicked on validate settings upon exit. That's it. It found an error which windows troubleshoot wanted to know if it could fix it. I said yes. 
If the address is indeed 192.168.100.46, then you can temporarily access it by adding a second IP address to your computer.  Assuming you are using Windows, the steps are:
If, in step 4, it is set to "Obtain an IP address automatically", then you'll need to change it to "Use the following IP address" and put in whatever your current IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway are.  You can get this information by opening command prompt and typing "ipconfig".  Then, you should be able to click Advanced and add a second IP address.
Everything else will continue to work and you will have the changed 192.168.100.x IP reachable on local network too.
Many consumer routers won't let you change the IP address to something that's not on the local subnet.  Are you sure the IP address is not 192.168.1.46?
As already mentioned by others you are crossing subnets which is causing your problem. Unless you have a router that can pass communication between the two subnets, normally in the form of a static route, you won't "see" the WAP.
Now I can no longer access the web interface for the other router by typing in 192.168.100.46 in the address bar.
