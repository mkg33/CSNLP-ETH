MondoDB is probably not as stable as MySQL et all, but MUMPS is probably more stable by several decades than any currently available SQL system. 
MongoDB offers MongoDB Enterprise Edition, where on top of authentication and encryption at rest, offers auditing for any user activity. HIPAA security rule advises to audit any user activity with ePHI.
It's not so much about which tool you use to store the data, but rather how you secure that data.  I don't see any reason why a NoSQL solution couldn't be secured to an appropriate level, just as a RDBMS solution could be done in a way that was completely insecure.
MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, etc... They are all just ways of organizing bits for storage/retrieval. There are not necessarily more security flaws in one or the other simply because one is relational and another is object-oriented.
Those who favor MUMPS argue that healthcare data is more hierarchical than tabular (lots of many to many relationships) which makes it stronger in healthcare. Given MUMPS dominance in Health IT this is hard to argue with. 
To add to @linda's answer, the database is just another layer in the stack of components that create an application. The security of that system is based upon the combination of all components.
If you are implementing a new EMR or migrating, Be sure to talk to your IT guys about project specifics before making any CXO decisions! I've experienced too many tales of management making large sweeping and disastrous decisions without IT Input.
There is an effort, (by a friend) to develop a layer for PHI handling over MongoDB called RESTCat that might be appropriate for what you are specifically trying to do.
