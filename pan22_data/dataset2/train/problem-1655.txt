Do not suck. A vaccuum cleaner will produce a static charge, with all bad effects. Buy a can of pressurized air, and blow the dust out. Indeed, take care not to start turning your fans to hard, but that problem would also be there when sucking.
Generally speaking, you want to blow because it's a lot easier to concentrate blowing force than vacuuming force. Besides, the risk of ESD is higher with vacuuming.
The OP and others have mentioned using something like a leaf blower to clear dust from a computer. Actually, American vacuum cleaner manufacturer MetroVac makes an electric blower designed specifically for blasting dust out of computer equipment. It's essentially a high-power vacuum motor in a can, configured to blow rather than to suck. Here's a video of it in action.
As vacuuming doesn't remove all clogged dust, I'm fond of a small preassure tank with an airbrush nozzle that can deliver both narrow and wide air flow. One can blow 3-4 computers with a single refill.
To tackle the floating dust, I either use a table-top vacuum or electrostatic feather duster, depending on the shape and size of the case. When cleaning a server rack that can be opened from both ends, have another person hold the duster on the opposite end. Don't take the duster too close to the case to avoid static charges!
