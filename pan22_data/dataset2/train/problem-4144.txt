After that you can SSH into Pi and install VNC to get a GUI. If you want a step by step instruction for it, check out Option 3: Connect with WiFion http://www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi/getting-started/using-the-pi/
I think all these answers are missing the point that the RPi model A HAS NO Ethernet, no wi-fi, so no matter what you do, unless you get an external dongle, you wont be able to connect to the RPi through ssh.... your best bet is either to use it directly on a TV or to use it through the serial port on the headers, or as I said, get an external dongle for wifi. 
I have created a shell script tool (unfortunately only runs on Linux), it automates the entire process of downloading the latest Raspbian image, unpacking the image, embedding the wi-fi and ethernet settings (provided by the user) in the image, repack the image and burn it on the SD card. When you boot your Pi with the SD card, it straight away connects with your network. The script also has the capability to searching for a freshly configured Pi on the network.
You can use the interfaces file. Load it up with all the network information and put it in a thumb drive and reboot the RPi with that. The RPi takes the settings and sets up the WiFi without the need for extra hardware or a monitor. 
You can directly connect a Wi-Fi dongle with your Pi, use the RaspImgConfig.sh script to embed the Raspbian Image with wi-fi credentials and burn the image on the card. No need for any monitor, mouse or keyboard.
You need to edit the wpa_supplicant.conf file on the sdcard (it's in /etc or /etc/wpa_supplicant depending on your distribution version). The format of the file is explained here: http://linux.die.net/man/5/wpa_supplicant.conf
You can set up your pi to work with a password protected wifi and automatically enable ssh without booting the pi, with config files in the /boot partition.
