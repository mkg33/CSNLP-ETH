If, after all that, it still doesn't work, I'd probably want to look at the output of sudo port -d install ImageMagick and see if anything looks out of place.
If it looks like something in the portfile is responsible for it not building, you can modify it before it runs to change the options it uses.  running port file ImageMagick will show you the path of the portfile.  If you edit that file then run sudo port install ImageMagick it will use the portfile with your changes.  Beware, when you run sudo port selfupdate again, it will overwrite your changes.
First off, make sure your portfiles are up to date.  Run sudo port selfupdate and then sudo port upgrade ImageMagick.  It's possible you have an old version of the portfile where it wasn't enabled.
Two other options: (a) Use fink instead of MacPorts. (b) Build it yourself, without MacPorts. If you met all dependencies for building it, this shouldn't be too difficult. 
The latest version if the ImageMagick port appears to include lcms, so it surprises me that it would build without it.
I you use a version of ImageMagick upto 6.5.9-0 with MacPorts, it disables lcms by default, but it has a lcms variant.
If that doesn't work, run sudo port uninstall ImageMagick then sudo port -d configure ImageMagick and watch for a hint in the log about why it's being excluded.
Also, as background information, from what I've read on the internet, lcms is the best way to use ImageMagick to convert images between color profiles, say from CYMK to RGB in order to make them web-compatible (well, IE compatible). I've tried using ImageMagick without lcms to convert between color profiles using -colorspace and -profile options without success.
I installed ImageMagick via MacPorts, but unfortunately it was installed with "--without-lcms" and "--with-lcms=no" even though it lists lcms as a dependency on the website: http://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=imagemagick There is also no lcms variant to turn this on, that I can see. Lcms can be found here, by the way: http://www.littlecms.com/
Anyway, any help on either installing ImageMagick with lcms support or alternative methods of converting image color profiles would be welcomed. Thanks!
