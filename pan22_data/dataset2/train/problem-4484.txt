I live in a dorm where many students have setup small wireless networks. There are two of this networks that are very close to my room as the signal is very strong. Our college uses DHCP to assign IP addresses. I believe that these routers are on the college network along with my computer. I have the MAC addresses for the routers but how would I find the external IP address for the routers?
Since 10.21.161.141 is only one hop away, and it's not on my network (I am on 10.21.176.0/24), it is the outside interface of my gateway.  In my case, the access point.
We can keep on decreasing or increasing the last octet, again this is better if you'd script it (or run an hping with your ttl value set to 1):
Here you can see that 10.21.176.2 is my gateway (Access point) and you can then determine which of these IP addresses in the range of your second hop (in my case 10.21.161.*, assuming it's a normal C class network) will reply straight away, this can be either scripted or done manually:
There is a way to find out if you modify the TTL values. You can do this using a tool such as hping, or simply traceroute (tracert in Windows).
I am connected to an access point, and I can do a traceroute to an outside IP address then see what the second "hop" is:
Note: This won't work however if the access point blocks outgoing ICMP "TTL expired" messages, but normally they aren't configured that way.
