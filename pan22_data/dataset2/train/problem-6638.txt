You just need to change an account wich used for start SQL Server Agent service to account with access to network share (and system service operations for sure) - e.g. any domain admin account...
As I grow more with SQL server I will most likely move to scripts, as viewing Brent's video showed me it is better in the long run. 
I use the maintenance plans, they were easy to setup and so far haven't failed. I have them backing-up my databases to a SAN, you must supply the UNC name for the directory path eg \\archive\SQL\database\fullbackup.bak. 
I have done this using a Maintenance Plan. I have actually written a script to backup all the user databases. I have shared that script here http://dbalink.wordpress.com/2009/04/25/automated-sql-server-back-poor-mans-edition/ 
If you do have Express, you'll have to be a bit more creative. One option is using the Windows scheduler to call sqlcmd with a backup script.
Remember that C:\ cannot be a network drive it must be a locally connected drive. (No, mapped drives doesn't work either).
But local disk backup and xp_commandshell it's really much more reliable. You can script result check/distribution to several servers and so on...
There are better solutions, though, than what I have done in my script. Just check the comments on my post.
Which edition of SQL 2005 do you have? If you have the Express edition (the free edition) it does not come with SQL agent.
