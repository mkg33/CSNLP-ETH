Windows Update keeps recommending me updates to components (.NET framework of different versions, parts of MS Office), which I think I do not have on my machine. Having been tweaking the Win OSs for fifteen years I shouldn't think I am inexperienced, so it is embarrasing.
The next question is why you want to disable .NET?  Although it isnt necessary, there are a lot of applications out there that rely on it.
Is it possible that bits of .NET are purposely covered up? Could any of you gurus comment on (1) where I should look for the "hidden" remnants of .NET and (2) whether it is reasonable to ignore the updates as long as one is convinced that the framework to-be-updated is not present?
.NET 3.5 isnt a program that is (un)installed from "Add/Remove Programs."  Its a Windows Feature that is enabled/disabled.
From the Control Panel/Programs select "Turn Windows Features On or Off" and see if .NET 3.5 is enabled.  If it is, then thats why Windows wants to update it.
Right now, after a fresh OS install I have done my best to remove all .NET that had been pre-packaged with the OEM Win7 HE, 64bit. I have removed all v4.0 bits in the Programs list, applied the official dotnet cleanup tool and still am getting recommendations of .NET 3.5.1 security updates in Windows Update.
