If you are worried / paranoid over this, another solution may simply be to set up a virtual machine and do your work/vpn through that.
On the other hand, you are correct in saying that a company can spy on you. By connecting to their VPN, you will be using "their" internet, everything will be routed via the VPN endpoint at their office and you will be connecting to their router/proxy/logging service.
If you trust them turn VNC on and watch what they are doing on screen and then turn it off completely.
I'm about to work with a company on a development project, but they first need to set up a pretty complicated environment, and suggested they use VPN to work on my machine to do this. Should I be concerned that somebody can just watch me work? It would be embarrassing, if somebody could witness my work habits (e.g. Asking questions on SO and researching all day is part of my daily work regiment, and makes me feel like a noob, but it keeps me sharp. I also listen to conspiracy videos all day, and RadioLab podcasts, :). Is VPN going to introduce this possibility, and if so, is there a way around it?
For some items such as anti virus, domain and a few other features, it is much easier to simply enable VPN access rather than publish these services to the internet and work out authentication/security.
When it comes down to it, remember that a VPN is (basically) the equivalent of going to their office and sticking a network cable in to their switch and the other end in to your computer.
As for telling if someone is connecting/connected, it is pretty much the same as being on a wireless hotspot - unless you have a firewall or monitoring program, you will not be able to tell... that being said, they will not be able to "get in" unless you give them administration over your machine, or they have some sort of remote access program on your machine.
