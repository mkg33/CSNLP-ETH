One of my college courses years ago used the first edition of "Database Solutions" by Connoly & Begg (link below).  We breezed through it in a month and then got on to other stuff, but I remember it being a good intro.
I also recommend "Database Design for Mere Mortals" and for a fun quick bit about getting your head around normalization 
I found the "SQL Server for Dummies" book to be pretty good.  It's the only "Dummies" book I've ever read, but a friend recommended it when I asked about a good intro to RDBMSs.
If you want a rule of thumb the shorter the better, huge database books tend to focus on mathematical theory which practically you don't need.
The Essence of Databases is very short but is one of my favourites, a bit old now and not available on kindle unfortunately.
I'm a big fan of Databases Demystified (link to the Kindle edition) because of its excellent db logic questions at the end of each chapter. It's also well written and breaks down all of the concepts surrounding databases into an easy to understand format.
