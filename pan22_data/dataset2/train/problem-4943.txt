As Madhatter has written, relying on the logs for this information will not give an accurate picture. Also, as with most statistics, you have to spend a lot of time thinking about what you are actually measuring - are people spending time on the page because its interesting or because its hard to understand? Capturing the data in javascript will give quite different behaviour from looking at the logs (consider what happens when the user has multiple windows open).
On the upside, the same machinery also allows you to start looking at caching effectiveness and clickstream analysis (also areas that most of the current generation of analysers are poor at).
AFAIK, there are no tools available, commercial or free which do this kind of analysis - including Google Analytics (malfy: can you provide a reference?). However writing your own is not overly taxing - but you'll certainly need to use mod_usertrack or require sessions throughout to differentiate between users - and log the relevant cookie along with the mimetype for a request - which means you're no longer using the standard log formats. 
Nihuo Web Log Analyzer support this function. It's not free, but there is 30 days free evaluation version with full function in their website. 
Analog will tell you what is definitely knowable from your web stats, and it will tell you very quickly.  Trying to get more is guesswork, and if you want a guess, why pay someone else to make it?  Random number generators are five a penny, so use one of them instead.
Stephen Turner, the author of analog, is a bright guy - ex-Cambridge statistician - and I'm inclined to agree with him on this.  He justifies his arguments in the link I sent above.
I do commend to you the analog documentation on what is and is not knowable from your web logs, especially the part where the author writes:
