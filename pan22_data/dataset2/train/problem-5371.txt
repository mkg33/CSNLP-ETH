...and this buffering and then error loop repeats continuously until right before I terminate the program where it gives this error:
I can start the stream on the Pi and it runs through code, only throwing the following three errors on different lines.  In VLC, I can open the stream without issue.
Once I get to the stream in VLC though, it freezes and the Pi's terminal gives the following errors:
I'm attempting to stream low-latency video from my Raspberry Pi to my Windows PC using Raspivid and VLC.  I'm no expert on this stuff and i'm mainly following tutorials and trying to understand what I can.  I'm streaming over RTSP.
Here is my code for starting the stream on the Pi.  I've used some variations of this that i've found online, but it generally remains the same:
raspivid -o - -t 0 -n -w 600 -h 400 -fps 15 -rot 180 | cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' :demux=h264 --h264-fps=15
Nothing i've found has worked to solve this so far.  If anyone has a solution, I would be grateful to hear it.  Thanks!
Every time the stream buffers, the stream unfreezes and I get some movement in VLC, but nothing usable.
