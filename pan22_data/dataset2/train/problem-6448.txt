To get a PCAP with real traffic, you could ask your colleagues politely to allow you to record all of their traffic one day for just an hour (or until the pcap is X-GB in size).  If you're at work, hopefully there won't be a huge objection to it since it should be work-related stuff and your company owns the network, etc.  Offer to destroy all DHCP leases, spoof mac-addresses, and change hostnames if anybody is unsure about what you might see so you can't track it down later.  Whatever.
We use Ixia IxChariot for this use.  It's a widely used commercial product and can definitely do what you're looking for.
Netperf and scapy are good options if you looking for a simple open-source solution. If you need more complete you would consider agilent N2x and Spirent.
Hyenae is a highly flexible platform independent network packet generator. It allows you to reproduce several MITM, DoS and DDoS attack scenarios, comes with a clusterable remote daemon and an interactive attack assistant.
There are some options you can play with, send delay range, TCP window size etc. IPv6 supported. It can generate 100K+ pps.
Short and sweet: use tcpdump to record and make sure you have enough space to store the PCAP.  Then, use tcpreplay (http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/) to play it back.
I've used Ixia IxChariot in the past and found that the only benefits were that it ran on Windows and produced slick looking reports that were effectively meaningless, but made management types happy to see.
