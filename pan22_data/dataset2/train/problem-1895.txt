As for retrieving the original source from the compiled file: no you cannot. You could disassemble it (so get an assembly version of your program) and I'm sure there is some little program out there that will rewrite some "C++ style" code from it, but that will never be like your original code as more than one instruction in C++ may correspond to the same machine code.
In the highly unlikely event that you haven't closed your vi session yet, open a new terminal and look for a .source-code.cpp.swp file in the same folder. Remember that files starting with a period are not listed by ls command by default; use ls -A to see them. 
I had written a source code of C++ and complied it with the same name using the following command line.
Now my source code has been replaced by the executable program.Is there any way to retrieve my source-code.
The last line of the .swp file would have the text from your original file before being corrupted by mal-compilation.
The .swp file get deleted once you close the vi session; so if you've already closed it, you're out of luck.
