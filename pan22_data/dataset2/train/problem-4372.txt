In addition, I'd buy a couple of portable hard drives to copy data to for offsite archiving/storage. I'd recommend using either a couple of different brands of disks, or different batches of disks to minimize the chances of them failing at the same time.
If you have family members that are network connected, you might consider buying a NAS to sit on their network, and remote-store on there.  
I currently have CrashPlan running on my machine with 1.2TB of data backed to their cloud service. Pretty easy to use and doesn't cost too much. I especially like that their subscription CrashPlan+ allows for unlimited data, so I don't have to worry about that :)
For reliable local storage, I'd take a good look at the Drobo products by Data Robotics. You can start off with a few hard drives and add capacity as needed without the need to worry about matching disk specifications like traditional RAID.
I do wish their up and down speeds were faster, but doesn't really matter when it's always running in the background and I'm always connected to the internet. And since I a critical subset of that data going to an external drive I can access that pretty fast in case of a drive failure (which actually happened a couple of months ago).
We use several ReadyNAS products and really like them; we have an offsite data-center so don't really need the Vault features but from what I hear it is pretty nice.
