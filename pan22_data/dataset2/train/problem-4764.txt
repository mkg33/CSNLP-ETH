I've seen multiply ways this was done in the past. Most of them failed and none of them were good enough to jump across this obstacle completely. Everyone of them has some flaw in it. I post the 3 most sucessfull ones:
With java you can start another server in the same folder, and you can generate the worlds with it if you have the right plugins for it. However, this is not very server friendly, as some servers don't allow you to run multiply game servers at once.
You can either ask the server owner to create a world or generate it yourself, then save a copy of this world to a separate folder, and when you need it, copy it back to the main folder to use it.
If your plugin runs on a small server, then in the mean time, when there's no one on that server you can use the time to generate some worlds, then use them when there's actually someone playing the games. You don't need to create only 1, you can stack them up and create 20-30 or even 50 worlds at once. The obvious flaw to this one is that it's not 100% there will be a playerless timespan on that server.
