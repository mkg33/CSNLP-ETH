For example, you have Player A plant seeds at 1:00pm and the server stores: what was planted, how much was planted, where it was planted, and a seed value for rain based on location and time.  Then when Player B logs on to that area the client grabs all that info and runs the calculation based on the info to determine whether it's ready to harvest or not.
Since it's based on a predetermined seed you don't have issues with authentication, and you also avoid the performance hit of having the server globally calculate everything all the time (which isn't practical).  It's all about how you design the database and your randomization engine for seeds and variance of weather (and how you limit/control it).
So whether you calculate grow cycles on the client or not doesn't matter, what matters is that you know when something was planted and have the information required to figure out whether it's ready to be harvested or not.  
To be perfectly honest the "best" method is going to be a hybrid of the two, because there are things you absolutely have to store on the server.  First, you absolutely must store what was planted and when on the server because otherwise when another player logs in they would have no knowledge of what another player planted.
