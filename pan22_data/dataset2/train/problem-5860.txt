Next when you go to your registrar and change your nameservers, you will enter srv01.kaareskovgaard.net, because the nameserver is on the same domain, you will then be asked to enter the IP of the nameserver.
When you specify the new DNS servers, you'll have to specify both a name AND the corresponding IP, if the name of the server is a record of the domain it is going to serve.
To do this, you firstly need to have NameServer records setup on your own DNS server for srv01.kaareskovgaard.net. You would also usually have 2 name server records, your registrar may require this, so you may want to setup srv02.kaareskovgaard.net as well, this should preferably point to a different IP to the first one. It can point to the same DNS server, although best practice is to have a second backup DNS server for your sendon nameserver, but obviously if this is a hobby then its not neccasery.
Also, if you're going to host your own DNS you should look at who's going to provide secondary DNS in case yours goes down. Some hosting providers offer this service.
