It would be best to have a new signature photographed at a much higher resolution.  This way the pixels would not be visible, and the graphic would be of higher quality.
I have a bmp photo. It is the photo of a signature. I am going to use the bmp photo for a pdf file. When I dynamically create the pdf file, the bmp file appears with its pixels visible. 
What should I do to avoid the pixel problems for the photo which is used in the pdf files that are going to be printed ?
The best way, as sYsinfo alluded to, would be to convert the image into a vector format. That's a fairly complicated task that usually has to be done by hand, though. You might want to just try capturing the signature into a larger image so there is more data to work with.
You're trying to put rasterized data in a scalable vector format. In English, you can't expand the signature in its current form because that data doesn't exist. The computer has to use an algorithm to blow it up, and when it does, you get the "pixelated" appearance. 
You can remove some of the blockiness by creating new pixels and assigning their colours to be the average of the neighbouring pixels. Not sure which (if any) image manipulation programs do this though.
