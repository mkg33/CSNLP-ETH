ADSP is an entry in DNS that works allows a domain owner to assert that all email must be signed with DKIM.  (similar to the -all and ~all in SPF/SenderID).  Messages that fail ADSP policy may be rejected.
Unfortunately there is no consensus yet on how to handle DKIM with remailers. There is a wiki page discussing DKIM in Mailman which discusses the possible solutions. At this stage I would certainly not use dkim=discardable if messages are sent to mailing lists, and would be wary of dkim=all.
Firstly, ADSP is simply the mechanism for defining a policy. Specifying dkim=unknown is equivalent to not specifying an ADSP policy. I'm assuming that you're specifically referring to the all and discardable policies here.
The problem with mailing lists occur when the message body or any signed headers are modified. This commonly occurs when adding a footer with list information, which is fairly common behaviour by all mailing list software. I think that pretty much all mailing list software will break DKIM signatures.
