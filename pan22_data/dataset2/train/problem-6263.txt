Preferences > General > Downloads: Select "Save files to" and browse to the location (and NOT "Always ask me where to save files")
Just discovered a great trick for dealing with this and other Finder dialogs, although I guess it may still vary from one app to another.  In any case, worked for me when I was using an Upload File dialog from Firefox.
It indeed seems to be application-dependent, which leads me to suspect that the fix lies in the Preferences of each application. For Firefox, for example, when saving downloaded files:
2 If you want the downloaded file to be saved to a consistent default location, regardless of save location of previous download:
Preferences > General > Downloads: Select "Always ask me where to save files" (and NOT "Save files to")
Default Folder X allows you to set the default folder on a per-application basis, or system-wide. It also enhances save dialog boxes, giving you folder shortcuts, favourites, etc.
I found that if I simply browsed to the desired folder, then the next time the upload dialog opened it would always reset to ~/Documents folder.  But if I selected a location under SEARCH FOR in the sidebar then the Finder dialog would reuse it.  So I made a Smart Folder that simply pointed to the desired folder/files and had it saved in the sidebar.
