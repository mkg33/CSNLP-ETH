Edit: Yeah I think it just starts rolling once it hits the history depth... so do the file size thing.
Then start a new instance of procmon in a new subDir. Creativity will have you creating subdirectories with incremental names like subdir1, subdir2, subdir3, etc.
That isn't specifically tailored to your situation. You'll have to tweak it. That's something I wrote a long time ago for a slightly different purpose. What you want to do is if the size of all the *.pml files in the subdirectory added together has not increased since the last time the script ran... then you know it's time to terminate Procmon and start a new instance.
The point is that you have to terminate Procmon gracefully with the /terminate parameter, not just kill the process, or else the log will be corrupt and unreadable.
Edit: Also, I've never run Procmon to 200 million events before, so I don't know if it just sits there and does nothing after reaching 199 million, or if it completely shuts down.  If the latter is the case, then your job is easier.  Just check if Procmon.exe is still running.  If it's not, then  you know it's time to fire it up again under a new subdirectory.
Yes, you're going to have to script it.  I've done some similar work with Procmon like this before, but my aim was nothing like to capture billions of events. Nevertheless, this should help you, unless you needed someone to write the script for you:
