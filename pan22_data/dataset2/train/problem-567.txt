Debian GNU/kFreeBSD is not a toy anymore! With Squeeze is will be a stable Debian port, with full security support and updates.
What would be the gain? What about using Nexenta instead? It is far more commonly used in production, and it probably supports your hardware already.
Sure, the release is labeled as "technology preview" but this is because on the desktop it's not fully usable yet (there are many bugs that populate GNOME/KDE libraries and other important desktop components).
you have to ask yourself how many people are running the debian/bsd hybrid...and how many of them rely on it to be stable
The FreeBSD 8.x-STABLE branch's ZFS support isn't 100% stable (I've crashed it a few times myself). It's also currently at version 13/14; a ways behind OpenSolaris. FreeBSD's InfiniBand support is 'lacking' (ie, nearly non-existent) last I looked too.
this project has always struck me as a fun idea and experiment, but i wouldn't presume to rely on it
I'm not sure it would be a big win over OpenSolaris.  The current ZFS implementation in FreeBSD stable (8.1) trails the OpenSolaris version by quite a big chunk.  The code in the development tree (9.0)is a lot more current, but I don't know how stable that is.  Because of the version difference, you lose out on features like dedupe, which can be huge, depending on your usage, and you may have issues downgrading your zpools.
OTOH on the server it's perfectly fine. We're using it on production already (as backup server, not a big deployment mind you) with no serious trouble.
