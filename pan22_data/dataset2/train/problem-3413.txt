Start a new firefox with a different profile.  Create a new profile specifically for gmail.  Set it as a desktop icon for quick access.

When I'm not using a second Firefox profile for this, I deal with this by using a second browser. I generally have multiple for a reason, so I use it for this. For instance, I only use IE for sites that require it, so using it for Gmail is useful since I'm not doing anything else with it. SeaMonkey uses the Gecko rendering engine and is also a Mozilla browser if you want another alternative.
Another way of doing this would be to use gmail via an imap client e.g. Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird (If you are using windows). Then you won't have google account login problems. If you are so paranoid as to be afraid of IP-time based tracking, you can try using anonymous proxies for web surfing while having gmail access via the imap client. 
Most (if not all) modern browsers provide for "private" sessions. I would consider opening one of these, and logging into GMail from there. That way you will be logged in for that session, but not logged into any other Google services in your normal browsing sessions.
