Your most likely getting beat up from the Internet.  My firewall is regularly scanned from multiple places.  Since it seems to be flooding your pipe, I would recommend looking at your firewall blocked log to see if you can identify the offending IP's.  If its one or 2, your ISP may be able to block that for you upstream to get that load off your connection.  
It is possible you are being DDoSed - an external entity is sending as much traffic as they can towards your public IP (thus filling your 30Mbps link), but this is not being passed through to your LAN segment, because it is hidden behind a NAT.
Running pftop on your pfSense box should give you good insight into the In and Out traffic in a side by side manner with the byte count. This should tell you exactly where it is not matching up.
What is interesting though is that during this time that your LAN interface outbound is pretty consistent at 2Mbps.
You might want to look at your RRD graphs to see what's going on with blocked traffic, and/or examine what you have exposed to the WAN that could be getting beat on [that would be services that originate from the pfSense box and which might well be only intended for your local network, but which may have default (or non-default) settings that make them available on the WAN interface as well.]
