There's a number of tools out there that can help you decode base64.  How best to download something like that largely depends on how you're getting to it.
So we can go to the Resources tab of the Inspector (next to the Elements one), and we can see the images of interest, in Base64-encoded PNG.
We go to an <img> tag with a Base64-encoded Gif image, but that's actually a simple 1x1 placeholder.
Note: I tried another way: you can copy the URL of the resources, and paste them in a simple HTML file with <img src="<base64-encoded data>"> tags. View the HTML file in a good browser, and you can save the images by right-clicking on them.
When you save a web page from a web-browser it should save the images too. In IE you choose save as web page, complete. The images will be in a subfolder and will be in jpg or png format - the browser deals with any encoding used for the HTTP data transfer.
As soon as you showed me the tag "img src=", I instantly understood that the browser already understands the base64 code. I just open a text document, added the tag <img src="data:image/gif;base64,..."> saved it as an *.html extension and opened it up in the browser (any of them work), right clicked on the image and saved. Voila insta-image from base64.
It's funny because you totally gave me the answer, let me share what I mean. I had the 'data:image/gif;base64," followed by some crazy base64 string. I wanted to convert the image back to JPEG but I didn't know how either and I really just wanted to do it quickly without using a script, python, etc (though that's a fine way to go in many cases). I just had one image I needed to convert right now.
Not much of web-traffic is base64 encoded... largely because it's not very efficient, and it's not at all secure.  (base64 is not encryption... it just obscures the data to make it not-human readable)  If you can get the raw stream data to a text-file or some such... there's several ways to re-assemble it.  Additionally, the data will not contain information about the file... i.e. file-name, size, type, etc...  it'l be a stream of data... and it's up to you to determine what it is.
Any chance we can peek at where the data is coming from? ...it would really help to give you a more appropriate answer.
Click on the data:image on the left, you get details on the resource, including a preview. You can right-click on the preview and save the image...
If you use Total Commander, it will decode base64/UUE provided that you save the data to a file with a .b64 or .uue extension. Winzip and WinRar will do it too.
