Also, the fact she's using XP means the system has absolutely no concept of permissions. There is no sudo&root, and no UAC. More modern Windows OS like 7 and 8 have UAC, which while not up to par with sudo+ apparmor/SELinux in Linux, is still a lot better than nothing at all.
Alternatively, it could be that there is an exploit within the browser itself. IE8 is an old browser that is filled with security holes. Use Chrome, Opera or Firefox, they're all miles more modern and more secure. 
Just to clean up a confusion, a site can infect your computer without plugins. Namely, JavaScript. Although modern browsers sandbox JavaScript so it can only do file operations in /tmp, JavaScript can still take advantage of actual vulnerabilities within the browser itself. In some cases, this can even be exploits in patched browsers (commonly known as the 0day exploit) although such incidents are rare.
But, largely, it would be learning not to click on any unknown link or open unexpected attachments that will keep her system safer.
I am inclined to believe that what she experienced was a result of an outdated plugin like Flash or Java. Unless you have an actual need for Java on the system, remove it. And always try to stay up to date with the installers. Really, if security is such an issue, I'd tell them to use Linux. That has a much better updater.
I'm pretty convinced flash has some vulnerabilities. I've been infected by websites I've visited using firefox and I am certain I did not install anything.
But, since you describe going to a site, a browser exploit from the referred site is likely culprit.
