This problem, bafflingly, is always specific to the application/window. Quitting and restarting each app fixes it for that app. I have this problem both with the Advantage2 Kinesis and Advantage Kinesys. It seems to be specific to my work machine and never my home machine. Oddly, it happens even when I remote desktop in from home to work. It may be Windows 7 specific. I read about a Advantage1-Windows7 problem which is fixed by either a bios change (disable usb 3 or turn on usb debug mode), a usb-to-ps2 dongle (plug usb keyboard into ps2 port) or an Advantage2 but I think this is a different problem because my Advantage2 (LF) has the same problem.
(1) Press Ctrl-Shift a few times. This seems to fix it for me. When I hit ctrl-c, it no longer puts the cents symbol. Pressing ctrl alone and shift alone may not be sufficient to fix this.
I have run into 2 extremely similar problems which roughly fit this description. After a year of living with them, I finally figured out how to fix them.
(2) Press Alt-Shift once. This is the default hotkey to switch keyboard input languages in Windows. See the control panel. Every once in a while, I accidentally hit alt-shift as I type a hotkey and trigger this. When I hit shift-3, it no longer puts "/". If you disable all the alternate keyboard layouts, this problem goes away.
