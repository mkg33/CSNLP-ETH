I downloaded and ran the Win10 Start Menu troubleshooter from MS (startmenu.diagcab) and it returned this:
I faced same problem (Start menu and Search, Notifications, etc. panels does not work) after a system update. OS version is "Windows 10 Pro 1890 OS build 17763.55 (dev. preview)"
I found another SU post on this exact issue, but none of the suggested solutions have worked. As a temporary workaround, I have installed Classic Shell for the user, but this might not be acceptable for him since the taskbar is still broken (right-click doesn't work in the taskbar).  
I upgraded a user from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 (in place upgrade) and his Start Menu does not work. I created two new local profiles, disjointed from the domain but still, the Start Menu does not work under any profile.  
One would think that these PowerShell commands would resolve the issue, but for whatever reason, they do not:  
"Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost" and "Microsoft.Windows.Cortana" applications need to be installed correctly." 
You can also check your system for integrity,  in the admin powershell type: sfc /scannow. See more details in the article I mentioned above.
