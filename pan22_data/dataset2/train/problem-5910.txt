In Windows 10 Version 1607 Build 1493.10 you can successfully install it on Ubuntu Bash, but it doesn't work :(
This may not sound like much given you have a Docker Windows client but it's useful if you have Linux toolchains that include docker for it's client-side functionality.
As of the Creator Update (released publicly on June 13, 2017) you can run native Windows executable directly in WSL. This means if you've already installed Docker for Windows you can simply invoke the docker binaries installed under C:\Program Files. Since they end in .exe the easiest option is to create aliases. Something like the following in your .bashrc should work:
Recently Microsoft announced a beta of a Ubuntu linux user mode running natively on Windows 10. This can run binaries compiled in ELF format on Windows (unlike cygwin which requires a compilation.)
Once Docker 1.12 is released and the Linux Docker client is separated, you should be able to run the docker client in Windows 10 bash.  
My understanding was that the primary limitation of running docker on other OSs was the Linux Network containers that made it possible. (Certainly for Macs). 
One caveat: you'll get an error message like "Unable to translate current working directory" if run from a Linux directory. Just cd into a Windows directory (e.g. /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername) and you should be good.
Nevertheless, you can install Docker for Windows and it works like a charm, you can obviously deploy Linux Servers and everything you need.
