This does not strictly mean it is running undo sudo (could be setuid'd also), but indicates that the program has more rights than the user may expect.
For example: In this program we need to tell the user to run some other program.  If the current one was run with sudo, the other one will be too.
Checking the error code (or return code) after the rm prevents someone from handily using sudo powers to create the file to play a prank on you. 
(for example in a program which is normally executed without such rights, but needs to be run with them during installation or to install updates. Then, you can use this to give some warning feedback about that).
Note that it only tests for a SUDO_* variable if it can first prove that it is running as root. Even then it only uses it to change some helpful text.
It is more common to check if you are running as the appropriate user.  The id command can be used to do this.  TomOnTime's script uses the id command to determine if sudo might be required to run the next command.
You can touch a file in /root and then if -e it. And if -e is true, rm (checking the error code) it so your test works next time.
