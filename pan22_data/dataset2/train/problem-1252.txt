Balance is pretty meaningless if one doesn't understand how the numbers interact. Your proposed solution, or even TMP's both assume that the 'value' of your stats are all closely related. The reality is that, depending on the underlying mathematics that govern your system, they could very well be far out of sync.
Balance isn't just a switch that you can flip. It's a complicated and nuanced process that goes directly to the heart of your game. The only way to even begin to make some kind of auto-balancing system is to generate a simple genetic AI that can play your game (or a simulation of it) and look at it's play to try to find degenerate strategies.
A good example of this is the '+3' cycle from the first release of Magic: the Gathering. There was one card of each color that did 3 of something. And in the noble MtG tradition, the blue one was so ridiculously overpowered that it blew the others out of the water. The value of '3' for the blue card was way WAY more than the value of the '3' on the other cards. The same could be true for your monster stats.
