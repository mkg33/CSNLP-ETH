One method to protect your assets I often rely on is using PhysicsFS to pack my assets in different packed zip files. In order to protect them, you could use some kind of symmetric encryption to secure your archives. If you do not plan any AAA-game this should be fairly enough to protect everything. But keep in mind, too much encryption etc. won't be useful and eventually decrease performance if you load your assets on-the-fly.
My answer to this question won't be complete, because there is no real good way to achieve what you want.
Assume you would pack all your assets in one zip file and compute the hashes. This leads to the problem that you need to recompile your project if you hardcode your expected hashes. However if you save the hash in another external location, you would need to protect that, too.
Don't make it too easy for hackers by putting each individual image in its own file or whatever, but don't bother with encryption because the determined ones will just break it, and pushing it to slow them down will just slow down your game and its development.
The big name games tend to use some variation of a well-indexed propietary archive file format with maybe basic compression.
