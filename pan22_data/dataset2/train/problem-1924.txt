The idea is to only have 1 copy of the app in case changes need to be made, so instead of updating the same application on X number of computers, we could just update the one in the network drive and then such changes would be available for everyone.
Each computer would then have to have a scheduled task to run the application at specific moments, using the drive's own IP as part of the file address.
I have a .exe application file that I plan to store in a network drive which many computers have access to. The purpose of the app is to retrieve information about the computer it is run in.
I have tried this myself and it seems to work, although I'm still not sure how it would work out if multiple users tried to execute it at the same time, or very close in time to each other at least.
Also, the network drive needs a user and password to access, this however is the same for any user that needs to store or retrieve files from it, with all permissions, usually this connection is already open, but there may be cases where the user needs to login, would the scheduled task fail to access the application then, or would it just ask for the login credentials and, if so, could they be added to the scheduled task arguments?
This application is not to be installed in the network drive, it would need no installation, just storing the file so it can be executed is enough.
