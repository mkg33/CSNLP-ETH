When reassembling, you'll have several options.  Worst would be to just line up the HSF, carrying remains of a phase change pad, atop the CPU.  Better would be to add some Arctic Silver (or other paste) to fill in where the old phase change pad was torn during separation.  Best is to completely remove the old phase change material, clean both surfaces, and then apply a very thin layer of Arctic Silver.  Of course I mean any non-adhesive non-conductive thermal paste, or which Arctic Silver is just a common example.
It is very unlikely that you can remove the HSF and CPU from the socket as a single assembly, because an installed HSF will block movement of the retaining latch release for the CPU.
Of course, the biggest difference in cooling effectiveness would be provided by a better HSF.  There are many good options in the $30-$40 range.
As long as you used a recommended thermal interface substance, and not an actual adhesive (paste can mean either!), you should have little difficulty separating the HSF from the CPU.
