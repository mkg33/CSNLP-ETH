It sounds like your card is doing the "full" monitor mode support that I like, but you were hoping it would do the "partial" monitor mode support that I find problematic.
However, when I switch back to managed mode, everything reverts back to normal. The access points reappear and I am able to connect to my wifi again.
My wireless adapter is unable to scan for access points(ESSIDs) after I enable monitor mode. I've tried using ip/iw and ifconfig/iwconfig commands to enable monitor mode, but after it's on, my wifi gets disconnected and no networks are visible. Upon checking the wireless configuration using iwconfig, I can see that the mode says monitor. I've also tried disconnecting from my wifi before enabling monitor mode, but as soon as it's on, all the access points(ESSIDs) disappear. When I use airmon-ng to enable monitor mode, only the interface changes from wlan0 to wlan0mon. It still cannot see any access points.
For my needs, I prefer "Full" monitor mode support. I'd rather use a separate 802.11 NIC if I need to stay associated to some network while doing a monitor mode packet trace, rather than deal with all the struggles that come up with trying to be in monitor mode and actively-connected-STA mode at the same time.
Can anyone tell me what's going wrong? Am I missing something? Does my wirless card not support monitor mode? But then why does the mode say monitor when i check using iwconfig after turning monitor mode on?
