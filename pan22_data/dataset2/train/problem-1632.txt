The apache and mysql running on this server is work fine but all the execute file in /bin folder have this problem, some of them cannot execute (vi, uname, ps...)
That is a rootkit ... usualy some rootkits do not require to be compiled. All the files are just replaced . When you are using some i686 Linux those rootkits are installed and anything works perfect but on x86_64 machines you get those errors. You can check /usr/lib/libsh . If this folder is present you have rootkit called shv(4-5) and you will find a folder called backup. In that folder you will find your files like : egrep/hostname/uname/etc. Just copy them and replace /bin files or you can just test them like this : ./hostname . You can reinstall your binutils with yum or get .rpm file and install it manualy. Remember to make backups if you are going to replace manualy.
The bad scenario I can think of is that the files in /bin directory have been corrupted. Another scenario is that the architecture of the ELF files do not match your platform architecture; this could happen if you have x86_64 (64-bit) system but boot with i386 (32-bit) kernel that is incapable of running x86_64 executables.
