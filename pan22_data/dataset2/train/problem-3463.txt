The optimal scenario for me would be to plug in my old router on the second floor (and another one I bought for the first floor) to any of the rj45 outlets, so it can extend the wireless coverage (with the same SSID), and communicate with the main router/modem via the LAN connection. Furthermore, I would like my phone/clients to always choose the strongest signal, so my phone doesent hold grasp of that bad router/modem wireless connection even though I´m stand right next to the second router. The solution I imagine:
I have quite a simple home network setup, but can´t seem to find out how to make it work. What I have is this: A main router/modem located in a small "shed", with a static IP from my ISP. This router/modem has access to a panel with rj45 outlets that covers most of my home. If I connect my pc to an outlet, let´s say on the second floor, I get around 300Mbps - which is what I pay for. This router/modem also has a wireless feature. But the problem is that it only covers most of the first floor, and I would like Wi-Fi coverage all over my home of course.
I´ve read about Access points, bridging and WDS. My old router only supports WDS which, as I understand, only connects to the main router via wireless. So how is this possible? Do I need to buy another type of networking equipment to achieve this?
While there's no reason you couldn't implement the scenario you outline, you're really implementing technology using an old paradigm. The new hotness in home wireless networking is 'mesh' wireless. There are a number of new solutions, but google has a solution called "google wifi" that works pretty well. Rather than have a small number of strongly powered APs, you have a larger number of lightly powered devices that handle that seamless handoffs of your devices. It sounds like your problem could be solved by that type of hardware.
