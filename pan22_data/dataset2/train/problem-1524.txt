Set up your networking so that the default routing table puts traffic via eth1. Then add a rule that traffic originating from eth0 ip address uses the routing table for eth0. Then use the wget option --bind-address to bind to the eth0 ip address.
You can do this with IPTables.  You need to specify a prerouting (or was it forwarding) rule which says anything which is on port 80 should be routed to eth0, and then in the regular routing rules default to eth1.
I dare say the solution might have something to do with iptables but I've no experience with it so would appreciate all help.
First, learn about routing tables and multiple default routes: http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.rpdb.multiple-links.html
I need to limit it so that any outgoing http requests it makes (ie through wget) only go through eth0 and all other traffic goes through eth1.
Look at shorewall.  Documentation for the masq file seems to cover what you want.  You will need to ensure that you don't route between the two interfaces. 
Look in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/xxx and check for the Listen Directive. I'm afraid I don't use Ubunutu, so take a look at
If you're not using wget which can specify the binding address, an alternative is to set up a www proxy and bind that (only) to the eth0 address, then use that proxy.
I've got two network interfaces on an Ubuntu machine which go out to two different networks but both have internet gateways. 
I would say edit Apache, to "listen" to a specific IP address. By Default, Apache listens to all IP addresses that your machine may have.
