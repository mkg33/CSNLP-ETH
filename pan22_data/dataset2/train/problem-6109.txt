Finally figured it out.  We wired up another PC to the router (A linksys Wireless-G router) originally, the second PC was connected via wireless.  Turns out the router had decided to stop forwarding HTTP packets via the physical ports, but NOT the wireless.  After a reboot of router, the internet returned!
I have seen malware do the same thing after you remove it, it makes sense, I consider Norton Products to be malware  :-)
You probably shouldn't have messed around in the registry, as it might have done more harm than good.  The only time I muck around in the registry is for something very specific or when I clean a computer's registry using ccleaner.  Go ahead and try that tool.
Do any alternate browsers work normally?  This will determine if there's a problem with just IE or a problem with connectivity.
Also the easiest and never thought of solution is that there may have been a bug in the Norton uninstallation and it could've disabled your adapter.
Moral of the Story: If everything you tried didn't work, it might be something completely different. :)
Open the network sharing center by right clicking the network icon and going to open network and sharing center.
Run the Norton Removal Tool. After running it and having deleted all Norton programs, reboot your computer. Run the tool a second time and reboot again.
Windows 7 comes with a very good troubleshooter, just click the network icon in the notification tray and it'll check for any problems with connectivity.
Then go to Change Adapter settings in the left sidebar, then locate your adapter, and check if it is enabled.
Select the Delete personal settings check box if you would like to remove browsing history, search providers, Accelerators, home pages, and InPrivate Filtering data.
The recovery procedure will wipe the laptop and restore it to how it was when it was shipped from the factory.  All your data will be lost.
