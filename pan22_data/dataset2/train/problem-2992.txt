For laptops, look into docking stations. These almost always provide at least two video ports for the purpose of multiple monitors.
however.. nowadays only really cheap cards has only one monitor connector! with 50$ you can buy a "decent" card (if you don't play games with your pc!)
Two monitors is simple for modern computers to accomplish. If you want more than two you will need to make sure you get a graphics card strong enough to support it, as well as the proper connectors.
if it has a separate graphic card check the model of the card; then look at the card specifications (note that "nvidia gt630" isn't enough.. producers use that chipset on different boards!!!).
if you're buying a desktop computer check the graphic card: if it's integrated it (usually) doesn't support multimonitor configurations.
if you're buying a laptop: usually they have one dvi/vga connector for the 2nd monitor and the integrated monitor.. 
For two monitors though, Just make sure that it includes the necessary ports. Most bargain PCs only provide one Video out port. If this is the case you will need to purchase either an internal graphics card with the needed ports, or buy a USB->Video converter (cheaper, but not as nice of a picture.)
