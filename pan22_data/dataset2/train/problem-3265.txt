wget saved file to C:\Users\myuserid\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin  even though I ran it from a different directory.
When using wget on windows, you first need to open a command prompt so that it will stay open, by doing Start->Run, typing cmd, and hitting enter.  Then, use the cd command to change to the directory where you wish to store the picture, and perform your wget.  By default, it will store the pictures in your current directory unless you specify a different location.
Why it works differently depending on location when it's run I do not know but it's a solution to at least put files initially somewhere more accessible.
The other answers should be correct, but there is also the possibility of finding the image file (lang2.JPG was your example, above) using Windows' search feature.
Also, with that command line you should be able to specify just the base URL, not a specific picture, to download all the images.  That's what the -A option specifies.
However when I copied the entire bin folder, including .dll files, onto my desktop and then retried downloading a file from within that folder via command prompt it worked correctly and put the file within the wget folder on my desktop.
I have discovered if you leave the wget installation in its default location it does save the file in:
