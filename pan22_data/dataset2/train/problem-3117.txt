It seems that my dump actually contained mysql.user data, so that after loading the database, I could only connect with these distant login information.
I also can access to phpmyadmin with the same root user, and confirm that the database was properly loaded.
I've crawled many related topics accross the web, and couldn't come up with that particular situation, and all the approaching topics solutions start with connecting with root user - which I can't do.
Taking a look at this mysql.user table, it appears that these login were specified, not for localhost, but the distant host.
Did you load a new mysql.user table when you loaded your new data? Sounds like you wiped your previous root user. Take a look at the script and see. Also, as @RickJames suggested, you might want to look here.
After setting up apache, php, mysql, pma and got eveything running, I open the mysql console with root user.
I'm trying to set a local dev environment on a Debian VirtualBox and am now stuck for days with the following situation.
