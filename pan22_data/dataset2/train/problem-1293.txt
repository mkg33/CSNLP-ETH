But you, as an AD administrator, have absolutely no way of knowing if an application is talking to a specific DC because it actually looked it up the proper way, or because someone configured it statically.
One thing you could do is remove the A record and the other DNS Mnemonics.  This would result in the usual DNS records for a DC not being registered, and not returned for normal authentication or group policy connections.  Then run a packet capture to identify where any traffic may be originating from.  
This is typically what is done for a hub-and-spoke topology.  For a spoke site, you would not want the DC to register DNS records so that only the clients in that site would connect to it.  After you configure this, normal authentication traffic should be minimized for the domain controller.  
How to optimize the location of a domain controller or global catalog that resides outside of a client's site
Whoever/whatever wants to talk to Active Directory should be able to find a domain controller using the proper process. But some application developers are definitely foolish enough to want a statically-defined DC; well, it's their fault, and they should pay for it.
