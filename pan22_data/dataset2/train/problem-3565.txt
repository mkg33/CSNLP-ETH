I have a network share that is several levels deep. For one particular folder, I would like to assign different rights than the default access that the shared folder is allowing. However this does not seem possible, as all of the child rights and inherited from the share rights. So if the share rights set the share to read-only can I not override the permissions in a child folder to allow write access?
Share permissions sit on top of the NTFS permissions. You need share and NTFS permission to do anything to a file that is accessed through said share. So it is quite permissible to give "Everyone" full RW access at the share level, and then control what they can actually do at the NTFS level. Which is what you will need to do in this case.
That is correct.  Share permissions trump any file permissions.  This is standard.  Most files are RW for Everyone but then restricted at the share level.  If the file permissions overrode the share, there would be no point in share permissions.
Your best option is to share the subfolder with it's own share and share permissions and allow users to access it that way.
