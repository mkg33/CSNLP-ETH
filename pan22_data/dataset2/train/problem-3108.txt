You can try adding the admin group to the instance-specific security groups.  The section in the rules for a source IP address allows you to use the name of your other security groups.  This is how you can get systems in different security groups to communicate as well.
As an example, I've setup a group called "admin", which allows administrative access from my IP. I added the "admin" group as the source to each of my instance security groups. However, I still can't access the instances from my IP without adding the rules directly to the instance's group.
Am I missing something? Although it seems a multi-tier security architecture should be possible, it doesn't seem to be working.
Everything is assigned ssh and then each server get's what is  required to do it's job. So one server has ssh, application and db so 1521, 42000-42300 & 22 are all opened.
Each of my instances has its own Security Group, which I only want to use for rules specific to an instance. I'd like to keep any rules which apply to multiple instances in a separate Security Group, which can then be assigned to instance Security Groups as necessary.
