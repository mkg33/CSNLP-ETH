As a side note, I modified the PKL script to support the odd combination of Korean Hangul input and Colemak layout. With the default PKL install, Korean input is horribly broken because it expects a QWERTY layout...
Explanation: The input language (keyboard layout) is not global; it is set on a per-application basis. When an application loses input focus, Windows stores the current input language. When that application regains input focus, Windows tries to switch back to the input language it previously stored for that application. I am not sure about middle click, but the Windows key and Alt-Tab definitely induce the input focus to be switched to a different application, and thus potentially switch the input language.
If you use only two layouts and one of them includes a key for switching to/from QWERTY (like Korean and Hebrew), uninstall all other layouts. Just use the single layout's ability to switch to/from QWERTY. Note the layout's QWERTY input state is still stored and automatically switched between different applications. I've used this method to switch between QWERTY and Korean input in a sane, predictable way.
The above settings add the Hebrew layout and the Alt + Left Shift keyboard short-cut you are used to (I would uninstall all other layouts and keyboard shortcuts on Windows so they don't interfere, or use different keyboard shortcuts)
Portable Keyboard Layout (PKL) is used for supporting alternate input languages on (other) computers without admin access. It maintains the same input language state across all applications. A keyboard shortcut for switching between layouts can be configured. Works from a USB drive. Free and open-source.
