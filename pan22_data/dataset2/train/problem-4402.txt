I'd take a look at the Brocade ServerIron ADX 1008 or 1016 - either should be more than adequate for your needs, but all the specs are up on the site.
Travis mentioned the barracuda solution.  I have not use the barracuda load balancers, but we do have their spam firewalls.  I can tell you from a usability and support standpoint that we have had very good experience with barracuda.
F5 is the market leader in this segment and Cisco also has a pretty nice solution in their ACE platform.  I've worked with both and I would go with F5 from an ease of use perspective.  As is normal, the Cisco solution is good but the UI leaves something to be desired.
Another player (actually the biggest Enterprise-class player) is F5 Networks. I bet they're considerable overkill for you though.
We are using cisco gear for hardware load balancing.  Currently we are using the CSS-11000 but are shortly migrating that to an ACE.  They handle ridiculous amounts of traffic and do SSL acceleration.  If you are already using cisco gear and have people familiar with that these would be a good compliment to that environment.
You are going need a much larger budget (you have $15k for 2 units you said?) for a hardware accelerator solution.  I would suggest pursuing a budget of round $25-30k per unit for this type of solution.   15k might get you one unit, but would probably not include the SSL hardware acceleration you are looking for.
I have had excellent results with the Brocade ServerIron ADX series. They're particularly nice because the interface is similar to Cisco IOS, and you can have 2 of them in a High-Availability configuration if you want (though personally, I've never had one go down).
You can look at the Barracuda Load Balancers, and Also at the WebApp Firewall if you are looking for more security for your SSL connections. 
In the past, I have looked into Coyote point for some virtualization balancing and I know they have web load balancers too, so it might be worth looking into.
