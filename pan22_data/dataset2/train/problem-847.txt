Note that accomplishing what you want will very unlikely be as simple as sending a simple request with specific POST data, and may involve multiple domains and multiple protocols (services may talk JSON, raw XML, another XML-based protocol, or another protocol entirely).  Each request may need to have a unique element, such as a request key, to work.  Typically applications expect you to have logged in, so you need to issue requests emulating that as well, and there are many ways to make it difficult to do automatically.  
wget (available in Windows via Cygwin) can send POST data with a request.  You must have previously captured it, or create it on the fly, you can use a web proxy such as Burp to snoop on an existing HTTP/HTTPS session and capture POST data of a request.
In short: I am looking for an app that can work as a POST recorder and can replay prerecorded requests.
I was wondering if it is possible to record and replay outbound POST requests from a Windows PC, and replay them. For example, if I have a POST recorder, and I send a request from Skype to make a call, can I record that request and replay it without Skype running?
