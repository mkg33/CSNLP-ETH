Once I do that, I can add A records, AAAA records, CNAME records, etc. I gather from what I've looked up about this topic that I have to create an A record to point to my VPS's static IP. I have no idea how to get the top level domain to point to dreamhost now though. Can someone explain what I should do? A primer on these record types or a link to one would be great..
Now although the VPS is (I think) set up well enough for now, I'm a bit confused about how to manage the DNS bits. Specifically here, I have a domain registered at another site, nettigrity. I'd like the top level domain to point to a static site on dreamhost, so till now its nameservers were set to the dreamhost nameservers. Now I want to put up some rails apps as subdomains. To manage DNS settings on nettigrity, I have to set the nameservers of the domain to interactivedns.com nameservers.
So here's what I have configured - I have a shared hosting account at dreamhost, and I've also just set up a VPS at intoVPS. The shared account is intended for mostly static sites and I'll be using the VPS to deploy rails apps.
IntoVPS, where my VPS is set up is, uses 'Hypanel' which has a 'My DNS Zones' section, where they provide their own nameservers. Could I use this instead of the registrars domain management service? Could one be better than the other for any reason?
