Comparatively, Dell asks only for $80 for the same upgrade on the Vostro line (as of 9/24 on Dell Direct, even less markup on the reseller site). What is this important to note? Because it suggests that the cost of the upgrade is a high profit item for Apple (higher profit suggests less value for the consumer).
To put things into perspective.  Imagine a process that takes 20 seconds.  It will take 19 with the faster CPU. 
Depends on the CPU upgrade.  IMHO going from a 2.93ghz to a 3.06ghz is negligible.   We're looking at a 4% performance difference (unless the chip is from a different family altogether and has other benefits besides clockspeed - bus speed, cache size, etc etc)
For macs and PCs, CPU speed these days doesn't really matter. If you want to speed your computer up, get the most RAM possible or solid-state-disks (SSD) budget permitting. 
The difference between 2.93GHz and 3.06GHz will be imperceptible. I'd spend the $150 on something else like iLife '09, which is a great Office equivalent on the mac.
From my experience, there is no noticeable difference on CPU speed. I would rather spend on memory and it does make big difference if you use Adobe CES and lots of video editing (iMovie).
