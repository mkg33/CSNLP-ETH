I recently obtained an ASUS Transformer Mini, which is characterised as a 2-in-1 laptop and tablet PC, runs Windows 10, and which I mainly intended to use for creating and editing Microsoft Word documents.
The tablet ships with Microsoft Office Mobile; however, because it has a screen size of exactly 10.1 inches, it seems that the version of Office Mobile that it ships with allows for reading, but not creating or editing Word documents (only devices with a screen size of less than 10.1 inches have editing capabilities).
I already have the desktop media for Office 2016 at hand. Can I simply load this media onto a USB drive to install the Office 2016 suite to my tablet, or will my only option be to subscribe to and use the cloud-based Office 365 suite?
My research so far has led me to believe that Office Mobile and Office 365 are the only versions of Microsoft Office that can run on tablet devices, and that the desktop Office 2016 suite is incompatible with my device even though my device also functions as a PC. At best, the information out there on this is confusing.
