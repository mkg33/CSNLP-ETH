Of course the last note, I strongly suggest you reconsider your usage of sshpass.  If at all possible you should be looking at using key-based authentication instead.
Running rdesktop from the remote machine might not be the best option though.  You basically have all the overhead of an X11 session, plus all the overhead of a RDP session.  You might be better of using the port forwarding features of SSH, then run a local rdesktop/freerdp client.  That way you can skip the slowness that is typical for remote X11 sessions.
That command indicates to me that you probably don't have X11 forwarding happening automatically.  But you seem to be trying to run an X11 application from a remote system.
If you plan on running rdesktop from the remote system, then you need the SSH server to support X11 forwarding, you need the xauth package installed on the remote.  You need to either adjust your ssh client config /etc/ssh/ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config or pass -X to your ssh command line to enable X11 forwarding from the client.
