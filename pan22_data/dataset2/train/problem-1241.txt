To validate where is your home drive and home path is just execute SET command in CMD and browse for HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH. For our case, we want to ensure that it's D:\ and \Users\xxxx
For our case, we are not using roaming user profile but we have found that our AD users have specified Home Drive in network drive. So we just changed the AD user home drive to “Local” (with no drive specified) 
When loggging into our domain, after entering account credentials the log in process takes around 1-2 minutes before it gets past the User Profile Service, the rest of the process takes 2-3 secs. 
then only you can follow the steps to get faster user profile log in in your laptop or desktop systems:
For example if your internal DNS IP is 192.168.1.16 and 192.168.1.17. You can't use something like google DNS 8.8.8.8. So make sure you use internal DNS servers only and that those DNS servers are Active Directory aware. Having external DNS on your Workstations (even as 2nd IP) can cause serious delays (exactly what you are seeing now).
Hi friends i am happy to give my wonderful tip for  speedup  user profile under the domain controller.
This effects all machines running Windows 7 Enteprise 32-bit and is on fairly high spec laptops (SSD drives, i5 2.93Ghz CPU, 4GB memory). 
It is taking bit long in logging becuase it is going to find profile on server. Assign your server IP as DNS on Windows 7 pc. So it will faster able to search server and logging process will be even faster.
