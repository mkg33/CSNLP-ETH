The sysstat package contains the sar utility.  Sar is a extremely configurable system "profiler", for lack of a better term, that collects various statistics at predefined intervals (cron).  These are stored in binary files, one for each day, that are typically rotated weekly, but that is configurable.  The sar program can be used to pull the statistics out of these files, and those results can easily be graphed with any office program or gnuplot (my personal preference).
Either MRTG or Cacti.  Cacti is a pain to set up, but gives some very pretty graphs.  MRTG is easy to set a basic plot up, but for anything pretty or complicated, it's pretty tough.
Munin is another nice RRD-based tool that's very easy to set up; the default network stats are quite basic, but it's easy to add additional plugins.  I've attached a copy of the daily and weekly stats on one of my servers; you also get monthly and yearly stats on a different page.
If you don't want to set it up, or just need something simpler, you can use iptables to record data transfer. 
You want MRTG which is a network monitoring tool, its the thing that produces all the network graphs you see around the web (with rdtool to turn the numbers into pictures)
I used mrtg, it's a very nice solution, and there are other tool that seems to be interesting and that give a lot of information about traffic named ntop a network probe, here find a link about installing ntop on CentOS
