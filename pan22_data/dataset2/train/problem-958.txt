Refreshes happen automatically under the two circumstances detailed in the document, and there is nothing in place to force a refresh:
There are also other features such as DHCP snooping which will build a database of MAC addresses and the DHCP assigned IP addresses.
The reason I'm interested in a way to force a refresh is two-fold. For one when a device is unplugged, I would expect it to disappear, but it doesn't. Also, for a switch where I've just enabled IPDT, not all devices plugged in appear immediately (though given enough time they do show up).
Rather than changing the probe count, you could shorten the interval. Sending 255 probes every 30 seconds seems like a lot; it is nearly 10 per second.
You could get a close calculation for the number of time a port was probed by showing how long the port was up, divide that by the probe interval, and multiply that by the number of probes configured per interval.
If what you have doesn't suffice, you can always request added feature from Cisco, although your requested features may or may not make it into a future release. Cisco may also share a roadmap of planned enhancements to you.
I don't think you are going to find exactly like what you want. The document to which you refer is the documentation; there's not a lot to this feature.
I am interested in finding the IP addresses assigned to devices attached to each interface on a Cisco 2960X switch. It seems like IPDT is exactly what I'm looking for. However it seems like the refresh interval is a bit odd.
