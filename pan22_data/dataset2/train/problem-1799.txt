1) In 'Wireless router' (192.168.1.1) main page, we need to find the router's 'WAN IP' (Top right corner), which should be something like 192.168.3.x.2) In 'Wireless router' (192.168.1.1) config page, we need to port forward the incoming request to the camera's IP/Port.3) (For access from internet) In 'Wired router' (192.168.3.1) config page, we need to port forward the incoming request to the 'Wireless router' (192.168.3.1) WAN IP 192.168.3.x and the port we've chosen in step 1.
Readout from netstat -a indicates you are doing it from the top PC. It is blocked from initiating any access to devices on the bottom by NAT in 192.168.1.1. You can access the top IP Cam from the bottom PC without problem.
This way the wireless router would be just a basic access point, bridging between wireless and wired networks. Then all your devices would be in the 192.168.1.x subnet, and the problems caused by Wireless router NAT would be avoided.
If I were you, I would disable the DHCP server in the Wireless router, and connect the Wired router to it via LAN port, not WAN port.
If you wish to keep your current setup, you would have to setup port forwarding just as suggested by the manufacturer's tech support.Note: I rearranged the order and reworded a bit based on your specified topology
To get it working for the top PC. Change the mode of your device from Router to Access Point. Then all will work.
Again this would be much simpler if you just disabled DHCP on your 'Wireless router' and didn't use the WAN port on that router and only used the switch ports and the WiFi.
