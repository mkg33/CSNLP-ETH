This is the same question as listed here in the Salesforce Community, but perhaps this community will be better suited to answering it.
I am having a strange issue where only certain images do not download on Outlook Desktop, specifically from email sent with Salesforce. When I click "Download Images" like I normally would do, instead of seeing the images, I see a small icon with a red x. This article describes my issue and I have tried the fix listed (verify that you have the appropriate image cache location in regedit), but it did not resolve my issue. Additionally, most of the time images load properly, only when sent from Salesforce do I have this issue. I can view the image properly on Outlook mobile and Gmail, and if I save the message as HTML and open in Chrome I can see the image, so I know that the image is there and working properly. Are there any Outlook settings I should check in order to fix this?
