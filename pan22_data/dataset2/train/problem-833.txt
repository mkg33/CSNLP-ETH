You can use something like autojump. Autojump lets you quickly jump to frequently visited directories with the j command.
Is there a way to go to any directory from any other directory directly? For example, lets say that I'm at root and I wanted to go directly to currentProject without doing:
For instance, once you've cd'd into your currentProject directory a few times, you can jump to it like this:
As Wuffers mentioned above, autojump that can do this for you.  It stores a database of previously visited directories and lets you use a command like j <a few letters in the directory path> to move to that directory.  There is an additional command for autojump named jc that should meet your requirements.  jc lets you jump to a previously visited subdirectory of the current working directory.  So you only have to visit the directory once for this to work until you purge the autojump database.  Also, you can also add it directly instead with autojump --add DIR (perhaps building the add list from a directory tree listing if needed).
In bash and *csh, there is the builtin commands 'pushd' and 'popd' that allow you to push directories onto a Last In First Out stack (with pushd [directory]) and then quickly change to the top directory in the stack using 'popd'.  So, depending on how you loaded the stack, you might be able to quickly navigate between directories suitably well for this to be functional for you.
