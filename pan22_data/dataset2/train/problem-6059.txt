If that doesn't help I'm afraid I can't offer much more suggestion... I have a bit of experience getting wifi to work on desktops but none with that specific card.
On my keyboard F2 has the wireless tower symbol and that is not working when I press Fn+F2. However,F1 has 'Z' symbol referring to snooze state so when I tried it Fn+F1 laptop goes to a quick snooze and when press power button to wake it up, voila wireless is working ! and I should do that every time booting into Linux.
Turn the pc off and back on, it should work. If it does not, (unlikely, but never mind), issue these two commands:
Wifi is hit-and-miss in Linux unfortunately. I realise that this is a long shot but have you tried something like the following?
If you search for Atheros AR9485WB-EG on WikiDevi you reach this page where you are told you need as a driver ath9k from backports. This means your version of ath9k is most likely outdated, and we must install a new one. I'll walk you through it.
Usually though, in Linux Mint, if there are additional drivers available, then the Menu -> Preferences -> Additional Drivers utility will tell you about it. If it finds it there then you will obviously need to plug in wired to install it.
