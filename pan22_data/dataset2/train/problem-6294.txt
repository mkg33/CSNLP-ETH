If you bind a socket to 127.0.0.1:8200 then only clients running locally will be able to access it and only with http://127.0.0.1:8200 or http://localhost:8200 (or a dns or hosts file entry that points to 127.0.0.1).
A socket bound to x.x.x.x:8200 will only be available through http://x.x.x.x:8200 or a dns or hosts file entry that points to that.
Binding a socket to 127.0.0.1 does not automatically make it available on the ethernet interface as well.
Every IP address on the system is independent and can be bound to by sockets separately, with the exception of the special address 0.0.0.0 which indicates to the OS to bind the socket to all interfaces.
It is possible for each door to take you into the same room or they could take you into a different room. It is also possible to lock one door and not the other.
If you have two (or more) websites you can bind them to separate addresses. (That is equivalent to having each door going into separate rooms).
Slightly inaccurate. It may do so. Equally well it may not bring up any website and it is even possible to display an different internal website from what you get when you use your x.x.x.x address.
You can also specify the website to bind to one address only. (That is equivalent to locking all doors except one.)
When you configure a website, you specify which addresses to bind to and quite often the answer is all addresses. (That is equivalent to have all doors taking you into the one room)
An example of how both references work,  my Windows 7 computer has IIS installed, when I go into IIS Manager and right click on Default Web Site, it gives me a 'Edit Bindings' menu option. Selecting that bring up a list of bindings. I have only one, but for IP Address it has * which means IIS listens on all my ip addresses.
127.0.0.1 points to your own machine, but that doesn't mean it will behave the same way once it reaches your machine
