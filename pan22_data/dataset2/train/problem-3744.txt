I'm attempting to install Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit from a USB flash drive on my new PC, but my SSD is not being recognized and the AHCI driver is failing. Whenever I boot into the Windows 7 Installer I'm prompted with Select the driver to be installed.
I downloaded the On-Board SATA AHCI/RAID Drivers from MSI USA, and selected the Hide drivers that are not compatible with hardware on this computer which left one driver to be installed: Intel(R) 100 Series/C230 Chipset Family SATA AHCI Controller or intel_rst_skl_w10\WIN_ALL_14.6.0.1029\f6flpy-x64\iaAHCIC.inf but it fails with The device driver could not be installed. Contact your vendor for an updated driver. What's going on here? Do I need to contact MSI or Mushkin for support?
Your choices are to either install Windows 7 from DVD or modify your usb drive with the drivers.  Asus has a write up here:  http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/LGA1151/Z170-K/DE164_100_Series_Windows_7_Setup_Guide_print.pdf
A new link for the Asus boards with an updated bios shows a new setting that should help: asus dot com/support/FAQ/1013649/

The challenge you are experiencing with the new 170 series (intel 100/C230 chipset) is due to Windows 7 installer iso's not directly supporting xHCI usb mode.
