/var/log/messages (or your distro's equivalent) should tell you the specifics of what command was run when and as which user.
Then inspect the file when it comes around, and either modify your script(if you can) to set the environment properly, or write a short wrapper script that your crontab will call.
As you can see there isn't anything particularly special about this environment.  At least on Debian/Ubuntu it all is run as the root account.
If you restart cron, then the first time it runs(if from /etc/crontab or /var/spool/cron/$USER) it will make a note of it in /var/log/cron. Otherwise it will just note that cron.hourly ran
On my RHEL 5.1 system, the PATH environment variable is set from /etc/crontab. All that stuff up at the top is stuff that's fed into the environment.
When I write cron scripts at the very start of the script I always set my PATH and other environment variables i will be using, so I can be certain that it will work correctly in any environment.
Never assume there is anything in the environment. Always code defensivly. You have a whole file to put whatever environment set up stuff you want in there. Use it.
Not much other the portability, the last time I checked (in Debian) it was recommended to put stuff in cron.hourly (and the others) and not directly into crontab if you wanted to create a package with your stuff.
