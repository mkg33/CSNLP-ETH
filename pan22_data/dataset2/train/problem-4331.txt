OpenSSL considers original/single DES and triple-DES different algorithms. That cipherstring disables single-DES, but not triple-DES; in fact the +3DES explicitly adds triple-DES algorithms at the end of the list, thus with lower priority if you use server priority. Similarly, you can select AES128 suites separately from AES256 suites even though both use the AES algorithm; in that case there is also an option 'AES' that selects both groups.
OpenSSL uses different ciphersuite names than the standard ones in the RFCs and many (most?) other implementations, excepting the recently added and differently structured TLS1.3 'suites'. See the man page for ciphers on your system or on the web at the heading 'CIPHER SUITE NAMES' about halfway down and/or my answer at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36463429/map-ssl-tls-cipher-suites-and-their-openssl-equivalents for the forward algorithm. Going in reverse for your values:
(Nit: you mean expand ... and expanded; expend[ed] means 'used up', like money that has been spent or a bomb that has exploded.)
