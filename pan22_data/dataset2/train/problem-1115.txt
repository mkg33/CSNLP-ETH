Getting notifications about incoming SMS on your PC: There's nothing for the iPhone I know of, sorry.
I'm unaware of any way to do that with the iPhone specifically. You may want to look into using Google Voice though - it doesn't have superb integrated on the iPhone (Google tried; Apple rejected their app), but it's easy to send/receive SMS on your computer using your google contacts, and the SMSs get forwarded to your iPhone, and replies on your iPhone get sent back through Google Voice so it's all still in the online interface. I believe you can also sync your iPhone's contacts list with your google account's, so it won't be as smooth as with Nokia, but should work.
HappyFingers iPhone app will do what you want.  Sync your iphone contacts to your windows pc, search and select contacts on your pc, dial and send sms messages from your pc.
I'm afraid but at the moment it is not possible to directly (i.e. without user interaction on the iPhone) send SMS with the iPhone (at least not that I know of any).
You could try out myPhoneDesktop ( http://www.myphonedesktop.com/ , I'm not affiliated with them, just a user) or something similar, but you still have to click on "Send" on your Phone...
There is this pair of apps - DiskAid on PC and FileApp on iPhone, lets you transfer some files and so on, see sms and contacts.
About reading the contacts list from your iPhone, I would advise you to sync it (e.g via Google, Yahoo or directly with iTunes and your local list).
Well, I have not the best solution, but it works and is for free. You need to do some thing on the phone though.
Anyway, write all you need in text file on PC, save as unicode, drop that file to iPhone, open, select text you need, copy it, paste it in sms and send it.. saves some typing at least..
