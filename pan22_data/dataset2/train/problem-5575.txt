On windows 10, windows have a 7-8 pixel invisible border. As such, setting a windows position to (0,0) actually (visual) sets it to (7,0). To fix this instead have been setting the position to (-7,0).
Try and uninstall the Auto Scroll Utility from Lenovo, and see if that resolves your issue, as this isn't a standard Windows feature.
Having used a Lenovo work machine before, they often ship with some software pre-installed called Auto Scroll Utility.
Having been very confused what they could have been, I noticed the behaviour of moving my mouse to the edge of the screen causes the window to "float" the opposite direction to the mouse, which to be honest was quite helpful, but I believe that is what is causing your issues.
Basically the problem is is that when windows have negative coordinates, are focused, and the mouse is moved over that edge, it pushes the window back to a positive coordinate. This also happens with an autohidden taskbar, it will push the window so it is not under the taskbar when opened.
