The benefit of doing this is full customization for how it works and the limitations being your own hardware's limitations.
Have you tried SugarSync? You can share (and I believe sync) files across users. I'm not sure if it uses LAN when possible for shared folders however.
You may find an ftp server and a good client sufficient for your needs if you're willing to run your own server.
Additionally, while most FTP software is intended for manual file uploading and download, there is software like FTP Synchronizer (linked below) that automates the process like DropBox does.
Box.net and Windows Live Mesh are a couple other options, but would not meet your 5 GB file size requirement.
The downside is that setting up your own ftp server and showing the family how to use the client of your choice will require much more work and knowledge on your part than a cloud-sync software like Dropbox does.
DropBox is probably your best bet for automatic background syncing.  Plans are available for up to 100 GB, and there is no file size limit for files uploaded via the desktop application.
DropBox seems to be pretty popular right now, although you "only" get 2Gb for free. It supports Windows, Mac and Linux clients, as well as mobile platforms (Android, iPhone, BlackBerry).
