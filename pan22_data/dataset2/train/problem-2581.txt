In my experience, if the Barracuda is sitting on emails that it has already accepted, there are only a couple of things that can be wrong.
There is also the possibility that your Barracuda has a hardware problem and is fighting, say, a failing disk internally.  If that's the case then support will figure that out fairly quickly.
First, there might be a problem with the connection to the Exchange server, in that the exchange server isn't accepting them or is tempfailing them for some reason (like, for example, your store being full and unmounted).  THere are also some edge cases where if the Barracuda is validating inbound emails against your AD zone before accepting them and your connection to the AD server is broken, you can see a delay -- but the most common failure mode for this problem is that the mail gets perma-bounced rather than tempfailed or queued.
Second, there might be a flood of incoming messages/spam happening, and the Barracuda is spending time dealing with the flood rather than passing the messages along.  You can see this by looking at the statistics graphs on the admin page -- big spike means big traffic.
First off, if you have Barracuda support looking into it, let them do their thing.  They know what they are doing and have handled issues like this in the past.
