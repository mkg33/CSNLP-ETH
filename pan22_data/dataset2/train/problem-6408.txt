How about awstats? http://awstats.sourceforge.net/ This can run on the webserver itself, analyses the logfiles and generates graphs. There's a bit of a learning curve first time you set it up, but when you've done it once its fairly simply to install on a new system.
Sadly but the truth, after some hours of researching I wasn't able to find a fitting application. My hope is now on you.
I've used it before and it's the right mix of colourful graphs and monitoring. The have a hosted and non-hosted solution (Enterprise Agents) that may suit your needs.
Forget self hosting monitoring and use something like monitis - the big advantage is that it checks from multipel external (!) locations and is free / cheap, depending how you check.
I'm looking for a simple self hosted website monitoring tool. It should be somthing similar to watchmouse.com or pimgdom.com, with a nice UI, colorful charts and so on (Customers like that :)). At the moment we use Zabbix also for HTTP monitoring, but since now our hoster care about the hardware and software monitoring on the machine directly, we don't need Zabbix anymore. For pure http-monitoring zabbix or an other monitoring suite is really an overkill.
This way you not only know that your HTTP server works well (it can cehck outout of specific URL's) but also that you are reachable from various international locations.
