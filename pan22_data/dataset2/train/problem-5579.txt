Then, on the non core server, you must launch mmc, add the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security console, so you are prompt to specify a remote computer
I have two Server 2008 servers (both running as VMs in VMware). One is a Full Installation, and the other is a Server Core installation. I just installed Print Services on both of them. In Print Management on the Full server, I added the Server Core print server (so now two print servers are listed in Print Management). However, the icon for my Server Core print server has a red, down-pointing arrow (indicating that it is down, I suppose). And when I right-click it and click Add Printer, I get a message saying that access is denied.
2008 has firewall active by default, with inbound filtering. As a quick test, disable the firewall on the Core:
I've bunch of 2008 Servers that I manage throught my office laptop with this MMC Service, but to use it you've to activate it on the server first.
It should now be working. Then you can activate again the firewall and allow the blocked traffic (RPC i guess).
Can someone tell me how to bring up or check on the status of the Server Core print server. Obviously, I'm somewhat of a noob with this stuff. Thanks in advance...
