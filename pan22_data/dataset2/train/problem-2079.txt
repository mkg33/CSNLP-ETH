* Do you know about X11 forwarding? It gives you ability to run at server GUI applications and work with their GUI locally. All interaction with user and windows is translated through network. Usually one uses ssh with -X switch for it.
I've been using far manager under windows for about the last 6 years, and can't find anything like it for linux. mc is not a reasonable replacement, and gnome commander is not either. Are there any OFM veterans out there that can point me in the right direction for linux? 
There was an attempt to port FAR to Linux called "farsh" but it died before any code got written :))
I'd recommend you take a look at GNU Interactive Tools, or GNUit (it was git before Linus "reappropriated" the name...) Like other GNU tools, it has EMACS-like bindings throughout.
Try Krusader. The only disadvantage of it is graphical interface. So it will be difficult (but possible *) to use it remotely.
GNUit is console-based and extensible, and has the dual-pane file manager layout with a command line underneath with editing and memory. You might like it.
The usual (at least for me) way to handle such things is to get a VNC window over an ssh tunnel, and thereby use a full fledged desktop environment of my choise, be that GNOME, KDE, or any other. Something similar works on windows with RDP protocol (Remote Desktop). I believe the existence of these options make any Norton Commander clone obsolete.
