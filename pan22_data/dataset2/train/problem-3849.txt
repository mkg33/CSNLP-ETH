As a side note, having a full or almost full root partition is definitely not a good thing, and is sure to bring you troubles sooner or later; you really should make it larger and/or free some space in it.
With this command, all paths for all files in the package will be relative to /extra instead of /; but this has a downside: if the package includes files meant to be installed in /usr, /etc, or any other system directory, they'll end up in subdirectories of /extra, and this will most likely not work as it should.
Also, I don't believe Yum can do relocatable packages (at least I've never needed to, someone feel free to correct me), and in this case it wouldn't matter until you at least free some space up on /. You could do a du -sch / to find begin finding out which directories you can delete from, though I don't think this would help since your / partition is small enough to presume that it's a basic install with a GUI on top.
To be honest, you're going to be stuck here until you free up some space on /, or until you think of a way to chroot yourself in /extra. There are guides floating around on the internet on how to do that, since I've never actually done this myself.
Does anyone have physical access to this machine?  Honestly, you're saving yourself a lot of headache if you change the partitions around now, versus when you have important data on it.  If / is full before you start installing things, you're just going to have to deal with this issue over and over for the life of the server.  It pains me to even think about the difficulties you are going to see.
File installation paths are hardcoded in Yum packages, so you can't modify them; the only thing you can do is using the --installroot option to make Yum believe like it was chrooted:
That said, if you're using LVMs, you could resize / so that it's big enough to install some things on. However I don't think your setup has an LVM.
