4 final check the HOSTS file on the pc in case someone is having some fun with you and has hardwired a dns entry in....
Id set the IP of the client to an address on the same subnet which isnt being used. Also set the DNS of the client to point to the DC.
As others are saying, your client is probably picking up an address and DNS settings from your SOHO Router/Switch and it has not name entries for your DC.
After these two steps I was able to ping the DC using the FQDN successfully and was able to join the domain.
To join a domain the pc needs to find the srv records for the domain, Kerberos and ldap specifically.
ISP DNS is being query'd and not your DNS server regardless if you input your static IP in preferred DNS in TCP settings.I wrestled with this for a few days before being able to piece together various info on the net. I have built small networks before and this problem had me stumped. The only difference was this network was at home lab. Made sense that it did not work with my Uverse because the options are so limited on my modem. Not sure if you have to contact your ISP Host to make changes, but I just created a host only environment, cutting out the access to the internet and any need to query ISP DNS and the clients connect without a problem. This solved my issue but you may have the need to connect to the internet. If your ISP can not make adjustments, possibly bridge a VM router or use Windows DHCP server to pass traffic.
