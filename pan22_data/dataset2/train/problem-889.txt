What I found - sharing notebooks for data scientists is a not a desirable format for communication. Many of them prefer IDE like Spider/RStudio or just a text editors (I know a few data scientists who use vi).
You might just share code by your source control and data by cloud storages. It will increase flexibility.
Airbnb recently open sourced their internal data science knowledge repository: https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo
I've recently open sourced a tool which combines code, data, and the dependencies between data and code to a single environment and makes your data science project reproducible: DVC or dataversioncontrol.com (there is a tutorial).
JupyterHub does not provide version control system nor facilitates sharing of Notebooks. You mentioned yourself limitation of Binder.
In essence, I think it meets all requirements you posted. On top of that it delivers richer visualisation capabilities and plethora of other features (works with Shiro, Knox, Kerberos - secure Spark anyone?). 
With DVC tool you can just share your project by Git, sync data to S3 by a single DVC command. If some of your data scientists decide to change the code at any stage of your project then the final result could be easily reproduced by a single command dvc repro data/target_metrics.txt.
You can protect the access with ssh, and the hosted files could be the git repository you want, with different linux (or whatever) user access. You'll need your own server. 
The only self-hosted solution I know is the paid Anaconda Enterprise cloud setup, https://anaconda.org/about. The other solutions I am aware of are not self-hostable!
