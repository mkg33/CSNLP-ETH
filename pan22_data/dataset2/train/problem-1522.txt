The advice given by user171212 will probably work (it'll stop the service) but it's not the right way to control services. For sysV init files, it would be more correct to stop the service and remove the relevant links from the /etc/rc.d/rc*.d but the correct way to do it is via the chkconfig command. Indeed that "Security Metrics" recommends such an approach makes me think that any advice / service they provide should be treated with extreme prejudice.
Double check the IP/hostname they're scanning.  Does it match yours?  Do an external scan of your own, with nmap, to see if the port is open:
I'm desperately trying to pass a Security Metrics test, I've been trying for a few days, but I 'm always left with the same problem:
I've been trying to close port 139 and 445 with both iptables and fuser -k, but it still reports as open (to Security Metrics at least).
The first thing to check is if it really is netbios. As growse says netstat -natp will show you which program is listening on the port. If it is nmbd, then you need to shutdown the server and make sure it never starts again (i.e. uninstall everything you don't need). 
If you still have difficulties, enlist the help of your web host (if you use one).  Most web hosts will help you secure your site per the PCI scan vendor's specifications, or at least point in the direction to get it fixed.
If you're trying to achieve PCI-DSS compliance and are stuck on this, then I think you need more help then a few answers here. There are some very good, free online training materials - I would recommend the rute as a good starting point. You should also read and apply the SANS Linux checklist.
