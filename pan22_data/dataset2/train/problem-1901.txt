dban is very good. It can also wipe disks to a US Department of Defense standard. That should be fairly secure. :)
Big Fire - seriously, it's probably not much less environmentally damaging that just throwing them in the garbage and it will 100%, absolutely, positively kill all data in one handy way.
I use dban for mass wiping of disks, it supports all the major overwrite standards and has very good hardware support.  However, modern research seems to indicate that a single zero pass wipe is sufficient for data destruction.  In that case, you might as well just use a linux system and issue the following command:
Eraser is a great free program that lets you wipe to a variety of different paranoia levels and standards.  It also adds secure file deletion secure file move to the right-click menu in explorer... very handy if you do this stuff regularly.
This will overwrite the floppy with all zeroes.  Change the zero to urandom for a pass of random characters.
Try wipe , can get it from Knoppix or Ubuntu or most major linux distros. I would recommend running it on the disk rather than a partition if you can for added paranoia.
