As lynxman stated in his answer, an unconfigured L3 switch should behave as a L2 switch. As womble stated in his answer, a second-hand switch may have a configuration from the previous owner. Here are my thoughts on the problem:
Unless you specifically configure a layer 3 switch to do some customized actions it should behave by default as close as possible to a layer 2 switch, and it also has some added perks on top of that so it's always an interesting addition.
The fix assuming you know this link will never, ever form a loop in your network is to enable "fast link" or "spanning tree portfast" on the port.
When a port is first enabled, the switch needs to interrogate what is connected to that port. If it's another switch, or another port on this same switch, a decision has to be made whether to forward traffic on that port or to block it. This takes about 30 seconds, and likely the station is giving up on PXE faster than that.
This is caused by spanning tree. The switch is making sure that the new link doesn't form a loop in your network before it risks forwarding traffic on it.
Second hand switches can often have the previous configuration left on them, in which case it could be doing just about anything.  Dig out the manual, and work out how to reset the switch to factory defaults.
