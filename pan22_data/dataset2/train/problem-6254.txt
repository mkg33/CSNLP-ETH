Our server right now is running Server 2003, however in the redesign I would be open to migrating to Server 2008 R2 if there is a good case for it (i.e. the URL Rewrite module).
4 - Would using something like the IIS URL Rewrite 2 module for IIS 7 help us out? Or would I still need to define several thousand unique redirects in it?
Right now we have a site with a LOT of static asp pages such as, www.site.com/123.asp. This is due to how our current site's CMS builds it's pages by default. I don't have an exact count but we have roughly 6000 asp files in the site right now. We are in the middle of a redesign and restructuring of the site, and are looking to migrate to SEO friendly URLs. The problem we're having right now is what do we do to redirect the old pages to the new friendly URLs? I know how to do redirects that is not the issue here. The problems I am coming up with right now are listed below.
3 - My understanding is that we would not be passing along page rank to the new URLs, is that true? (not a major question I can ask on more SEO forums if nobody here is sure)
Thanks for any guidance or help. I have been looking for a good way to do this for a while now and keep coming up with things that sound problematic and bad (such as having 6000 redirects).
