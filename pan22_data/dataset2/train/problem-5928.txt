Check this out: http://docs.homelinux.org/doku.php?id=using_linux_ic_with_debian_squeeze the kernels there have the storvsc ata_piix fix ;)
With Debian jessie the hyper-v stuff is no more a problem, the modules are already integrated and are stable. You need only to compile and install the hyper-v tools (kvp and vss), I found this howto: http://docs.homelinux.org/hyper-v:debian_jessie_hyper-v and all will be fine ;)
Thus said for squeeze: Install with legacy NIC and IDE only drives, then get the Wheezy kernel from squeeze-backports and reboot. Then you'll be able to use paravirt NIC, SCSI disks, additionally you'll get mouse integration and support for more than 1 vCPU.
At the end of the installation, you will have a working Debian 7 (Wheezy), with modern kernel that support Hyper-V. So you may remove the legacy network card and use the native driver for network and disk.
When netinst ask you for the hostname for your new system, switch to another console (Alt-F2) and type
Hyper-V drivers got fully integrated upstream (moved out of staging) with 3.4. While Debian Wheezy (7.0) will be based on 3.2, it will contain a backport from Kernel 3.4, I'm using it here.
The solution I use is to download the Debian 6 netinst "business card". Add a "legacy network card", and boot on the install disc.
Stay away from any in-kernel Hyper-V drivers based on anything let's around say 3.0, since early version were considered staging and were sometimes utterly unstable. 
Currently, the netinst image doesn't contains the hyper-v drivers. (tested with netinst beta 2). You may replace your network card by a legacy network card, but it won't be enough since the debian Netinst does not detect the disk, so you can't install anything.
