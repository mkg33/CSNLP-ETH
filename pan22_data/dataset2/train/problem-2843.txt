I have a pivot table where I am representing a series of data across a number of categories as follows:
Below is a TR submit date along with the total # of TRs for that date which the pivot table did wonderfully.  Unfortunately, I wanted to see the sum over time (well, quarterly)... The procedure above got me there... curmudgeonly.
Then on Show Values As tab select Running Total In, And Select the column header you wish to Group By.
I would like to add a column on the end of the pivot table that shows a cumulative running total of the Grand Total column amounts. Ideally I would like to preserve the pivot table properties, i.e. I would like to add this cumulative sum column and still be able to add and remove fields from the table. Is this possible?
Can't reply to your comment in Doug's post as I don't have enough points, but just drag the field to the data area alongside the running total column.  You can have the same field appear more than once on a pivot table.
You can add the same column multiple times to the pivot table, so to address your requirement, you can add the column once as 'Normal', and then add the column to the pivot table again, this time using the 'Show Values As Running Total' feature on the second instance of the column.  That will allow you to see both the normal amount and the running total.
