The good news is that less features generally means less care and feeding over time. But there's also less functionality as well. You won't necessarily be able to install any arbitrary application on it, like SQL Server.
PS: Old lead soldered IT equpment may need a new set of electrolytic/polymer capacitors, but still can have longer lifetime expectancy than leadfree (tin) soldered modern kit (google: tin pest).
PSS: Sometimes a good 9-15 years old used WD/Qauntum/MAXTOR drive can outlive a new RAID array made from 3TB-6TB desktop drives (due to the greater heads flying gap)...
In general, a NAS is more of an appliance than a server. The OS is not as full featured as a dedicated server OS, but it has an interface to let you share files. A common feature is to have different RAID levels (0 & 1 almost always, 10 and 5 common) available for data availability. This increases uptime, since a single drive failure (other than RAID 0) will allow you to continue to work. It is not backup, since if you lose the NAS in a fire, you've lost everything. There are plenty of other features, but I'm sure that there are other better descriptions of NAS elsewhere.
The advantage of a NAS is primarily redundancy (uptime). While a server has multiple points of failure (the RAID card, the motherboard, the OS, sometimes the network card or the network), a NAS can be configured to avoid all of these. A cheap NAS won't be that much more reliable than a single file server, though. They're usually equally easy to back up, so the main variable is how fault tolerant you need your storage to be.
In your case, since you're talking about a file-server replacing NT (!), a simple NAS may be worth considering. The big questions that only you can answer are how much downtime are you willing to accept, and how much are you willing to spend to mitigate that risk.
