I know for a fact that it's on the Windows network domain, and I in fact have credentials (my own) to authenticate with the domain.
I am curious. We have an intranet here at my place of work, the organization is quite big and I am pretty sure it's not a single network (e.g. it's a typical level 3 LAN or even several LANs). We're a small subgroup in the organization sitting in the same office space and there is a Mac Mini that's connected to a huge HDTV on the wall showing "useless stats" all day long.
I would like to login remotely with my username and password (Windows domain network which we use) and just put something else on the HDTV, temporarily. A motivation poster :P Nobody will get hurt.
Problem is, I don't know the address or hostname of the Mac and which e.g. remote desktop protocols it supports.
I would want to do it without doing the technically completely unnecessary round of asking people about its hostname, address etc. They're all network buffs, and I am very tired of asking them questions. To practice my networking skills, I want to pull this off on my own -- finger, some careful port scan -- what to throw in the toolbox and how to go about it? The host is connected somehow, I can probably distinguish it from others because it's a Mac through some heuristics?
