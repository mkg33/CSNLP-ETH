Normally at this point if it doesn't work out i start lobbying to upgrade the app sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't. If you are really lucky and it's a common program searching google will give you the exact places you need to give permissions to run as a non admin.
I normally start by finding the HKLM key that the software uses - hopefully something sane - and using regedt32 (note regular regedit won't work) give thier group full control of that registry key. Then I'll give them full control of the installation directory. 99% of the time this resolves issues with needed local admin. 
As a quick fix, you may find that running the application as a member of the Power Users local group will be sufficient permissions.  Power Users has modify rights on almost all of the registy and local file systsem.  So it is a good indication that if the app works as a Power User, then it can be made to work as a normal user by editing registry of file system permissions.
Check out the site nonadmin started by the excellent Aaron Margosis.  It is a great resource as you roll out limited users on XP.  Some applications that want to run as admin need additional tweaking beyond the good answers already given to be able to run as a limited user.
