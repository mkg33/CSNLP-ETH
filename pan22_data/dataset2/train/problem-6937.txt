It's probably a regulatory/compliance issue.  Your employer wants to be able to read/archive all communication.  This is very often a requirement in industries such as banking.
A certain large company in Rochester NY that used to make a lot of film blocked outgoing ssh when I worked there, but allowed telnet!  When I asked about it, they said that ssh was a security hole.
Second, a lot of malware/botnets will use port 22 because it is often seen as "secure" and therefore allowed. They can then launch processes out that port, and infected computers might also launch SSH brute force attacks. 
Most larger organizations will be blocking everything and only allowing HTTP/HTTPS access via a proxy server.
Your clients are probably in possession of non-trivial data that they would like to retain. Outbound SSH is a really bad thing to have open for an entire network. It's pretty trivial to bypass proxys, leak sensitive data, and be generally obnoxious.
In other words, companies sometimes make stupid decisions, and then make up baloney excuses about security rather than admit their mistakes.
IMO, anything passing through the network/internet perimeter should be understood and controllable. If a group of devs need access to servers at a hosting provider via ssh, that's fine -- but it also needs to be documented. In general at the places that I have worked, we establish dedicated site-to-site VPN connections to locations outside of our network, (essentially extending our internal network) and avoid client protocols like SSH over the internet.
First, as people have mentioned, SSH port forwarding can be used as a proxy or bypass around other ports and services to avoid IT policy stating such traffic isn't allowed.
I'd be very surprised to hear of any corporations allowing direct external connections from desktops or servers unless there was a specific need.
