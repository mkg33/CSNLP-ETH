My search for assistance or instruction on this has not turned up anything. I may not know the right term to search for. I have read about many milters, but none that seem to solve this. Can anyone offer any help or point me in the right direction?
I use a vendor for my email, but run my own web server (EC2, AWS Linux), so I am thinking I can just create a second MX record for say "mail2" and use that for this application. Then I could use something like "parseme@mail2.mydomain.com" and have my server process those emails. I am thinking this can be done with a sendmail milter, but am not exactly sure.
We exchange emails with various clients and vendors. I am trying to implement a solution where all the email communications between our rep and the client or vendor is saved in our database so in our admin system we have a record of the communications. I have seen similar system for some of the project sites like Guru.com or elance.com. You communicate back and forth via email, but the system logs the conversation.
I have been searching for a couple of days to try and figure out how to implement this. In studying emails form Guru.com I see they all go to a common email address. The subject contains an encrypted ID and "From: (freelancer's name or project owner's name)" So it seem that there is a milter on that box that parsers the body of that email, saves it to the DB, and forwards the email on to the recipient (from the subject line).
