For some strange reason, when I overwrite the msi with a newer version, and then go to the policy, and click on "Redeploy Application", the application gets uninstalled on the users' machines, and all reg keys, binaries and shortcuts are gone from them. The "Add/Remove Programs" still contain the application entry.
I did check that my Package Codes and Product Codes are different for both versions, and that the Upgrade Codes are identical. I also checked the RemovePreviousVersion to true.  
Checking with some other msi (firefox 3.0.0 and 3.6.3) I downloaded from a site specifically for AD deploy, it worked just as expected (first installing the 3.0.0, then I over-written the msi, and clicked on "Redeploy", and the users got 3.6.3 after the next log-off-log-on).
I have managed to create a minimal vdproj that does nothing but write its current Product Version to a registry key, and created two versions of it (1.0.0 and 1.1.0). I still face the same problems when using this msi in my AD environment.
