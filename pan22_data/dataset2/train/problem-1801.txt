Someone who seems knowledgeable (FWIW) here writes that "The hardware keys like sound control keys can not be remapped. they are where they are for good."
You can effectively do what you want, but there are some caveats with it.  What you can do it turn on the option in the Keyboard preferences to use the F-keys as standard function keys, and then go to the Exposé and Spaces preferences and then assign F-keys to them.  However, the downside to doing it this way is that you have to hold the fn key to control screen brightness, volume, and media controls now.  This is what I chose to do, because I use standard the F-keys in applications and in virtual machines as well.
I haven't received my Snow Leopard copy yet so i can not be sure. But you should be able to choose what key to press for "Show Desktop".
I gave up.  The best I could do was redefine Fn-F3 to be Desktop.  At least it's on the "Exposé key," so you have the mnemonic thing working, and it's an easy one-handed stretch (Fn-F11 is IMPOSSIBLE) when you need to drag a file attachment into a mail message.
Man, I could have written this complaint myself (in fact, I just did, elsewhere, before finding this page).
More damning is that while running Key Codes, none of the "hardware keys" (exposé, itunes control, brightness, volume) show up at all. It seems that those keys get intercepted before anybody can do anything with them.
I'll keep looking and drop back in if I discover something different, but for now all signs point to SOL.
It's certainly no solution - but just to add to the conversation:  by default hitting command+(Show All Windows) shows the desktop.  i.e. hitting command-F3 where F3 is functioning as a special key and not truly as "F3"  If nothing else, it's an easy reach on the keyboard and somewhat logical.  I still can't understand why there is no show desktop special key - especially in light of the dedicated dashboard key (who uses that?) and an empty space at F5.
