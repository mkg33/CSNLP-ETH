I think, you should set up your postfix to use the gmail port 465 as an outgoing mail server. This can be done by setting the default transport to the smtps:alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com:465 or some similar.
If you want to test if gmail smtp port 465 is reachable from your network, just type in a telnet alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com 465 command. If you don't get an error message back, it is reachable.
Is there a way to send an email to GMail or any external server using port 465 only? It has same result when I run it with sudo.
There is a possible solution, that you could set up an outgoing mail proxy on another port (f.e. port 24) on some of your servers, if you have, although I don't think it worked in your place (probably you want to use gmail exactly for the same purpose).
The openssl command, which you are calling, is only a tcp port connector. It is practically a telnet client, the only difference that it encrypts data. It hasn't anything to do to your mail logs, even if you are connecting your own postfix with that.
