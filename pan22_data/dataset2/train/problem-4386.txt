Problem: The MacBook Pro (running Snow Leopard upgraded from Leopard) will not obtain an IP address via DHCP and repeatedly self-assigns a 169.xx IP address. I have tried restarting the computer, changing network ports and using different cables. Each time the computer has the same issue. I am able to connect to the same network via a wireless access point with no issue and other PCs (new to the network) are able to obtain an IP address without issue. 
On my unibody MacBook Pro 17" running Snow Leopard, the DHCP problem turned out to be fixed by switching from WEP to WPA2 security on the WiFi network. I had no problem using it with WEP on an iPad, two iPhones, and another MacBook Pro (unibody 13"). In fact, both MBP's are running 10.6.8 so I'm still not sure why one worked and one didn't, but after switching to WPA2 everybody's happy!
If DHCP is already set for this network inteface, go to the "advanced..." window and click "Renew DHCP Lease". Does this help?
Ugly hack workaround: Delete the ethernet network interface (select it and click the "-" button at the bottom). Create a new ethernet network interface.
Does that business even use DHCP? If it is a "business grade" network, they may have specific network settings, MAC authentication, or other security measures along with DHCP. They do this to keep their machines on the network and others off of it. I assume you are authorized to use this network?  You may have to obtain permission to add/use another computer on thier network.
Background: I am trying to connect my MacBook Pro to a business grade network where I do not have access to reboot the server, switches, or router. 
Have you tried repairing disk permissions and repairing the disk via disk utility from a bootable OS cd? A lot of times flakey permissions can cause all kinds of weird problems, especially after an upgrade.
Question: Why won't my MacBook Pro obtain an IP address via the ethernet connection? Any suggestions?
