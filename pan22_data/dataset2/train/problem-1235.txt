The theorem mostly relies on a result of [2] that roughly says that a graphs of bounded clique-width without large cliques also has bounded treewidth.They thus smartly trim the formula so that they do not have large clique in the incidence graph and solve the reduced formula in FPT time using a well-known algorithm for MaxSAT on bounded treewidth. I guess this approach may work in other problems as well.
I'm looking for problems that are hard to solve in FPT time but has an approximation algorithm. That is, problems that are:
The problem I'm familiar with is counting the number of simple paths of length $k$ in a graph. It is known to be #W[1]-hard, but admits a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation in FPT time (for any constant $\epsilon$).
The k-cut problem is to remove a minimum number of edges to create at least k components. W[1] hard when parameterized by k but admits a 2-approximation for any k.
In this paper we prove that (R1) the problem is W$[1]$-hard, (R2) that it admits a factor 2 approximation algorithm in time $2^{k^{O(1)}}n^{O(1)}$, and that (R3’) assuming a hypothesis somewhat stronger than $FPT \neq W[1]$ that there exists an $\epsilon > 0$ such that the problem does not admit a $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation algorithm in time $f(k)n^{O(1)}$.

R3. There exists $\epsilon>0$ such that the problem is not $(1+\epsilon)$ approximable in FPT time (unless W[1]=FPT).
In the Directed Odd Cycle Transversal problem the input is a graph $G$ and the task is to find a smallest set $S$ of vertices such that $G-S$ has no (directed) cycles of odd length. In the parameterized version we are also given an integer $k$ and asked whether a solution of size at most $k$ exists. 
In Defective Coloring we are given a graph $G$ and an integer $\Delta^*$ and are asked to partition the vertices of $G$ into the minimum possible number of color classes so that each class induces a graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta^*$. (If $\Delta^*=0$ this problem is just Coloring).
In [1], the authors prove that MaxSAT parametrized by the clique-width (resp. neighbor diversity) of the incidence graph of the CNF formula has an FPT-AS (Fixed Parameter Tractable Approximation Scheme) but it is known that MaxSAT parametrized by clique-width (resp. neighbor diversity) is W[1]-hard. 
In [1] we showed the following regarding this problem parameterized by treewidth: (R1) the problem is W[1]-hard; (R2) the minimum number of colors can be 2-approximated in FPT time; (R3) there is no $(3/2-\epsilon)$-approximation in FPT time, under standard assumptions.
