The answer then is the 16 bits from the first two uninteresting octets plus the 3 bits we just determined, so the subnet mask is /19. The CIDR format of the network address is 216.239.32.0/19.
Now, knowing that you could have 8 unique networks the same size as your network should tell you that you will need 8 unique numbers to represent them. If you are versed in binary math then it should be immediately obvious that it takes 3 bits to represent 8 numbers.
You need to determine the subnet mask that identifies this network. The interesting octet is the third one since the first two stay the same and the fourth sweeps from 0 to 255.
On a side note, within this network you can have 32*256 host addresses--minus one for the broadcast address and minus another for the network address.
In the third octet, the network address starts at 32 and the next network starts when it has incremented to 64. It "uses" 32 numbers in that octet for the network address. Therefore it "uses" 1/8 of the 256 possible numbers in that octet.
This is indeed called CIDR notation. You can use the ipcalc Linux tool to convert the ranges to CIDR notation:
