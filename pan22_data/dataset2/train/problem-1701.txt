The long term solution might be switching to a better file system, though. Currently I would recommend XFS. I've used it for years without major problems. The only drawback is that it can't be shrunk the way ext2/3 can be shrunk - it can be expanded though.
That's the clue you're looking for. My bet is that the culprit here is ext3. By default, under ext3, any fsync issued by any application under any user account forces the entire journal to disk. This is especially annoying if you're running databases which often have to issue a fsync() call. This is even more annoying when running over RAID devices which don't support write barriers (don't know if MPT devices support them, sorry.)
This was an unbelievable yet a fact number for me. It seems that stat64 syscall was forced to wait for the dump operation to be finished.
If you're reasonably sure about your UPS and server stability, try mounting that file system using the data=writeback mount option instead of the default data=ordered. You will be sacrificing reliability in the face of a server crash, but if your performance gets hit this bad anyway it's not a big loss.
