The IEICE Transactions from Japan has a very fast review process. The first round of review takes at most 3 months, and the second round between 2-3 months. So, in 5-6 months you get a definitive answer. I don't know the numbers, but several professors told me that's the case, and I confirmed that by personal experience. These journals are very popular in Japan, with many papers published every month.
However, not included is the first journal I think of with a fast turnaround time: Information Processing Letters (IPL).  I couldn't find any statistics, but rapid dissemination is their first goal.  When refereeing for a similar Elsevier journal with the same goal of rapid dissemination but with a slightly different scope, they requested my report within about 5 weeks.
Glencora Borradaile has an interactive graph with turnover time (among other information) for several journals from several sources.
While it is not a typical core-TCS journal, it seems that ACM Transactions on Database Systems sets a very good example:
I have heard that Theory of Computing aims to have quick reviews. I am not sure about the statistics though, I have not looked them up.
