When SSH authenticates a user, it logs the user name to the system's security log, but it does not log which of the authorized public keys was used in the log in. Is it possible to get OpenSSH to also report which public key was used, or maybe just the comment associated with that key?
A nice blog post answers your question: http://www.screenage.de/blog/2012/02/10/how-to-log-history-and-logins-from-multiple-ssh-keys-under-one-user-account-with-puppet/
I have a production system where several different people are allowed to log in to a single account - the account is for the application and not for the person as we don't have personal accounts on production servers.
Try playing around with the LogLevel parameter in sshd_config. For details, refer to  man sshd_config
For auditing purposes I want to be able to tell who logged in at what time, and as we use SSH keys to log in it seems logical to track that (as there is no other identifier to track). 
The operating system being used is CentOS 5.6, but I'd like to also hear if its possible on other operating systems.
