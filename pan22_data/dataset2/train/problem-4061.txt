Another option is to configure some totally bogus IPv6 settings so even if the provider does enable it, it won't work on this system at all (yes, it is super kludgy, but it would work to prevent anyone from doing anything with IPv6 on your system).
There is a write-up on this on the debian.org wiki here: http://wiki.debian.org/KernelModuleBlacklisting
Don't have services listening that shouldn't be open to the world. At the very least simply forcing services to bind to a specific IPv4 address should ensure they're not listening on IPv6. netstat -tupl can help with this.
Failing that, most daemons will let you specify interfaces addresses to bind to, with default of all. Explicitly list the v4 addresses you want, and then they won't leave open ports on v6 addresses, should you later get any. Outgoing connections would still prefer v6 addresses, though.
Going out on a limb here, but wouldn't the host provider communicate any potential kernel changes like this to it's customers?  Have you experienced anything (kernel upgrade, etc.) that would lead you to believe that this would happen without advanced notice?  Also, are they even routing IPv6 traffic to/from their network?  Might be best just to express your concern to support and go from there.
I can't test it on debian right now, but on Redhat you can modify the /etc/sysconfig/network file and add "NETWORKING_IPV6=no"
I believe currently the best way to disable IPv6 in Debian Lenny is to create a file in /etc/modprobe.d named ipv6.conf with blacklist ipv6 in it, then run depmod -ae as root, followed by update-initramfs -u.
