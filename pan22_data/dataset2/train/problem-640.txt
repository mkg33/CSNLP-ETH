The default settings for WAN/LAN should be fine on the router, and all you need to do is set up the WiFi.
Simply plug an ethernet cable from a LAN port on your Belkin ADSL router to the WAN (Internet) port on the E2500.
In the E2500 you have to disable DHCP because the Belkin is already handling that. And for various reasons (DNS mainly) with consumer-equipment in most cases that is best done by the internet-facing router.
On the second router if you setup DHCP but for the gateway put in the first routers IP address. And for the second router the IP address should be assigned statically with the first router as the gateway. That should work
If the Belkin also has Wifi it is probable best to have them BOTH setup for the same SSID and same password and configure them both to use the same channel(s). That way your client-devices will automatically pick the one with the strongest signal and will mostly smoothly roam from one AP to the other when you move through the building.  
Please note: In some equipment you can't disable DHCP, or the device won't work if the WAN connection is not used. In that case you will have to daisy-chain like Moses proposed in his answer. 
Most wifi-routers can be used as just an access-point. (Not all. You will have to try to see if yours can do it.)
