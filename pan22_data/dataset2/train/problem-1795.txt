Using xterm, you can log everything the terminal displays to a file. Then you can open that file in an editor or less.
One can gain such functionality using other tools, like emacs shell or screen, but I am wondering why such a useful feature is missing, I do remember a simple C-F used to work in terminals.
Don't know gnome-terminal but urxvt does that by typing Alt + s. It should be in your repositories, lookup the package rxvt-unicode.
Is there a way to make the Gnome terminal app support output search? or is there a better terminal app that support searching output natively?
Using a default terminal and bash, there is no functionality to search the standard output of commands.
In screen you can enter copy mode and do searches on output. You can also do logging of output to a file and search it any way you normally would (grep, less, etc.).
You could try script(1). On login just call script and you can then search through the typescript file it generates. It's not a single keystroke like emacs shell and it is buffered, but it might be better than nothing.
