And finally, I filtered the email column to only show the highlighted values which gives me a list of all email addresses which have multiple ContactIDs.
I need to be able to identify that 'email2' has the ID '0002' and '0003' assigned to it, but this spreadsheet has hundreds of thousands of records so this needs to be done with a formula.
Then I used conditional formatting in the email column to highlight duplicate values (Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cells Rules > Duplicate Values) (This removes all the email addresses that have only one ContactID)
From there, I used the 'Text to Columns' function to break the data back into two parts; email and ContactID, using the comma as the delimiting value.
I have a spreadsheet which is an export from a CRM database. There are two fields, email address and ContactID which I need to run a check against.
Using the CONCATENATE function, I merged the values from the two fields into a third column (C), with a comma between the two values.
After copying this column to another sheet, I used the 'Remove Duplicates' function in Excel so I am left with only unique values.
