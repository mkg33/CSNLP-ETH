Though it is possible to develop Windows 10 apps on Windows 8 (and Windows 7) machines, it requires a separate Windows 10 device if you wish to debug. If your goal is to write a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app, that is to say a Windows app, then upgrading to Windows 10 is the right thing to do for the sake of your own time and headache. Not to mention, Windows 10 is pretty nice. Remember, Windows 10 update 1 has been released, so be sure to upgrade one up have updated. Also, Visual Studio 2015 now has Update 1 which should be publically available in just a few days - so once you have installed Visual Studio 2015, be sure and update so you are writing Windows apps that target the UWP version 10.0.10586. I hope this helps.
I need your help please,I want to develop for UWP with windows 10(I tried to install windows 10 as a VMWare workstation virtual machine but I never have found the right ISO file(my processor supports virtual machines of 32 bits),so I need to convert my windows 8.1 pro 64 bits to windows 10
As for system requirements. The system requirements for Windows 7 are less than that of Windows Vista. The system requirements for Windows 8 are less than that of Windows 7. And, the system requirements for Windows 10 are less than that of Windows 8. Amazing stuff, huh?
