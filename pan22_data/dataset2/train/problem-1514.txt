Since a lot of zombie computers will be the ones doing the scanning and since their IP addresses will likely be dynamic, I can't see anyone really being enthusiastic about blocking IP addresses for those systems.  You could try and do some sort of lookup to determine the ISP and send them the information but again, I doubt they'd do anything about it - though some like Comcast might.
Notice how the whois entry shows very clearly what is the ABUSE e-mail address. This is not always so clear, but it's often there. If not, you can try using abuse@ISP, where ISP is the domain.
This host can be anywhere in the world. There isn't a central authority that you can contact for these cases, unfortunately. The best way is to contact the hosts ISP and report an abuse.
The way to find what is the abuse address for a certain IP is to use whois. There is a whois utility on Linux and on MacOS X. If you don't have this on your machine, try a whois website:
This is not the please where you will fill your complain, but they will help you find where to send your abuse report, and how do to it effectively.
After you get this address, send a very polite and informative e-mail to this address. Add all data that you have - what was the attack you received, includ the log entries and relevant date/time. Mention the source IP and the destination IP (the one on your side).
