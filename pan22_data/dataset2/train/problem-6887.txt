Also, install Ossec; although it is not its primary purpose, it will find some common misconfigurations (improperly configured accounts for example). And its primary function -- host based intrusion detection -- will help find if someone is trying to exploit vulnerabilities.
To expand on what mas said, here's a simple find command to list all the setuid and setgid files on the system for review.
I would check out Bastille-Linux at http://www.bastille-unix.org/, its a set of scripts that you can run and it will check the system settings, file permissions, user setup etc.  I've used it once or twice on my own boxes, and if finds issues on default installs (mostly r_x on rsh/rsync utils).  It outputs as html/java+curses/flat text.
In addition to some of the very good responses here, check out http://www.sans.org/. They have some very good documents if you're willing to do a little reading to get a better comprehension of "defense in depth".
Just make sure you back everything up first, you could image all the partitions to to make sure you really get it right.
Of course, like others have said, this is all assuming the machine doesn't have a rootkit on it already...
If you are worried, I would recommend following those tutorials you mentioned and rebuilding the server.  Especially if you think the other admin might have left something bad.  As the new admin, you should know how to deploy whatever service it is running again anyways.
Download Nessus and perform a network check on it. It will tell you about remotely exploitable vulnerabilities.
