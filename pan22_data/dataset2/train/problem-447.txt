Bridges were not originally designed as security devices but as a method of helping networks to scale by splitting up collision domains. 
The choice to use a bridge or router depends much more on the topology design, type of media used, physical distance, cost, etc.  
So, a VLAN is a virtual LAN, or a segregated out bridge/switch - virtually.  That could be considered a security feature.
Packets are layer 3 items.  Frames are layer 2 items.  Routers route packets and bridges/switches pass frames.
There may be security benefits to create isolated layer 2 networks, but that is still more of a topological decision.
However the bridge support in linux is more than just a bridge. Bridge traffic passes through ebtables and by default IP traffic on a bridge passes through iptables (this can be disabled). This allows one to implement packet filtering and can therefore allow a firewall to be introduced without breaking up the layer-2 domain. 
Internet Protocol (IP) = layer 3.  If your endpoints have no ip addresses, they are no accessible by endpoints beyond their layer 2 domain.
Considering this, from a security standpoint, is the reason one would use a linux bridge to limit which systems can communicate with one another?
Linux bridges operate at layer 2 and therefore can only switch packets between interfaces whose mac addresses are contained in a single bridge; a full router operates at layer 3, and thus allows packets to be forwarded/routed to other networks.
