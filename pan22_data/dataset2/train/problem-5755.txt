This is called asynchronous routing. You have to point the default gateway of the webserver to the IP address of the router on ISP-1. If the clients that are accessing the web server came from the same IP you can route this without changing the default gateway, or, you can implement NAT on the ISP1 gateway to act like a reverse proxy and then route it at the web server. Regards.
Also, investing a router than can support multiple WAN connections would make life a lot easier for you (and allow you do load balancing/failover between both Internet connections).
The point is that not only web may use the ISP1 connection. You may choose. It's good because you may connect to the server from ssh from both connections if someone fails. As a CentOS user I created the following files so my changes weren't lost after reboot:
Firewall people do inside nat to get over this problem. The inbound connection is natted to the firewall inside interface address and therefore does not have a routing problem at the server.
Assuming your Webserver is on the same subnet as your workstations, why not just setup split DNS so that on the inside, yourwebsite.com resolves to it's internal IP address?  Sure beats complicated asynchronous routing.
If the both inbound connections end up in same interface in same IP you have very limited (none?) options. See if you can get another IP for the same computer/interface and have one inbound connections in one IP and anoter inbound in another IP. After this you can do source routing easily. 
I had the same issue, but I solved only with iproute2 (source routing). Marking with iptables wasn't necessary:
If you can't get different sources connect to different IP addresses you can use iptables mac to redirect packets depending on MAC they were coming from.
