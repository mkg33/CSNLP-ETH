You could do some kind of Bluetooth point-to-point connection as well, but that's about as insecure as shouting your bank password at a carnival.
We do a fair bit of running cat5 wire at the company I work for and have this limitation on a number of places we install our equipment in. A common solution we use is to pull off the molding and run the wire behind it if we're running the length of the wall. If we're running wire through a wall we'll pull off the molding on either side pass through the wall and pinch the wire under the molding when we put it back on. It's not pretty but your only other pretty option is to fish up the wall and install an rj45 outlet.
If you can't run cable/fiber and you want 100Mb without wireless you're stuck. The best thing you could do is set up a wireless bridge.
Use a wireless connection that is not on the standard MHz ranges. E.g 900MHz radios or microwave wireless. It's not 802.11, so is unlikely to be eavesdropped on. It's also filthy expensive and not terribly user friendly. However, you're project specifications are very unusual, so the usual solutions won't fit.
It would help to know why wireless is not a viable solution for you. Is it because of security  issues or is that wall you can't drill through made of depleted uranium?
