yes - there will be some downtime during the period of time that the name servers are switched to godaddy and the time you set the zone file, the domain will bring up a generic godaddy landing page.  The downtime will probably be brief, only 15-30 minutes, but could be longer.  I've found godaddy telephone support to be helpful if a situation arises where something is "stuck", but I also know they've gone through some changes and there's no guarantee you won't go into a 24 hour holding pattern.
To switch them without downtime I'd recommend going with a 3rd party like Dyn or DnsMadeEasy.  Set up your settings there first, then after your settings are already in place, change the nameservers with the registrar.  You won't have any downtime, and you won't be stuck if you decide to change registrars later.
While searching around for solution, I found GoDaddy support article, https://support.godaddy.com/help/article/4041/managing-domain-names-with-off-site-dns, which mention 'adding Off-site DNS for the domain name prior to initiating the transfer'. Not sure how it works. Did anyone used the Off-site DNS?
