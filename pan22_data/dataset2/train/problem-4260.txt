Now that I'm ready to deploy my program, I'd like to test the connection over a network, and use a 64-bit server to hold the database.
"You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'mysqldump -u root -proot Isys-TMS(EEI1) > isystms.sql' at line 1"
mysqldump is a separate binary and not a command within the MySQL console. Furthermore it is spelled with a p in the end (you had a b there!).
Up til now, I've only used the 32-bit version, and my backup 'process' would be to copy the database folder from C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\data and paste it onto the same directory of another computer.
Properly escape the catalog name and mysqldump will work fine from the command line (the real command line, not the MySQL command line):
You can create a backup in Query Browser with the tool itself: http://www.siteground.com/tutorials/php-mysql/mysql_gui_tools.htm
It is a commandline program like mysql.exe. You seem to run this in Query Browser or mysql cmd - this is wrong!
Please read this too (avoid \n / \r\n conversion): http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/de/mysqldump.html
And try to avoid ugly characters like parentheses in your database names in the future. Also prefer _ over -.
I'm also assuming I can simply use this .sql output on the new 64-bit MySQL, so if that's not the case, what else can I do to solve this problem?
Which is not at all helpful. (Though I'm not sure if I did it right on the command line client, as opposed to Windows' own CMD)
I'm currently using MySQL version 5.0.16, on my local computer (which runs a 32-bit OS), for easier access while developing my program.
replace "mysqldumb -u root -proot Isys-TMS(EEI1) > isystms.sql;" by "mysqldump -u root -proot Isys-TMS(EEI1) > isystms.sql;".
