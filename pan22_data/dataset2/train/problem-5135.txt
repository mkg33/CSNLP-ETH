The obvious things I can see are: durability (server hardware mostly more qualitative and have more warranty) and power consumption (server hardware more focused on performance, than on power economy). Also server disks are usually a little faster, but it seems, that it is not always the case.
Rubber anti vibration dumpers and rigid cases are strongly recommended for all modern high density disks/fan mounts. (Esp ones over with density 500GB+ per platter, since their heads are really fragile from my experience).
One very important difference is the Time-Limited Error Recovery (aka Command Completion Time Limit)
If you don't use "hardware compatible" equipment (i.e. OEM) then you may find yourself SOL when the kit dies and you need to get it fixed quick.
May be there are some other reasons, that make you choose server-oriented series (Seagate ES drives, for example) over desktop-oriented ones (Seagate Barracuda series)? What are they?
The heat-pad under a smooth chip (motor controller) is missing in the most of the consumer drives (seagate, WD), but is usually present in the most of the enterprise class disks. (so the tiny smooth chip is much more likely to die under the load from overheat in the desktop model).
Enterprise hard disks also tend to have a longer MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures), i.e. longer life span, than consumer grade ones.
