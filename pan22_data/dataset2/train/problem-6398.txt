The problem with this is that it only shows the first worksheet.  If you double-click you can still see and edit the rest of the sheets, but they won't show in the Word Doc.
Inserting the Excel workbooks as icons can be done, but requires more steps.  However if you are only working with 20 workbooks instead of 600 worksheets, it becomes more manageable.  Go to Insert > Object, ensure "Display as icon" is checked, then select From File and open the file.  Repeat for each workbook.
If you drag-and-drop the Excel file into Word it embeds a copy.  The original can be renamed/removed, and the embedded version can still be opened and edited.  You double-click, and it opens the data in Excel.
Or if you really need the tables to be visible, for every worksheet, I think you are looking at writing VBA to do it.  I wouldn't know exactly where to start, it would likely take me half a day to nut it out.  I'll leave that one to you, or another helpful soul who is a VBA expert.
I personally like the icons idea, it makes for a compact master document that contains 20+ Excel workbooks, each with 30+ worksheets.  You can show all icons on a single page, or split them into categories.  But it may not be what you need.
If you want to do the icons, and drag-and-drop inserts them as tables, it may be possible to change that behaviour.  For some people (this will probably depend on OS and version of Office, it doesn't work for me on Mac using Office 2016), you can right-click on the embedded table/icon and "Convert" it from one type to the other, as described here.  You may be able to select multiple and convert (although I doubt it will allow that).  Or at that point, it may be easy to record a macro.
