DeltaCopy (basically a Windows version of rsync) and SyncBack (3 versions to choose from, one free) sound right up your alley.
Crashplan from here http://www4.crashplan.com/landing/index.html gives some nice options.  I'm not sure if it will back up to another internal drive but I can't see why it wouldn't.
If you get Robocpy and the Robocopy GUI you can fiddle with it to do what you want. I use this everyday for my backups.
Some backup devices (such as the Seagate Freeagent external drive) come with supplied backup software. However, I find to cover from building fire, it can be better to use a remote backup system such Squirrelsave, Mozy, Carbonite or Jungledisk. If you have a home network and want a machine to work as a backup machine, then R1Soft's CDP backup system supports Windows and Linux machines.
I wrote my own, as a Python script.  It uses md5sum to detect changed files, and copies them to a standard backup subdirectory within each working directory.  Each backed up file has the same file name, with a suffix, such as <filename>_1, <filename>_2, etc...
