VMware products do spread the load across multiple cores, but be careful about scheduling issues with busy guests which will impact overall performance.  More info here.
The documentation on QEMU is not really clear; using the "-smp <num of cores>" option allows you to emulate more than one CPU, but it is not clear if this is real smp across multiple host cores, or effectively "threads" bound to a single core.
SMP support refers to the ability for the host to present a multiprocessor VM to the guest OS.  If you want to allocate more of your host CPU resources to a guest, that is likely the route you'll need to take.
Although it is from an ancient version of ESX1.5, the newer versions use the same technique, and even more so. Documentation for later versions is available here but doesn't seem to be googled
Typically, virtualization software permits you to set the number of CPUs the VM can access and allows you to set a min/max cpu usage used for all CPUs.  This is certainly true of Hyper-V and Virtual Server though I don't have experience with QEMU.
