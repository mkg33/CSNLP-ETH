µTorrent has actually always been portable! It's only one executable. The setup has been added later. It launches when you first execute utorrent.exe, but you can just skip it, and µTorrent will (should) be launched. I still have one of the first versions which is only 100K or something in my tool archive somewhere (when I heard they were bought by another company first thing I did was thoroughly backup that executable).
I would check to see if the installer has any command line switches.  I would look for a "continue on error" mode and also I would look for a install mode that leaves out the toolbar.  
The above command should tell you if there are any command line switches if you run it from the command prompt in the correct directory.
I'm using Vista Home Premium SP1, UAC is disabled, Kaspersky Anti-Virus 8.0, and I have admin rights in system.
What is wrong with installation? How can I install uTorrent properly without installing Ask toolbar? Is there anywhere uTorrent version that doesn't require installation? Any workaround for uTorrent to work without installation?
if there is anyone else using a computer (other user account), it could be the configuration or registry or something got corrupted. Had a same problem, this worked for me.
I use uTorrent for long time now, and now when I start it I get installation wizard to install new 1.8.3 build 15772 version. Ok... So I start to install, and everything is going fine, until I get to options to install Ask toolbar. Of course, I deselected installation of such toolbar, and clicked install button (to install uTorrent), which has that small admin/shield icon, and nothing happens. I click again, nothing again... So I selected option to agree and install Ask toolbar (I can remove it later), and it did successfully installed in all browser :/ but, uTorrent still don't want to install. I'm  getting install button enabled and when I click it nothing happens, step with option to install Ask toolbar is not longer there.
