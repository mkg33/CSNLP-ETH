However, this question is absolutely a matter of opinion, and DirectX absolutely has its benefits over OpenGL, especially 10 and 11 and especially in the context of game development.
I like Direct X and have been using it for several years on many projects but if your learning do watch out for version issues. 
I don't know how up-to-date it is (i mean it's not, but i don't think there's any reason that it shouldn't be usable), but i used it a while ago (C++) and i really enjoyed it.
If you're just starting out it's probably better to use an existing 2D engine or framework such as SFML.
Anyway, if what you want is to create an actualy -game-, as opposed to learning the stuff that's going on "under the hood" in the processes of drawing and such, i'd recommend using something higher level then openGL or DirectX, or you're going to spend your time drawing stuff on the screen as opposed to creating an actual game. And HGE is definitly worth checking out.
Also, should you choose to go with OpenGL, SDL is a wonderful and very popular library, and there are plenty of resources for learning OpenGL (NeHe, etc.) - but that's the place for another question perhaps.
I agree with these remarks and think it is a stellar discussion of why OpenGL is better than DirectX.

I found that the majority of direct x code will not compile under a different version and this can be hell if you are trying to follow a tutorial.
HGE wasn't updated since 05.08, but again, i remember it being pretty simple to learn, and fast. It also comes with all sorts of tools and helper like a particle system.
I recommend Direct X as there are features for everything that make it easier when you are first beginning and then more advanced ways of manipulating things as you advance.
