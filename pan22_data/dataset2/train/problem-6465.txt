Because of this, the WoL magic packet is usually sent as a broadcast. As the switch's MAC table will likely have aged as well, a unicast WoL packet would effectively be sent as broadcast anyway.
Directed broadcasting usually requires explicit enabling and can be tricky, depending on the equipment. A static ARP entry for e.g. 192.168.0.254 => FF:FF:FF.FF:FF:FF will send all IP packets to that IP as a local Ethernet broadcast, doing the trick. Of course, you only need one entry on each subnet you need to direct WoL to.
Since the unpowered destination machine will not answer to ARP requests, it's likely that the ARP cache just times out - the sender can't resolve the IP address and nothing is sent.
A broadcast is only sent locally, so when you need to send a remote WoL you need to use either directed broadcasting or a static fake ARP entry on the destination router.
The static ARP trick can also be used to wake a device from the Internet: set up port forwarding for any obscure UDP port to the fake ARP IP address and send the WoL packet to the forwarded port on your router's public IP address.
