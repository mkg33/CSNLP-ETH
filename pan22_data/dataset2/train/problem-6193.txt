Other items I've seen suggested related to this kind of attempt recommend monitoring for the failed attempts and blocking the source IPs - eventually the same IP will be used for another probe, so by detecting and blacklisting after attempts to log in with a nonexistent account you gradually reduce the threat at the cost of increased firewall rule processing. Also, it might be best to not block after only a single connection attempt - typos do happen.
The best answer is, don't do anything about it.  As long as your users have strong passwords of 8 characters or more, at that rate it will most likely take around 3000 million years to brute force it!
Here's some discussion and analysis of a "slow brutes" botnet attack that started in 2008: Slow Brutes Final Roundup
Install denyhosts or fail2ban - it will block by IP after a certain number of attacks.  denyhosts operates on /etc/hosts.deny and I believe that fail2ban operates on iptables rules.
Audit your passwords (with john the ripper or similar), and see if you can increase the timeout for login.
