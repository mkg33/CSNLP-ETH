Maybe some sort of a square wave with certain time distance between signals generated by measurement device and a loop in python that counts those waves? I am sure there gotta be a existing way to do such a stuff, with all the error correction and other stuff.
How many bits accuracy do you need in the ADC conversion?  Typical off the shelf ADCs may have 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 bits of resolution.
Choose an ADC with the appropriate resolution and an appropriate interface supported by the Pi (e.g. I2C or SPI).
Analog-to-digital converter will be made by a contractor, I need to prepare a specific technical specification - the task in what format I want that angle measurement to be sent to the rpi.
Then do a search for that ADC and Raspberry Pi to see if there are many tutorials.  If there are it will be a safe choice.  The ADC itself will define the data format.
Purpose of that device will be to measure analog angle, convert to some format of a number and send it to rpi via some pins. At this stage, there is a good deal of a freedom what pins to use, so lets consider the fresh state where all pins are unused.
