Go to the branches list on the Bitcoin Core project site (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/branches), locate the latest version number, and substitute "0.11" in the command below with that.
Being a noob, I have no clue as to where it is looking for the bitcoin-qt file, so I tried the same command in the directory the file was in that I downloaded it to, same error.
You can either get a statically linked binary from https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/ or use one of the package managers:
After that, you will be able to run Bitcoin Core by typing: bitcoind (the text based backend) or bitcoin-qt (the graphical frontend), or bitcoin-cli (command-line client)
Turns out, after much experimenting, Mint Linux is the only distro I could find that seems to be relatively small, relatively fast & works great (for me, that it).
I know I'm doing something completely wrong here, but have no idea how to proceed. (sorry, spoiled by win/mac 2-click installations!)
WARNING: Complete noob to linux (somewhat noob - if something can be installed w/ a package manager, I'm ok, else completely lost).
In order to compile and run, Bitcoin Core depends on some other tools which must be installed prior to compiling :
Compiling Bitcoin Core requires the Berkeley DB version 4.8 which is not available in the wheezy repositories, so we must use squeeze repositories. Note that if you don't need a wallet (i.e. if you want to run a headless Bitcoin node and keep your wallet elsewhere) you can completely skip this section and jump directly to downloading and compiling Bitcoin Core.
I loaded debian 7 on a VBox VM (took 2 days to get everything to run correctly, but cool now) and just want to put a BitCoin wallet on, so I went to the bitcoin site and downloaded the wallet. Unfortunately, there is no install package, just a bin and src directory. I figured the bin was the correct place to look and found a directory named "32" under that. In that directory, I see bitcoind and bitcoin-qt.
