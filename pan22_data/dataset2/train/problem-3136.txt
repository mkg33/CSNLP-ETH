In conclusion, since the Perc 6/i is a hardware RAID controller, I'd just let the OS partition the drive as it recommends. The alignment of the partition is not going to have a noticeable effect on disk/file access speed. 
Your math is wrong. In a 4 disk RAID5 array there are (simplistically) 3 data disks and a parity disks, which is why if you have 4 80Gb drives, you get 3*80 or 240Gb of usable space on the RAID array. So, by your assumptions, starting a partition on at 2048 bytes into the drive would start on the 2nd block of the 2nd drive.
Of course, it's reading and writing 64Kb chunks, so it you started you partition at the 192Kb boundary, you might just see a fractional improvement when accessing files right at the start of the partition. But, assuming this disk isn't going to have a few very large files (i.e sized in multiples of 192Kb) being read sequentially, in normal operation, the heads would be moving all over the disk(s), reading/writing files allocated in 4Kb chunks, which would swamp any gain from the alignment of the partition.
But, in fact, your premise is wrong anyway. If you've ever watched the disk activity lights on a RAID5 array, you'd seen that they all flash together, except when doing a rebuild. In other word, the RAID5 controller actually caches the disk read & writes and executes them in parallel across all the drives (obviously, during a rebuild, all but one of the drives operate together while the rebuilding drive is usually on solid). This is so it can guarantee consistency.
