5/ Wear is a problem but they have ways to manage it (involving scattering blocks) which are possible because randomly fragmented data won't slow an SSD. Also, a small database on a large disk will likely not wear out in time to buy a cheaper new one in the future.
1/ If you neglect to add the right indexes, SSD will be much more forgiving as random seek times are so low.
6/ There's a trend towards non-relational databases and doing joins in the middle-tier. This could really change things: I/O to simple unindexed tables on SSD drives on shards without performance penalty and with a much simpler scaling proposition. Also saving on SQL Server licenses per shard.
The Microsoft Research article concerns itself with cost per Gb rather than the performance gain. It does not actually fit and test the drives but uses a retro-casting algorithm based on log files from actual servers.
3/ A single SSD drive with shadow copy has surely got to be cheaper than a bunch of spindles in a RAID cabinet and the controller and connections. Not to mention the power and heating and rack space.
7/ This is all theoretical. If anyone has real-world performance testing against spindles, I'd love to see.
2/ Costs are way down against when that study was done and for small web applications, say for running the back end of a phone app, not enterprise Exchange servers, the performance could save expense on hiring a consultant to tune SQL Server.
4/ Spindles are notorious for being the part that most commonly dies on a computer. SSD has no moving parts and an hour of business down time could cost the price of an SSD in one go.
