Purchase a VGA to Composite Converter and a Y Splitter. Or you could get a VGA to Component Converter but this would depend on what your TV supports. Also make sure you do your own research on which converter or y splitter your going to buy as the hyperlinks I've provided are just there to give you an idea of what products you should be looking for.
If your TV only supports composite, then @MHrappstead answer is what you're looking for. Similarly, you can convert VGA to S-Video, if that's what your TV supports.
Finally, let us not forget DLNA solutions. If you have an Xbox 360, a PS3 or a DLNA-supporting media box, you can just stream your video to the TV over your network.
My Computer is a Gateway ID59C I just bought it about 4 months ago. How can I hook it up to the TV so that I can watch Movies and stuff off my computer? and getting a brand new HD TV really isn't a answer.
Depends on which connections are available on your TV. Most TVs in recent years have a VGA connector, and you'd connect to it much like you connect to a monitor (although you'd need to add a 3.5" audio connector as well if you'd like to use your TV speakers).
