Good old XP used to have the DLLCache folder, replacing the file there and into system32 would of fixed things directly.
I have windows 10 1511 version. About one month ago i just deleted the following files qmgr.dll and wuaueng.dll because of the windows update was taking all of my internet in name of taking just idle bandwitch. But now i wanted  that files back. But in some way i got correct wuaueng.dll file and fortunately it gets compatible with my windows and  windows update service gets started. still unable to find qmgr.dll. Because of that file BITS service is not starting. I searched on internet downloaded many qmgr.dll files but all the files are of windows xp windows 7 version. I have an ISO of windows 10 but i don`t want to reinstall it. I have heared that there are some DISM command lines that can restore missing files from an offline ISO image. On internet commandlines are given but not correctly guided how to use these line. Also there is many commandline are given but not know which one will work for me. Can anybody tells me what i need to do.
In W10, theres the problem of file versions. If the latest version is bad (as in incompatible with something you use), neither DSIM or SFC will fix the problem.
