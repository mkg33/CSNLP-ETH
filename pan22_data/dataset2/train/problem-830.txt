It's currently a litte tricky to get running, but worth it and looks great. Hopefully it'll become default GUI for Nagios someday.
Their dev team is pretty active as well and respond to bugs in their issue tracker pretty quickly. As I said, I identified two bugs and they rolled in the changes within 24 hrs.

Centreon is also written in PHP, and sensible PHP too. I've already modified mine to add an audit trail of who did what and when and fixed a couple of bugs.
It also supports multiple operators and groups and has a fairly fine grained ACL config. This is great for us because we can allow our customers to login and see only their devices.
It's open source, has a very active development team. Installation is a wee bit involved but as long as you follow their instructions to the word then you'll be all good.
With the limited dev work going in to the free version of Nagios the community fork Icinga looks very interesting.
