There are at least two reasons power is consumed in a pc even when it is shut off: one is that some services are not interrupted, like the clock. Also, many modern pcs can be awakened by a network event (Wake-On-Lan or even Wake on Wifi), which implies they must be mnitoring the network for such signals. 
It surely is not battery discharging, it is well known that removing the battery allows it to conserve its charge longer. Some manufacturers (Toshiba) even suggest doing so on a regular basis.
The other reason is that current Windows pcs do not really shut off, in order to allow shorter boot-up times. They are indeed in sleep mode, in which they do consume some power in order to preserve RAM, and to respond to wake-up events. These include activity of mouse, keyboard, or the pressing of power-up buttons. To this you must add Wake-On-Lan or Wake on Wifi events, and the ensuing monitoring. 
Ensure that your pc is completely turned off by selecting Shutdown, and not Sleep. Some people think as long as I press the power Button and the screen turns off then the laptop is happily off, but their mistaken and in a day or 2 the battery is flat (especially on Sleep). This is because on Sleep, most of the hardware is turned off while the RAM is left on to facilitate quick resuming (that's why Wakes are much quicker than Boots). RAM uses quite a bit of power even during Sleep.
Alternatively, it might be usb devices connected to your laptop that's drawing some power from it. Ensure you disconnect all devices when your laptop is off.
