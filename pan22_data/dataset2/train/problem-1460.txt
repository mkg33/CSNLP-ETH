I presume you've got an Active Directory domain. Fire up the "DNS Management" management console on a domain controller (which, odds are, is also one of your DNS servers), open the server node, the "Forward Lookup Zones" node, and highlight the zone that corresponds to your Active Directory domain. Click "Action" (in the menu) and "New Host". Enter the hostname and IP address of the new host.
If you are using a gateway server then modify the hosts there and all is well. Other wise if your Router(cisco/juniper) allow for a text version of the hosts file put it there. That will circumvent having to put a host file on every client.
We need to append a line to the hosts file for every user on our network. I have admin privileges, but don't know the first thing about windows scripting. Can someone point me in the right direction on this? I don't have the list of all the machine names, so I'd prefer a script that would discover all the machines on the network and do the update.
Presumably you're a sysadmin. It sounds like you need to spend some time learning about DNS, because it will save you a lot of headaches in the future.
Don't use "HOSTS" files. Period. Any "solution" that users HOSTS files is just creating a new problem.
Short of a tool like SCCM you are not going to be able to discover an exact listing of machines on the network.  
Agreed at the recommendation to look at DNS, but let's not forget that there might be some horrible old legacy apps that still require hosts name resolution on this network.
