If you have BufferedLogs turned on, it takes some memory, otherwise it's only sequential writes to disk. If your apache makes many random disk accesses (serving many images or whatnot) try external log server to minimize iowait for log write. Also with debug logging level log grows very fast, if it's not important, change to info.
Considering you can buy hard drives with capacities of 4,000,000 MB; a 73MB log file is pretty small really. I would let logrotate rotate the file once a day, keep a week to a month around for various analysis. It doesn't make any noticable difference to the rest of the server (CPU, RAM, etc) at that size.
In most cases (when you just append data to the end of the log file), it doesn't matter how large the file is (gotten it to a couple 10s of gig's on a 512mb ram machine, with no visible slowdowns, until the /var partition was full :))
If your /var partition is small, your log files large (73MB is relatively small), or you need daily logs for archival/processing, you should use daily rotation. If you dont process logs, or don't do anything with them, except append data to the end (like apache does), it doesnt matter how often your rotate them - just take care not to use up all the space on /var, since it can cause bigger problems then just not-having logs.
