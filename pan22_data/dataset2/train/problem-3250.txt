Another alternative now is Banana Pro, which has gigabit ethernet, built-in WiFi and also a SATA port. I ordered mine direct from China via AliBaba but you can now find them (both bare and in kits) on amazon.com
The closest you can get are the ShevaPlug and its derivatives I think. Specifically TonidoPlug2 or DreamPlug. They're more expensive and are enclosed, but are the closest thing I can think of that's ARM.
N.B. USB 2.0 theoretically supports up to  480 Mbit/s (60MB/s). USB 3 will work on the Pi but currently only due to backwards compatibility, so you may not get the speeds you expect from a USB 3 device.
Combine this with the Raspberry Pi 2 (which is faster, supports a newer version of ARM, more USBs, probably uses less power etc), and you should be able to get what you are looking for.
Newegg has a host of embedded boards with gigabit NICs on them.  The boards themselves are < $100 and simply need power, memory and storage in most cases.  Most low-powered boards like the RPi do not have gigabit controllers on them to cut down on cost and energy consumption.  There is a company called UDOO with onboard gigabit but it does not fall under $100.
There's the Intel Galileo but that's 100 mbit. It does have a mini-PCIe slot so you may be able to add gigabit ethernet. It may make more sense to add USB3 to it though, that way multiple fast devices can be attached.
Another way is to use a more advanced USB-Ethernet adapter (The Pi's existing 10/100 Ethernet adapter uses a internal USB bus) - for example this one suggested here. 
The BananaPi has no official info regarding practical ethernet speed. But according this article it is roughly 800Mb.
