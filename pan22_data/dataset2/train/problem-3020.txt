This is what i'm doing to send email with bash. I use it to send me a log file and external IP adress, feel free to use it :
You'll need to review the SMTP protocol specification. It's a surprisingly light read for a technical specification, and will help you understand how the email process works.
I would be happy with a solution that uses a little bash shell to accomplish the goal, but don't want to use any other tools...
Specifically, realize that attachments are converted into MIME types and encoded in text, so any attachments you'd like to send via telnet would have to be converted into text and transmitted as such via the telnet protocol.
Does anyone know how you would send an email using telnet or netcat but attach a file as well?  There are probably better ways, but I still want to know :-) 
Rather than generating a new message "on the fly" each time, it would probably be easier just to email yourself a very short example message from a "real" email program (leveraging the work that the people who wrote it did to put the attachment into the proper encoding and creating the MIME headers).
Save that message off into a text file w/ its headers (removing the transport header, of course), and just modify / copy / paste it into telnet or netcat for future sessions.
