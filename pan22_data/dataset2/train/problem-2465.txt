You will need to call ASUS support and have them send a system restore disk(s). Sometimes the cost of knowledge and experience is high...Ouch!
What you need is get a live suse linux disk (it is free ISO download from suse.com site)toget access to the hidden partitions containing the restore files (there are like 4 hidden partitions, the one you need to copy is to an external usb drive is the biggest one containing the install.wim file) and copy the install.wim file to an external usb Hard drive. Then try to make a bootable USB using the largest  capacity stick you can get. A 32 GB should do it. My install.wim image with all the windows 8 driveras included in the operating system was 22GB. The install.wim image contains the windows 8 operating system plus all the native drivers for your laptop. you can use The WindowsÂ® Automated Installation Kit (AIK) to extract all, the Windwos OS + drivers to a file and place that content in the source file of the bootable USB. Read about WAIK at microsoft site. I also recommend finding site with methods of making a bootable USB with not less than 32 GB capacity. Well At least you have an idea of how to look for the rest of the information to make a Windows 8 Recovery usb stick.
