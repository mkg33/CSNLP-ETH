Now, there are many permission issues but since I am not good at AD at all, I can only suspect that these 2 domains are actually not aware that they are in the same company.com forest. Furthermore, we all users have to maintain 2 accounts country1\user and country2\user depending on where the service resides.
All I could find is that validated entry in "AD domain and trust" console where the domain countryX.company.com trust the other countryY.company.com (basically trusting each other, though I am not sure of the effects).
May I ask how can I confirm if the 2 domains are NOT set under the same forest? And upon confirming that, how to set up into one forest?
I looked at "AD sites and services" which seemed to be the place to set up the DC relationships but it seems that a separate physical server is required to be the DC for company.com. Is that the case or can I just set it up logically? Otherwise, I may have to treat these 2 sites as separate forest and look into full trust between them.
