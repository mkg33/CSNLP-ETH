This will find all files and folders on the current drive, sort them in ascending order by the last time they were accessed, and show their full path and last access time.
The range selection can also be used with copy and move commands, if you prefer to archive files instead of deleting them.
Is there a way to search the entire drive by date opened - and the order form last to most recently opened?
This will probably take awhile, especially on system drives or other drives with a large number of files and/or folders. However, you should not use this criteria alone when choosing to clean up files on a system drive or in an area where program files or data are stored - you could seriously break things if you do. Only use this for user data like documents, pictures, videos, etc.
An alternative approach is to use TCC from http://jpsoft.com/all-downloads/downloads.html (the LE version is free). This is a much-upgraded version of CMD, which allows you to both order and select by each of the file dates, eg:
PowerShell gives you a lot more options for working with the data, too. As @CharlesH has covered in his script, you can dump the output into a CSV file instead of just leaving it at the console. You can also do some filtering according to file size and other properties, or format the data to show more or less data and display it in a way more friendly to you.
