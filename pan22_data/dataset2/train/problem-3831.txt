Is there a program that will take the audio from a dvd and turn it into a written transcript. Meaning will it take what is spoken and write down each word.
What you need is software for "speech recognition". There are many available, but be aware that the results usually need a lot of correcting. DVDs will be particularly difficult, because they have several different speakers, possibly a lot of noise and bad/non-standard pronounciation.
Have a look at the answers under tags speech-recognition and speech-to-text on superuser for software you could use.
If the content has Closed Captions, those are directly and reliably machine-translatable in the DVD data. However, they are often not what is said exactly, but rather paraphrased so that they can be read, when the dialog is fast (and rarely, just plain wrong).
accurate speech recognition without training the software is impossible...for known prompts(like in an IVR) you can do a fuzzy logic thing where it "sounds like" x,y,z or say again...this is not possible to generate transcripts/subtitles for DVDs
Subtitles can suffer from the same paraphrasing. Also, on DVDs, they are implemented as graphic overlays, so you actually need some kind of OCR to convert them back to text.
On the technical front, you'll probably have to extract the audio from the DVD (using some ripper software, e.g. mplayer), then run it through a speech recognition program.
