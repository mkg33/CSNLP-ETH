But beware: This feature is only needed on one switch per VLAN (if it spans over a couple of switches) - so be shure to find the right one :-)
I have telnet access to a Cisco switch, only I need to enable an interface so it can start handing out IPs on a certain subnet. What commands do I need to use to get to the interface config  file or area? I had another sysadmin show me once, but he has since moved on and I inherited his setup. I've been going over the iOS manuals, but I can't see the way to do this. This is probably a really basic question, so I apologize if I'm just wasting electricity.
If your Cisco device really is a plain switch, not a router/multilayer switch then it cannot, by definition, be a DHCP server. However, multi-layer switches can, this is an excerpt from a Cisco page on the subject:
You can set up a simple DHCP service with the command "ip dhcp pool", there's a few other commands to configure do the full configuration but that will get you started. 
What you will find in the IOS documentation - and possibly confuse you - is the possibility to act as a DHCP proxy between the requesting station and the server (this is useful in large networks since DHCP uses many broadcasts).
If you just wish to direct DHCP request on VLANs on the switch to a DHCP server on another VLAN you can use the ip helper-address feature.
As said before - it much depends on the exact switchtype and the licensed features - but most Cisco L3-switches are able to hand out IP-adresses via DHCP.
