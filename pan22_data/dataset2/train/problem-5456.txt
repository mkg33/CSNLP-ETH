The game works fine on my PC, I can't figure out the Android problem though. Any ideas or help would be appreciated. I didn't want to supply code since I wouldn't know where to start that would be helpful.
I've stumbled into the very same problem lately. The game advanced only when touching the screen. From what I have found in various articles, it may have something to do with the CPU throttling that the Flash Player uses on mobile devices. Going into fullscreen removed the problem for me.
I am not sure if I will be able to provide enough information for someone to answer this question, but any ideas might help.
I am creating a tower defense game in Flash and I eventually want to make it run on Android. Just for testing purposes, I have been running it on Android's browser and different Android .swf player apps.
Recently, the game stopped working correctly. When it gets to the second wave of enemies, they get about four tiles in and stop moving. I can get them to start moving again by constantly clicking on parts of the screen. It's almost like the game loop has quit updating.
I am not sure what was happening. I am sure one of the answers was probably the problem, but I couldn't find it specifically. I rewrote my game loop and a lot of the other code that worked with it and the problem is gone.
Trying to solve the problem, I have updated the gameloop from Flash's standard events to a NativeSignal event (didn't solve the problem but the game runs much faster overall).
