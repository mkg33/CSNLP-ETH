In English it is "composite keys". For instance, take a look at MSDN website (any search containing "sql composite key" will do).
Both composite key and compound key describe a candidate key with more than one attribute. According to the Relational Database Dictionary (C.J.Date) they mean the same thing.
A composite key consists of more than one attribute to uniquely identify an entity occurrence. This differs from a compound key in that one or more of the attributes, which make up the key, are not simple keys in their own right.
In ER modelling the term "compound key" also has a more specific meaning. It means a key whose constituent attributes are references to keys in other entities - i.e. a compound key forms an identifying relationship. For most purposes, this isn't an especially useful or important concept so the terms composite/compound are often treated as interchangeable. It's probably best to stick to "composite key" unless you are referring specifically to the ER modelling concept of a compound key.
Assuming that the question regards Relational Databases, I searched for a "neutral" definition in Wikipedia:
It sounds to me like a composite key is a superset that includes compound keys. If we accept that a composite key is made of more than one attribute (of any kind), and a compound key is made of more than one simple key. A compound key is a type of composite key with a more specific meaning, but the term "composite" key is always appropriate to use.
When we have two or more fields in a table that, together, identify its records uniquely, what's the proper way of calling them? Composite or compound keys?
For example, you have a database holding your CD collection. One of the entities is called tracks, which holds details of the tracks on a CD. This has a composite key of CD name, track number.
