My question is, is there a was to force terminate anything that is running on :80? (highly unlikely as I've mentioned that it doesn't appear in any processes). Also, is there somehow a more recursive search I can do? I have done the basic grep search and an SSD search in Finder but both turn up nothing...
More to the point, when checking processes that are running on :80, I am only greeted with httpd processes. When looking at all my current active processes in ActivityMonitor, there is nothing that strikes me as unusual. I have also recursively searched for the text "It works!" throughout the machine and nothing pops up (I have also conducted other searches but found nothing). This servlet appears to be running at startup and have checked all startup menus that I am aware of and, again, nothing strikes me as out of place.
I require to run an app on localhost:80 but found that it was blocked. When going to localhost, I was greeted with this:
It seems like a process is running but the file that runs that process is gone, which I know is impossible.
