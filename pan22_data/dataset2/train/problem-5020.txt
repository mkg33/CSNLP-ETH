For example, a c3.8xlarge at $1.68 per hour will render much faster than a cluster of PIs, plus be easier to configure and setup. 
(Depending on your location, that's probably in the same ballpark as the electricity to run 20x PI.)
You mentioned 20 Rpi2 devices for your cluster. 20 x $35 = $700. If you go the AMD route (less expensive for the same performance level as Intel), you could build a desktop with 32 GB or RAM for that same dollar amount.
I have seen bunch of articles saying how raspberries could be joined to make a cluster. I basically am a 3d artist type thing and you know rendering a 10 second animation can take hours.
So if I make a cluster of about 20 or more raspberries with each having 1 GB RAM will the end result have 20 GB RAM? I just want to know what will be the role of cluster regarding the RAM? I am concerned about RAM because that's what troubles me... I don't concentrate on the processor but RAM.
Also, the RAM on the RPi (LPDDR2) is running at 400 MHz and can be accessed at a rate of 800 MT/s, whereas a (AMD-based) desktop uses RAM (DDR3) that runs at 1066 MHz and can be accessed at a rate of 2133 MT/s, about 2.5 times faster.
Of course not! Each node in your cluster needs to be able to load all of the textures / geometry etc. So it would limit the total size of your source data to (much less than) 1GB, but 20 copies.
All things considered, yes building a cluster of Pi's is a cool project. But if your aim is to access better performance, a desktop with better specs is a better solution.
The general consensus is that clusters are a waste of bandwidth. Yes, your cluster will have access to the sum of all the processing power and RAM, but you are introducing network latency into your performance equation. If you are focused more on RAM than CPU, you could build a RAM-heavy desktop for the same price as your Pi cluster.
