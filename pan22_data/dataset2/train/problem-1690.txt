The distance is just a plain math, you put values in it and get the result but then you check if it's less than 5, and what if it's not? You end up with a situation where in one frame your object is way before some trigger, but in the next frame your object has moved so far that it passed the trigger and is still far away, but on the different side. This is a well known problem in physics with fast moving objects and it's called tunelling.
To solve this issue you can use lower speeds, shorter timestep for simulation or use special kind of collision algorithms known as sweep tests. In such tests you extrude your moving object along it's movement direction, so fast moving ball would become a cylinder from balls position in one frame to position in the next frame. Then you test collisions between cylinder and walls instead of ball-walls.
Before using the distance at all it was working fine but now I want to calculate the distance to make sure it will work only when the player is exit at specific direction.
But if I'm moving the player slow very slow or much slower then it will pass inside the line and make the rest of the code in the Update.
But for some reason on high speed movement the distance calculation is not working good. It's not giving errors or exceptions it's just does nothing when exiting.
