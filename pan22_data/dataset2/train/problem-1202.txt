I would recommend not using fail2ban but running SSH (and others) on a non-standard port. I don't believe in security by obscurity but I think that this is an excellent way to reduce the noise in your logs.
Failed logins on non-standard ports will be few and far between and can also indicate more targeted attacks.
If you have the option, I simply change my SSH port to something non-standard. It doesn't necessarily make your server any more secure, but it sure cleans up the logs (and lets you see anyone deliberately trying to break in!)
You could even go a step further an install a SSH honeypot such as Kippo to 'let in' the bruteforcers and see what they would do given the chance.
The attempts are mechanized, so the numbers seem OK (yes they are high compared to some sites and the low compared to others). You should take the steps you normally have to: You consider your sites as attack targets every day, even when you do not detect an attack; not detecting an attack, does not mean it does not exist.
I just changed the ssh port away from the standard 22. My server, my rules :) just edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config, change the port and restart the service. The only down side is that you must remember to add that port to configuration to every ssh client you use.  
A few 100 is just fine... Last month I found one of my servers had 40k failed attempts. I went trough the trouble of plotting them: Map
