Ran into the same error in almost exactly the same server stack, and found a solution. The warning and error are thrown because your trying to send a job to a non registered worker. Check the name of your worker and check with ps -ax on the command line if its running. 
Manually this works fine: starting up the client, adding jobs and running one or more workers in separate shells works as intended. Now I want to run the workers using Supervisord, but this generates a lot of the following errors in the Gearman log:
I'm testing Gearman on a dedicated job-server (Ubuntu 12.04) for my PHP project (using pecl/gearman as the PHP impementation).
PS: I know you already jumped ship and moved along with Beanstalkd but maybe it can help someone else.
I'm kind of stuck here, since the error message doesn't really return results on Google. Any help is appreciated.
Sending a job to a non existing worker on the command line using gearmand -f will give you no feedback. Doing it using the pecl module results in an error.
