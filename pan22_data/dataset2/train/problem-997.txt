We don't lock the server racks, we lock the room and it's across the hall and visible from the offices of 3 or 4 IT people, so no one could get in there w/out us noticing.
Complying with these two requirements has many challenges as there are a lot of possible sysadmins and netadmins (around 10) that need access to the server room.
Racks aren't secure. You can take off the doors off of most racks in a couple of seconds even when they're locked.
We use a keysafe as well. It lives inside a mantrap between a small business operations center and the actual DC. TO get a key, you have to badge into the man-trap, badge into the safe and complete a hand scan. Then, you badge into the DC. All of this is monitored by video.
The lockbox with passcodes for each person idea mentioned above is a good one.  Re-reading the questions, I see the part about auditing key use.  I know that the lockboxes realtors use here can do this: each realtor has an electronic key that's registered to them, the lockbox records which key opens it, and the owner of the lockbox can download a report.  I don't imagine this is cheap, however...
We are considering several possible solutions but everyone has some drawbacks, mainly related to who is the key master and how to maintain availability in the case of absense of such person.
