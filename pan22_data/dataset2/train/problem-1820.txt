If a CPU could support an extra address line (making it 8GB per a channel), there should be no difficulty to support 16GB per CPU, which is not the case. Therefore, the address limitation for this CPU is 4GB per channel, and a 8GB stick will either run at half capacity, or likely will not run at all, due to BIOS confusion with memory SPD and likely an absence of corresponding entry in memory configuration table.
How the question: why would you risk and use questionable memory configuration instead of taking no risk and go with known configuration? If you already have the 8GB stick, just try it, it will not harm the laptop physically. The only side effect could be in BIOS confusion and possible security lock related to perceived tampering with memory size. But this state of BIOS can be reset to defaults. Is this your real problem?
If the User documentation and Qualified Vendor List is not available for the particular laptop, you can examine similar products designed around the mobile chips as i7-620M, e.g. HP Elitebook 8540W workstation. The page says regarding the supported memory:
So, the background logic is this. Memory capacity is determined by address space times memory width. If the memory has dual channel architecture (2 x DIMMs), and advertised limit is 8GB only, it means that each channel is limited to 4GB address space. Therefore, a 8GB DIMM memory can use only half of its space, since there is simply not enough address lines on the CPU/board side.
