Most physics engines are specialized to some degree and will simulate physics to a point that's necessary for the game. Physics engines for car games are often quite different from physics engines for 3D shooters. And the physics engine of a golf game might have excessive calculations of the interactions of the golf ball and the individual grass leaves, while completely missing the handling of high speed collisions and deformation of a car (in case it get's hit by a golf ball).
Essentially Physics engines try to simulate the effects of both gravity and collisions. For better physics engines that means they include both permanent and temporary deformation of objects, including splitting objects into multiple objects, and angular momentum of objects. Ideally they'd also simulate stress, e.g. how many trucks can cross that bridge until it collapses, but that's quite rare. Further simulation variables like air resistance would also count as physics engine, but as far as I know these haven't made it into any game yet.
The input it speed, mass, and time, the output is new speeds. Sometimes rotation/angular momentum is an input and output too.
