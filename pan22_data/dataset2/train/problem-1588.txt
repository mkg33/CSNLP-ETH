Or is it possible to interject a shutdown command if it is after a certain hour and call the bacula director to start the backup now?
Yes it's possible. I have done this a long time ago - however i can't remember exactly how but it was not hard, from what i remember there was a configuration file you simply edited.
I'm new to controlling the linux system using scripts, so any hints on how and where to start are greatly appreciated.
This problem is well known for the users of linux-based home PVR systems like MythTV (they want their video recording machine wake up when there is something to record on) and MythTV wiki gives a lot of information on this topic: http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/System_wakeup
The easiest way to accomplish this, would probably be to set the wakeup-timer in the BIOS. So the computer always boots up at backup-time. And then write a script to make sure no-one is logged in, and the backup is completed for a shutdown.
So is it possible to have the Notebooks schedules to automatically wake up from suspend or shutdown?
I am looking for an automated backup system and I like bacula. I have 3 Notebooks and a Desktop computer that need regular backup. Now I don't want to let them run all night just to do the backuping, so I was thinking I could use wake-on-lan to have bacula wake up the machines, then do the backups, and shut them down afterswards. While this may work with devices on the ethernet, it won't work with the Notebooks on the wifi. So is it possible to have the Notebooks schedules to automatically wake up from suspend or shutdown ?
