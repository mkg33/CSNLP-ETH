I'm not familiar enough with this machine to tell you how easy it is, but generally the keyboard on a machine like this is end-user replaceable, so you could simply replace it.  Alternatively, you could just open the machine and unplug the data cable connecting it to the motherboard.  (I suggest this way specifically so that it doesn't cause you grief in the BIOS or something like that, if the occasion arises.)
Tested on my Windows 10 Home Edition 1607, and it works fine. Now, I can safely put my external keyboard on the laptop's keyboard and not worry about the keys anymore.
In case you can't access gpedit.msc (group policy), what you can do is, uninstall the standard keyboard driver from device manager and don't restart the computer. Just sign out and log back in. You'll see your inbuilt keyboard won't be working. 
I solved my similar problem by clicking Start>Devices and Printers, then clicking on the icon for the computer and clicking the Hardware tab in the Properties dialog. Then I double-clicked the keyboard entry to open the Driver Properties dialog and clicked the Change Settings button, which should require administrator privileges. Once that dialog opens, click the Driver tab, and the option to disable the driver should be available. Click disable and bingo, laptop keyboard all gone away. Make sure you have you USB keyboard installed properly first.
