Assuming you have Management Studio or Management Studio Express installed, can you connect the Management Studio to the instance using sa?
The key here is CHECK_POLICY=OFF. That made the trick. I hope this will make 'sa' immune to future changes in their domain setup.
I had that problem some years ago after installing a Windows ServicePack (no SQLServer Update, but Windows), the SQLServer refused connections, until the SQLServer ServicePack was installed also! I found a message in the eventlog after some hours.
It seems that one week ago they were playing with the Windows Security policy. They were adding/removing permissions but they can't give me exactly what they did because they really didn't know (ouch!).
I think they did this, because they knew there is a big security hole and wanted to force all admins to install the pack. However, since it is some time ago, I don't no the exact versions and so on. I would recommend, you double check you event log and install all/newest service packs.
Like @SpaceManSpiff said, don't forget to check if Mixed mode is enabled. Someone changed that setting for me and I had the same problem. Here is how to solve it:
Oh and the always catch all in windows, reboot (seriously, this helps my test SQL server after I've done stuff to it)
