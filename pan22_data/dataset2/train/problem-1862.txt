Is this a problem with the hosts file not working or is it a problem with no DNS resolution at all working on the machine (ping, IE, etc.)?
sfc /scannow didn't work for me but installing this .msi did : http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972034
Short answer is that after trying all sorts of things, I ended up with "Winsock XP Fix" which someone built some years back after noting that the registry entries related to WinSock were actually the same between systems, and that sometimes they end up corrupted.
Next time, check \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\DataBasePath in the registry to see if the location of your hosts file is correct and the same as where Windows assumes it to be.
From what you have done, and the list of things you have checked makes me think some sort of system failure as it looks like you have done the correct things, try doing "SFC /SCANNOW" from the command line just to test for system problems. 
It used to work. I used to have numerous redirects in there. But it stopped working a few weeks ago.
