An alternative approach would be to configure the box that is allowed to connect as a proxy server with some NAT and set up your own private subnet.  But I would really advise that you talk to your admins also.
Well, you will need to tell the Admins the MAC of your router. Technically, that should work. But they likely will get you, as multiple computers will generate a different traffic pattern than a single computer. I would look out for that because there are just too many students like you that are too "clever" for their own good. 
Assuming your router can clone the registered system's MAC address and supports PPPoE, it should work just fine. 
As the others said: you will have to clone the MAC adress. Besides that, if you have a good router, you can turn on "TTL mangling" - this way it will be harder to detect the machines behind the router.
I'm puzzled as to why you don't want the admins to know, as it seems like a reasonably legit thing you want to do.  Unless there is something more going on that you haven't told us about, but anyway...
I wouldn't advocate a MAC address cloning/spoofing solution; the admins will likely be able to determine the types of devices connecting to the internet via SNMP queries if they're any way competent, and you could possible end up getting yourself into some trouble with your college authorities.  You don't want that do you?
You might want to change the title of your question. It looks like you are asking for "hacking" advice.
