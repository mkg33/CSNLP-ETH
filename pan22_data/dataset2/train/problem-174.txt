The HDD does what you are describing automatically when it discovers a bad sector (until it runs out of spares). If you want to force it to scan for (and handle), bad sectors rather than wait for them to be discovered, chkdsk /r will do that.
If data preservation is your aim, get a new disk as soon as possible. You will, of course, already have at least 2 separate backups of the data anyway!
After you run chkdsk /r, additional bad sectors should be extremely rare on a drive that is not in the process of failing.  If you are doing this because you are aware of bad sectors, repeat the process periodically (say at least once per week for at least a month).  If you see any additional bad sectors, that is a pretty good indication that the drive is dying.
There is software that is aimed at preserving data on drives with problems. Unfortunately, the majority of it is not free. Spinrite from grc.com will do very thorough scans of your drive resetting data issues from drifting heads and ensuring that damaged sectors are recovered. However, it is around USD90.
