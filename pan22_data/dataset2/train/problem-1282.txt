To make things worse I've also tried to use the primary mail adress of the deleted mailbox for a newly created distribution list, but that won't work. Users trying to mail that adress receive an NDR stating 5.1.1.
The problematic mailbox had previously been attached to a user who was still in the system, so I created a new mailbox for that user and then detached it. When I did that, two mailboxes appeared in the list of detached mailboxes , one of them being the "ghost" mailbox. I deleted both of them and the problem was solved.
I've deleted a mailbox and it's user in Exchange 2010. Now I'm getting the following warnings in the event log of the Exchange server:
It seems like the mailbox somehow lives inside the Exchange server, but I really don't understand how or why.
I can't find any corresponding mailbox, which is why I suspect that the GUID belonged to the deleted mailbox. The user who had the mailbox attached is deleted as well.
It bothers me somewhat that this happened and that I can't explain it, but the important thing is that the problem was solved for now at least.
