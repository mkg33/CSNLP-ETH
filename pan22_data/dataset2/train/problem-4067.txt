IxChariot. Not free, but it can simulate all kinds of traffic. SmallNetBuilder.com uses it for their product tests.
You can use D-ITG software. It's free and can be downloaded from http://www.grid.unina.it/software/ITG/
I also like testing with NDT, but it is isn't quite as easy to work with as iperf since NDT basically has to be setup as a server somewhere, and the client must have java installed.
I would pipe something like /dev/urandom (or /dev/zero to test the devices' compression if any) across using two *nix machines.
I find iperf to be one of the more useful utilities to test point-to-point bandwidth.  It has many options to test over tcp/udp, with udp it can tell you how much jitter there was.  Ports of iperf are available for almost every OS.
I have used it to test several computers connected in a network with various operating system. Throughput, jitter and delay can be easily measured.
Many command-line FTP clients report transfer statistics, so you could simply use FTP to GET or PUT a large enough file for the statistics to be meaningful.
