3) openfiles /query /v > file.txt [ENTER] (This will create a file on the desktop with a list of all the opened files on the server.)
I believe you are going to want to refer back to Sky100's post as he is correct, not in providing you with what you asked, but in providing you with what you need to resolve your issue. You will need to reference the locked ID number via the "openfile /query /v" (verbose) command as it will supply you with the data you need. Search for the file name within the list given, the data will show which item has the read & write enabled, and along with it will provide a specific ID number. No, you may not be able to find which specific system has the file locked, but with the tools provided, you can disconnect that user from the file. Here is a step-by-step to simplify my ramblings.
4) Open the file.txt and search for the line containing both your file name and the Read + Write permissions.
As long as you have Administrative rights on the file server, it will disconnect that system from the file and assuming your system is automated, should allow things to keep moving along as needed.
