Lately we have been bitten by a few bugs that made it into release updates.  The latest being scroll bars in select dropdowns not being draggable.
So automatic updates can be completely disabled, and rely on the IT staff pushing out each update after appropriate testing.
We have disabled automated updates, test new versions in limited deployments and, when they test "good", deploy the new MSIs to "upgrade" the old versions. Sounds like something very similar to what you're looking to do.
I have Chrome deployed fairly widely in a few different Customers and I've had to contend with this.
We want more control over when people get updated - so we can have a few of the more tech savvy staff try the newest version with our internal applications before everyone gets it.
Instead of watching the release blog, I came up with a relatively simple script to identify when a new version is released.  With a few tweaks this could be fed into a monitoring system to alert you that there is a new version to test:
From watching the last few updates, it looks like a new MSI file is released with each release channel update, both major and minor.
This downloads the latest MSI file (hopefully google doesn't change that link...it was rather difficult to find a direct link to it), calculates the MD5sum to see if it has changed, and extracts the version number from the comments field of the MSI.
