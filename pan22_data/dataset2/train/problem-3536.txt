One thing to watch for when setting time formats in excel is that the format "hh:mm" ignores the number of days and similarly "mm:ss" will ignore the number hours entered in the cell.
The formula for the cell containing the average will be the same as any other type of average ( =SUM(XX:XX)/X ,OR =AVERAGE(XX:XX) )
I was trying to do some math on time values, and I ended up here at this page looking for help.  Strangely, though, none of the cell format suggestions listed here were working for me...
Of course this is not the number result that it should be(I have not calculated it manually yet but I am sure it is not 0).
...until I finally realized that my data, which I'd imported from a file, had spaces in front of most of the time values.  Once I removed the spaces, Excel was HAPPY to run all manner of formulas, correctly, on my time data.
If you want duration time, not time of day, use the format "[h]mm:ss" and not the format "mm:ss".  Normal math functions (e.g. average, sum, etc.) should then work.
This will return the absolute number of hours or minutes - useful if your sum of times goes over 24 hours or 60 minutes
If you are getting strange looking results when manually calculating average times try putting square brackets around highest level unit of time in your format:
First, highlight all of the cells that you will be using for the calculation. (The cells containing the values that you will be adding, and the cell containing the average of all of the times.) Right click the collective highlighted cells, and click "Format Cells". In the Number Tab, choose Custom from the selections on the left side of the window. In the type drop down selection box, look for the value "h:mm". Select that option, and click ok.
