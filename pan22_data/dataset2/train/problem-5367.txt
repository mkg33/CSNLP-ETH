I've seen this a long time ago, in the Win 2000 days, when the time difference between the client and the server was off by more than 5 minutes.  It gives you weird errors that makes you think it's a dns issue when it's really not.  
Yeah this is a weird issue, and it has been bugging me for weeks. I would love to know the fix for it. I have also noticed that I can browse by IP address.
Did you by chance stop and/or disable the Windows Firewall service in Windows 7 (as opposed to merely disabling the firewall itself)?
Do you still use wins and netbios?  Maybe the netbios over tcp is disabled?  When we finally shut wins off we had to go to fqdn, but then again we might be doing something wrong and don't know it. 
I saw a whole network going completely nuts because someone used a GPO to actually disable the service, instead of only configuring the firewall to be off.

Just had the problem show up on ONE newly loaded Windows 7 machine.  Everything comes up fine, works fine, then after an unknown period of time (a day or two), the machine gives the exact symptoms described above.  One interesting note - even during these symptoms, I can go to a command prompt and PING the servername just fine.
One more side note:  I was able to alleviate the problem by typing in... \servername.domainname.extension  - then everything works just fine.
