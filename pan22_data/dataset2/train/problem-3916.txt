If you had better switches I would suggest you setup SNMP monitoring of the ports used between the switches to see if you are actually using all your bandwidth between the two.  Since those appear to be un-managed you really can't do much.  
I do recommend that you start looking into managed switches, and go with a Gigabit switch. It takes knowledge to manage one (a managed switch), so bear that in mind when you consider complexity and cost.
Companies put dozens of computers and/or phones on switches with a "single wire" connecting those switches to other switches or a router (the outside world) all the time. You don't need a complicated setup, and you can easily use a CAT5 or CAT6 cable to achieve the 100ft distance, as Aseq pointed out.
With that switch, I suspect connecting two ports will take down your network.  You will create a loop. You need a switch that supports bonding (aka etherchannel) if you want to combine the capacity of multiple ports.  
If you use a Gbit (gigabit) switch, that means that each port can handle up to 1 billion bits per second. So your "single wire" to the other switch or to the outside world could (theoretically) max out at a Gbit speed (and I doubt you have such fast internet). 
You will only have the capacity of a single port between the two switches.  Keep in mind that these are switches, which means this only applies to traffic that actually needs to cross that link to access something connected to the switch on the other side.
