I honestly couldn't foresee much of a performance gain from having three seperate vm's, mainly for the fact that i'm guessing they'll be on the same host, and therefore will still be fighting over disk i/o.  Also, with seperate vm's any queries that go across databases will have to hit the other vms.  Seperate vm's also means more overhead.  Each vm means more overhead on the host, and more overhead for each seperate os.  These are all resources that you otherwise could allocate to one vm..
[side note]: http links aren't working for some reason, so here is the link to a small description about memory sharing: http://www.cdhtalkstech.com/2008/11/03/memory-sharing-–-vmware-has-it-and-the-others-don’t-part-1/
It depends on the utilization, and how much you will need to scale. Vertical scaling (adding CPU and memory) in VMware only goes so far. Multiple copies of the O/S in memory don't necessarily apply because VMware will share memory between the VMs. 
I'm curious why you are deploying a SQL cluster across two ESX hosts? Do you have VirtualCenter? So, to sum it up, running 3 DBs on a single VM is good until you need to scale. I would then consider splitting them out, and possibly put my ESX hosts in a cluster, and enable HA, DRS, and maybe fault tolerance. :D
