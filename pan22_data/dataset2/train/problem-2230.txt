I came across your question while facing the same issue on my Linux-powered laptop though I haven't found a hint of what OS you use.
I solved this problem on my Asus N552VW (and I think is a common problem for all the Asus computers) this way:
If you use Linux, this info will be relevant to you. However, it was concluded that there is no way to implement a fix to this issue in the current X-server driver. There are some bug reports in different bug trackers:
Go in C:\Program Files (x86)\ASUS\ASUS Smart Gesture\AsTPCenter\model\ and edit the file InertiaSetting.ini as Administrator.
At the beginning, the new behaviour seems weird and scrolling is not the same as before, but the annoying problem of zoom-in when doing anything regarding CTRL will be only an old, bad dream.
Is there a way to disable this or is this a bug ? I don't think it's an issue with the touchpad sensitivity though.
Every time I scroll, there's a 1sec (not sure) delay before the scrolling stops when I lift my fingers from the touchpad, and it will automatically zoom when I press control afterwards.
For example, I'm on a webpage, I scroll all the way down, lift my fingers from the touchpad and I want to change tabs directly with ctrl+tab. The page than zooms in or out because I pressed control during the after-scroll delay...
The root cause is obviously in X-server and others report consequences. However, it is concluded that it is not fixable in current X-server driver. The only workaround is to disable or minimize inertial scrolling:
