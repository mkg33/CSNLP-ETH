WinRM is capable of using HTTPS transport, and if your machines are in the domain and have your enterprise certificates on them already, it should Just Work.
Some have a whitelist of what IPs are allowed to connect. You might do the whitelisting in sshd or in iptables.  On windows, in the  windows firewall, or possibly in winrm itself?  There are lots of possibilities.  
You should also consider how much you trust the different vendors/implementations.  Do you expect to see remotely exploitable bugs in openssh & *nix more or less than in windows?  Trying to word this so as not to be a troll - it's obviously a loaded question.  But the issue is very real.    
the bottom line, though, is that any remote-access service like ssh or winrm has risks and benefits.  From what I can tell they provide roughly analogous functionality.  If they provide similar levels of AAA then you might treat them similarly in your security posture.    E.g., if WinRM uses https certificates for authentication, but openssh allows passwords sent over the wire (one possible config), WinRM's AAA is probably better.  
As far as what that security posture specifically should be...some people put ssh out in the open on port 22, some people require a VPN before you can connect. Some use security through obscurity and put ssh on port 222 instead of port 22.  
Are the privileges of each service limited?  E.g., on Linux you might run selinux so that inbound ssh connections can only do certain operations.
