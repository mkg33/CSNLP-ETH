Wrapping the script in a try block makes it fail silently. reopen opens a new terminal window if there are no visible windows or if only for example the preferences window is open. Finder also has an insertion location property, which is usually target of Finder window 1 or the desktop. But there is a bug in 10.7 and later where it often refers to some other window than the frontmost window.
I think the title states exactly what I want to do. I want a shortcut or even a button within Finder which fires up a new iTerm Tab and changes the location to the location i've open in Finder. Some sort of open . in reverse. :-)
If you want the script to reuse existing tabs, replace the tell current terminal block with something like this:
I guess it is because the internals of iTerm has changed, but none of the solutions worked for me. What did was the following code:
Using the other answers on this page I have created an App that can be dragged into the finder task bar. 
Iterm Preferences and Under Profiles tab, go to General subtab, set Working Directory to “Reuse previous session’s directory”.
