Now your music library will ONLY show music in E:/music AND your other sound files remain unhidden, so other apps can use them normally.
BEFORE INSTALLING Just hide all the sound files you don't want in your music library (make files 'hidden'), then install '13 all mods' (link above), then unhide those sound files. 
Note: this app will not show an icon in you menu, but it will be in you app list in 'application manager'. There, you can uninstall it, and this will undo any features you selected i.e. it will show all your sound files, ring tones and it will re-enable nokia-hands etc.
There is a very easy way to do this. This method does not involve keeping your sound files 'hidden'. This means your files will still be accessible from other apps. Also, you DO NOT not need to hack your phone for this.
When you install, it may say 'phone not supported', BUT INSTALL IT ANYWAY. This just means that not all the extra options will work for your phone (e.g. disable nokia hands), but you should expect the music thing to work properly. 
You can also do other cool things like disable the nokia hands boot screen so your phone turns on faster. All of the features are optional during install. Your phone may not support all the options, but hopefully it will work for the music library function.
This little app will let you do exactly what you want. The music library will now only look in E:\music (memorycard>'music' folder) 
HOWEVER, when you install it, it will still show your ring tones and other sound files, but it wont show any further sound files that you add to your phone unless you put them in E:\music. THERE IS A VERY EASY WAY AROUND THIS:
