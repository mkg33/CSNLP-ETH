Technically, there's no way that you can stop someone else from formatting this disk if they want to. However, there might be a simple solution:
I think what you are asking is impossible to achieve. If a user has admin access to the drive they will always be able to format it.  The only way to achieve this is to not allow anyone else physical access to the drive. If someone plugs your drive into their machine they can do whatever they like.
Get a big sticker and write this on it with a RED marker: "Please, do NOT format this disk! It contains important information that need to be preserved."
I once had a problem with a NAS hard disk, which didn't work anymore. So I removed the disk from the container and connected it with a special cable to my computer, formatted the disk and then put it back in the NAS container. That worked just fine.
Of course, if they can do that, then they can just delete any truecrypt file too.. the only actual way, is LowTek.. lock and key, lasers and dogs.. steel and concrete.. like a buried safe, with monitored alarm system and seismic detectors.. or in a bank vault.. surrounded by storm-troopers.. you get the idea.
The only way to prevent others from formatting it and using it as a new disk would be by using a strong sledgehammer and some brute force. Unfortunately, that would also destroy all data that's on it.
That way, people won't confuse it for an empty drive, they can see its got something critical on it, assuming they can read, and they are not automatically prompted to format should they shove it in their mommies puter.
I don't think you can force that. On the old floppies, yes, but on an actual hard drive, if someone wants to format, they will.
