I believe that some programs that create middle, hidden proxies to handle various net services (like Internet Download Manager, Net Limiter or some Wireless Printers drivers and software) may set to 127.0.0.1 the outgoing traffic to catch it and possibly intervene.
one thing I noticed that fixed upload exceeding limit issue was that the "Apply rate limit to transport overhead" and "Apply rate limit to UTP connections" boxes were unchecked. This must have happended when I went to the newest version, cus I noticed my download speed suffering the very next day. Once I checked those 2 boxes the upload speed went from 300k plus to the 150k I had set. Hope this helps someone.
To make sure that the upload limit you set in uTorrent is respected, go to Options > Preferences > Bandwidth > Global Rate Limit Options and make sure that the "Apply rate limit to transport overhead" and "Apply rate limit to uTP connections" boxes are checked/enabled.
Go to "scheduler" and, if you're not using it, mark the entire time panel with the "light green" color (click several times on the time panel to get the right color and then drag the pointer to fill the entire panel).
Well, it's not a real solution but it could be a possible explanation and a good workaround for this over-discussed bug.
2) Enable (Check) the option 'Apply rate limit to uTP Connections' and 'Apply rate limit to transport overhead' as shown in the following snapshot! 
The reason the upload limit may seems to be ignored is because it is not applied for local peers. Peers that may be on the same subnet as you.
This may deceive uTorrent making it think that all the peers you're uploading to are on your LAN (notoriously not subjected to global bandwidth limitations).
