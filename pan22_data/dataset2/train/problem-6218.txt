The solution listed in the quora thread isn't working. I tried it with two ubuntu images and the instance won't boot with that user data set.
Now that a marketplace image cannot be attached to a random server, which I already had running. The solution was actually very simple. Just create a new instance from same AWS Marketplace AMI and you can attach the image to that.
Is there a recent workaround? I'm not trying to access anything secret since I have been using the stock Debian AMIs. I just want to fix that issue without having to re-do everything.
I used the official Debian Amazon Marketplace AMI. Now I'm not allowed to mount the volume somewhere else as a secondary device to fix my stupidity.
I'm encountering the same problem as here: http://www.quora.com/Amazon-EC2/Is-it-possible-to-rescue-an-EBS-volume-which-has-marketplace-codes.
I'm sorry, but I suspect there's sod all you can do about it.  Start again from an open AMI, build out with Chef scripts, optionally integrate those with AWS OpsWorks to give you some kind of deployment mechanism.
Basically I've locked myself out of the instance and I don't have any snapshots. I was working on a larger setup and for security reasons I tried setting up UsePam no in sshd_config which borked everything.
