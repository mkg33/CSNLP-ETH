and then I selected Visual Studio's window and used ctrl-space to toggle always on top. It worked like a charm.
In my case, I was able to get it out of that mode by using Window->Float to undock a tab. After I dragged the tab back onto the main window, it was no longer stuck on top.
When I got this problem I found a solution to the reverse problem over at How-To Geek. Luckily it involved a TOGGLE which I could use to disable the always on top mode that Visual Studio's window had gotten into. As per the above link, I added this to my AutoHotkey script
Always-on-top status can be switched by clicking the pushpin on the program title bar when FileBox eXtender is running.
Very strange though, for months I didn't have this problem, and earlier when I started debugging, my window was behind Visual Studio's window... Thought it strange as it never happened before. Closed Visual Studio, reopened it, and viola.  
Maybe for some reason, the always-on-top property of your Visual Studio (VS) is being saved somewhere and then reloaded on run.
Depending on your VS version, you may be able to use FileBox eXtender(FBX) to change its always-on-top property for each run or permanently. It is probably better to use the version matching your Windows' architecture; 64-bit for x64 and 32-bit for x86. Also, FBX can probably be only used for elevated-mode programs if itself is run in elevated mode (e.g. "Run as Administrator").
Perhaps an addin is causing it? Try disabling addins in Tools/Add-in manager then run Visual Studio in safe mode by executing
