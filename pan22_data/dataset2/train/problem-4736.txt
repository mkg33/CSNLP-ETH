In "Manage Sources" the Preview gave the citation as ( Gov...) with a space before the name that shouldn't have been there.
A custom style could result in unexpected behaviour such as you are seeing. On the other hand, downloading new custom styles could fix your problem. 
I entered a name (Government of South Australia) in the publisher field for a piece of legislation, and left author blank. I then changed my mind, and moved the name from publisher to author. Then I decided that it should be a corporate author, to stop the name from being reordered as 'Australia, Government of South'.
In Word 2003, my APA formated bibliographies are alphabetic, and selecting IEEE 2006 makes them numbered in order of place in document. 
Sounds like you are using the Inset Citation, Manage Sources and Bibliography functions, which tend to work really well.
Editing the source and unticking and then reticking the corporate author check box fixed the issue, and now the source plots under "G" rather than at the start of the list.
