Continuous backups make sense since unless you're seriously unlucky and everything fries at once. Backups mitigate risk, not eliminate it. It takes pretty bad luck to lose your main and backup drives at once, and well, its better to have a backup, than to not have one, lose your drive, and then realise there's nowhere to get the data from. 
Most drives tend to keep on running until they die and it tends to be sudden. What should you be looking out for? 
Tech Report tried to kill a few drives, and the results were interesting. I'm combining data from there and ssdendurancetest.com in my answer.
Reallocated sector counts seem to be a good sign that a drive is starting to fail. That said, TR's limited sample size only really started to fail at 100TB at worst (and that drive ran for another 800TB) and their best case drive ran fine until 1100TB, and failed 100tb later.
Best case scenario would be that the drive goes into read only mode. Intel drives do this, and chances are you can get your data out should that happen. Apparently one of the drives that ssdendurancetest tested throttles back on errors. It was a 'premature' failure, but its indicitive of what may happen with the drive.
