By typing solve(x^4 - 3*x^3 + x^2 - 1 == 0), MATLAB will simply state that the roots for this equation are the roots to the given polynomial, and it will express this roots using the root function. Take a look on the documentation of the function to understand how it works and what does it do. Notice that you can get find explicitly the roots, setting the maximum degree of the polynomial when calling the solve function. Notice, also, that not every polinomial will have a closed form solution.
The problem is that you are using the symbolic toolbox, something I highly discourage to do. If you have a numerical problem, use a numerical algorithm to get what you want.
If you are working with polynomials - and polynomials only - you will be much better off if you use MATLAB's extensive library on polynomials. Check the documentation on how to create polynomials here and how to get the roots of the polynomial here. Essentially, you define a polynomial saving in an array its coefficients and use the roots to get the (numerical) roots.
