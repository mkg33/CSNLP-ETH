However, isStrike and isSpare are mutually exclusive, so perhaps an enum could be used to express STRIKE and SPARE states.  You could also add states for UNPLAYED, PARTIAL & FINISHED to track whether or not there are rolls left in the frame.
BowlingFrame and Roll contain unused information.  frame.roll1.isSpare and frame.roll2.isStrike are never used.  It would make more sense for isStrike and isSpare to be members of BowlingFrame, at which point Roll would only contain pinsKnockedDown, so that class should be removed, and BowlingFrame instead contain two integers for the pin counts for roll 1 & 2.
DiusBowlingGame: looks like a GOD class to me, you should try to reduce the responsibilities here. for example, Game simulation should never be part of the game itself and also, you can think of scoring logic as a separate strategy class on it own
The 10th frame scoring is flawed.  A strike grants two additional rolls; a spare grants one additional roll.  Neither of these are currently handled.
