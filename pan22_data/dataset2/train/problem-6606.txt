We are a very small ecommerce business and we are trying to find a remote monitoring tool something in the lines of the ResMon/PerfMon in Windows in order to monitor our dedicated Windows 2008 R2 server. The main features we need are:
Try appfirst. It does all of what you are asking for and is easy to validate because it's a SAAS tool.  
We had used Zenoss Core for a while but it ended up being a pain for our Windows servers.. it looked like Enterprise was probably better, but we weren't ready to cough up that much for it. We switched to IPHostMonitor and it's been working great for us so far :-) Not open source, but it's the best "low cost" solution I could find.  http://www.iphostmonitor.com/
Any suggestions? I found PowerAdmin ServerMonitor, Munin, Nagios, OpManager, OpMon etc searching google but I don't have time to setup & evaluate everything. 
Check out spiceworks, (free but ad supported) it is supposedly easy to use & fairly comprehensive.  We use something else because our needs are different but this seems to get good feedback for similar situations.
