If the above if true this might be automated through a script(that connects as admin and performs the desired actions).
You will get a list of the Remote Sessions in the command window. Make sure the account you're logged in on your client computer has admin rights on the server. You can also use the server's IP address instead of the server's name.
Open up the Terminal Services Management console on a domain member computer and connect to the system in question.
If you have the proper administrative tools set up, there is a tool you can use to manage remote sessions. Hit your start key and type Remote Desktop Services Manager into the search box. It should find an entry of the same name that you can run. If you don't see that entry, try connecting to a Windows Server system and looking there.
Time to time I can't login to my Windows Server 2003 because there are to many open sessions. Is it possible to close them remotely(without physical contact in server room)?
When the window opens, there will be an area on the left side that says, "Remote Desktop Services Manager", with a computer (probably your computer) listed underneath. Right click on the Remote Desktop Services Manager option and choose "Connect to Computer". A window will open where you can choose "Another Computer" and enter the computer name that you are unable to reach. Now the name of the locked computer will show in the list. Click on it, the section to the right will show information about that computer, including a tab that will show any open sessions. From here, you can right-click on a session and choose to disconnect, logoff, or reset it. Do that, and you will be able to connect to the computer via remote desktop again.
This will list all sessions on the remote machine, which you can then reset (kill), or log off individually.
You need the session ID of the RDP session in order to disconnect a user. This command shows you all sessions
