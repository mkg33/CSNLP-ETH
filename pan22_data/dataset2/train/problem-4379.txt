Put the colliders on the the objects in your scene that you don't want the sword to pass through and leave off the rigidBody. You don't have to have a rigidBody on those objects for the collision detection to make the object have a physical presence in the scene, and if it is an object that does need a rigidBody, you can mark the body as isKinematic in the editor. That means it will not accept an in-coming force (therefore it wont get moved).
I have Cube with a sword like object as its child object. But when the cube moves in the scene the sword goes into the other objects in the scene. The sword have a BoxCollider attached to it but the scene contains objects that are stationary and don't have a Rigidbody attached as I don't want them to be controlled by physics, same for the sword. If I attach Rigidbody to it then it will be displaced from its main position on collision. 
You may want to read up on the Unity Docs on RigidBody and Colliders because depending on how you set this up will change how you script things like OnCollision()
I tried to render only the Cube including the sword with one camera having higher depth value then the main camera in the scene. If my game was in first person then this works fine but In 3rd person when object get behind other objects in the scene we can still see the object.
