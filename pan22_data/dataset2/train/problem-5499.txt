You don't specify if the PCs are on a wired or wireless network. If you're using wireless, plug them both into ethernet ports on your router. 
Uncompressing archives should be plenty speedy on a moderate computer. For scripting purposes you can use a combination of batch files, folder monitors, etc.
If your router is inaccessible or doesn't have ethernet ports, buy a cheap ethernet hub or switch. Even if the switch isn't connected to your main network, you can configure the wired network adaptors your PCs on a different network than their wireless adaptors.
Check out this comment to a related Lifehacker article that suggests using Windows' "Offline Files" feature to quickly sync multiple files between computers.
Actually 2GB over a modern network should be quite fast. It's all the small files that is the problem.
1) Reconsider Dropbox. After installing it, check preferences and ensure that the checkbox for "Enable LAN Sync" is checked. It'll then go direct to the two machines.
2) If you don't mind a command line, robocopy /mir would be a fast and easy way to do this with a quick batch file. The /mir argument tells it to make the destination target look like the source -- it won't copy stuff that hasn't changed so can dramatically speed up those copies.
Use SyncToy 2.1 (it copies only files that have been modified) and schedule the task. The files must be manually synched before you use the first time; use 'echo.'
