If you don't use SharePoint, as far as I can tell you should have no problems, aside from some decisions to make re: file type handling (as Richard pointed out).
With older versions of Office (not 2003/2007, though) there can also be problems where they used the same .dll files and features "leak" from one version to the other.
Yes. Specifically with SharePoint (WSS 3.0). If you ever use the 'Edit in Datasheet' functionality of SharePoint lists in Internet Explorer, you can not install any Office 2007 components with the SharePoint extensions - they must be explicitly excluded at the time of installation.
Yes - I had Outlook 2003 installed on one machine, then installed Office Home & Student 2007 (which doesn't include Outlook).  Generally it worked OK, but the insert clip art feature didn't work - it wanted the Office 2003 component for some reason.
Whenever I open one version of Word/Excel/PP/etc (say open 2007 versions) and then tries to open 2003 version, I am almost always prompted with this message that initialize office application for the first time use.
If you use a COM Add-in, then it will be added into all versions; you can't install into one and not another.
However, depending on the version of Exchange that's being connected to, there can be problems with having both Exchange 2003 and 2007 and using them both.
