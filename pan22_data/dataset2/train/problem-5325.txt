a few days ago my Apache server randomly started hogging the CPU during which time the site becomes sluggish and unresponsive. 
Once you know which particular URLs are taking along time you may be able to do something to determine the why. Perhaps by adding debugging code or something.
You could also add %D to your access log format so that you can post analyse which requests are taking a long time.
The Extended status, which should be on by default in Apache v2.4, but turn it back on if you have turned it off, will show you which URLs are running for a long time and thus may give you some indication as to what is happening. It may well already be present below the output you have already shown.
Each incident lasts 15-30 minutes and then the situation returns to normal for a while, until another incident occurs. 
W stands for "Sending Reply" (as per the key in the output of the server status), rather than some form of waiting state. This is the state between having received the full body of the request and completing sending the response.
