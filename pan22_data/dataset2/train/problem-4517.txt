A slightly more security-minded approach would be to make Windows more like Linux and install an SSH server (perhaps full-blown cygwin, perhaps one of the SSH-server-only packages that I've seen on t'internet)
In my experience there are two things that could be going wrong. The first and most common is whether or remote shutdown is allowed. In the Local Security Policy (Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Local Security Policy). Expand Local Policies and open up Security Options. "Network Access: Sharing and security model for local accounts" needs to be set to Classic.
A stupid evil hack would be to create a service listening on a port of your chosing that does nothing more than execute shutdown (perhaps psshutdown from the PsTools suite if XP home does not include such a command). Any connection attempt to that port should trigger a shutdown, so of course you open yourself up to annoyance if someone so much as port scans your test box...
As another answer has said the machine name is required, even if you have already specified an IP address. Try using something like this:
