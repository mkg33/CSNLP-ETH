The issue here is most likely that the basic speed on core and memory (157/300) does not provide enough power for the hdmi output.
I would have to guess that it is a hardware problem or technical software setting? Do you have a VGA cable because you could try that and see if that works? It will give you slightly less quality if you are trying to play blurays or something however. You should also try checking the refresh rates. If it is too high or low it may be causing the flickering. You should be able to experiment with this by right clicking the desktop and going to 'graphic properties'. There are also a lot of other settings in this panel that you can try playing around with. Check the specs of the TV to make sure you our outputting the correct refresh rate. If you make any headway, then post here again and I will see if that helps me any in diagnosing your problem. Best of luck! 
PS. Ofcourse you can always reprogram the GPU Bios, but that seems a bit harsh move for dealing with an issue such as this.
Dirty FIX: put something else playing on desktop meanwhile, so the gpu automatically up's the core and memory speeds higher.
