Try removing the Mso.dll file in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Office## (32-bit) or C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Office## (64-bit), where ## is the Microsoft Office version number.  Then perform a repair installation of Visual Studio.  Be sure to create a restore point before you do this.
This is old, but likely applies to this version: The Windows Installer dialog box may appear every time that you start Visual Studio .NET.
This happens every single time I open an Office application, even though the progress bar on the window seems to complete every time.
Go to control panel's "Programs and Features", select "Microsoft Office...", and then click "Repair".  This did not require the original Office CDROM.
I Googled a bit, and I found a note about disabling the Visual Studio add-ins for Office (which must have installed with Visual Studio).  I have done this.  
Ever since I installed Visual Studio 2012, when starting any Office application, I get a box that says "Please wait while Windows configures Visual Studio 2012..." and I have to sit around for about a minute.
Try running one of your usual Office shortcuts 'as Administrator'. You should be able to do this by holding Shift and right-clicking the shortcut, then choosing 'Run as Administrator'. You'll get the usual message and the Office application will start. Then just close it and try again the normal way. In my experience this will clean up any lingering setup issues.
