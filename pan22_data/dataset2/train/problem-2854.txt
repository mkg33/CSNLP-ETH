Note that since this is a corporate machine I'm also unable to upgrade Internet Explorer to the latest version.
Thus, my question is if there is a way around this, besides using Firefox or not connecting to the hard drive? 
Back up this file, then remove it and reboot.  You should find that you are prompted for the correct username/password now.
You're using IE to access a windows share? What happens if you use Windows Explorer to map a drive (persistent) and then exclusively use IE to access the site?
Are you accessing the application from the remote desktop?  If this is the case, you will potentially be authenticated on that instance as a different user.
Here, you can enter server names or wildcards where you use different credentials than the logged in user.  IE can automatically add entries if you were ever prompted for Windows pass-through authentication to a web site and ticked the "Remember this password" checkbox.
IE and other Windows components use this list to determine whether to login to network resources with alternate credentials, such as web sites enabled for Windows pass-through authentication.
I have encountered an issue between Internet Explorer 6 (SP2) and IIS, although it seems that IE6 is the primary cause of the problem. When I attempt to access one of our internal intranet applications that uses IIS Windows Authentication the application thinks that I am a different user instead of my main account. The account that is being provided is actually one that I use to log on to the remote system to access the hard drive, I have been able to verify this by examining the log files.
