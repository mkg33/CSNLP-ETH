You will end up with a domain controller that has a 60-days-old copy of the Active Directory database; this may or may not be a problem, depending on various factors:
If there's something else here you're not telling us that makes this impossible then, well, you need to tell us before we can help...
If all this server is, is a domain controller, then install a new domain controller, transfer the roles, and its all good. A few hours work, tops. No need to restore old backups, no need to mess about no problems.
Usually when you restore the system state, it removes all the Windows updates that you did, along side with the software that you have installed. I believe your AD should be fine.
Also, it would be really useful to know why you want to restore that system state backup. More specifically, do you need to recover the server itself or the Active Directory database?
If, as you said, you have other working domain controllers in the forest root domain, then you can just shut down this server and forcibly remove it from the Active Directory using NTDSUtil:
Finally, reinstall the operating system on it, add it back to the domain and make it again a DC using DCPROMO.
