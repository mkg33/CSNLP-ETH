A splitter, though you must remember you half the bandwidth with each splitter if both devices are running it and in your case Quarter it if you had all 4 pulling on the bandwidth at the same time though in your and my situation improbable.
Been looking into the same thing but different reasons. Your options are a switch box (ISP as stated previously needs to be checked. TWC limits to one modem access).
A router. Great option for you as your going directly off the connection line and the router will provide as a splitter under a single IP.
And a Access point which sadly I'm fearing more and more is my only option. If you go with this option get a Duel band router and access point. The router and access point need to have signal strength of 300mbs each as the access point will use the 5GHz channel to receive from the router and output through the 2.4GHz channel as well as the ethernet ports on the back or front depending on model. Drawback to this is you will limit your future proofness of your home if the ISP's ever give true fiberwire bandwidth of 1Gbs. If your on the Google fiberwire city list go the rout of the router as all other ISPs in the area will raise their bandwidth to stay a competitor. If your not and you don't plan to live their longer than 4 years and already have a duel band router go for the access point.
But talk to your provider first and as for possibility of using this one, they maybe blocking access only for one computer at a time.
You need something like this, it's an ethernet switch, it's basicly a more sofisticated hub. 10/100Mbit if you don't have faster internet. No need for setting up, just plug and play. http://amzn.com/B00002EQCW
