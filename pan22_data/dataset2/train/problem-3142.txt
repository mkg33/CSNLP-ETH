It's quite possible that the data could be recovered.  Formatting a disk only wipes the metadata area; the data is entirely untouched.  Writing data to part of the drive may not over-write the area containing the data you're trying to destroy.  Creating and deleting a RAID array may not touch the contents of the disks at all.
I formated the raid-0, then destroyed it, created a new raid, formatted again, then repeated that one more time. 
If you want reasonable certainty that your data is gone while minimizing the time needed, create a RAID-1 array, fill it completely with garbage data, then delete the data.  Filling the drive forces it to over-write the area containing the data you're trying to destroy, while doing it on a RAID-1 array lets you write to two disks for the effort of one.
After that I proceeded to transfer about 1TB of garbage data, (which is about how much data I had stored of my own files) I then once more, formatted, destroyed, and recreated the RAID 0.
The 35-pass Gutmann wipe is designed to cover all possible drive technologies from the early 1980s on, and protect against three-letter-agency-level attackers.  If you're concerned about ordinary data-recovery companies, or are using a drive manufactured since the late 1990s, you only need one of those passes: a single write with random data, although an all-zeroes or all-ones write will probably do equally well.
My question is would file recovery programs be able to piece together any data in terms of smaller files like pictures, or larger files like ISO images. 
I am getting ready to sell a Lacie Big 5 20tb drive and I wanted to make sure my files were gone securely before mailing.
I am more interested as I see lots of people talking about hardware failure Raid0 being gone for good, and not necessarily formated drives
I just dont have the time to do the writing 1's to the drive multiple times as it said it will take 30 something hours per pass.
