It would be well worth it to note which items it's failing on and manually retrieving those (and if it is a large attachment, just save it as a file or open the PST from Outlook after migration and manually drag it in if you really want that large attachment in your inbox still).
I backtracked for some of the other mailboxes that had failed importing using the ECA and was able to perform imports on the mailboxes that were failing after I changed the setting for the mailbox.
If it still fails, run it with BadItemLimit and AcceptLargeDataLoss; the job will have a log file containing the date, subject, sender, and receiver of any corrupted message (just CTRL-F for "<BadItem") and from my experience, even massive mailboxes had only 10 or 11 corrupted items, tops. 
I had the same issue and attempted to import the .pst using Outlook.  I can't recall the exact message I received but it made me think to change the maximum message receive size for the mailbox.  I changed it to 512000 and the import was successful.
I would suggest going through the integrity and repair (if necessary) process with eseutil on the mailbox store (if you're going from Exchange) or using scanpst.exe from the Office directory if you're using just a PST.
