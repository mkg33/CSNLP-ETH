Any recommendations or war-stories from people running IIS in larger environments and how you handle request logging?
I'm looking for some recommended configurations for IIS (7.5) logging for a reasonably high-traffic web-farm? Currently generating approx 500MB uncompressed logs on each of 4 web servers daily.
ODBC logging? To SQL Server seems like a lot of overhead for log files... Maybe to an open source database of some sort?
Even Urchin struggles with large log files.  It can probably handle your size, but it will eventually peak out too.
I've struggled with finding a good program to handle large log files.  Somewhere around the size that you have is where most tools start to fail.  
Log Parser is awesome as parsing large log files, but you'll need to build your own reports.  I've reverted to some custom reporting on a couple really large sites.
Analog can handle a lot of logs and I believe works for this size although I haven't tried it in a few years.
Should I just keep using log files and something like Analog to summarise them for points of interest?
SmarterStats (www.smartertools.com) is close, and you can give it a try.  It will keep up on the log processing but it's slow viewing reports because of its own file system database.
