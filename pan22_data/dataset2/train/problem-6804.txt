Related to OlafM's answer but different: you can program a microcontroller of your own to speak the SD card protocol, and then emulate whatever behavior you want it to have.
If your sd-card is FAT32 formatted, you may hex-edit the 2 fats, and mark a sector as bad with the correct hex code. This is only a trick if you want to logic test a software supposed to find a bad sector at this particular place ; it won't harm your sd-card either, a reformat will bring it back to normal condition. 
But you can easily run badblocks -w in a loop until it causes some bad blocks to appear. Something like this should work:
A common fault for a family of devices I know have a strong correlation between SD card corruption and intermittent battery contact.
On a single sector—no, because the wear-levelling code inside the SD card will remap the logical blocks all over the place.
Not sure whether this works for your purposes, but maybe it will actually suffice to physically damage your card, which could be a lot faster.
assuming that badblocks returns 0 if no bad blocks were detected and ≠ 0 otherwise (the man page doesn't say and I haven't checked the source code.)
