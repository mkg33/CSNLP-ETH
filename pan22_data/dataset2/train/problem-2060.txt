Probably there are too, too many examples to list, but one classical example (it is highlighted by Aigner and Ziegler as a "Proof from the Book") is the use by Lovász of a geometric representation to solve a problem in Shannon capacity.  Though the proof was published in 1979 and solved an open question from 1956, this remains state-of-the-art.
I dont think there are any examples of such things. Except for linear programming, semi-definite programming, complex numbers, large fractions of machine learning, etc.  The real question is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExWfh6sGyso.
Relation of error correction codes with lattices, sphere packing etc. (e.g., Conway and Sloane book). Yet the relation is so strong, that it is not quite clear, if I should call error correction codes “completely not geometric” after that ...
LLL  was used to provide a polynomial time algorithm to factor (univariate) polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$ whose co-efficients are drawn from $\mathbb{Z}$.
Lattice reduction techniques, such as LLL or PSLQ, are highly geometric and solve problems of pure number theory, such as linear Diophantine approximation and integer relation detection.
