You may explain a bit better what Font Awesome is. I suppose it exists of PNG images, probably small in size. I have converted PNG and JPEG logo's to vector images, in Illustrator. I suppose the same can be done in Inkscape. It's a lot of work, and for one reasonably sized logo this is doable although it will never be perfect. For many really small images, too much work I think. 
It took me about 5 minutes of moving and resizing (align + distribute helps a lot here) to rearrange all the icons to about a dozen of columns inside a page.
What I've done is this: create a new inkscape file with just a simple path in it. Save and close Inkscape, open the file with a text editor. Now, open the fontawsome svg file with a text editor. Copy all the tags, paste them inside the first file, inside the tag. Search for "glyph", replace with "path". Save the file. Now, open this file Inkscape. All the glyphs have now been converted to path, but they sit on top of each other.
You better google for vector graphics, use Google Image search with ai, eps or svg as filetype filter, and use another set.
