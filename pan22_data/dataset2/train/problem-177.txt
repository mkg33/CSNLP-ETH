The "Word moves desktop icons problem" has a long history on the web. When you save a Word file normally, Word creates a perfect image of that doc file with a name ~WRL*** and changes your original desktop icon to have this ~WRL name. If you have a Word crash later on, that saved file is perfect and is used by the recovery system or you can just use it directly. But when you close Word after doing a save, Word deletes that ~WRL icon and then creates a fresh original file icon at the next available desktop icon location, hence the original icon has moved on the desktop. I have found at least in Office 2003 Word with Windows 7 that this problem goes away if in folder options/view you say "don't show hidden files". Then Word does not mess with desktop icons at all and the original desktop icon stays where it was. 
If you just want to be able to open the same document by clicking at a particular place on Desktop, create a shortcut of the document on the Desktop.
I know this is super old but thought I would reply anyhow. I have this issue at work and when this happens I do the following.
When you save a file in Word, it actually saves to a hidden, temporary file first before replacing the original file. Word does it so that if it crashes during save, you don't lose the original. This also means that Windows Explorer sees the original file briefly disappear and forgets its position on the desktop.
Not sure what causes this issue but this works for me every time. This is the only way I can get rid of the issue.
