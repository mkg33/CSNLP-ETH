I was trying to use conditional formatting for text strings beginning with "020" or "07" but when I type the custom number format in as ### #### #### it wouldn't insert the spaces. I'm probably doing something really stupid so any help would be greatly appreciated.
I also had trouble achieving this until I realised that my pasted number had a space at the end.  As soon as I deleted the space, the formatting worked as planned.
I managed to work it out. I needed to change the format of the range of cells to General and then in the conditional formatting rule change it so that the text was simply beginning with either 2 or 7 instead of 02 or 07 (suppression of leading zeros and all that!!) and then format as 0## #### #### or 0#### ### ### as applicable and it now works great. Many thanks for all your suggestions as they definitely helped get me there in the end!!
I am trying to format cells so when I type in phone numbers it automatically formats them as follows: -
Excel also has a format under the "Special" category just for Phone Numbers. If you click that, then click "Custom" it will insert the Phone format which you can then edit as you see fit.
