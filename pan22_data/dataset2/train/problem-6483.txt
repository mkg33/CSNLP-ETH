They are no longer necessary for their original purpose.  Having said that, even windows 95 could blank the screen as power saving so they haven't been NECESSARY for a long time.
No they currently have no use, LCD's do not have the same burn in problems as CRT's. Also newer versions of OS's have the ability to shut the monitor off when not in use which also saves power. They are just there to look nice even if you have a CRT still you can just set it to turn off the monitor after 5-10 minutes. 
I have an LCD monitor,and from what I've read from the Wikipedia article,they only protect CRT and plasma monitors
Yes, they're useless except for aesthetic value. Let the "screen saver" power off the LCD. Remember that even if the screen saver image is mostly dark, there's a bright backlight wasting power behind the dark pixels.
At work the screen saver is created by our comms and media department and deployed to all workstations using group policy so its the electronic equilevent of sticking posters all over the place.  Changes every couple of months.
LCD monitors can suffer something similar to burn in with lazy transistors. If you leave your screen on for very long periods of time and have parts of the screen that never change, these pixels can ghost for a while, until they're coaxed into changing. However, this is very much an edge case and most people do not leave their monitors on for anywhere near that amount of time, much less without changing the screen. They still have utility, but only in a few situations.
