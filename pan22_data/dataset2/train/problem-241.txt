The Fonts folder can contain shortcuts to font files, as well as fonts themselves (note the arrows on the icons in the screenshot in Edin's answer). If the "missing" font is a shortcut pointing to a file that is not readable all users, then Explorer will likely deliver the error message described when it tries to access the font metadata, and fails.
You can also hide/unhide individual fonts in the list of fonts in the configuration panel. Check there if that particular font is hidden and if so "show" it back.
Maybe there is a problem with the permissions on that file. Right-click the file in Explorer and check the tab Security.
I also tried to install a font in my user account, found that it just wouldn't show up in the Windows Fonts folder. It shows up when I log into the administrator account though.
Windows can hide certain fonts based on your language settings. So basically if the font is not designed for your selected settings it will also not be displayed. In your situation it might be the case that the language settings differ between accounts. You can check or uncheck this option in the font settings which can be found in the configuration panel.
What solved it is I copied the font file from my user account local folder to a thumb drive, and while logged in to the user account, I installed the font from the thumb drive instead of my local folder. It prompted an administrator authentication as usual, but it worked this time!
I am a user of a network and I am also the administrator of the network, so I could install fonts without help from another person.
I've actually found a simpler solution. If you install the fonts with an admin account all you need do is  log on to a standard user account, leave the "hide fonts based on language settings box unticked in the font settings then restart the pc. Hope this works for you.
