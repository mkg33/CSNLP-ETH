There is no setting to disable the quick launch keys in registry, so I guess it's part of the keyboard driver Windows auto-installs for the keyboard on the laptop, but I can't find another driver for it to use. Acer has some software called Launch Manager that quick launches applications with certain keys, so tried installing that too, but all I can do is remap the hotkeys to open some other application, not disable them. Have also tried installing a keyboard remapper software but it seems that the acer application/keyboard driver overrules key remap settings written to registry. 
She then got a laptop for work, so she never took the Acer into the shop where she bought it to have the problem fixed. She now stopped working and had to turn in the laptop so I promised to help her get the old laptop working as warranty has now run out on the Acer. As Windows Vista is not an option in my eyes, I installed a fresh install of Windows 7 (not an Acer specific version). Funny thing is that the quick launch still work as they did on Vista, even on a clean Win7 install with no Acer software installed! Having a laptop where you cannot write the letter A without launching IE is quite annoying to say the least :)  .. so a solution has to be found.
I have a friend who has an Acer Aspire 6930G laptop that came preinstalled with Windows Vista. From day one had the problem that pressing certain keys launched certain applications, i.e. pressing the key A launches Internet Explorer, TAB disables WiFi, etc. 
As a workaround, just remap all the keys to run c:\windows\system32\rundll32.exe. It is designed to run a specific entry point of a specified DLL, but if you don't give it any parameters it just silently exits. There's no popup message or command box, either.
Have googled endlessly, called Acer support, etc. but the solution seems nowhere. Can anybody in here help with a solution on how to disable these hot keys? Would be highly appreciated!
