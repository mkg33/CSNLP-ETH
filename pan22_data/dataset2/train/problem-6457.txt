Interestingly, if I look at the "issuer" for the "Baltimore CyberTrust Root" in the browser, the issuer is itself. On the other hand, OpenSSL indicates that it was issued by "GTE CyberTrust Global Root".
The "GTE CyberTrust Global Root" is a 1024-bit certificate. (Since 1024-bit certificates are deprecated, this can be a problem)
Why does browser tell me that "Baltimore CyberTrust Root" is the root certificate, and openssl tell me that "GTE CyberTrust Global Root" is the root? What accounts for the difference?
In my browser, if I view the Certificate Hierarchy for WEBSITE.com, it says that the "Baltimore CyberTrust Root" is the root certificate. (It's 2048-bit, which is good!)
Today, I noticed that OpenSSL and the browser (Firefox, Chrome) give me different certificate chains for a website. OpenSSL shows a root certificate from "GTE CyberTrust Global Root", and Firefox & Chrome show a root certificate for "Baltimore CyberTrust Root". Here is the certificate chain output from running "openssl":
