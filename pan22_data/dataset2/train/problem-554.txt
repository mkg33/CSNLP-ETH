In this configuration, the traffic is send to your U.S. local caching servers. It is very simple and it can help Google crawler ;-)
As far as proxying vs syncing, I'm not sure if Google is sensitive to the physical location of your target server and would suspect you'd be just fine pointing both to the same destination as long as the domain name doesn't get changed while they travel the site.
3/ Use load-balancing tool (Cedexis, Dyn, etc) for balance the trafic accross network of cache servers. You can optionally redirect the Google IPs specifically to your local cache servers.
Our website is currently hosted in the UK and we have very good search engine positioning on www.google.co.uk. In order to achieve the same sort of success in the US, our site would have to be hosted in the US.
For #1, there are plenty of tools out there to help you determine the relative location of your user: http://www.google.com/search?q=geolocation+ip
Questions 2 and 3 depend heavily on your application. Question 1, is theoretically achievable like so:
2) Our site doesn't experience a huge amount of load yet, so for the time being, would the US server just reverse-proxy the requests to our UK server?
