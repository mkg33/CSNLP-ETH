Two weeks elapse, during which time managers may throw data-retention flags. We deal with special snowflakes during this interval.
Sometimes that 20 year veteran was the prime secretary support for an area, and therefore was a Delegate of pretty much everyone with a calendar that needs managing. As soon as an account like that gets disabled, anyone sending an appointment to the managed calendars will get unusual bounce messages. Temporarily re-enabling the account stops the bounce messages while desktop staff go through and hand-remove the Delegates from all of the mailboxes. This can take a couple of days for the desktop staff to negotiate with the owners of said calendars to get in and make the needed settings. The account is then re-disabled and will be subject to the usual 2-week deletion. This is one 'feature' of Exchange that I particularly don't like.
Managers requesting access to user-directory data are given a CD, not direct access. FAR too often in the past said managers just use the user-directory as yet another file store.
Managers complaining that said 20 year veteran of the department was the sole point of contact for a certain critical function, and therefore they need to keep the name around so critical mails don't get bounced, get their hands held. We try to put an Out Of Office rule on the disabled mailbox stating that the person has left and please contact Person B instead. We then set a hard delete-date for that account suitably far in the future to make sure that the world knows that Person A is no longer here. We do NOT put that email address on another mailbox if we can at all help it. We are not always successful.
