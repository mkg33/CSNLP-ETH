There is no mechanism in QEMU today to mark a SCSI, ATA or VirtioBlk disk as being backed by non-rotational storage. So the guest OS wouldn't do the optimal settings out of the box. As a workaround, for Linux you can override this by unsetting the 'rotational' flag for the block device in sysfs for any disks backed by SSD.  I'm talking to people to find out if it is possible to add this feature to QEMU to make it 'just work' in future releases.
You don't need to do anything at all with current versions of qemu. If the virtual disk is a QCOW2 image, or is on thin provisioned media such as SAN storage or a sparse LVM or ZFS volume, then it will be presented appropriately as a thin provisioned volume to Windows.
You do not need to care about defragmentation in windows, because if belive to some sources defragmentation in Windows don't fully switching off at SSD drives:
What really can be important is enable TRIM support inside VM. You can achive this with virtio-scsi that support TRIM command.
Being previously a VirtualBox user, I moved to KVM(QEMU/libvirt or whatever it's called) recently. I know that in VirtualBox, when you add a new storage device to the VM, there is a checkbox labeled Solid-state Drive, if checked, the guest system will see the virtual disk as a solid-state device. This is very useful as it can inform the guest system (i.e. Windows) to disable defragment. I wonder whether this is possible in KVM or not, because I couldn't find anything related on the internet?
Recent versions of QEMU (I tried with 2.12.0) support a rotation_rate parameter. If you set it to 1, the guest should treat the disk as an SSD. Currently, libvirt does not support this parameter in its XML format directly, so you have to pass it in as a qemu:commandline parameter.
