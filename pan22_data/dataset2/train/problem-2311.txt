This can also occur with VMware Fusion 4.1.1. If I quit VMware, the Dock process returns to normal CPU usage within a few seconds.
Even though I have 12gb of RAM, I regularly start running into the swap file, and I have to kill the Dock process. This resets the amount of memory that it uses to about 60mb, but within minutes, it will be taking up more than a gigabyte again. 
Because of the high memory usage, CPU usage and swapping, this regularly makes my computer entirely unusable. Given that this is my main work machine, I will have to probably reinstall it soon if I cannot find a solution, and I can only hope that reinstalling it will actually fix the problem. Has anyone encountered a similar issue before?
I have a very annoying problem with the Dock process - after more than a few hours of uptime, the memory usage will spike to more RAM than I have. The process will begin to thrash the hard drive at the maximum speed that it can (according to iotop), and it will regularly use more than 100% of CPU, which I guess means that it's using more than one core at the moment. The number of threads in use ranges between 5 and 12. 
I had selected a set of photos to cycle as my desktop background.  Some fo the images were rather large TIF images.  This caused Dock to consume extremely large amounts of memory and CPU.  Since the problem depended on image, it would seem to come and go and was therefore, hard to tie down.
I recently discovered consistent ~20% CPU usage on my MacBook Air was caused by the "Change picture" setting being enabled and set to "Every 5 seconds".
