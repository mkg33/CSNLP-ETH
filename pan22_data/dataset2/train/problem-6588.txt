As the result, Windows ignores settings in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts and uses it from hosts.ics.
This can happen if there is, say, only one entry in the file, and when you ignore the comment-out text.
My hosts file is ignored until I have a network connection on my (Windows 7) laptop.  Once I connect to a network, everything works as expected.  Obviously, without a network I can't ping hosts etc. but I still expected Windows to get their IP addresses from the hosts file.  It doesn't.  Even after disconnecting it still looks up addresses OK, but between restarting the computer and first connecting to a network, it ignores the hosts file.
I was experiencing the same issue, hosts file entries being ignored.  I tried everything in this and many other threads with no luck.  I figured I'd post what worked for me in case someone else comes across this.
Note: simply opening the hosts file and deleting the content, verifying that it was 0kb and re-adding it did not work.  I suspect a permissions issue on the file.
In windows, make sure HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\DataBasePath is pointed to the directory of the hosts file.
