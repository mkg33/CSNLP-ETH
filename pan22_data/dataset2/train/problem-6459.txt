Maybe you can use some type of natural language generation to create news based on certain input. It wouldn't have to be state of the art (this is a complex field with lots of research) but could be based on a certain sentence pattern with some different synonyms that can replace each other for different types of news. Wikipedia has an article on this which might be a good place to start. Just keep in mind that since news are very similar in structure you can keep it very simple by sticking to certain patterns.
This is easy to solve, but it complicates your code even more. You could also go a step further and make functions randomizing a group of people, e.g. a married couple, where there would be only like 1% chance that this is a gay marriage. Then you could make a story about a %person1.name% being in love with %person2.nameLocative%. You should write a few stories, some variants of these stories and see what functionality you need.
During the whole gaming process there is a news-feed (every day there are a couple of fresh news about what is going on). The news are fresh and individual so I need to write about 2000 pieces of news for 2 year gaming, maybe more. 
Not being able to substitute words like in English is not a real problem, because while in English you have this problem less often, it is still there:
"There was a %person1.sexAndAge%. %person1.personalPronoun% liked kids... But they didn't like %person1.personalPronounGenitive%."
The problem is that I am not sure whether repetitive news can interest in this game. What can be done to make the news-making process easier but not boring from the point of view of the player?
I am currently working on a educational and fun 2-in-1 game. As I am not a professional, I need advice on story and news-feed. The goal is simple-get richer, the story is about a worker who is trying to get over his/her financial problems and become rich.
