It won't expire in the sense of your not being able to install it; but starting January 13, 2015 Microsoft will end mainstream support, 5 years later on January 14, 2020 extended support will end.  After mainstream support ends, Microsoft will stop adding any new features/enhancements(1) to the OS but will continue to provide security fixes.  When extended support ends existing security patches will remain available; but no new bugs will be corrected.  In the past, as the end date approached MS has occasionally closed exploits as "won't fix" if the fix would require very large amounts of work.  The most recent high profile case of this was a bug in the Windows 2000 networking system that occurred roughly a year before support was schedule to end. Microsoft's justification was that fixing the bug would've required a complete rewrite of the networking code to fix (or backporting the WinXP network code, which was a complete rewrite, to Win2k).  
The OS that came installed on your OS from its manufacturer never expires. MSDN, BizSpark, and similar licenses do.
