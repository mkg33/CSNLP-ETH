Sucks to hear about your graphics controller! You can run Windows 7 using the default Microsoft Standard VGA driver.
I managed to disable my AMD GPU by starting windows and getting to system and security -> device manager -> display adapters -> and then right clicking on my AMD Radeon HD and hitting 'disable'. The maximum resolution has been reduced from 1680x1050 to 1400x900, but that's ok! I have a late 2011 MacBook Pro with the same soldering problem.
install Parallel desktop and run your windows in it by adding your bootcamp system. You can run Parallel desktop with integrated graphics only.
NOTE: When running in BIOS emulation mode, Apple completely masks out the Intel GPU hardware so only the discrete hardware is seen.  When running in EFI mode, Apple maps the I/O ranges into the same address space for both adapters, and their ACPI/EFI implementation is incomplete.  Long story short, it is not physically possible to use the Intel GPU in Windows on Macs that have discrete graphics -- period.  Not through BootCamp, not through a manual Win7 install, and not though an EFI boot either.
