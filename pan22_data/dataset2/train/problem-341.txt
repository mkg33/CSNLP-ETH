I have a 500GB external drive I want to use on a couple of Linux systems, and looking for a filesystem for it. External drives are frequently formatted in FAT32, but I don't need to interoperate with Windows and would rather avoid the ugly limited kludge that is FAT.
You didn't mention anything about speed, but if you are concerned about it, then I recommend ext4. It is starting to mature nowadays.
Since I only need to use it on Linux, I would use ext4 or XFS, but they store ownership information. Ideally, I'd use a proper Unix file system that doesn't track ownership (files are owned by whoever mounts the device, like they are when mounting a FAT32 partition), but I do not know of any file system that does that.
Linux plays nicely with NTFS and EXT file systems, but Windows doesn't play nearly as nice with EXT.  If you are 100% sure you will not need Windows interoperability then I would say go with EXT4, but if you think you may some day need to read the contents of your external hard drive from a Windows machine I would go with NTFS, other wise you will need a EXT viewer like EXT2READ.
FAT / FAT32 is typically only used for flash devices.  These days FAT / FAT32 is a poor choice for any device compared to other available choices, and I often find the 4GB file size limit of FAT32 (less for FAT) very constraining.  Don't use FAT / FAT32 unless you must (i.e. on a jump drive).
