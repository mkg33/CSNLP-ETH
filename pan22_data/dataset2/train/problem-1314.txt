I'm sitting at about 90% capacity now and before it gets any fuller I'd like to sort things out. In the future, I will opt for two single HDDs as opposed to a RAID1 setup as HDD prices are absurd these days and I don't require what RAID1 offers me.
In the meantime, I wonder if I can pull one of the HDDs and still use the NAS? What I plan on doing is:
Yes a RAID1 system is a mirrored array inwhich both drives contain the exact bit for bit data for the chance that one drive fails, all your data is intact.
You will have no problem removing one drive the other will function completely independent and your data will be intact for the life of the drive.  Once you replace the removed drive the controller will rebuild the RAID1 configuration/integrity.  Depending on the controller you may be able to turn off the RAID and use the two drives/bays independently however if you do not the controller will automatically reformat any drive; any data being erased and write the backup/RAID.
I have a QNAP TS-239 Pro II+ with 2 x 2 TB HDDs in RAID1. I'm running 3.6.0 Build0210 firmware. I access the NAS from my iMac (OS X 10.7.x). The NAS HDDs are formatted as ext4.
