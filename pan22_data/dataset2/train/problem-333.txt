Search down this for a configuration drop down list for the drive. Click "WindowState" and there should be a tick box for "ShowSideBar" tick this and it should work hopefully
Even if you get preferences set for the session that the volume is mounted you will start with the simple finder style folder the next time you mount the volume and double click on it from the desktop.
I'm not sure if you can set this to default, but to make it look like the first, click the small, pill-shaped button in the top right corner.  Hope this helps!
Based on "Explaining the Finder's view options and toolbar visibility", you're expecting the right behavior and the state of the window should be saved in .DS_Store -- at least as the Finder worked in 2003.
Your truecrypt volume is not formatted as JHFS+ (and it won't be).  I usually format my tc volumes at fat 32.  The easiest work around is to select the truecrypt icon from the left hand side of a finder window that is already open.
Another possibility is that TrueCrypt is deliberately not allowing this change to save to enhance its plausible deniability. Finder may be writing something about this volume to its preferences. If TrueCrypt were to allow this to happen normally, then this trace information wouldn't allow TrueCrypt users to plausibly deny that they haven't used encryption software.
The above article says that the .DS_Store file "is written when the volume containing the directory is ejected". It's possible Finder tries to write the volume after TrueCrypt has closed the encryption channel. If this is the case, then the fix would be for the TrueCrypt developers to fix this (or, if you have the OS X development skills, do it yourself and contribute the change back to the community).
