Looking now, I see the only application that has made its way into Program Files is WinPcap (other then items installed at Windows 7 installation).
Of course, if there really is a reason to keep those directories separate (like Svish suggests), you probably shouldn't try this anyway.
I virtually always use Custom installs & virtually always never install into "Program Files" folders. (Actually I never even install into my System drive, E: as it is, but instead into C:.)
I think some bigger programs might install things into both directories. Like if they had both 32 and 64 bit versions of things. Especially when it comes to common files and various libraries. And you don't want a 32 bit assembly to be overwritten by a 64 bit one or vice-versa. Would probably not work so well the next time that assembly were to be used.
One possible workaround is to make one of the directories a junction point that points to the other. That is, you could move all subfolders from Program Files (x86) to Program Files, delete the folder Program Files (x86) and then create a junction point with that name which points to Program Files. You would now appear have two directories with identical content, and all references to the applications within would still be intact.
So thinking that if you are more specific in where you want something installed, you may have a better chance of it ending up there too.
