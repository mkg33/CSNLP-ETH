If the water sits on top of the mats; you still have a short hazard and have added a slip/fall hazard as well.
Sounds like a typical case for a raised floor. Wet carpet under the raised floor is bad for the carpet, but that's unavoidable under the circumstances. The only thing you can avoid is wet servers, and a raised floor will achieve this. 
If the water ends up under the mats; the carpet will be very slow to dry and you'll likely end up with a mold problem.
I wouldn't be happy with any alternative to removing the carpet myself, but its a fair point that there's a cost issue involved with both removing it and then replacing it at the end of the lease. Its worth perhaps just outlining the safety issues and costs associated with leaving it in place and letting someone else make the decision.
I would suggest that there is no "lining" or cover that could be placed on top of carpet that would be better than just removing the carpet. 
Unlike a plastic mat, however, there is air ventilation under a raised floor. That means it's easier to air-dry the carpet in case of small leaks, and you won't have standing water on the floor causing a slip risk.
Just covering the carpet with plastic anti-static mats will just trade one bad problem for two others if you have another leak.
