have a hybrid of local storage with ssd's for TempDb (RAID1) and the rest of the disks for Windows, Data and Logs to be provisioned from a SAN over the network
I plan to change the hardware for may SQL Server, and upgrade it to SQL Server 2016 Enterprise. AlwaysOn AG will be built on top of two nodes + dr.
A storage array provides high capacity and centralized management. You can snapshot some volumes and present them to another host. Although, the switches and cabling to connect the SAN up can be a bit more complicated.
Regardless of the solution, the hardware will be rented from a hardware provider. So there will be no buying involved. 
Local storage has fewer server nodes involved and may be more familiar to the OS administrator. There may be limits on capacity that fit in the server, unless you add something like a disk enclosure. 
Database level replication makes it relatively easy to use two independent storage systems for a business continuity solution.  A storage level failure then can be mitigated by activating DR.   Single point of failure analysis is still a good idea, checking for redundant power supplies and SAN paths and such.  The DR copy, possibly at a remote site, makes recovery faster if the primary copy becomes unavailable.
