Your boot time increases since a file system check is run because of the unexpected shutdown. Any modern OS will do that by default.
I notice this pattern with my Macbook Pro anytime the battery reaches 0%. (Usually a result of me leaving it unplugged with the lid open).
What you're experiencing is somewhat expected. As Walter said in the comments, once the battery is below a certain level, the system will try to conserve as much power as possible.
This is also why it's not recommended to run laptops without a battery, unless you want it to run more slowly â€” sounds weird, but I've seen that happen.
Data was not commited to disk when power ran out, thus disk was re-checked at boot and boot item cache aka hotlist was recreated. You need to check if your CMOS battery is in good condition too. I.e do you get your system clock reset when battery runs out?
If your charger is less that 80watt, Once the battery is completely flat the computer will not start for about 12 mins. Battery needs at least 1% charge before a Macbook Pro will boot when you use a charger lower than 80watt.
This includes stepping down the CPU, which explains the slow reaction for the first few minutes of usage (after the battery reaches a certain charge, everything's back to normal).
