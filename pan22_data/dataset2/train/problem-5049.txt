The error is related to cookbook dependencies. Every cookbook can depend on others, and these dependencies are listed in metadata.rb (or metadata.json).
And specified my Stack to use that custom cookbook. But I don't see in the logs that phpmyadmin is installed or running.
I am trying to install phpmyadmin on opsworks using a custom cookbook. I am very new to chef and so I really don't know what I am doing.

Also, please note that you will need to install a web server as well (such as apache or nginx) and configure it to serve PMA.
The phpmyadmin cookbook requires the php cookbook to be present, as stated in the Requirements section on the GitHub page. So you will need to get that cookbook and make it available in OpsWorks.
