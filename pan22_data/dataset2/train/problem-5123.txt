It really depends on how much I like the computer. If it's an older one that I don't care too much for, I would take Ignacio's suggestion. However, if it is my main workstation then I would reapply the thermal paste. Laptops, I always replace the thermal paste. Clean off the old ones with some firm cotton swabs and Denatured Alcohol.
I wouldn't be too quick to jump to conclusions. According to Arctic Silver's thermal paste application instructions:
Unless the paste looked like a dog's breakfast after separating them, there will probably be no need to clean it off and reapply. Of course, if it looks too clean then it may be that the protective plastic was never removed from the layer of paste in the first place...
I doubt that's just scare-mongering; the heat that is generated in a CPU these days is enormous, that's why heatsinks are so huge these days and why modern cases have multiple fans.
Another tip, but of course that may not be everyone's thing: if your machine tends to overheat after running Windows for a while, try installing Linux, it's much gentler on CPU demand in my experience. I've saved a few machines this way that I would otherwise have had to dismantle or throw away.
Thermal paste isn't that expensive and you usually get it in quantities that will allow several applications (a very thin layer will do), but it needs to be there between your CPU and heatsink/fan, so I wouldn't mess around and hope the board's temperature sensors are wrong, just apply it correctly and you should be fine. I've found using an old credit card or similar works well to firstly remove left overs of old paste (if any) and secondly to spread the new paste evenly and to make sure it gets into all those microscopic little irregularities.
