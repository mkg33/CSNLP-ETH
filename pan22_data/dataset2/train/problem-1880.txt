Any app set to full screen will automatically go to a new Space of its own, to the right of any existing spaces - see this example with one Safari Window & Mail set as fullscreen, to the right of my 6 existing numbered Spaces…
Now that Desktop/Space has two windows in fullscreen mode, and when you're on that Desktop/Space, any new app opened will go to another Desktop/Space.
You cannot assign any hotkey to go directly to a fullscreen app, only to a numbered Space, but default is  Ctrl ⌃   [Num]  &  Ctrl ⌃   ←   or  →  to go to last/next, so to get there quickly I use  Ctrl ⌃   6  /  → 
If I'm understanding it correctly, you want to have two windows share one Desktop/Space fullscreen, and when another app is open, it'll go to another Desktop/Space? If that's the case, then this behavior actually comes default with OS X. 
Other than in fullscreen, you can set any app to a specific Space by launching it in that Space or dragging it there by the header bar + key combo, then right click in the Dock & Options > Assign to… This Desktop.
That way I don't have to worry what app was last used and just insert the shortcut to open the app that I want.
Any app which doesn't have an assigned Space will always open in the current one, unless the current Space is an auto-generated fullscreen Space.
