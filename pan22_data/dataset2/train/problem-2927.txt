I expect you will want to limit which addresses can access MySQL which is easily done.  You can also secure SSH with port knocking where the port is closed unless you have probed the another port recently.

Different scanners send different flavors of XMAS. Your ALL ALL rule, while it SHOULD match the canonical definition of the phrase XMAS packet, doesn't actually catch them as NMAP sends them.

There are some sensible defaults already in place with this package which you should be able to trust.
I'm new to iptables, and i've been trying to put together a firewall which purpose is to protect a web server. The below rules are the ones i've put together so far, and i would like to hear if the rules makes sense - and wether i've left out anything essential?
In addition to port 80, i also need to have port 3306 (mysql) and 22 (ssh) open for external connections.
 5. Having this kind of rate limits makes DoS attacks really simple. I just need to send 1 SYN packet per second to your server to deny YOU ssh access.
Try shorewall which provides a reasonable firewall out of the box. Enable access from net for the services you want.  There are example rule sets for one, two, and three interfaces.  The documentation is good and it is actively maintained.
