Most spambots use port 25. Once you have setup like that, then if any other machine try to send via port 25 it will show up in the firewall logs.
If you have a firewall, a simple solution is to block all outbound port 25 traffic except for your Exchange server. Individual machines are likely trying to send spam on their own. Once you've put the block in place, check the firewall logs to see which IP is trying, and failing, to hit port 25 outbound.
The problem could be that that your exchange server is allowing RELAY. Make sure that setting is turned off or set only the IPs which are allowed to relay via that server. Your network design should only allow the exchange server to send traffic out of your network via port 25. 
Where is your data stored? Is the hardware mostly identical? It might be easiest to reimage the lot of them.
I have used a program called Showtraf before now which monitors traffic on the network. We had a similar problem before and it showed the ip that was sending out vasts amounts of data on port 25.
1- Look at the firewall logs to see which machine(s) are actually trying to do outbound mail and getting blocked.  Those machines are infected.
