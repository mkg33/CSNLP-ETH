But... What if you replace MR3420 with 1 of your main routers, then load balance between WAN and DSL, instead 2 WANs??
And an extra 3rd router (4 LANS , 1 WAN,  MR3420 v 2.3) on which I want to install openwrt and use it as a load balancing router for the above DSL routers so that I can smoothly browse internet without switching WiFi frequently.
I would like to install open-WRT on a router MR3420  v 2.3 and want to know if it can act as Load balancer for 2 DSL routers below. but I am not sure if openWRT will solve the following use-case
MR3420  has only one WAN port and my assumption is it should have 2 WAN ports to support the two DSL connections above? am I right ? or Can I plug the cables from the DSL routers into the LAN ports of the 3rd router and yet use it as Load balancing router using openWRT ?
On MR3420's firmware, it's definitely a WAN port, but I doubt it would be different to the other ports from hardware aspect. So, I suggest you to search about open-WRT and see if it supports binding ports to custom network zones. If so, then you can choose 2 ports as a WAN port.
