When you have your system running from a USB stick live distro, download required package or packages from Crunchbang Waldorf site.
Then mount your hard disk drive to some directory. For the sake of example I'm going to, again, assume that you'll be mounting your root partition from your hard disk drive under /mnt.
I am going to assume your live USB stick has the same distribution as you're running otherwise or at least it is a Debian based one.
Then all there is left to do is to re-install the required package or packages using --root /mnt directive for dpkg. That way the packages are not going to end up onto your live USB stick filesystem but instead into the system you already have on your hard disk.
With those assumptions first boot your system with your live USB stick. Then query which package owns the file /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 with command dpkg -S /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (the file will turn out to be owned by the package called "libc6" but it is a nice exercise anyway).
