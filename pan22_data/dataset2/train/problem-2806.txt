I get "page cannot be displayed..." browser message.  And, I'm not even seeing the request hit the server.

The ssl on; directive is for old nginx versions, and it might not be supported anymore. The format above is the current method of applying SSL to a vhost.
I have configured nginx for port 80 and 443, with 443 containing an ssl cert configuration.  When I restart nginx, no errors occur, so I don't believe it's a cert issue, but of course I could be wrong.
Your machine isn't accepting connections on port 443. That's why the http link works and the https link doesn't.
This may be because you didn't reload nginx after making the configuration change, or because you didn't open port 443 in your firewall(s).

We are not behind a load balancer.  This is a server hosted on Rackspace.  There's no hardware firewall or anything like that, either.
