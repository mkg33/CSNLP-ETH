check out CloudifySource TV, some videos on how to orchestrate services using Cloudify, an open source PaaS stack for setting and orchestrating application deployment on the cloud.
http://confreaks.net/events has a lot of videos. But they are more around programming than server maintenance/setup.
I like watching conference presentations that show you how to do things when it comes to server setup/deployment etc.
Those are the two main sysadmin conferences right now, I would start by looking at those and then you can always proceed to further conferences as your requirements change
Check out http://www.securitytube.net/, obviously it is mostly about security but there is a lot of stuff on there that is really useful for sysadmin's. I found a great video there about tcpdump and SELinux. 
http://pivotallabs.com/talks/ has a number of good videos, though they aren't conference videos, they are similar. Again, though, the focus is more on the software development process.
You can try looking in youtube for videos, since it looks like you're specially interested in systems management I think that the following conference videos would be ideal for you
