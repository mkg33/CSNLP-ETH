Are you able to telnet to port 1433 from your workstation? This is an easy way to determine if you have network connectivity on that port. It could be that your provider is blocking the connection with their equipment somewhere along the line. 
The fact that you're seeing the port as filtered makes me think they are blocking somewhere down the line. You may want to check with them as they may not want to allow SQL Servers to be connected to from remotely or they are blocking well-known ports. tcp/1433 is a well-known port and there are a few SQL Server-related worms that target it directly.
I spent over 48 hours trying to sort this. didnt find anything on the net. also happen to be with 1and1
(maybe changing it to permit, will allow us to tick the "Block All" option again - which sounds safer, but the support guys said there is a know bug, so might not work)
Crazy idea, is your username and password correct? Are you logging in using Windows authentication or SQL Server?
type 'netstat -an' on the server machine to see if port 1433 is actually listening.  also, make sure the user account you are using is enabled and also that  "SQL Authentication" is enabled.   take care of the "SQL Configuration Manager" settings as well.  Also, allow the port 1433 as an exception in your WIndows Firewall.  Basically, if you haven't told your SQL server to allow remote connections then its not going to.
its probably to late for this to help you, but hopefully will help someone else with the same issue.
I had the same headache connecting with SSMS from client PC to remote SQL Server. It looks like local firewall was blocking inbound server connection. Problem was solved by assigning inbound rule for SSMS for client PC firewall. The only place I found how to do that was https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc646024(v=sql.120).aspx
