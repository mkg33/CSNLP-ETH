IP routing is the process of forwarding a packet based on the destination IP address. Routing occurs at TCP/IP hosts and at IP routers. The sending host or router determines where to forward the packet. To determine where to forward a packet, the host or router consults a routing table that is stored in memory. When TCP/IP starts, it creates entries in the routing table. You can add entries either manually or automatically.
New-NetRoute [-DestinationPrefix] [-AddressFamily] [-CimSession] [-NextHop] [-PolicyStore] [-PreferredLifetime] [-Protocol] [-Publish] [-RouteMetric] [-ThrottleLimit] [-ValidLifetime] [-InterfaceIndex] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [] 
New-NetRoute [-DestinationPrefix] [-AddressFamily] [-CimSession] [-NextHop] [-PolicyStore] [-PreferredLifetime] [-Protocol] [-Publish] [-RouteMetric] [-ThrottleLimit] [-ValidLifetime] [-InterfaceAlias] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [] 
The first command creates a route for the destination prefix 10.0.0.0/24 for the interface that has the index of 12. The command specifies 192.168.0.1 as the next hop.
The New-NetRoute cmdlet creates an IP route in the IP routing table. Specify the destination prefix, and specify an interface by using the interface alias or the interface index.
This example adds a routing table entry, and then displays the properties of all the entries in the routing table.
