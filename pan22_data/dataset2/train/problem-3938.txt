But there is much still going on around the network that you cannot easily stop since Windows is looking for other computers and services regularly.
Turning off the service called Network Connection Broker Service will stop the connections from tiles to microsoft's servers.  Right click on the windows icon in desktop (top left), go to computer management, select services, find the Network Connection Broker, stop and disable.
I am running Windows 8.1 .  I want to configure my machine so that the only network activity that happens on my machine is the activity that I explicitly trigger (e.g. web requests made with a browser).  I want to disable features like live tiles, scanning for automatic updates, OneDrive data synchronization and any other process that involves my computer talking to some other device over a network without my explicit knowledge that the process is taking place.  
If you don't like live tiles, uninstall all of the universal apps that provide them (you will need to complete this using PowerShell as some cannot be uninstalled by hand).
What steps do I need to take in order to accomplish this?  Is there some place (or some places) that I can globally disable such OS features or do I need to do this with some external utility (e.g. NetBalancer)?
OneDrive is optional so remove it. Automatic updates can also be turned off though that may leave you vulnerable to malware unless you are very vigilant.
