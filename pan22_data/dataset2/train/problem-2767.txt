It's because, interestingly enough, the name of the shortcut is already "IIS Manager" - look at the name in the command prompt.
I did some more experimenting and found that even if you take the path %windir%\system32\inetsrv\InetMgr.exe and make a completely new shortcut, the same phenomenon still happens.
Explorer is changing the displayed name because of a [LocalizedFileNames] directive in the desktop.ini file:
Even more interestingly though, removing this entry doesn't display the real name of the file, even after restarting Explorer. Not sure if there's a way around it.
If I take the IIS manager shortcut on my desktop, which is named "Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager" by default, and rename it to "IIS Manager", it sets the name right back. However, if I rename the shortcut to "IIS" or "Foo" or something else, it renames the shortcut correctly. What is this happening?
To type a nullspace, hold down the Alt key, while holding it down type 255 on the number pad, then release the alt key.  (You must use the number pad.  The numbers in the top row will not work)
I was able to rename it to IIS[nullspace]Manager without any issue.  It looks the same as IIS Manager, but uses a nullspace instead of a space.
