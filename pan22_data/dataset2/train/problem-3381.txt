I had set up my computer to use google's dns because I found it to be more reliable than my local isp.
I found I could ping brksharepoint (with a wiped hosts file), and tried browsing with chrome... this worked, where ie would fail.
I then edited my hosts file to resolve to the correct ip address as I thought this was the problem - this fixed nothing.
Browsing to the ip address "10.2.1.40" worked (however it prompted me for my user credentuals when I am logged into the local domain) and browsing to the computer name brksharepoint in ie 10 failed with a 404.
You're using a public DNS server while trying to access a local address on your LAN.  Set up a local DNS server that looks to 8.8.8.8 in the event it cannot resolve something.  Or in your network settings, enter the local address as DNS1 and 8.8.8 as the alternate.
Using an app that had recently been set up I was getting 401 errors, I couldn't figure out why as I was logged into the local domain and it should have 'just worked'.
What I suspect is happening is your computer tries to resolve brksharepoint with Google but this of course isn't a real name, so it returns an incorrect IP address (one of the standard 'name not found' webserver) or lookup failure.
Can you run a local DNS server, on your router perhaps? This way you could run a lightweight client like dnsmasq to resolve local names before requesting it from Google.
