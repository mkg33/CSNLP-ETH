If you have multiple servers you need to rebuild, I highly recommend you look at something like Puppet instead of writing a shell script. Puppet has a descriptive language, so you define how you want the system to look, not how to get it there. The package type has a responsefile option that allows you to define the debconf answers in Steven's answer.
FAI nowadays has profiles to install most major Debian-based systems, including Ubuntu, from the network. This of course is just an extension to the puppet answer, which is an extension to the debconf answer.
I need to write a script that will build my server from a fresh Ubuntu server install. Among things like Apache and PHP it needs to install MySQL. The only problem here is that when I install MySQL with apt-get, at some point the installation will bring up a dialog that allows me to type my root password. I.e., human interaction is required.
The combination of staging from FAI, then customizing with puppet into server roles (where puppet will use the proper tools for your system, like debconf for Debian (-likes) rather automatically), is rather popular these days and it shouldn't be too hard to find examples that match what you want to do rather closely.
A major added benefit of having a staging/configuration server is that it's also a logical place to keep your configuration version-controlled, e.g. with git (which has the benefit of naming repository states by checksum, so that you're safe against corruption as long as you note the right checksums down), for a truly clean and reproducible process.
How can I bypass this screen during installation and avoid human interaction while still using apt-get to install MySQL?
