Do not use the hosts file for this; it replaces DNS lookups rather than doing them (and the ns1 subdomain has no special meaning).
On linux, you can use dig to test DNS; do dig @192.0.2.2 in mx yourdomain.tld where yourdomain.tld is replaced by your domain and the example IP is replaced by that of the nameserver under test.
Using the hosts file is not a proper way to test your configuration as it completely bypass the resolution mechanism. The best way to test your DNS config is to expicitly ask the wanted DNS server
No, /etc/hosts is only used for address lookups. You need to modify the configuration of your resolver to point to the new name servers.
It is OK to effectively change your configuration, perform the test, and then roll back (if needed). Because of cache mecanism, the number of impacted user will be very low. 
I remember experiencing problem with one of my DNS server, one user told me it was broken about 1 hour after it was broken. At that point, I called another user I knew he was using the corresponding RR (he was connected to the corresponding web service) and all worked fine for him (RR still in cache).
