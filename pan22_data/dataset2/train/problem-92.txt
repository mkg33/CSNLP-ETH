It's easy to show by induction, that at least half of all clauses will end up sattisfied. But I can't find a tight example  with only 1/2 clauses sattisfied and all clauses satisfiable. I expect, that the approximation ratio is better than 1/2, but I can neither prove it nor disprove it.
The described algorithm is actually Johnson's algorithm (with order on the vertices) which is known to achieve$\frac{2}{3} ratio$.
By the way do not feel bad about getting stuck on this. Proving an approximation ratio better than $\frac{1}{2}$ for this algorithm was an open problem for a while.
To complement the other answer: Costello, Shapira and Tetali showed that the expected approximation ration achieved by Johnson's algorithm on a random permutation of the variables is strictly better than $\frac{2}{3}$. Poloczek and Schnitger showed that another randomized version of the algorithm has expected approximation ratio $\frac{3}{4}$, and that the random permutation version does worse than $\frac{3}{4}$.
