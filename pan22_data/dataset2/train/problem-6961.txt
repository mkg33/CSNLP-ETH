I have an off-grid solar system - and use a Go-Power 30amp automatic transfer switch between solar (AIMS Inverter pure sine wave) and shore (power company).  I have a 3000 watt APC UPS downstream of the automatic transfer switch powering a 15amp circuit of plugs thru the house to smooth out the transfer between solar/inverter and shore power.  The transfer occurs twice a day (inverter on and inverter off).
It would be better, if your load is fairly mixed, to just plug them both into the wall and split the cables between them. Efficiency loss from AC/DC conversion would eliminate a lot of the added runtime, and by reducing stress with a second wall-plugged PSU you'll still gain runtime.
In my office I have a 1500 APC UPS and my wife as a 2nd one in her office - plugged into the circuit powered by the 3000 APC UPS.    The purpose of these 2nd ones was to allow work on the 3000 APC UPS / circuit  without killing our computers upstairs as I fool with the Solar system.
Nothing would explode. But the smaller one would not discharge its battery until the larger one is exhausted.
The one in my wife's office works OK.  BUT...  the one in my office went crazy and cycled on/off rapidly and actually smoked itself.    I replaced it with another/different 1500 APC UPS and it also cycled on/off - once per second continuously until I switched back to Shore power.
