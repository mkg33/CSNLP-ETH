You can download a trial, and see if it works for you. I tried SyncToy and a few others, and Syncovery was by far the most advanced.
You can easily specify source & destinations, and set specific file masks and filters. In your particular case you'd say File age less than 365 days under Masks & Filters, and configure your workflow in any way you want. 
There's a pretty good guide over on the sevenforums here that discusses the process in more detail. (NB: robocopy allows //server/share as a destination)
I've been using Syncovery for a couple of years now (before it was called Super Flexible File Synchronizer) to synchronize files between my Synology NAS and my notebook, and to do a bunch of other stuff. The number of configuration option for each job is a bit overwhelming at first, but you start to appreciate the flexibility with time. 
I wrote a batch script a while back to do something similar with robocopy (inbuilt functionality to Windows) and ran it as a scheduled task under both Win7 and Win8 RT.
It's a commercial software, and they offer basically two versions: the Standard edition ($34.99) and the Professional version ($59.99). I have the Professional one, as I needed the realtime sync (to instantly copy modified files from a specific directory to a Dropbox folder), and also wanted to run it as a service, so I don't have to worry seeing its UI every time.
