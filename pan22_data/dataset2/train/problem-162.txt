You do install a tool for Opera, but run the Chrome browser at the end. Mayhaps I am ignorant, but this seems not like the way to go. If you just want to verify that tor is running, you could check the logs first.
You could virtualise an os with your tor browser client and filter with iptables on the host machine. Qubes OS does this and more for you.
Also I would advise against using tor for P2P, thats just not ethical behaviour. Better use i2p for that, albeit slower than tor, I like it quite much still. About your traffic affecting the network negativly, you can think like this: 
I can't provide a complete answer. On my RPi2 prosody runs quite fine. I am using a sqlite file and auth mechanism 'internal_hashed' to store the jids. With at most 20 users, I noticed only neglectable load. The provided tool for creating selfsigned certs creates certs, that do not work with pidgin atm. Also a typo in the default config regarding the path to the ssl certs, was causing me minimal sweat.
If yes, that would require 3 forwarded ports for prosody. Perhaps you use external components to deliver more functionality and therefor need more ports accesible by the clients.
But in essence you have the right idea.. You need to install/configure socks proxy capable software and configure it to use tor on localhost:8118.
As your question is really two questions and each of them concern several topics, we could move further conversations to chat, perhaps over Pi hosted xmpp?
But there is almost no software respecting the configured proxy settings at all. (little overstatement here, also am ignorant and would like to know more software respecting proxy settings)
Mostly they screw up (the software), when asking a DNS to resolve a hostname. The DNS query is often send bypassing the proxy. The solution to this is not trivial. Need to learn more. To check your specific host for 'proxysafeness' you should employ wireshark or an analog.
