Small-business-server is designed for just that use-case, it's a very strong product. As for hardware, we can't really recommend anything since needs are very dependent upon just what you do there and how it gets done.
If they're using Google Apps, you may not need Small Business Server, Windows Server standard may be enough.  Honestly though, call your favourite vendor (IBM, HP, Dell, or the CDWs of the world) with the information you have (number of users, storage, backup requirements) and have them figure it out. :)
Remember, if the clients are not XP pro, or Windows 7 pro/Ultimate, then you'll be upgrading your user's pc's in addition to an AD server. 
Due to the fact the company only has 10 employees and doesn't need anything drastic, I'd recommend Microsoft SBS 2011 (Microsoft Small Business Server 2011).  This would easily be able to cope with your needs, it's easy to manage and can hold up to 75 users if you go for the "Standard" edition or 25 if you go for the "Essentials" edition.
Regarding hardware, I'd personally say you only need one tower server to run all this.  You could then have shares (if required), Active Directory and a lot more (however by what you've posted this is all that's required).  A simple tower server (however the specification depends on their exact requirements, but custom builds are available) will easily be sufficient.
If your only requirement is the following "..now they will start having employees use different computers at different times of the day.", then perhaps you do not even need a domain. You can setup a cheap linux system with Samba for file sharing, and map/authenticate using mapped drives. Each user can have his/her own share. You can set up any number of local accounts on the client/user pc's with password protection. They just need to be trained to keep all of their important files on the server/mapped drive.
