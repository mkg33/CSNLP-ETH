Babylon has taken over my computer.  After hours, I managed to get rid of it on IE and Firefox, but nothing I do works for Chrome.  I have made google my default browser in settings and followed the advice of several forums and help services, but nothing works.  I am using a pc with windows 7 and I am not very computer tech savvy.  Thanks
I also suggest you check this babylon toolbar removal guide if you still not can not get rid of it completely.
For the specific case of Babylon, there are a number of step-by-step videos on YouTube that might help.
To remove Babylon (or anything else that has taken over Google Chrome), doing the following should suffice:
Open up chrome and go to the little three bars for settings. Open Settings > Extensions > Click the trash bin > Your done! However you might have to set your search engine again. Same thing go to settings > Scroll down to search > select google or whatever engine you use. 
Then go to PC control panel, find babylon search or delta search in your program list and remove it.
