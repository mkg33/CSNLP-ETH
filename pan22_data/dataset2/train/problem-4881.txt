Are you mapping the share to your system, or merely accessing them directly via My Computer? If you map the drive, then you can chose the link to Connect using a different user name and choose the user/password there. The 'net use' command will also allow you to access a share using alternate credentials, but not sure if it will allow you to browse the share without mapping it using those alternate credentials.
As far as I know this is the workaround that requires the least amount of effort. It's convenient when you want to avoid the hassle of logging in again or mapping a network drive.
What this did was terminate all connections to the share drive and then when I tried to reconnect it prompted me for my username and password again.
Because of this you need to make sure that you're using the right path from now on! if you needed to login to an account with higher permissions to run a backup, make sure your backup tool now works with \Server[path]` and not the IP.
If you connected to \\192.168.2.10\ with the wrong user you can try again once by using the server name instead. If you open \\Server\ you'll be prompted for your credentials again. From then on you'll have two open sessions to the same server but with different users. They seem to last until those logins expire which is potentially until the next logout.
