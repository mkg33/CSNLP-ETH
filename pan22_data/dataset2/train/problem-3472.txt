So you don't need to configure your router to use one antenna. The WLAN chip firmware will use all three antennas to make the best possible connection. Just set up the connection, everything else is automatic.
Antennas in MIMO work in the same way: There's a phase difference in the radio waves when the signal is received on each antenna, just like there's a phase difference when your two ears receive the sound waves. And vice versa, the router can send out waves with a phase difference on all antennas ("beamforming") to make the signal stronger for the receiver (here the analogy breaks down, you can't do that with your ears).
Think about the antennas this way: You have two ears, and with those two ears you have directional hearing - you know what direction a sound comes from, and if there are people talking to the left of you and to the right of you, it's a lot easier to concentrate on and follow just one discussion with two ears. If you want to do that, you don't cut off one ear and just use the other.
