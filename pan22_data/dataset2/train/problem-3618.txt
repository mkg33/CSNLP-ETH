You're missing a huge factor here:  not all ghz are created equal.  The Pentium 4 was a notoriously inefficient processor.  A newer processor, even using only one core at a lower clock speed, will get a lot more work done per cycle than a Pentium 4 could ever hope to.
Both AIR and Flash are the same platform, and process code identically. If Flash implemented multithreading than so would AIR. The only difference between AIR and Flash are features.
I'd say that Adobe Air does not support multu-threading. Here are some sources for that claim. There may be some hacks to make it run in multithreading but as far as I see no official way and nothing user can do to make it multithreaded.
As of AIR 3.2, Flash 11.2, Video is finally decoded on a separate thread. And depending on some factors and requirements, that separate thread that is handling the video data acts simply as a forwarder and forwards the video data to the GPU where the GPU distributes the decoding across its many cores.
(Multi-core or multi CPU processing is more accurately described as multithreading. A thread is a set of code that runs line by line. A CPU core can only execute 1 thread at a given point in time (unless it has hyperthreading - 2 threads at a time). A computer with 4 CPU's and 4 cores each CPU can run 16 threads at any given point in time. If a device only has one core than all running threads have to share that one core.)
This question has been asked more and more as time goes on. Do Adobe AIR or Flash apps utilize multiple cores or multithreading? So here is the official answer:
