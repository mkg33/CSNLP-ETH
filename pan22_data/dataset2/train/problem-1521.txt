fileTweak is a program that adds a tab in Explorer properties.  It is mainly used to change the date/time, but it will display seconds.  Unfortunately it isn't free.
However, I've been using a workaround that has satisified what I needed it for so hopefully it will help you.  The following command, when run from a command line in the directory in question, will print out the file names and the modified date down to seconds:
Anyone know a way to immediately show the seconds of a file's date modified property in the GUI? So if you create a file, any file in any directory, right-click and choose Properties, the date modified (if it's recent) will say something like "dd/mm/yyy hh:mm, one minute ago" - reminder this is in Windows 7. Windows XP did it normally. Then they changed something.
If you wait a while, eventually you'll see the seconds, I'm not sure how long a while is, but this is incredibly annoying if you want to troubleshoot something that relies on the seconds of timestamps... is there a setting? registry key I can change perhaps?
I'm literally using Chrome, pasting in the path of the directory to be able to see the seconds quickly (as a workaround) but would be nice to be able to use Win7.
