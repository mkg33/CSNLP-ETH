It supports re-reading the file, low-level disc operations, and much more. All is documented in the extensive manpage. (man safecopy)
As a last ditch attempt, some people have successfully recovered data from unreadable disks using cdparanoia (FOSS) or Exact Audio Copy (freeware). If these two apps can't read it, then it's probably gonna be more effort than it's worth to recover the data.
As an alternative to ddrescue and the likes, the safecopy program can do this too, in a rather user-friendly way:
If the encoding material (the, usually aluminum, reflective foil layer) is damaged, then you're probably out of luck. Otherwise, you can reinforce the backside with a label and mend the crack surface using standard CD repair techniquesâ€”e.g. applying resurfacing solution and putting into a heating/polishing unit. Here's another crack repair technique using scotch tape. Other repair techniques are discussed here.
Is it possible to somehow create a copy (an image) of a heavily cracked CD-ROM (but not broken in two)? Hopefully without damaging DVD drive...
Though this should be a lesson to you to rip and/or back-up your purchased disks first thing in the future. I personally prefer to rip an ISO image and use that exclusively while I keep the original disc in storage as a backup. With UMDs (PSP games), this greatly reduces load times and also eliminates wear-and-tear on the original optical disk.
(I know the legality of ripping CDs/DVDs is in question in many countries, and software publishers will argue that you only own a license to play the game, not the actual DVD/CD. But most game publishers still aren't going to send you a replacement disc if yours gets damaged or is lost, so it's up to you to CYA.)
