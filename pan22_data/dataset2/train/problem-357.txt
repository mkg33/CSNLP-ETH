Not only will this open a handy Terminal window showing the raw Eclipse output, it will automatically adopt whatever path you have set in your login shell.
Now Eclipse uses the same values for the PATH environment variable as your system does. Remember: This is only true for the run configuration you chose.
This helped me to run (mvn test) the external PhantomJS application from within a Maven project in Eclipse. 
So you can use any of the normal methods to set your path (editing /etc/paths or ~/.bash_profile or just installing well behaved command line tool like mbed), and worry no further. If you can call it from the Terminal then Eclipse can call it too.
Most likely, one of your bash login scripts (.bashrc or .bash_profile) is changing $PATH. If you start Eclipse from the terminal, does it get /usr/local/bin in its path?
Alternatively you might just add a symbolic link to your /usr/local directory pointing to your application. 
If you want to set an variable system wide on OSX you need to put it in your ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist file.
