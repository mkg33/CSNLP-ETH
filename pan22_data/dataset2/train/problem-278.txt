One of the real problems with batteries is that it is actually quite difficult to estimate how much charge they have left. Typically it is done by applying a specific load and seeing what the voltage sags down to and then looking at a graph of thousands of complete battery discharges and seeing where you are on the graph.
Windows (and other operating systems) will just be showing you what the battery is reporting, that the voltage from the battery is lower and therefore is probably (as far as they know) mostly discharged.
The problem is that if the battery contact has eroded slightly or a film has built up on it then it will make it more difficult for current to flow through it. This causes the apparent resistance to increase and increases the voltage dropped when a current is applied. The result is that it appears to the outside world that the battery is much later in the discharge cycle than it really is. It can still supply pretty much all of the charge, but something is causing the voltage to be a lot lower.
Effectively you end up with the battery cells being able store charge, but not able to release it as efficiently as it used to. This might also result in the battery getting warmer than it used to.
