PS: I didn't realize I couldn't upload images on this answer, 'cause I have a nice little screenshot sitting right with me now! Or can I?

Alternatively you could create a second batch file, this could allow you to run anything as an administrator, while only entering the administrator password once. The password is saved in an authentication token, and takes some real computer know how to crack.
You can use a command line utility elevate. (download link - https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz7qe_olclTwVGZLUklFMHNxQ00 )
The accepted answer does indeed work. But I found that in Windows 7, I had to endure the UAC dialog each time the shortcut is clicked. This IMHO detracts significantly from the "automatically" in this question!
Then I found that in my own situation, the .bat file in question is to be run by Task Scheduler. In this case, checking the Run with highest privileges option on the General tab of the task, nicely takes care of the problem. The .bat is then run as administrator without any hassles.
