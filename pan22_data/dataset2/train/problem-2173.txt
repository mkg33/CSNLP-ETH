I worked on a team that had a partnership with microsoft to demonstrate the feature by integrating it with our product's data storage. there's a white paper floating about on the MS site (and frequently appears on the register) outlining the Marketing Bulls... uhh.. technology integration involved. if you look at my profile, that might give you a clue what to look for...
This feature was cut despite actually reaching a closed alpha/technical preview release. There was a smoke and mirrors blog post from MS about the technology living on in an upcoming SQL server release, but to me it just felt like it was axed, hard.
Does anyone have any idea what happened to it? Is it killed, or just on the backburner? Was it just impossible to implement, too expensive, or did someone think of a better idea?
Other reasons WinFS never appeared could be due to marketing and profit. The only area Microsoft can increase profits is the sale of Vista to someone already running XP. Vista licenses for new PCs are instead of XP licenses and don't increase profit. So, you need to convince people they need to upgrade XP to Vista. Outside of users of this site, the idea of a new file system is nowhere near enough to fork out the cash for a new OS. A new, shiny GUI is a much easier sell and more likely to make those additional sales.
The most interesting feature that was ever connected to what eventually became Vista was WinFS, a revolutionary (so it seemed, at least back then) new way of storing and accessing information on a computer.
Just for the record, an excellent ZDNet overview from 2013 (titled "Bill Gates' biggest Microsoft product regret: WinFS"), with lots of relevant links, references and insider quotes like:
