I Got all my movies in my desktop pc if i press cast to a certain movie i can see them on the smart tv no problem the thing is that is very far away. So my idea is to use my android phone as a way of picking what to display on the tv without actually having to download it on my phone
Take a look at Videostream for Chromecast. It's an extension for your Chrome browser on your PC.  You can assign library folders on your PC that Videostream  can access.  Then using the androiod app you can browse the library right from your phone and play the videos on your Chromecast on your TV.  It's really simple to setup and works well for me.
