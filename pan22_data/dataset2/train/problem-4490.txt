I am using openbgpd in freeBSD with 2 ISP connections. I have my own AS number and a /22 network. Currently I am advertising entire /22 to both networks. Inbound traffic comes in But my outbound traffic goes via a single link.
I would like to either distribute my outbound traffic via both links so that outbound traffic is also load balanced. 
If ALL traffic goes out a single connection, my first guess is that you aren't getting a full feed from the provider that is being ignored. Routing is such that precedence is given to more specific routes, so if you have a route of 192.168.0.0/23 going to provider a, and two routes of 192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24 going to provider b, provider a will be completely ignored. I'm not familiar with OpenBGP. So I can't tell you the specifics of how to verify some things without looking. But the first thing you need to do is validate that BOTH providers are giving you a full feed and not just a default route.
And you should remove the "announce all" unless you want you peer to route their traffic through you, which is generally the opposite;
If that is the case, then you need to look into route preference for outbound traffic and path padding for inbound traffic. Make sure to wait twenty four to forty eight hours between configuration changes just to ensure you have a large enough data set to determine the effectiveness of your changes.
