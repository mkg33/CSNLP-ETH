That's an unfortunate state of affairs, but it's inevitable when technology from different sources evolves over an extended period of time and with no "watchdog" body to enforce conformity.
Z going up is a standard co-ordinate system for modelling packages since the early days when 3D Studio Max was the de-facto tool used by everyone, and was an originator of this standard.  It's still present and documented in modern versions, e.g.: http://docs.autodesk.com/3DSMAX/15/ENU/3ds-Max-Help/index.html?url=files/GUID-99C4C2C1-0971-48E2-8266-B911A3315554.htm,topicNumber=d30e55885
It's worth adding that there is at least one modelling program that uses a Y-up system, and that this program is documented as causing confusion for users of other programs: SolidWorks.
The transforms you give in your question just convert the co-ordinate system from that used in 3D APIs (Y up, Z depth) to that used by 3D Studio Max.
There's actually no well-defined Cartesian co-ordinate system for 3D; you just get to pick which direction each of the 3 axes represents according to the requirements of your own use case.  So neither standard should be seen as correct or incorrect.
So we have a situation here where in one case - 3D modelling programs - one standard was chosen, but in another - 3D APIs - a different standard was chosen, and that's just the way things evolved historically.  3D modelling programs would have evolved from plotting out a floorplan on a sheet of paper, where Z is naturally up; the designers of 3D APIs just chose differently.
