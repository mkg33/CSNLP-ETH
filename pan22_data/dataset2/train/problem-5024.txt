you can setup conditional formatting to highlight the first item of each month by using something like this:

This formula assumes your data is in cells A2 and below and has a header on row 1. Select all the rows, (with Cell A2 being the main selected one) and create a new conditional format, using the above formula.
This will return a "yes" every time a new month starts. Simply filter for "yes" and you will have what you need.
To organize your dates into earliest date to oldest, select all the numbers (dates), then go to Data tab> Sort and filter group, then click (Smallest to Largest)
I have a list of daily values for several years in excel. It shows values for a stock price index and therefore doesn't always start at the first day of month but rather the first weekday of the month, when markets open.
How can I quickly filter out a list that shows only the first logged day of each month? I.e. 1., 2., or 3rd?
I just had a similar problem where I had to find the first entry for each month. This is how I was able to do it.
You have to create a helper column First Weekday where you write the Formula before your Filter. The Formula calculate the First weekday of the month and write First in the helper column
