I have inotify-based programs running on a few of my servers.  For example, on the one that stores my scanned private documents (bills, receipts et al), I have a program that watches for new files in a directory tree.  When a new document is created, it is immediately PGP-encrypted (unless the new document IS pgp-encrypted, of course).  Another, similar program, sends any changes in a particular tree to another server, far away.
Check out inotify tools, or if you're a programmer, you could roll your own that fits.  It's not that hard to do; the most difficult part is keeping track of all the subdirectories, and dealing with directory additions/deletions/renames.
It can monitor just about anything and everything that goes on with the kernel - you define your own rules to match the type of syscall activity you'd like to have audited.
We have a Linux server which is Ext4 and another Linux Server which has an ISCSI where Windows clients have shared folders.I need to
If windows clients are mounting Samba/CIFS shares then you should check out full_audit.so module for Samba.
I could see modifying one of those to simply write to an audit file that could then be reviewed as need be.  The most difficult part I see in that, is making sure the audit file doesn't grow too large.
