Additionally: If you have access to the WSUS servers themselves you can use the management interface to see which machines registered with that particular server.
So I'm wondering if there is a way to check which server the clients are connecting to to pull their Windows Updates?
I have multiple WSUS servers setup on our domain; one is handling Windows Updates, while another is setup to only do Endpoint Protection updates (via SCCM 2012). Endpoint Updates are working properly on all machines, while Windows Updates are only working on some. One those where it does not work, Windows Update still says, "You received updates: Managed by your system administrator"
Clients are all Windows 7 and the servers are 2008 R2 with SCCM 2012 on the one doing Endpoint Protection.
The root cause here is the erroneous belief that the functionality of OS updates and FEP definition updates can be split across multiple WSUS servers for the same clients. It cannot.
Simple solution here... a client can only be assigned to ONE WSUS Server. Whether it's a standalone WSUS server, or a Configuration Manager Software Update Point (SUP), does not matter -- but the limit is one.
