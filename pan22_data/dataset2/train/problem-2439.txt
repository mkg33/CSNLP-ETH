Doing this will eliminate almost all STP problems, and it will limit any that do happen to a single access switch.
The current Cisco best practices are to only have a VLAN on a single access switch. You can have as many VLANs as you like on an access switch, just don't trunk those VLANs to other access switches. Don't connect access switches to each other, only to a distribution switch. Disable VTP by setting all the switches to vtp mode transparent, and limit the VLANs allowed across the trunks to the VLANs which are actually used on each switch with the switchport trunk allowed vlan command, along with the switchport trunk and switchport nonegotiate commands to unconditionally trunk. Also use the global spanning-tree portfast default and spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default commands so that any switch connections to an access port will err-disable the access port.
While you claim to have checked the VTP passwords, the 2811 and the 3750 have the same VTP domain name, but they are clearly configured with different VTP passwords.
Apart from the Domain name and the password, you will also need to ensure that the VLAN names match.
The passwords must match for VTP to work correctly. You can verify this by the show vtp password command. It could be as simple as having a space at the end of the password entered on one device.
