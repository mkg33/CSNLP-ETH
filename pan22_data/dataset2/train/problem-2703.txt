As well, install a simple SQUID (proxy) on the network, download update once, then just adjust the settings in the browser to the proxy and all the content of the updates should be available on the same LAN.
Basic scenario is a PC repair shop where there's a lot of time being essentially wasted downloading/installing Windows updates on individual machines. I had intended to set up an in-house WSUS server to deal with this, but as I got into the install documentation, I found that the WSUS license specifically disallows serving updates to computers that don't belong to your organization.
The German mag c't once wrote a script called WSUSOffline to apply WSUS updates without internet connection. I never used those but you can find it here http://www.wsusoffline.net/
Perhaps you could setup a caching proxy like Squid to cache all requests to Microsoft URLs for an indefinite period.  It wouldn't work as nicely as WSUS, but it might be a solution.  Here's a FAQ about it ... might be more of a pain than it's worth.
Since I try rather hard to keep everything legal (even if the license restriction is a bit asinine), I'm trying to find alternatives to WSUS that would allow deploying locally cached Windows updates, preferably over the network, in as automated a manner as possible.
