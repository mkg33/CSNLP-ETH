To get around this issue, we found they subscribe to emailreg.org.  So you pay a nomininal fee and get whitelisted to anyone who subscribes.  This worked in our case.
On point 2, if your application is sending so many emails that you are running into such limits how could the recipients even have enough time to read them all? That sounds to me like an absurd amount of email.
If an ISP limits the number of emails from a given source I fail to understand how changing that source would help. Perhaps you need to either:
Is this a business-class internet connection? Does your contract with the ISP allow you to run servers off of this connection? If so, you should (hopefully) be able to negotiate with your ISP for them to loosen their SMTP rate limiting for you.
We had a similar problem with a large amount of students that forward their email to common ISPs.  So when we would send a message to all 20,000 students, thousands of them were forwarding to roadrunner accounts and we were hitting rate limits.
There is no way of getting out to the outside execept thhrough the IP that was assigned to you by your ISP. 
Another solution would be to lease a small VPS and relay all your outbound mail through that server (via an ssh tunnel or some other encrypted connection). That would take your ISP out of the loop - they'd have no way of knowing how much mail you were sending out.
While this worked in our case, all in all I feel this is a crap solution, and feel a little dirty paying for it.  You are basically paying a ransom to have your email delivered.  And if you are going to multiple ISPs there may be different services.
With all of the iPhones connected via wifi, all the traffic is forced out via the assigned IP address.  
Do you have a web site that may provide SMTP services?  Perhaps you can route your emails out through that ISP.  While some ISPs block port 25, they typically leave port 26, often used as a work around, or port 587 (smtp submission port) open.
