Note, Driverpacks no longer allows you to download the driverpacks from their site using the program (you will get an error), driverpacks are now distributed via bittorrent, the torrent file for each driverpack can be found on the driverpacks download page, or sign up on this forum and you can download driver packs directly. http://reboot.pro/forum/88/
Once you have the 7zip Driverpack files you need, copy them (do not unzip them) into the "DriverPacks" folder where you installed the "Base" program. When you run the program skip the update driverpacks step in the process. Once they are slipstreams compile the ISO, then burn to disc.
I don't change any of the default settings when using the DriverPscks software, just pick the driver packs you want to slipstream and create the ISO image.
This will keep it a size to fit on a CD. If you want all the drivers slipstreamed it will require a DVD burner to make the DVD and a DVD drive on the target installation PC.
You can install other driver packs besides the "Mass Storage", but this will bloat the size of the XP install to DVD size, The only driver packs I suggest to slipstream are
If you use other customizing software for other reasons than drivers such as Nlite, use Nlite first then driver packs last or install problems will result. Only use DP to slip drivers, do not use Nlite for this task.
