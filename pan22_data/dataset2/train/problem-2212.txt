In the Device Manager the drive appears as VMWare Virtual Disk SCSI disk device. That is what first got me to thinking because I haven't used SCSI connectors for years.
If I control-click on the drive and check the properties, there are various tabs (General, Tools, Harware, etc.) but none of them give a drive type or model number or anything like that.
I am not that experienced with Windows, but I need to use a Windows server for my FileMaker server, so now have an instance of Windows Server 2008 R2 at a hosting site.
Everything is working, I would just like to know about the drive type, which is supposed to be enterprise grade SSD.
You may not be able to determine the physical drive type that the host is presenting to the guest, but you can run a disk performance test.  
Under the Tools tab I see options for Error Checking, Defragmentation and Backup. I understand for Windows 10 there would also be an Optimize option here which would show the drive type, but that doesn't appear on this server.
If it is really slow, probably not an SSD.  If it is faster than a traditional disk with a spindle, it probably is an SSD.  
You need to specify a test file size that is at least as large is the storage subsystem cache, so I would use a file size of at least 20 GB.  
Windows PowerShell is also installed, and if there is some command line query I can use for this it would be nice to know.
It's supposed to come with 120 GB of SSD storage, and I want to confirm that the drive is really SSD. I've searched around trying to find an answer, but haven't found one yet. There seems to be checks for this for Windows 10, but they don't apply to Windows Server 2008 R2.
