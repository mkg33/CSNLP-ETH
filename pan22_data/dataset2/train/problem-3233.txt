I'm puzzled by this email message that gets quarantined by McAfee Secure Messaging Service (it's based on Postini) for no reason that I can think of.
I read the docs (http://www.mcafee-sms.com/webdocs/admin_ee_mcafee/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=MACAFFHelp&file=header_overview.html#951634) and in short, the x-pstn-settings header tells me that NONE of the filters was triggered, but the x-pstn-levels header tells me that the final score (0.02932) is low enough to classify the email as bulk/spam.
The users unjunking these mails should be teaching Postini so the false positives should not keep happening. If that is not the case your options are:
X-pstn-levels:     (S: 0.02932/98.63596 CV:99.9000 FC:95.5390 LC:95.5390 R:95.9108 P:95.9108 M:97.0282 C:98.6951 )
I have used Google's Postini only, so I don't know how it may differ from McAfee Secure Messaging Service. I don't know how exactly the scores are computed, but it is undoubtedly based on a very large number of factors. The scores could be different based on users marking messages as junk or not junk.
