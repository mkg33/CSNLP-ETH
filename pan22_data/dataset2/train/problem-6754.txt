The main problem, I think, will be keeping a track of the nearest bit of effective cover to get them to run to when their being aimed at.
If they are always trying to use some tactics then you should be able to find out where you want them to be and create a path for them to that point. So they will always be trying to follow their path to that point. If you use the frustum to tell them to take cover then it could look effective. They move a bit along the path, then their in sight so they instantly take cover. 
You could just keep it simple. Create a frustum (smaller than view frustum) to calculate a sort of target area for the player. If the enemy is in that frustum, they should stay in cover (for a period of time, not forever). Then make sure you're A.I. always try to spread out.
It should be smart enough to look compelling, but dump enough to give the player plenty of time to shoot them. Also, if their popping up when your not looking, it means it will drive the player to look around a lot, which will add to the sense of vertigo in your fast paced shooter.
