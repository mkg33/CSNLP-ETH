With only 5 Windows clients, you might even just want to do OD and skip AD all together until your number of Windows clients grows.
You're probably better off taking a "Golden Triangle" approach here. That means having Open Directory on some OS X servers, Active Directory on Windows ones, and configuring Kerberos to forward auth requests from the OD servers to the AD ones.
One final option is to run some Apple-specific schema updates on your Domain Controllers, which will let you use WGM to manage OS X clients without the need for Open Directory at all. Some people do this, and have no problem. Other people are really really scared to run a schema update from Apple in a production forest - I'm one of those people, so I've never tried this.
This way, you get authentication and authorization centralized on a Windows platform, and you can still use Apple specific tools like WGM (think Group Policy, but lacking) for the OS X machines, since they'll be bound to both directories.
Products like ADmitMac also exist to help ease this management burden (nightmare), though it's more meant for integrating Macs into a largely Windows environment - which is the opposite of what you're doing.
