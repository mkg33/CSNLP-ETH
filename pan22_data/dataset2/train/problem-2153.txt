The first command removes many X11 packages, including the X11 core libraries. Since all other X11 packages (transitively) depend on the X11 core libraries, they are also removed.
And if you want an installer which installs only a minimal system, there's also the Raspbian UnAttended Netinstaller
The second command removes all now unneeded packages, i.e. packages that were only installed as a dependency of later removed packages.
Build a custom image? - I use https://github.com/jamesbennet/pistrap. A fairly minimal install is ~300mb.
Tasksel is a tool that installs multiple related packages as a co-ordinated “task” onto your system.
There is now also an X-less image by the foundation named Raspbian Jessie Lite: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
I would like to know how to completely remove X.org and all GUI-related components from Raspbian or soft-float Debian.  The most obvious solution would be sudo apt-get purge xorg, but I am afraid that that will leave some GUI packages lying around.
