I use Windows Remote Desktop to connect to my physical workstation at the office -- I remote connect from home where I have (conservatively) 16 Mbps Down and 6 Mbps Up. 
If I was doing more thinking-oriented tasks the delay would be okay, but I am honestly losing so much productivity it's driving me insane. I've googled and asked IT here, but I can't figure out if there's a bottleneck somewhere that can be widened, or if this is just the nature of working from home. Do WFH'ers really just have to put up with delay? What kind of connection and/or hardware can alleviate these issues?
It's not that I experience true lag/ping/latency in the gaming sense -- when I move my mouse, it appears to respond instantly and when I navigate folder directories, it's fast enough. However when I alt tab between completely different applications, or scroll up/down on a website or coding IDE, I experience, IMO, intolerable "lag" -- that is, if I scroll wheel down 10 clicks it will take several seconds to catch up, thus preventing any kind of expedient scrolling up/down to navigate, which as a web developer especially, literally hurts my productivity by probably 3-400% (I work very fast -- most my work is mindless HTML/CSS/JavaScript that I've done many times already).
My laptop's specs is a mobile i7 from 1 or 2 generations ago, solid state drive, and 8GB DDR3 ram. 16Mbps Down 6 Up as I said earlier.
