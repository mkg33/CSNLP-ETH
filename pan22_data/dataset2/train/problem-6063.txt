How much time are we talking about here? Because a thorough CPU/RAM/disk check should be done over the course of a day or two. Especially with server hardware.
OK, any server can fail at any time, and it's perfectly possible for a used server to outlive a new one, but are they willing to take that risk?
Our main file server which is going to be replaced this year has been running for 5 years without any problems.  Not even a drive failure, knock on wood.  We also have 2 other Dell refurbished servers in production now without any problems so I don't think it's a fluke.
Have they seen how little a new server costs these days, or are they just knee-jerking towards what seems like the cheapest-in-the-short-term option?
Dell has a good selection of refurbished servers on their outlet website and we've had very good luck with them.  The nice thing about going this route is that you save money but you also get the same warranty and support from Dell as you do with a new server.
Anyway, as well as checking disks and memory, I would also do a full physical check on the server.  Inside the cabinet, all the little nooks and crannies, everything.  Also I'd like to see a full reboot cycle of the server, just to ensure that it comes up clean without anything kicking and screaming.
One other note on purchasing old equipment. You will want to consider how much support older equipment might require.  There might be minimal support if any from the manufacturer.  If you lose a component, can your company wait for parts that may have to come in? You may condider purchasing an extra older machine or two for "parts".  They have gotten better over the last few years, but many servers have specific parts for only that series or type of server and they can be expensive.  Consider your support needs, desires, and budget depending on what you require to operate.
