Anki stores collections in collection.anki2 file which is an sqlite database file. Let’s open it in DB Browser for SQLite and find the record with:
You can create a capture group by surrounding any matching regex pattern you would like to keep during the replacement by surrounding it with parentheses and using the convention \<digit> ordered by the number of (captured) groups you specified. 
This killed me too before I learned of it because in many regex implementations, the $ is used to denote a capture group, but in Anki, the \ is used.
Let’s look at couple of trials with the ‘Find and Replace’ window. I am using the following settings.
Now let's say you also wanted to keep their describing adjectives. You will need two capture groups. One for the animal and one for the adjective.
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">One<span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">Two<span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">Three<span>
I can only assume that it was working in some of the previous versions but was unintentionally broken.
<div>&lt;span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"&gt;One&lt;span&gt;</div><div>&lt;span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"&gt;Two&lt;span&gt;</div><div>&lt;span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"&gt;Three&lt;span&gt;</div><div>&lt;span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"&gt;One&lt;span&gt;</div><div>&lt;span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"&gt;Two&lt;span&gt;</div><div>&lt;span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"&gt;Three&lt;span&gt;</div>
The documentation https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#find-and-replace is not helpful at all and is even misleading as it shows an example which does not work when applied. 
Summary: lt; reminds html entity &lt; Now we know that the regex engine is working but apparently the characters are stored differently than they look.
The answer seems easy to provide but when a valid regex is applied in the ‘Find and Replace’ it simply does not work.
