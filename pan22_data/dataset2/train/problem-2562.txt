Mind you, I have experienced MANY problems due to operator error! This is probably cause of most reported problems. The appropriate remedy here is BACKUP.
What I'm going to do is set up the system as I originally described with the primary partitions readonly and one additional partition that is writeable, and I will write data to that partition as infrequently as possible -- only when the user makes changes to settings.  My hope is that it will be extremely rare that the RPi will lose power at the exact moment that the one data file is being written.
In fact, the instance of "corruption" is rare (and it never seems to happen to the experienced users).
You don't even NEED to even mount the boot partition, I presume you mean /. Normal Linux writes to the filesystem all the time and won't work if it is not writable. It is possible to put these elsewhere (usually tempfs).
In summary I suggest you don't bother trying to quarantine your OS. Always poweroff safely and backup regularly.
I have had 2 SD Card problems with 5 Pi, 12 SD Cards over 4 years. One was a Card which totally failed after a few days use, and was replaced under warranty. The other was a failed update.
You need to distinguish the causes of "corruption". Most often this is just a problem, experienced by all computers which fail while writing. This is usually fixed by journalling.  In rare cases powering off while the SD Card firmware is performing housekeeping can cause "corruption".
