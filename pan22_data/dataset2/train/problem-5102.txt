I recommend setting your DNS servers to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 which are google's DNS servers, and then issue an ipconfig /flushdns to renew your configuration. This should ensure that the domain is correctly configured. Eventually it will start working with your old configuration as well, but it might be required to reboot/restart the DNS provider in your network, such as router or service on your server.
I'm trying to access a website but I can not make my computer or router to recognize the new IP address. Previously, it took little time for this to happen but lately I'm waiting up to 24 hours. How to force my computer or router to recognize the new website IP?
When altering DNS settings, you should always keep in mind that such changes take time to propagate over the internet. It can take from 2 to 48 hours before changes are replicated through all hops on the internet.
ipconfig /flushdns can be used to renew your DNS configuration with that from your router/modem/server (depending on what your DNS servers are) but if they were not updated yet, you will still get the old address.
