For 2 drives with separate Windows Installations where one volume needs to be removed, and the OS is being stubborn this should work.
5.Now select the disk which you want to make INACTIVE (For instance if i want to make my Disk 1 as active i.e where the OS is installed and REQUIRED to boot, i need to select the drive which i want to make INACTIVE. In my example DISK 0) 
********************************IMPORTANT THING TO DO FIRST *************************************** 
After I selected the partition to remove I did this (This might remove any system-based flags, but probably not needed):
BE CAREFUL with this, you can destroy your system if this issue doesn't apply to what you are trying to fix.
Solved. In my case I was restoring two drives. C: and D:. One of them was set active and setting both as inactive did not work. I swapped the drives on the mother board and was able to run restore. 
Another thing I did in diskpart (Probably not mandatory, but I'll put this out here) was the following:
Although not listed in the document below, use the switch inactive. I can't be 100% sure that still works for 2008, but it does for XP/Server 2003. You could also use 3-rd party tools like Acronis Disk Director.
Point to remember : THERE SHOULD BE ONLY ONE ACTIVE DRIVE SO YOU CANT SET MORE THAN ONE DRIVE AS ACTIVE 
Explanation : This error crops up because you have been in Computer Management > Storage > Disk Management and selected more than 1 drive as ACTIVE together with the one which was already active- the one where your OS was . 
Also since you cant get your OS to boot you must specifically select the boot disk from where to boot.
