Someone ran "chown -R username /usr" and now I have no way of logging into the box to change it back. SSH has been disabled, X Server won't start so I have no graphical GUI, and the console login keeps saying "Login Incorrect" when I try to login. I don't have the exact message next to me, but it says some files within the /usr directory are not owned by root, which leads me to believe the chown was the problem that caused this.
Restart the system and at the grub screen select Solaris failsafe. This will boot into the miniroot which should detect and mount your current filesstem on /a. You can then fix /a/usr. 
Boot from a rescue CD and mount the drive, then you can run your chown.  I can't think of a way to do this without a reboot.
Once you boot off the CD and mount the disk's / and (and /var and /usr if separate partitions) you can try using pkgchk to fix the permissions rather than a blind chown. For example, if you mounted / under /var/tmp/root:
I can change the ownership back if I can just get into the command prompt somehow. Does anyone have any ideas how I could get a command prompt from this?
Single User Mode has no login, and does not honor most file system permissions, so it should have no problems overriding the settings.
