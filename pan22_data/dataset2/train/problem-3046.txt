Found this on another site. Right click the unified Inbox, and choose the folders to include. Make sure all your inbox folders are checked. Worked for me with a Yahoo address.
Which to means that there are two unread messages, however if I quickfilter for unread messages it will not show any messages which are unread. No matter how I sort the messages or scroll I cannot find the unread messages. I have no problem seeing most of the other new unread messages whether they are in this same inbox or in other inboxes.
I am usually the one with all the answers when it comes to computer problems but I have been unable to solve this problem. Any ideas on what I could be doing wrong? Maybe 32 inboxes is too much?
I currently have 32 inboxes and I view them in a unified folder view. It's showing about 32700 messages at the moment. All inboxes are mostly IMAP (I believe a gmail and a yahoo account is POP3) and are mostly from custom installs on linux servers with a few from gmail, yahoo, live.
I have used Thunderbird for a while and I have had a constant problem of not being able to read some emails because I can't find them. I have tried restarting, removing the mail account and adding it again but the problem keeps reappearing. 
I have also noticed that all inboxes emails will not show in the unified inbox. I am having to click on individual inboxes to read these emails.
I had the same issue. It was caused by emails being ignored. See if the mails show up again after you check View -> Threads -> Ignore Threads.
