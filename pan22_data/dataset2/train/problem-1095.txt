Could you specify the updated page that is not updated on the other site? If they are both being served from the same vhost config on the same server I'd expect both to update in-step. One appearing not to update could just be a caching issue, or if you are on a shared host it could mean that someone is running a scrapped copy of the site on that same host (hence the IP address being the same) - which reopens the "how does his site know how to see your SQL database" question (could you provide the error logs that identify the other site?).
Are you on a dedicated service ("real" dedicated/colo or a VPS) or shared hosting? If you are on a shared hosting arrangement you'll need to contact them to report a web server configuration issue (if the server should not know the domain it should respond as such, but some servers are accidentally configured so one of the client sites is the default site instead of the "configured domain" site being so. If you run your own server then you need to look into your web server configuration similarly.
As both domains point to the same IP address your server is responding to requests for both domains (if this were not the case, the other site getting anywhere near your database would be a serious security issue). Why someone would do this to you intentionally I don't know, as all the content comes from your server is it unlikely that they can redirect people away to a dodgy site when payment details are entered or anything like that...
