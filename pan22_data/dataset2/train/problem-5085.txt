Chrome's passwords are encrypted with your login password, at least on Windows, though very weakly. I'm going to have to say that it's a bad idea to use the browser's built-in password manager no matter what. Google Chrome can import Firefox's passwords even if Firefox's passwords are under a master password.
You could try using the LastPass plugin to have an online and extremely secure password vault. Just turn off automatic login and your set. It even has the bonus advantage of a web interface and portability.
Use a dedicated password manager that is at least reasonably secure. The safest is probably KeePass because it's been around for quite a while. Lastpass is another option that is reasonably secure, but if you're working on the CIA, keep in mind that it hasn't been audited by any independent organization yet (KeePass hasn't been audited either, but it's open source, so thousands of people can and have read through the code for security flaws and those flaws are fixed very quickly).
Depending on your system you could encrypt your Chrome Profile Folder (TrueCrypt in Windows, equivalent ones on other operating systems)
P.S.: You can put a specific link on your desktop with the parameter for the profile location, so others can use chrome with the default profile.
Using this app, you can import all your Google passwords (since it's not clear how they're secured), and after importing consider removing them all as they're still stored in the cloud and you can see your of all passwords by going to https://passwords.google.com/
Is there any way to password protect google chrome browser? So that I can do "Remember password" on sites browsing in chrome in a shared computer and others can't access it
