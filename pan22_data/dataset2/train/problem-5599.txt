I am developing an application that works in local network. This application has to run on several computers at the same time, and it's important to me, as a developer and tester, to see (literally) how it behaves at all times on all computers.
Alternatively if you find a good VNC or RDP client that you can tile and arrange to your preference, you can just run those on the virtual machines and connect from your management computer.
There are pay-for products like Vision from Master Solution that is meant to control and monitor computer labs that will "Grid" and control remote systems. This may be closer to the kind of control you're looking for, but like I said you pay for it and you install a small client on each system you wish to monitor.
I don't know even if I put the question right, but here's what I'd like to accomplish. I have avoided specifying exact Vmware virtualization product here because I'm not sure which one would be most suitable for the task at hand.
You can then launch a rdesktop viewer for each of the required VMs and leverage your desktop manager (eg: Compiz/Fusion) for the tiling and click to maximize effects.
Is there any way to connect to screens of virtual machines deployed on ESX, ESXi, Sever 2.0, or some other product, so that I can see something like grid of screens, say 4x4 or 6x4 or whatever number of scaled screens, at the same time? Ability to interact with screens directly from grid (by double-clicking a screen, for instance, and then getting full resolution screen) would be greatly appreciated, of course.
ESX/i lets you have lots of consoles to VMs open at any time, you'd have to move them around to create the tile effect you mention but yes you can do that. You can click on any specific console to control it but the resolution won't change (not for ESX/i anyway, it will for Server/Workstation/Fusion).
