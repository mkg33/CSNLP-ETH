This log will have events which contain the server name which the end user attempted to connect RDP into.
Look in the Security logs for those. RDP logons are an Event ID 4624 but just searching for 4624 won't work. Within the event you need the Logon Type value to be "10" and the SecurityID value to be yours. Not sure how to filter those...
I connect to my work PC via VPN/RDP and I would like to find a log file on my work PC that would include some information on when I used it last, from where my connection originated and how long it lasted. Where in Windows 7 would I look to find that out?
You can also type query session or qwinsta (both are the same thing)  Show's who's on and what port is listening etc.
Look under 'Application and Services Logs' > 'Microsoft' > 'Windows' > 'TerminalServices-ClientActiveXCore' > 'Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RDPClient/Operation' , 
I can't tell you how to check from your work machine when you established a VPN as presumably it isn't the VPN server (?). However, if you're using Remote Desktop Connection to control that work PC you may be able to pull the logon / logoff times from the Event Viewer.
