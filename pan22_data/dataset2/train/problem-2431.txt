Since one server commonly hosts more than one domain, nginx and all modern web server software offer a feature to support this, which in nginx is the server_name directive.
However, if nginx wanted to do something on the same port as some other service on the server (e.g., port 22, commonly used by OpenSSH), then there would be a conflict to resolve.
But how could there be two different servers listening on the same ip and the same port? Linux would not even allow you to start two services listening on the same port as far as I know.
I am curious as of why there is a need to specify a server_name in the nginx configuration file on top of the listen property.
I have been reading a digitalocean article on understanding nginx configuration file, and this is how it explains the difference between the two settings:
Nginx is one service on Linux, and it is using the ports you tell it to use. From there, Linux is not concerned with what nginx does, so if nginx wants to read something in a request to the reserved  port (e.g., get example.com on port 80) and do something different with it from other requests (e.g., get example.net on port 80), it can do so.
Well, with HTTP 1.1 you could point to one IP many domain names, it was not possible in HTTP 1.0(more you can see in this answer). So, you start on nginx process and it listening on requested ports, infinite number of domains and subdomains. For example you could check stackoverflow.com and serverfault.com, they both points to same IPs.
