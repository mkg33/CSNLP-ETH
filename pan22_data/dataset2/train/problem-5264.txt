Yes an X450e-24t is a L2/L3 switch.  It will support basic routing protocols with the base edge license, or you can get the Advanced Edge license that will support OSPF v2/v3, VRRP, and ESRP.
Yes!  They call it a switch, but according to its white paper it is also a router, and so it can be a gateway; it also supports some routing protocols if you need to connect several networks though it doesn't sound like you do.
The problem though is it's been EOL'd https://esupport.extremenetworks.com/eservice_enu/docs/summit_x250_x450e_endofsale_0713.pdf so XOS 15.3 is the last firmware version for it.
Here's a link to the Install Guide: http://extrcdn.extremenetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/100286-00_Rev17_InstallGuide.pdf and more importantly the Concepts Guide: http://extrcdn.extremenetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/EXOS_Concepts_Guide_15_3_2.pdf
I just started somewhere and they have a Cisco Catalyst 6509 running that they say; "Just handles network routing and Gateway".  They also have an unused Extreme Networks x450e-24t switch that they have asked if I can set it up to replace the Catalyst.
