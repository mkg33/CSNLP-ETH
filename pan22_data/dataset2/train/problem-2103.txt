If you can log in to the Administrator account, you should be able to do things like run the defragmenter from that account. The Administrator account is not restricted by UAC ever, so you should not have to worry about that. Administrative tasks should run without any problems.
If UAC is turned off, then there is no way to elevate a task to an administrator account. When UAC is turned on, you should be prompted to enter the administrator's username and password when doing administrative tasks. If turning UAC back on does not solve the problem, then there may be other problems.
Webroot sounds like a legitimate security software company, however, you might be better off using Microsoft Security Essentials, as it is supported by Microsoft and designed to work well with Windows 7. Windows Defender is not antivirus software, it is only capable of removing some problems and is not a substitute for a proper antivirus tool. There is not really any good reason to disable it.
Find out from your friend if he installed a legal copy of Windows 7, and if so, if he can provide you with the installation disk and license key. If the copy of Windows 7 he installed is not genuine, then it is possible he used some sort of activation crack, which could be causing this problem. Since you can't contact your friend right now, you may have to wait. In the meantime, you can try some of the other suggestions here.
