Repeated code is not only a pain to create, it is a source of bugs when it comes time to make changes.
To make accessing the functions easier we can add them to an object and use their names in the create grid function.
I used direct element reference for gridContainer, newGridButton, colorfulButton, and pencilButton so you must ensure that they are unique ids on the page.
To reduce repetition we use functions to wrap up code that has only slight differences, passing the differences as arguments.
Looking at the create grid function the only difference is the mouse event, all the rest is identical. Create the mouse event functions separately. We need a reference to the newSquare, that can be found in the event as event.target
and modify the create grid function to take the name of the draw function as well as the size. Also move the clear grid function into this function.
There is a small chance  (about 1 in 16) that the random color function will generate an bad color as you don't check for leading zeros. See code below for an alternative.
The only difference in each is the Id of the button and the function called at the end. Thus we can simply wrap one of those sections in a function passing the Id and the setup function as arguments.
