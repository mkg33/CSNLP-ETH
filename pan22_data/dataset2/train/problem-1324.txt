Not a solution really but did you know you can drag and drop a folder or file in to the terminal and it will insert the path to the item 
You could create a symbolic link (which is like an alias in OS X, or shortcut in Windows) in your home directory, which is by default where your Terminal opens up.
I think that 2 is cleaner and better in the long run, but either should work fine. The issue with 1 is that if your work habits change, you will need to remember to remove that line, or it will drive you crazy every time you open a shell.
The way I do stuff like this is with DTerm http://www.decimus.net/dterm.php this way you can just hit a KeyCombo from the Editor you are working in (Textmate in my case) and you get a Command line for this location. You can than issue a Command (ie make) and thats it! If you want to open a real Terminal there than you can just hit Command+Return instead of Return and your command is executed in this Directory in a new Terminal Window. 
Let's say your program source files are located in /usr/bin/myapps/. And your home directory is /users/Frank (you can reference your home directory by using the path /~ as well).
What this does is create a symbolic link called "project" to the location /usr/bin/myapps. You can then cd to project (cd /~/project) and wind up in /usr/bin/myapps.
If the problem is simply that you have to start every session in the terminal with this: cd /a/very/very/annoyingly/long/path/name, then I can think of two solutions.
