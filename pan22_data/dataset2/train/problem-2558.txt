DNS Requests contain questions that specify a name (or maybe a somewhat arbitrary text field) and a record type - the content of the response will vary depending on the type. Most requests are simple direct lookups of a server name looking for an ip-address in response (Type A) but some will be looking for more information on name servers themselves (Type NS), mail records (Type MX) and other services (Type SRV that will return names, ports, weights and priorities). DNS responses contain answers to these questions, possibly more than one if the request requires that and are not always just ip-addresses. 
One other clarification - DNS doesn't resolve URLs - in most scenarios involving URLs DNS is only used to enable the client side system to find the ip-address of the server part of the URL, everything else is handled by other protocols.
DNS queries and responses are best looked at using a protocol analyzer - Wireshark is a good cross platform tool that can capture and deconstruct the requests and responses into their various parts. There is a nice introduction to the structure of DNS Requests and Responses at Firewall.cx here.
