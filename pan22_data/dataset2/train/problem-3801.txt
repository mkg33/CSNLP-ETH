But ,when I restart machine or server and then check for identity with command ssh-add -L I am getting message like The agent has no identities.
I believe this answers your question more fully. This OS X specific flag is hard to find documentation for but it's been working since at least OS X Leopard.
On OS X, ssh-add has a special flag to connect to Keychain if you decide to store your private key in there.
So the keys must be unlocked on each login, and you need to automate this – on Linux using pam_ssh is one option; it automatically uses your OS password to unlock the agent. Another similar module is pam_envoy, which is slightly more reliable afaik (but requires systemd).
Does that means when we restart machine, Agent lost identity? Is this normal behavior or some thing I am missing here? 
It's normal. The purpose of a key agent is just to hold decrypted keys in memory, but it will never write them to disk. (That would defeat the purpose – why not just unprotect the main key instead?)
After creating keys with name id_rsa at it's default location. I am adding identity to SSH agent with command ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa, It's adding successfully.
