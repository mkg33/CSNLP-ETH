I'm not familiar with "sending notification" option, don't think it exists frankly. What there's an option for, is to forward and email to external SMTP address. It can be done easily by creating external contact and forward emails to it. You can as well hide it from the GAL after you done the forward, which will allow the users of the Exchange Organization to see only your internal mailbox.
However we did have some success on using get-mailbox statistics in the exchange management shell on 2007.  Downside was mainly it never seemed like an elegant solution and for a high volume mail server it would be very unsuitable.  Don't have the exact script to hand but it would right the value for
You don't mention what cersion of Exchange you're running but this is not possible with Exchange 2003 as far as I know.
The only other idea I came up with was clunky and would require at least allowing outbound mail to a single external pop3 account that would then interact with a public folder on Exchange.  If you want details on how that could work, let me know here, otherwise I won't waste paragraphs explaining the idea and clunky setup.
I'm not sure why you have things set up like you do but why not create Contacts for the external email addresses and set up the forwarding options on the mailbox enabled users to forward a copy of messages to the external contact?
With transport rule, you can do this. But... it seems that it does not work with these kind of message. The rule works well with a regular email but when i try with a voicemail message the rule does not apply. I don't know why, probably because it is a kind of system message.
Items to a file and then compare it later to see if the object had increased.  If yes then it sent an email. 
Had a look at something like this for conflicts I interest email boxes.  Was never able to find a suitable transport rule that would work.
