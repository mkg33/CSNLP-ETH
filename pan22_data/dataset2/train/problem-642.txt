If you're not totally paranoid (like me), then a cloud service would be a good alternative to the separate SSD.
And if you are really paranoid, I would recommend keeping the most important data on a few CD-R's in a safe with a USB CD drive.
My reasons are as following: for really important data costs should matter much less, and cost is the main obstacle for now, secondly, backup speed is much higher compared to a hdd (from an ssd at least), this time alone is worth something, thirdly, failure rates of hdds have been increasing a lot in recent years because were are getting close to physical limitations for mechanical disks whereas ssds can still improve a lot.
With 1tb SSD drives for around 600 usd just around the corner the answer to this question is a even bigger yes. 
Of course, nobody should rely just on one backup media but spread it locally and on different media.
Just one side note: for unimportant and cloud accessible data like programs, games and system I would never even think about ssd, hdd is enough as a convenience backup.
This way I have quite easy access to the files and the backups are kept up to date. (The two NAS units would be set-up to replicate each othet)
