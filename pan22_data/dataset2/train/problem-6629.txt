Place the tip of the screwdriver against the thing you want to listen to.  Carefully put your ear to the handle of the screwdriver, so that it presses up to that little flap. You want a physical conduction path..  Don't put anything into your ear canal, obviously.  The noise will be quite evident when you find the source.
It could be a speaker in a UPS unit warning about low power. It could be a RAID card or internal battery unit complaining about something.
You might try wanting to put your ear up to each server (if you've not got too many) ... with luck, you'll find the screeching server by the one that's making a bit more noise than the others. It's worked for me before now tracing the server whose fans have spun up to full speed...
If it's a fan or other rotational screech, you might find it by using an improvised "mechanic's stethescope" -  A screwdriver, broomstick, or some other solid object.   Solid objects conduct sound better than air does.
If you don't have a lot of devices, shut each one off at a time and see if any of them make the sound go away. You could also shutdown the AC for a few minutes to see if that helps you make heads or tails of it. Most components will have an amber or red LED as well as the audible alarm to tell you something has failed. Trial and error, or ask someone experienced to come take a look.
