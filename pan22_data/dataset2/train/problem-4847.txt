I've been noticing this issue a couple times lately - I try to open a Remote Desktop Connection to another computer that's
After a while (>10 minutes), it does fix itself and I can connect to the remote computer using the computer name, which seems to support the DNS cache theory.
Despite what the error message says, if there have been no changes to the DNS or computer names, this is often a time synchronization problem (see relevant answers on ServerFault). Make sure the server's clock is properly synchronized, and that the client you connect from is within 5 minutes from the correct time. To connect despite the problem (e.g. to correct a configuration error on the server), simply do what is mentioned in the error message, i.e. connect using the IP address of the server.
Is there a way to establish a RDC to a computer in such a state as described above, without physically going to the remote computer? For instance, is there another DNS cache I can send a request to to update itself?
If I'm at the remote computer, I can connect to the original computer, so that's all working fine. If I had to guess, I'd say it is related to an outdated entry in a DNS cache somewhere, but I tried clearing my local DNS cache and it didn't help (> ipconfig /flushdns).
