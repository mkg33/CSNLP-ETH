To use an Xbox 360 wireless adapter on Windows you need to purchase a Wireless Gaming Receiver. You can find them on Ebay for ~15$.
You should just be able to plug it in and it should go. I have seen it done before, but I can't seem to find anything on the internet to back this up. 
However, if it does work, it is most likely to work on a 32-bit system, especially a Vista/7 system that will go out and download drivers for you. It will most definitely not work on a 64 bit machine.
Plug it in and it should just "work" or like my 5 year old like to refer to it as "computer magic" :)
It's highly unlikely that this will work at all. Microsoft does not like their components being used across different platforms (ie the Xbox 360 controller will not work on a Windows PC, you must by the '360 controller for Windows). 
The XBox Wireless adapters are just a generic USB wireless device.  Windows should have some drivers to support it, as the XBox is just a Windows computer (all be it running a very custom version of Windows).
