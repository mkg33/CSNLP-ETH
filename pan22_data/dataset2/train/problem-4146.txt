Keep in mind that chkdsk will just drop data in bad sectors, which can make things WORSE. :)   If bad sectors are suspected, consider obtaining and running SpinRite (in recovery mode), before using chkdsk in write-mode, as SpinRite will attempt to determine what the data in a bad block was before marking it off-line.
I have gone through starting/stopping services on start-up but still can't pinpoint the problem. (I did this because in safe mode everything seems normal (in terms of speed) however some problems still exist). I want to re-image his computer since he has a clonezilla backup image however his outlook files have to backed up first. I cannot even do this since the copy gets hanged up on 96.2% (i used regular drag and drop as well as robocopy). the outlook file is roughly 8gb and there is 100gb of free space on the external HDD. I tried to copy in safe mode with the same results. 
Warning: If the drive is really messed up, both chkdsk /F and SpinRite could take hours to complete.
I cannot add anything to the speed/performance  issue but  suggest removing the drive and attaching it directly to a working system to grab the data from Outlook. Either directly or with a USB adapter.
If it does report problems, you can then (re)run it in write-mode (check mark "automatically fix..." or run chkdsk c: /f and hopefully it will correct the problem enough tog et you working.
My coworker's computer stopped working properly. After login the Desktop loads then everything slows to a snails pace. Meaning opening My Computer could take up to 5-10 minutes. Then seemingly randomly the computer just freezes and wont complete any task although the cursor moves freely.
