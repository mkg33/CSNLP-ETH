I guess from that you can tell that HID Compliant Devices are most likely going to be some input devices or others you have connected to your computer. Disabling them all would probably lead your HID's to stop working, because you know... you disabled them. Are you sure this wasn't just some troll post that recommended you to do this?
Judging by the setup in device manager, I imagine "HID Compliant Device" is some sort of slot, so basically if you plug in another HID one of these slots will be filled to activate that device. It could also be left-over generic HID drivers for devices you have once upon a time plugged into your computer but are not currently plugged in (for faster hot-plugging). This could also actually be active drivers for your current devices or some of their components, I don't know because information about this on the internet seems lacking. But either way, I don't see why this would have any positive effects for anything. Definitely sounds like a shady deal to me, but please tell me how it goes if you try. Worst case, your Keyboard and mouse will stop working, what do you have to lose?
I haven't tried this myself. However from reading forums, this is a very common recommendation, and does apparently make a big difference. Apparently it shouldn't actually stop the devices from working, but may reduce some additional functionality.
after some investigation I found Under Human Interface Devices in device manager a HID-compliant device was the culprit.  I went one by one disable and re-enable until i found the one that was the issue.  Once i did i left it disabled.
