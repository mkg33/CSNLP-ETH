Once everyone is moved over, then move DNS to the new server.  Give it another day or two for DNS to move, and you're done.
I know there has already been a question that has been posted here about migrating shared hosting accounts, but wanted to get a second opinion on my plan to move hosting providers.  My business is moving our shared hosting account (hosting and email) to a new provider, and would like to have minimal downtime.  Here is our current plan:
When you're ready to enable the new mail server, simply log into the antispam provider's Web interface, change the IP to which it delivers mail, and you're off to the races!
No downtime should occur as for two weeks you will be pulling e-mail from both the new and old providers.
You could also move the email addresses one at a time to the new site, leaving DNS pointed at the old site.  Forward each mail address on the old site to @newserver.company.com as it gets moved. 
I'm hoping this should result in little downtime for both website and email.  Because of the volume of high-importance emails our company receives on a daily basis downtime is very expensive and not tolerated.
By having a third party as your MX record, you'll be able to move seamlessly to a new mail server without having to worry about stale DNS records or reconfiguring the old server to forward material to the new one.
