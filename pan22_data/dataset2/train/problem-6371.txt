You'll want to make sure that rediscluster is a registered save handler for sessions. You can check that in phpinfo().
You'll also want to tweak session garbage collection lifetimes and the probability that it'll happen on a given session_start() call to make sure old sessions are cleaned up.
Failover and distributing between master and slave nodes does not appear to be documented that well (I plan to raise a Github issue) but if you've only got a few shards and single nodes on each, I believe this should work (since AWS doesn't require you to list the endpoint of each node, and just the configuration endpoint).  You don't actually need to specify any options.
Your session save handler is set to redis, not rediscluster.  See: https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis/blob/develop/cluster.markdown#session-handler
You're also using the redis style for your save_path, not the rediscluster style.  That requires only hostname:port in the save_path, but also at least one seed at minimum.  It should look something similar to:
Where option is any of the options defined in the cluster.markdown file (timeout, read_timeout, persistent, failover... and maybe distribute).
