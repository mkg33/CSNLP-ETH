Here is the output of my ip route and swanctl --list-sas (I'm using swanctl to configure and control strongswan):
The keys for policy based routing are ip rule and ip route.  Create a new route table, an according rules to get traffic onto the table.
As you can see I have an IPSec connection between my hosted server called sv1 (37.17.x.x) and my home router (87.97.x.x). The server's routing table has only the default settings but you can see the IPSec policies called home-invitel, home-securewifi and home-lan that routes every traffic from the server to the home LAN subnets 192.168.100.0/24, 192.168.87.0/28 and 192.168.88.0/24 respectively. A fourth policy called sv1-local routes the traffic between my home endpoint and the 10.1.1.0/24 local subnet on the server.
So policy based routing has nothing to do with the routing table of the OS but it's using a separate "database" so ip route and such does not play here. You set up these policies with the IPSec config. IPSec can do the tunneling on its own.
How do you route traffic when doing policy-based routing ? All the tutorials I have encountered thus far only mention how to setup the ipsec connection, but none really explain how to route the traffic between the two endpoints or what additional steps are required for this process. Do I create a tunnel ? do I have to mark it ? add a route ? if so, then how is that any different from a route-based setup ? 
In linux, when it comes to route-based IPsec tunnels, it's pretty straight forward. Install one of the mainly ipsec implementations. Establish your security associations, add a VTI interface on each endpoint, add a mark to the VTI, change some sysctl opts and you can route traffic between the two endpoints.
