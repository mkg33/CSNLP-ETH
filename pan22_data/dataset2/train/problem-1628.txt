Now I can use this alias when I want only traffic for the internal network to be VPNed, and use the config without --route-nopull if I want all traffic to be routed through the VPN.
For example, if I am on an untrusted network, I want all my traffic routed through the VPN. Later however when on a trusted network I may just want SSH access to machines, but do not want all traffic routed since it would be unnecessarily slow.
In short, assuming you control your client, you control inter alia its routing tables, and you can set them up how you like.  Routing less to the server than it might wish is easy; routing more than it might require needs its cooperation, or at least its capability; but both are possible.
Based on the idea of deleting a route proposed by @MadHatter, I created an alias that does essentially this:
If on the other hand the server doesn't publish such a route, you may opt to route all your traffic over the VPN, though in this case you will need to ensure that (a) the VPN server is equipped to deal with this, and knows how to NAT/route your traffic to the internet, and deal with the replies, and (b) ensure that you don't have multiple default routes, and that you can still reach the VPN endpoint.
I have OpenVPN setup to route all traffic through the VPN. I am wondering if there is a way to switch whether all traffic is routed or just traffic destined for that network per client.
