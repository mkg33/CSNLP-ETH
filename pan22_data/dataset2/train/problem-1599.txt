I experienced the same and very specific scenario by trying to load a kernel using netbsd pxeboot bootloader.  It actually talks NFSv2.  8 years ago, this might also be the root cause, your debian client and rhel server did not talk the same language.  You could have enabled NFSv2 by adding -V2 as argument to rpc.mountd.  You can also eventually disable v3 and v4 with -N3,4.
I have two machine, an NFS server (RHEL) and a client (Debian).  The server has NFS set up, exporting a particular directory:
the linux kernel for example is trying to mount rootfs over UDP even for the NFSv4 and needed a special argument to be added at the tail of nfsroot. example: nfsroot=192.79.143.131:/diskless/client01,tcp
...and comment out whatever is in /etc/hosts.deny to make only hosts.allow active. NFS uses tcpwrappers and these files to control access along with what's in /etc/exports.
I've seen this if your /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny are not correct; check those files for a line with portmap in it and either comment it out (unsecure if you're not behind a firewall) or set the line on the client/server to be your specific subnet.
Unfortunately, rebooting the server solved the issue, so I still don't know why it was happening, but it's not anymore.
your rpcinfo indicates NFS is trying to connect over UDP. it appeared NFSv4 is no longer working over UDP but is expecting TCP to be used.
