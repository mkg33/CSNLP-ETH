Your computer being quite recent, I would check if you have status LEDs on it, or otherwise other status indicators, and compare with the manual if at least that is OK. That's a quick first step which might give you out the final answer straight away.
It turns out that it was a bad USB device (Wireless Keyboard/Mouse Combo) or a bad USB port on the MotherBoard (I am leaning toward the port on the MB).
Sometimes it's the small things... When you unplug, unplug a lot - all you can. But anyway, start with the diagnostic tools at hand: motherboard LEDs!
Someone spilled coffee into my keyboard so I had to revert back to a wired keyboard during the time I was waiting for it to dry and clean it. After a few days I thought
If that doesn't help, as you built it yourself, you can check the connections... First remove everything that isn't necessary - try keeping only the motherboard, the graphics card if there isn't an integrated one, the power supply and RAM. If it can't get to the bios at that point and that every connection is good... You can try another power supply, another graphics card, then you should know if it's the motherboard or what depending on how it reacts.
