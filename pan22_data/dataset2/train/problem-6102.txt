Is it possible, to change? What went wrong in my case, so the primary partitions seems to be that small? What do you recommend, how to change?
So I suspect your server has huge logs under /var/log directory or some program having big data files such as MySQL installed (check /var/lib/mysql). 
I never did it before, please keep that in mind if I ask a beginner question now, but the info I've found on the internet weren't really useful for my case.
For a typical root (/) partition 50 GB is plenty. A typical CentOS server installation takes anything between couple of hundreds of megabytes to perhaps 2 GB, a desktop installation can take couple of gigabytes more, depending on what gets installed.
To be honest, I don't understand much what I see, except that the "root" partition seems to be the primary partition and that this partition is full now.
My question is now, what to do? The actual partitions are coming from the automatic CentOS setup. All I want, is to have more space for the main partition, but I don't know how to get it AND I don't know if I need two different partitions ("root" and "home") at all?
