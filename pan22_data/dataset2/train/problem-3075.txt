What I had planned on doing was to get the site set up on the new server by navigating to the numeric IP address of the new server while the site is still active via the domain / original server. This isn't working however. When I try to navigate to the IP of the new server, it is redirecting automatically to the domain which is just taking me to my original server. 
I'm trying to transfer a wordpress site from one server to a new one and I don't want to take my site down during the process. The site is currently running on its original server and I just set up a new server via Laravel Forge / AWS. 
Ok, so it was actually a combination of multiple issues. I did have to edit the wp-config.php file as suggested by @Richard above. That didn't solve it alone. I also had to edit the nginx config file as well as follows.
I thought maybe this was an issue with the nginx config file but can't see anything in there that would explain this behavior. I'm a noob though so posting it here:
I also tried setting up an A record to point to staging.airfrying.net at my new IP but that is also redirecting to the original site.... Frustrating! Any help would be appreciated.
