If you model a TV, you can also model a human, you just need some time to get the feeling of the creation of soft body models.
You can type in your portfolio that you are level designer and show some beatifull landscapes for example. I think level designer is what you search for.
Also if you model long enough, your brain will get boored and you will start wanting to model something completely different, so in time you might get get interested.
PS: I had no idea coding games requires math knowledge, I'm not good at all in math, but I keep forward becouse I want to create a game :D
You can be level designer, make some fences, houses, rocks, perhaps lightining artist which is really crazy if you are good one.
On the other hand, I think you must spend some time trying to build characters, at every try you will get better. Traditional paining and 3D modelling are kinda different.
It sounds like the job title you should be shooting for is environment artist. Those are artist who specialize in scenery and props. There is generally a bigger demand for environment artists than character artists; if you think about all the open-world games coming out these days it's pretty obvious why.
animating objects often falls under effects (fire, smoke) or level design (doors opening, drawbridge moving) or tech art (all of the above).
If you work in a big company, there will probably be few 3D artists for specific tasks. One of them might be soft body modeller that will do characters and animals, etc.
