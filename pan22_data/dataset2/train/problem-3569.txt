Just curious what do you guys use for file or database encryption? Any good programs out there or techniques employed for securing IT personal information? Main reason is the company I work for has incredible too many IT passwords, which is good and bad, but the director would like to be able to store them all on a heavily encrypted file. Options?
I would create my own in-house application (web, c#, java, etc.) which would store all the passwords in one database, along with who has access to use them. Then, I would provide access to these passwords by authenticating the user with the company account (I presume this exists, either by in-house method, active directory, LDAP, etc.). When authenticated to the system, it would act as intermediary between them and whatever they are authenticating to. 
I know it's a bit of a pain to do things in house, but often it does exactly what the boss needs, and in my experience, if it's documented enough, will last a long time.
On boot your software can wait for a browser user to input the password. Then it would be stored in memory until next boot. Depends on your software of course.
You need to store all the relevant information in database as encrypted and fetch in encrypted mode back to the software. Inside your software you then decrypt them. Where you store this password is up to you. Some even require password on server boot, but if you store it on HDD or even on USB stick it can be read by unauthorized code.
Encrypting the database files, directory or partition helps nothing. The database software needs encrypted access and hackers use SQL connection to talk to unencrypted database.
