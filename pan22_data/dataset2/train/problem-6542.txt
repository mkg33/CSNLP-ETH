I was also facing the same problem. I am using Sonicwall device in between. Some firewall settings blocked it from showing the IP in tracert. 
Your default gateway isn't always the next hop. In fact it is generally the router of last resort. Your computer will parse the routing table and will only use the default gateway if no other more specific routes match. So do a route print and see what you find there.
In my enterprise, the gateways are all redundant.  From host side we set gateway to be 192.168.0.1, but that's a load-balanced IP managed by two routers who are actually 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.3.  When you traceroute, the outbound packet goes to destination x.x.x.1, but the IGMP reply packet comes from x.x.x.2 or x.x.x.3 depending on which router is active.  traceroute shows the IGMP originating address.
there enable check against Decrement IP TTL for forwarded traffic under Detection Prevention and test it and let me know is that is help full.
It could be @MikeR's answer. It could also be that your machine has a route to the 10.75.89.100 address that doesn't go through the default gateway, but instead goes through 10.77.121.3. Check your host's routing table to see if that's the case.
