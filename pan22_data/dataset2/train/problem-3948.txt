My issue is that if there is something like:  Between $52 million and $64 million... then looking 2 words ahead won't find the "and" because the $52 isn't read as one word.  Should I use something other than words to do this?  Or is there a way to read in a number as a word (or text)?
I a teacher and am creating a macro to look for common errors in my students' papers.  For example, I build a macro to look for the word "profit".  If it is found, it then looks at the previous word. If that previous word is not "operating" or "gross" or "net", then I return a comment to the student.
I have several items like this.  However, when I read through the document and look at the word before or after the desired word, numbers mess me up.  For example, I want to see if students use "and" when using "between" (they often mistakenly use between/to or between/through).  Thus, I have a macro to find the word "between" and then look at the next 2 words to see if either of them are "and".  If not, it returns a comment.
