I have 2 computers both with 1Gbps ethernet cars (PCI) and are connected to a 1Gbps capable Switch with Cat 5e ethernet cable. Why are file transfers so much slower than 100Mbps let alone 1Gbps.
Keep in mind, Windows Vista/7 reports transfer speeds in Megabytes per second (MBps) not Megabits per second (Mbps). Link speeds are rated in bits not bytes per second.  1000 Mbps is equivalent to about 125 MBps...but, many other factors (includding PCI bus limitations/HDD speeds/cable quality) reduce the 1Gbps throughput to something closer to 400 Mbps.  50-75 MBps transfer rates are not uncommon....on my 7200 RPM drive, I'm only getting 20 MBps.
One other minor point: Many routers and switches say that they're GigE capable, but are really just referring to the interface. Often the data transfer between ports will be limited to a much lower speed due to hardware/software reasons. 
My switch is connected to a router which is at least 100Mps ethernet speed. So would the file go from 
It depends on how the devices are connected.  If (as I suspect) your computers are on the same ip schema, and the switch has its uplink port into the router, then the router is not involved.  The router would only be included if it were two pcs on different ip schemas or subnets.
Write speeds on laptops suck, especially if its an old or fragmented drive. Also you need to understand the difference between megabit and megabyte. So a 100mbps network will allow a max transfer of about 95mbps which Windows will report is 9.5 MB/sec in the file transfer dialogue. What numbers are you seeing exactly?
You are limited to the hard drive speed of your SLOWEST drive in the transfer.  Your mega fast switch and NIC and badass new PC with the 15,000 rpm drives can only send data to the 10 yr old laptop as fast as it can write it to a drive.
