I think you are unwise to reject creation of variable used only once.  The forced line breaks you seem to be requesting are difficult if not impossible to implement in an aesthetically satisfactory way in an automated formatter - and if you're not using an automated formatter, you're wasting time.
While over time I feel that the clarity and readability of the code that I write has improved -- and lets hope for reasons other then white space -- I have never come to peace with how to break long lines.
So I would write the code as follows.  I like this because it makes reading the parameters more consistent, and doesn't indent them quite as far.
Adding white space to this line could improve readability. At one point in time or another have rationalized almost every possible behavior between:
Depending on previous indentation, some lines might flow over the "max line length", but I think that characters per line is more of a suggestion and there are good times to break that rule because breaking it leads to code that is more readable than code that doesn't.
