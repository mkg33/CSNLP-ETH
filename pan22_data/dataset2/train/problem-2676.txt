The problem was that when I upgraded Firefox it cleared all my settings (including in about:config - which is a total pain, but another story.)
Firefox did not used to work this way.  When you deleted everything, everything was deleted.  I have all the boxes checked except for browsing history.  A few versions ago I stopped using an addon that deleted flash cookies, because Firefox said that was necessary anymore, and also the plugin was incompatible with the new version.
The clear history defaults to "last hour" - which is practically invisible the way they have it laid you.  Who would ever use that setting????
After noticing this I went to the CCleaner site, which I used years ago, and the functionality I need is no longer part of their free version.
I noticed that my Amazon shopping cart still had items in it after I cleared all my data (except browsing history) and restarted Firefox later.  Also, when I came here to post this, I was already logged in to the stackoverlow system, and I just had to press a button to add superuser.  
I changed the clear history back to my prior settings, and what should be the default: "Time range to clear: Everything."  Now it has this huge warning flag that you will be clearing everything.  The huge warning flag should be shown when you will NOT be clearing everything.
