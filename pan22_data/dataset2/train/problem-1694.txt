I have made a game (I like to code when in my spare time) where words are taken at random from a list and displayed on a label. If they type it correctly, their wordcount goes up by 1 and the word is removed from the list. If they get it wrong, the word remains. If they enter nothing in an attempt to skip the long words, they get a skip. After their wordcount has reached 12 and their time is less than 60 seconds, they get the new high score.
The most important part of the program is the entry when the user types its text, yet it is tiny. Parts of the program should have sizes proportional to their importance.
You imported tkinter as a wildcard (*) so you should remove tkinter. from your program for proper operation.
You have a wordlist right inside your code. This makes it pretty annoying to change it and a non-programmer might actually be scared to change something inside a code-file. I suggest reading the words from a file, it is very easy:
The information text lacks spaces, some words stick to each other, giving a feeling of lack of professionality.
I wanted to share my code with you guys to find out if there is anything that can be improved in terms of code shortening or even bugs that I could've missed out when writing the program. Also, I made this in Python 3 and used the try and except to try and help it work in Python 2. I do not have Python 2 so could you please also try and see if it works on there.
In restart(event), all I see is a mess of code. What I want to see, or what I should see, is a properly formatted code:
