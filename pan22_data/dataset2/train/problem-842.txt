It's possible that your replication has been done programmatically, read "manually", as in code. You have no choice but to manually re-sync everything.
Before you try anything else, check if DB 2 is a replication slave of DB 1. Execute "SHOW SLAVE STATUS" on DB 2. If it gives you a result, it is likely, that an error occured, that stopped the replication.
To dig deeper, I recommend reading the MySQL manual, especially the chapter about replication setups: MySQL 5.0 Replication 
You need to first confirm if DB 2 only contains a subset of the DB 1 data, or whether both server contains records that the other doesn't (i.e. DB 1 is missing data also).  If this is the case, then remove the replication, wipe DB 2, and start again, doing it properly this time...
If the "running" columns show "No" and "seconds_behind_master" is greater than just a few seconds, check for value in "last_error". It should give you an idea of where the error occured. Try to fix it (by modifying the data on DB 2) and give it a new shot by running "START SLAVE" on DB 2. Check "SHOW SLAVE STATUS" immediately afterwards.
