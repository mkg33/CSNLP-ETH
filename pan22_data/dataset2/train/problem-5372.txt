While IPv6 proponents strongly encourage use of /64 subnets it is possible to use smaller ones and allocate addresses by DHCPv6. You can then use proxy NDP on your router to pick up traffic from the ISPs router so it can be routed to your internal subnets.
Another option is to use NAT. The IPv6 proponents don't like NAT but that doesn't make IPv6 NAT impossible. Linux added support for IPv6 NAT in 3.7.
This is particularly likely to be an issue for power users and small buisnesses who use "broadband" type internet connections but want to split up their internal networks. 
In an ideal world ISPs would provide their clients with a prefix to route as needed on their internal networks. Sadly that doesn't always seem to be the case, some only allocate a single /64, others allocate a /56 to the home router but don't provide any facilities for actually using it.
Yes, IPv6 uses one /64 per LAN. Your ISP should give you a /48 or at least a /56. They get plenty of addresses from their RIR and they should distribute them properly. The whole idea behind IPv6 is to give everybody plenty of addresses, and ISPs that give you only a /64 are screwing it up...
