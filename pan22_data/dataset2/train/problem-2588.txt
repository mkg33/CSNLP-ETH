I had a quick look on google but only really came up with Make for Windows the last version of which dates back to 2006. Maybe it is just incredibly well done and stable, but I would still like to know:
I have a LaTeX project using make files for compilation and want to write the texts on Windows using Kile.
In the ideal case I would like to configure the tool into Kile (which is running on Windows, yes) and run it from there.
Another way is to use nmake command provided by the windows SDK but, in this case, you have to edit some part of the makefile.
there is a way, first you have to download an ubuntu oficial image in dockerhub and then something like this docker run -d -v C:/Users/francis.delacruz/Projects:/mnt/test ubuntu /bin/bash, in your windows desktop continue doing your makefile because you will execute in your linux container even you could deploy all in this terminal bash just you nedd to install all dependecies finally just test. when you put this -v in the container it will mount windows desktop memory into the ubuntu container so its like a mixture. i hope this was helpfull for you.
