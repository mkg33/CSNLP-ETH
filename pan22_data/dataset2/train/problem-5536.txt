You need to first understand the requirements for the technology you're trying to implement before attempting to set it up. All high availability VM scenarios require shared storage. That can be a fibre SAN, an iSCSI SAN, or a direct attached SAS enclosure. The VHDs are stored on this shared storage which is accessible by all machines in the cluster. That is the disk that is suitable for cluster uses. So, your next steps involve writing up a proposal, presenting it to the decision makers, and spending some money.
I am trying to setup a failover cluster with two nodes. After running the validation tests, the storage sections had many warnings. The next step after creating the cluster with two nodes on the same domain is to add storage. I right click on storage and choose "add a disk", then I get the following error: 
No disks suitable for cluster disks were found. For diagnostic information about disks available to the cluster, use the Validate a Configuration Wizard to run Storage tests. 
This is not possible without using a shared-storage technology like iscsi. Hyper-V does not support shared SCSI, which is what would be needed to have multiple Hyper-V instances to access the same .VHD file.
