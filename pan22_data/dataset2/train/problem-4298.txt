Depending on your application, a software firewall inside the OS might be good enough, but a NIC isn't private just because you label it private. The NICs are on the same broadcast domain, and any NIC on that broadcast domain can communciate with any other NIC on that broadcast domain. If you want this to not be the case, you need either physical or logical network separation.
Putting your public and private networks on 1 VLAN is a security no-no. It will probably work, but it's worth the small investment for a semi-managed switch. 
I have servers with two NICS each. The first NIC is public and the second NIC is private. The router will plug into the switch port 1 let's say (public). Then server 1 public plugs into port 2 on the switch, and sever 1 private plugs into port 3 on the switch. The public interface is: 192.168.X.X / 255.255.0.0 and the private interface is 10.0.X.X / 255.255.0.0.
Depending on the price difference, and how security and privacy are an issue, I would advice the VLANs able switch. Another reason is that usually those devices benefit from a better build and a stronger internal firmware.
I am wondering if I need to buy a switch which is managed (VLAN support) for my configuration, or will a cheaper unmanaged switch work?
Or you can just buy two unmanaged hubs/switches, one for public and one for private. That's a little more secure since there is no possibility of a mis-configuration mixing the two.
