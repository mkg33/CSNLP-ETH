alternatively (but only if you really can't) you can change to not use the RAID controller, but instead use it the SATA connectors without any form of RAID. This means the RAID controller is deactivated and certain speed optimizations are not in effect slowing things down.
Run it and see if it comes across with any errors. If it does then replace your memory and if not then work down the line of components that could be affected.  Blue screens are always shown when there is a hardware problem so you basically need to keep testing components until you find the bad guy :)
I locked out my DVD/CD drive and installed the program successfully from a old CD drive using a non-SATA connection. Worked.
There's a lot to be said about all the steps of this, but what you basically need is to integrate these driver packs,
If you get this error, its usually because you have setup your harddisk to be SATA RAID, but setup was unable to find the right driver and the BSoD is caused because it tries it with default drivers and fails.
Blue screens are very often linked to memory problems. (they can be more but most common)  I would recommend running a memory test. Try this -- > http://www.memtest86.com/
