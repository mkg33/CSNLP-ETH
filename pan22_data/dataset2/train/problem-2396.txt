This article is only a few months old and provides some pretty good ideas about what to look out for in the current options:
It really does most anything Exchange does, but is more light weight, doesn't require hughe hardware or licensing costs.  I loved it while I was on it.
I've deployed it in the past as a decent replacement for Exchange. The Outlook plugin can lag a bit a bit behind the current version of outlook - took 6 months for a plugin for outlook 2007, for example. 
Stores everything in flat RFC822 files so no broke Exchange store, has a great management interface and stellar support.
At my last job I migrated us off of Intermedia's Exchange service to Kerio Mail Server. It has great webmail (much easier and lighter than OWA), LDAP, ActiveSync and support for NotifyLink/Sync.  It looks like Exchange to anyone using Outlook or Entourage.  GAL, resource booking, calendars, built-in spam and AV.
It offers a MAPI provider that allows Outlook to connect almost exactly as it would if you were using Exchange. I can confirm from personal experience that it works well, runs on Linux, and very few of my users know the difference.
You have OBM from Linagora. It's main objective is to replace Exchange. Most of the web site is in French but you can probably contact them and get info.
