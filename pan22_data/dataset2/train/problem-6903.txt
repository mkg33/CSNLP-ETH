The obvious issue you're trying to avoid (and nevertheless, will fall into by definition of "iterative process") is that the work you do on levels will need to be re-done when your mechanics change. If you have a core few levels, that's not a big task. If you have 90% of your levels done when you realize your character doesn't jump high enough, then you've got a lot of work ahead.
I'm not sure if I'd agree that you should start on levels as soon as possible. Maybe a core few - what you feel are going to be your most fun levels. But as long as you feel you can vary your puzzles in enough imaginative ways, I'd say it's not a bad thing to have 70% of your levels un-made some time into development.
To try to put it simply, game design is an iterative process that can take a long time to "find the fun". Once you have found the fun, you can being the arduous task of nailing the details in place, and making a suite of levels that make use of the mechanics.
It's hard for me to give much advice on the story without knowing what it is, but I will say you should try to be careful about letting it influence your game mechanics too much. The end goal, easier said than done, is story elements that fit well with their accompanied twist to the gameplay (you found a lost, distressed girl - maybe the two of you can work together through the next 18 puzzles to find your way home!) If that becomes too difficult of a goal, I don't think too many people would blame you for amounting your story to simple cutscenes between level-blocks.
Minimal gameplay elements sounds like a great idea - simplicity makes these things very easy to understand. However, around the time that testers would begin to get bored, you should probably think about "what interesting twist might breathe new life into this?"
