To add on to @Tasos, if you have passengers who have taken multiple flights you can also calculate the lag between flights / bookings, the number of flights taken in total, the number of flights taken within a time period, etc. You could then also layer means, medians, and standard deviations onto these features.
A neat solution to this is to use cyclical transformations like sin and cos, adjusting appropriately for periodicity.
An important consideration when feature engineering date variables is the "distance" between encodings. As an example, you might encode Sunday == 7 and Monday == 1. By most metrics, the "distance" between these two encodings would be quite large, even though we know in reality that there isn't that much difference between them. (Similar examples include December == 12 and January == 1; last week of year 1 == 52 and first week of year 2 == 1).
If you have the destination of the flight, then you can use an external source and get the holidays or specific "big events"
You could assume a normal distribution of weeks the customers bought their tickets, use mean and standard deviation as parameters of each customers individual distribution, calculate quantiles for each customer (e.g. 2.5%, 25%, 75% and 97.5%) and use them as additional features.
Date fields are quite interesting data since the limit of what you can "feature engineer" with them is your imagination. However, it is difficult to know a priori if one of them will improve your model before you try it.
