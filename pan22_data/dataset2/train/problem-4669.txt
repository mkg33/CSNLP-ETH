I'm trying to think of sounds that will help convey the time of day and weather condition. I'm not even sure of all the weather conditions I would consider, and some are obvious. Like if it's raining, the sound of rain. But then I'm thinking, what about for a calm day? If it's morning time, I could do birds chirping or something. Night time could be an owl or something. What are some good combinations of sounds/weather/time to have a good effect?
Animal Crossing is a real-time game (meaning the game keeps track of the time), and it had a different background tune for each hour of the day; the tune in the middle of the day is upbeat, "friendly" sounding, and the night one is very quiet and slow with some extra percussion sounds thrown in. I don't recall any bird chirping sounds, though there is the sound of water running when you walk near a stream and the sound of your own footsteps when you walk around (specific to the material being walked on), and there definitely was the pitter-patter of rain when it was raining.
