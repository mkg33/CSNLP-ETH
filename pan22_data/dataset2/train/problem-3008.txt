which is a better tool for VMs than VirtualPC in my opinion. You can run the VM in full screen mode with this tool, although I can't find options for changing the resolution.
You shouldn't need to install any additional drivers to get VM machines to run, your host OS provides the hardware/drivers to the VM and the VM essentially talks through the host OS to the hardware.  
VM Player runs great in XP and Vista, although no matter what you are running it in, if at all possible you should run it off of a different hard drive than your host OS to improve performance.
You need a driver for the vm. E.g. vm-ware provides the VM-Ware tools. If you do not have something like this, I would try the normal Linux/Ubuntu driver for your graphic card.
I generally avoid using Virtual PC for Linux.  I suggest getting the VMWare Player software and finding an VM Image of Ubuntu online.  This will give you a much better experience.  The resolutions will automatically resize to whatever your host OS is setup to unless you change the option.  Virtual PC is nice for running Windows because it is possible to circumvent the licensing issues if you are running an OEM version of Windows (i.e. Dell) on that manufacturer's hardware.  If you start virtualizing Windows you may need to upgrade to VMWare Workstation.
