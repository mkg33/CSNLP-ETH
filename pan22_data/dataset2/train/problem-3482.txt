I highly recommend Slicehost or Rackspace Cloud. They are VPS solutions and they worked very well to suit my needs. Slicehost costs about 38 for a 512 MB solution and Rackspace Cloud costs under 40 (typically) for a similar solution under Cloud Servers.
In response to davemac your looking for a LAMP solution.  Most important here will be to find out database size requirements, compliance needs, uptime SLA agreement, backups, bandwidth and level of support and outside consulting + migration if needed.
Recently faced with terrible service from 1and1 and planning to switch hosting provider.  What  can you recommend?  I'm looking for Linux,PHP.MySQL, Java is a big plus.
However, if you are looking for a little more than shared hosting, moving to a VPS (Virtual Private Server) host gives you even greater control over your hosting environment. You will pay more for this, but the benefits are that you are able to run your own (virtual) server with full access, configure it how you wish and you are not affected issues that arise with shared hosting ie; other users on the same box inadvertently bringing down the server. For VPS hosting, I have found wiredtree.com to be reliable, comparatively priced and to offer good support.
I've been happy with my MediaTemple dv (dedicated virtual), so I figure that their gs (shared hosting) is fine.
My experience with Bluehost.com over the years has been a good one, if you are looking for shared hosting. They offer shell access (if you provide identification details) and the usual LAMP stack along with cPanel. I am based in Australia, and have had no trouble contacting them via email or Skype calls when I have needed support.
