I don't have any informations about pricing, but without a license file it will still run for 1 hour before reloading. 
I tried to search both on Internet and corporate intranet, but I don't even know what to look for...
While we can have access to lab devices, I'd like to know if there is any emulator or simulator of ALU routers on which we can practice and test some configs.
My company recently deployed several Alcatel-based networks (7750SR) for ethernet and IP transport, and me and my team will have to support a part of it. 
Go to this web site http://www3.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/src/mysrlab. You can purchase time from ALU so that you can practice your configurations and prepare for the exams.
It exists within Alcatel-Lucent. They use it for classroom instruction. I used it taking the  Alcatel-Lucent Scalable IP Networks 4A0100 class.
The "vSim" SR-OS is limited in terms of pps (250pps IIRC), and there is another release, "vRR" that's intended for production use as a route-reflector.
We're quite used to troubleshoot on Cisco and Juniper routers, but Alcatel-Lucent TiMOS is new to us and really different.
