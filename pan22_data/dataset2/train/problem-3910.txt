In that case, your only real option is to restrict the misbehaving user to a non-administrator account / not give root access, or monitor through something not installed on the computer. With full access on the computer, every monitoring program can be disabled/uninstalled.
If it has to be all on one system, give the user a restricted account. If that is not feasible, there's little you can do. You can problably try to find a monitor that hides or logs its activity, but with admin rights you can subvert everything, so it'll be an ongoing struggle...
If you all have separate computers, the best bet is to use a router/switch (dedicated, or separate PC) that can meter traffic. If only you have the admin password (and noone can rewire the network), that cannot be circumvented. Unfortunately, I don't know any cheap home router that supports this.
That said, I assume from your question that you all share one computer and you just installed a monitoring software on it.
Or you might want to find a social solution (i.e. talk to him) :-). But I guess you already tried that...
