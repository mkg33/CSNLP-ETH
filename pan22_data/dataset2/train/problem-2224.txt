I am getting a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with 1 GB RAM and quad core processor. I am looking for a light weight operating system to install on it. I will be using it mostly for web browsing. I was thinking of Ubuntu, but the standard Ubuntu already eats up most of the RAM. Is there a light version of Ubuntu without all the unnecessary background processes? Or perhaps another light linux distribution that is still not too primitive? I wonder how good raspbian is? Any thoughts?
Different OS's are best at different things. But if you are wanting to do web browsing, the Raspberry Pi isn't a very good device for that. The GUI bogs the Pi down, making browsing painful. Raspberry Pi's are best used for command-line accessible processing power.
I'm very happy with Raspbian on the Pi 3. Tho I'd be much happier with a 64-bit version, but the 32-bit version is already fast enough.
I can't say that the GUI is eating all resources. You could try the Windows OS to get some punishment.
Unless you have any reason to go with a particular distro i'd stick with raspbian that is tailor made for the raspberry
