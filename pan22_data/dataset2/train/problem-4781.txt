Also, there is a quantum algorithm to evaluate NAND-trees with a polynomial speed-up over classical computation [8,10,11]. The NAND tree is an example of a game tree, a more general data-structure used to study matches of board games such as Chess and Go. It sounds plausible that this kind of speed-ups could be used to design more powerful software game-players. Could this interest some quantum-video-games developers?
Unfortunately, playing games in reality is not exactly the same thing as evaluating trees: there are complications, e.g., if your players are not using optimal strategies [12]. I have not seen any study considering a real-life scenario, so it is hard to say how beneficial is the speed-up from [8] in practice. This could be a good topic for discussion.
planning in artificial intelligence and haplotyping in bioinformatics. Although I do not know much about these topics, this line of research looks rather practical to me.
It is known that Grover search can be used to polynomially seep-up the solution to NP-complete problems [1]. This is proven for 3-SAT in [2]. Some applications of SAT, borrowed from [3], are: checking circuit equivalence, automatic test-pattern generation, model checking using  Linear Time Logic,
Visioning is both dangerous and polemic in this field, so we should be cautious with this topic. Yet some Q-algorithms with polynomial speed-ups have interesting potential applications.
