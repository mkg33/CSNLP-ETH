This happens if you set iis/asp.net error pages to a dynamic page such as 500.aspx, 404.aspx and error is site wide so every request gets same error. It looks like due to session blocking iis waits previous to finish before processing dynamic error page and queues your request. as number of requests increase memory increases.
I might have found the reason. I don't know why that didn't happen on iis7 or 6 but what happens is this.
i've noticed this usually happens if there are continuous errors. as i didn't change anything in the code am i safe to assume it is not related to memory leak in the code?
I have this web site written in c#. around 400-500 users online at any time. it was on windows 2008 32 bit machine before and never ever locked/slowed down due to increased memory consumption up until i upgraded it's server to win 2008 r2 64 bit.
since i've upgraded the server i noticed (2 times with in 10 days) it started to eat ram. last night it went up to 4 gb ram. with ram increase response slows down quite a lot. recycling app pool doesn't help. I have to restart it's worker process to recover.
