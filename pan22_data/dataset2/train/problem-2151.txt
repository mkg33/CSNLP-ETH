If you have purchased a wildcard or UCC certificate then it will allow either unlimited subdomains (in the case of a wildcard) or mulitple domains up to a certain number (in the case of UCC).
If you have purchase a standard, single domain SSL certificate, then it will be for one domain, so you can only use it for domainname.com or www.domainname.com. 
This is not an issue actually that is specific to IIS, but related to SSL certificates in general. According to this site (https://www.clickssl.net/blog/do-i-need-different-ssl-certificates-for-www-non-www-domain), GeoTrust allows you to buy a certificate that is for both www and no-www. You have to request it for www if you want that capability though.
As Chris S alluded to, just go with a Provider that will give you a Subject Name Alternative so both example.com and www.example.com can be used.
It depends on how you have IIS configured. If you are certain the cert has both example.com and www.example.com in the SN and/or SAN then it will work for both, simple configure it in the bindings for the site(s). If you don't know how to configure the cert in the bindings section of IIS, then that's a wholely different problem.
