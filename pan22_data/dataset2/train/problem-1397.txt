My question is what performance counters or whatever can I log that will help show that SQL server is waiting on I/O, but not because its asking for more than normaly, instead beacuse the disk is to busy to respond to the requests from sql server as quickly as it normally would?
I've been arguing with a DBA and a couple hardware guys about performance issues on our SQL server.  Normally everything is fine, however over the past few weeks we have been having huge lag spikes in sql server.  Its clear that SQL Server is waiting on disk I/O.  But I keep getting told that it is beacuse SQL Server is asking for abnormally high I/O.  Which isn't the case.  I can see from what is running that there is nothing out of the normal, and all the DBA cares to look at is what is causing the blocking and so on, which is useless.  For instance the major thing we see backing up is operation on the ASPState database, which we are using to manage the ASP Session State on the web servers.  These operations are normally never seen on Sp_who2 active results because they occur so quickly.  The database is in simple recovery mode and logging is miminal.  However during these lag spikes we can see alot select and update operations on the database being blocked or waiting.   I'm sure what is going on is that someone or some job is running something that is causing heavey disk usage on the raid arrays used for that databases log and data files.  The problem is proving it, since no one wants to admit they are doing something that is killing our website.
