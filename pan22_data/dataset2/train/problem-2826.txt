I have a Lenovo Miix (I think 2) running Windows 10. You can disable the touch pad on the keyboard in the Devices and Printers Control Panel: my first HID-Compliant mouse was the touch pad. I clicked Change Settings and disabled the driver. Ta-daaa! (This worked for me in Windows 8.1, too.) 
In the latest Preview version, it is possible to disable the touchpad via the control panel based on whether or not a USB input device is connected. Basically how you'd expect it to work in the first place.
it's not about the driver, Just enable back vertical scroll feature from synaptics touch pad setting, that's it, just done that successfully 
There is a check box to turn off touch pad if USB mouse is attached. Just disabling it will only work until you shut down your computer.  This is a permanent turning it off every time you reboot if you have a USB mouse attached.
