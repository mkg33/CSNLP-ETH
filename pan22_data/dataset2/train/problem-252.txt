OpenVPN's security makes heavy use of SSL/TLS transmitting data across the wire, and the recommended authentication is through using PKI. If implemented correctly and configured properly, OpenVPN can be considered secure.
I think you will find PPTP is fundamentally broken - see here. - the only use case I can see for it is "ease of use" when setting up with clients that don't support OpenVPN - but both Android and Mac now support OpenVPN.
This all depends on you knowing what you are doing. For example, if you configured it to use 1024 bit RSA certificates for authentication, that is now considered weak. Using/not using a static hmac key can also have an overall effect on the overall security - the ISP in my country actively attacks OpenVPN traffic, without a static auth key I would not be able to establish a tunnel. 
OpenVPN is more secure then PPTP.   I don't think there are any fundamental differences between IPV4 and IPV6 from the point of view of the tunnel, save that IPV6 has more space.  
OpenVPN now allows you to use a couple of SSL librarries, OpenSSL (since LibreSSL is said to be API compatible with OpenSSL, it may work, but I haven't tried it myself) and PolarSSL. For example, I compiled OpenVPN from source on my VPS and told it to use PolarSSL instead of OpenSSL, and thus my server was immune to heartblead, but not some of my clients.
I have heard that using ipv6 in combination with a PPTP vpn can expose your true ip address, so I have been using a PPTP VPN with ipv4 for the past few months. I am considering switching to an openVPN because of the higher encryption, but it doesn't want to connect, it appears to be because I still have ipv6 disabled. Which is more secure? Ipv6 + openVPN or ipv4 + PPTP?
