I have Outlook 2013.  It appears that this option is set as a default.  I kept loosing the functionality of my rules, and kept executing clean rules and creating the rules again.  I never looked at the setting on the second dialog box.  And I don't recall this as a default in 2007 nor 2010.

To circumvent it, you need to set up a rule through the advanced options.  The short method will end up with that selection defaulted as on.
The condition you want to change isn't on the conditions page. It's on the actions page. Click Next and look near the bottom of the list.
Yes, you have to click Next and remove the tick "stop processing more rules" at the top. And then click Finish. My problem by not doing this is that when a rule has been applied to a mail from a certain person, the next time you get a mail from the same person, the rule doesn't apply, which might be a bug in Outlook 2013, or dumb programming.
The meaning of the "and stop processing more rules" action is, "and stop processing more rules ON THIS MESSAGE".  You are correct that it is not very clear exactly what that action means.  Microsoft could and should change the wording to be more precise.
So every time you are creating a rule, you have to go through this procedure or your rules will only work once. 
Click "Next" to move to the "Select Action(s)" page of the wizard.  You will be presented with the option of unchecking the "and stop processing more rules" action.
Turns out that if a client-side rule has the "Stop processing more rules" command, then any following server-side rules are not executed - I guess because the server gets the message first and doesn't know whether the client-side rules will be triggered, so it assumes that it will.
