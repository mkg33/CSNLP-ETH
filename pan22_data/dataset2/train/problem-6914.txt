So I have a situation and I need to figure out what to do about it before Hurricane Irene hits Saturday evening. I mentioned in another question that I'm running (the GUI equivalent of) chkdsk /r on a secondary hard disk drive (that I pulled out of my parents' computer) on my computer (running Windows 7 Pro x64). It's plugged in as drive D:, so it's not being used except for being scanned by chkdsk. I started it on Friday evening last night and it's been running through today. It looks like it's about 90-95% done according to the progress bar, but it's been progressing so slowly that I do not know if it will complete before Hurricane Irene hits this weekend (we expect rain and then wind to pick up Saturday afternoon-evening). It is very likely that we'll have power fluctuations/outages during this storm, and I do not want my computer to simply lose power in the middle of running chkdsk on that drive, and since it's taken so long and it's almost done, I don't want to simply cancel and start over later.
So, my thought is that perhaps I could simply hibernate the computer before the storm hits. If I do that, would it create any problems when resuming the computer, thereby resuming chkdsk?  Basically, is there anything about the tool that requires it to be on at all times during the course of its run, or can I allow it to hibernate without any issues?
I have hybrid sleep enabled on my computer, so I likely will simply sleep it and if the power goes out, let it turn off (since I can then unhibernate it later). This should work, right?
