I could go on about how I would use Objects for those products in stead of arrays, and there remain a few things to be said about the markup you are using (it is not very semantic, it should probably be a ul of articles at the least), but I think I gave you enough food for thought now.
Allow me to comment on @OliverMaksimovic remark about going for straight html in stead of using an array. I do believe it is much better to use an array here. It makes the code a lot easier to maintain (what if you want to change the markup of a product, you would have to make that change multiple times). Also, if you ever decide to fetch those products from a database or something, you could basically keep your template as is, you would just have to change the $products declaration.
There is not very much going on in your code. It is basically just a template, so not very much room for improvement when it comes to the logic. It could be a bit better when it comes to style and readability though. Allow me to refactor the code to the way I would write it:
