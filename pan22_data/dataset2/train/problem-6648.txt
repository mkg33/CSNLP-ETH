If you must reinstall, CentOS is a nice stable choice as long as you don't require a recent version of Python (it uses Python 2.4 and if you want newer versions you need to install them side by side).
2) CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux - much longer support life cycle. Typically, 7 years.  Often much more mature (read: stable) software in use. A little bit limited in the software which comes prepackaged by the vendor which means you're not always going to have the latest and greatest software easily available. 
I recently migrated my own webserver from CentOS to OpenSuSE (needed Python 2.6, didn't want to screw around with parallel Python installs). YaST is nice, and provides a very minimal learning curve and it's got some other nice tools (eg. cnf. Why hasn't anyone else done this). You've got zypper (yum equivalent) if you prefer to do things by the command line.
Depends on what you need, but if Fedora is doing the job acceptably then IMHO there isn't enough of a benefit to warrant a reinstall.
4) Ubuntu - Similar to Debian just slightly newer (read: immature of sometimes less stable) software available.  Good life cycle, especially when using LTS.  
I always choose for CentOS as it's very stable and it's a gratis version of enterprise-like Linux like Red Hat Linux.  also haven't found a server control panel that has no support for it.
3) Debian - Rock solid, reasonable life cycle. Mature software.  Much, much larger selection of software packages available.  Choice of debian linux zealots everywhere :) 
1) Fedora release cycle is a bit crazy, means you're living on the bleeding edge all the time.  Also means that before you know it a newer release has come out and it is time to do a complete OS upgrade.  Less than ideal for a production environment and I would avoid it for this reason alone.
