We happen to be using a CMS (DotNetNuke) that has some redirection capability built-in, but various caches must be rebuilt every time a redirect is added or removed, which causes some painful performance problems when adding or removing redirects. 
Have you considered a custom 404 error handler in IIS to do the translation after the page isn't found? You could then do DB lookups or whatever is needed to do the translation. 
I suspect there may be an alternate storage method for IIS redirects, or perhaps there is another method that I don't know about.
For those that are interested in perhaps convincing me that we don't need so many redirects, I hope you are right. Here's some details:
I've looked at IIS Redirection. However, these redirects are stored in the web.config for the site. It feels wrong to be modifying the web.config up to a dozen times every day during live site operation with redirects. It also feels wrong to have so many redirects in a single web.config. 
The set of redirects is not static. We will be adding and removing redirects more than a dozen times per day.
Is there a good method for accomplishing this that will allow us to add and remove redirects without affecting live site performance significantly?
