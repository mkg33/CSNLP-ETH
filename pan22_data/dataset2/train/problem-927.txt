This is an intermittent issue and I have tried to replicate it at the Genius bar, but without success.  It has started happening more and more in the past year.  As it was intermittent I didn't contact Apple about it until it got more frequent after my Apple Care had expired.
Anyone know what controls the keyboard illuminating, is there a sensor of something that could have come loose in my case that just needs to be fixed?
I have a June 2009 MBP 13 also and have the same issue and the same excuses from genius bar.  In my case often I will boot the machine up and I notice that if the keyboard does not illuminate on startup the computer will sleep immediately at login and will not wake.  Same issue loops when restarting.
Because that this is apparently not something they fix when a unit is returned, refurbished, and re-certified (see my comments above), my recommendation would be to install ImsomniaX or Caffeine and just keep it on when you want it on. Unfortunately, this disables the intentionally built-in pow-saving features, so if you care about saving power, you have to take a hands-on approach to that.
I think it my case this may be the Hall sensor in the keyboard assembly.  It is also possibly the keyboard ribbon cable.  I will disconnect it from the ZIF connector and reconnect it and see if that fixes it as I know this is a common cause of the issue.  Hope this helps some of you experiencing the same problem.
I have recently found a workaround solution.  If I turn the computer upside down for the startup (seriously) the keyboard illuminates and all is fine, no sleep issue.
