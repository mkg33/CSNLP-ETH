I'm assuming you are on a windows machine. In that case you can download a free software called bitvise tunnelier. If you have an external SSH account, you could use the software to ssh to it and use port forwarding and setup a socks server on your computer. You could then set the proxy settings on your torrent client to use socks proxy and set the host as 127.0.0.1 and the port as the one that tunnelier is listening on. This will get torrents to work (also you can set the same proxy settings in your browser to access blocked websites).
Meanwhile, if you have a home machine active while you are at work, you can control it to work torrents.
I've gotten around some restrictions with Free Download Manager.  But, don't blame me if you get fired for leaching your company bandwidth. :)
I'm providing the following information as knowledge and do not intend it to be used for any illegal or malicious activities :).
The purpose of the bit torrent protocol is just to be able to distribute the bandwidth across all the peers. What you're suggesting defeats that purpose.
If you have a virtual private server, than you can install a command line torrent client on that like rtorrent and download the completed torrents via http in office, but if its shared hosting, it can get your hosting account blocked. If you dont want to use cli client, install torrentflux on your webserver, it has a nice webgui
The best you can do is indeed like @nik suggests try to control your home machine (using something like LogMeIn) and download the torrents there.
