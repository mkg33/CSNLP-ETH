At high frequencies, the energy lost to the magnetic field is greater (more transitions) At some point the loss is too significant, and the signal is no longer received correctly.
There are also other reasons why higher frequencies are hard to achieve on a motherboard. For example, electricity only travels so fast (speed of light, if we neglect the propagation properties of the wires) and this can become significant when timings drop under a certain threshold. because the actual level of the signal is different on different places on the wire. In a CPU, the distance traveled by the current is smaller, so this problem is encountered at higher frequencies. There is also endpoint resonance to take into account, etc.
The basic reason (in simple terms), is that any electric current creates an electromagnetic field around it. (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction) Any electric current variation induces a variation in the electromagnetic field, which costs energy.
At low frequencies, these variations happen rarely enough that the lost energy is negligible compared to the total energy running through the wire, as the current flows and transports energy for a longer period of time for each transition.
Also, then the total energy emitted into the air is sufficient to be captured by other wires. (In the same way that an electric current generates an electromagnetic field, an electromagnetic field generates a current)
