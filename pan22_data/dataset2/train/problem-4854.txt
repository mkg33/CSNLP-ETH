They are "propagated" to DNS servers around the world in the same sense that ideas are propagated from one mind to another. When a query comes in, the local DNS cache needs to learn the information (if it's not cached already, or if it's cached but it's expired). So, the new value you just pushed to your server shows up on the map pretty much like gossip shows up on the blogs. Well, not exactly the same, but I think it's a neat analogy.
So maybe the original phrase of "change propagation" was more appropriate at the time, since it was a two-step process.
Not a myth, we see "speed of propagation" issues fairly frequently when changing MX records.  It's always when we don't control the DNS and are working through a third party so we usually can't tell if the TTL is very long, it is being ignored by some DNS servers, the MX is cached by the SMTP server or some combination of all 3.  Regardless, it's painful when it happens. 
Only after DNS NOTIFY (RFC 1996) was specified in the year of 1996, there was a standard way of promptly notifying all authoritative name servers about zone changes.
I wouldn't call it a myth.  The TTL on the caching does have the side effect of stale records being held onto after the DNS entries have been updated on the authoritative DNS server.
In the original DNS specification (RFC 1034/1035) there were two steps of cache invalidation that needed to take place, before a zone update was globally visible. Additionally to the already mentioned TTL expiry of caching resolvers around the world, you first needed to wait for (all) your secondary name server(s) to refresh the zone data from the primary's zone.
