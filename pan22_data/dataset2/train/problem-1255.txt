i need to know if there is any Tool (specifically for FreeBSD) , through which i can get the Realtime network traffic usage of any Host/IP , and which should also run on Multiple interfaces as well?
Also if you are at the console or can ssh in, pftop gives real time info, and according to this thread http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php/topic,11289.0.html the bandwidthd package can also give per ip info.
You could install the pfflowd package which is a netflow emitter - I only played around with it a little and found some netflow collectors didn't seem to like it as it didn't totally conform to standards. 
This thread http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=11185.0 mentions people being happy with Manage Engine's Netflow Analyzer Pro although the thread also mentions the free version only supports one interface. (and you need to run this on a box external to your pfsense)
When you say ntop is no use -is that because you had problems using ntop, or that it didn't give you sufficient info?
