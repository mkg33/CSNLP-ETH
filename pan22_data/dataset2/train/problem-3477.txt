If you don't have the install discs, you can contact Apple and they'll ship it to you for a small fee. After installing an older version of OS X, you can then upgrade to El Capitan if your Mac meets the hardware requirements.
You can't get Mac OS for free, but you can run most versions of GNU/Linux on a Mac.  Even the older macs (PowerPCs, LCIIs) will run GNU/Linux, although they will be somewhat slow and probably not good for even general flash-filled browsing nowadays.
No. Mac OS X costs $129 USD and is available through Apple. While you may be able to find some locations that sell it for slightly less, you will not be able to obtain it for free unless, say, a friend gives it to you.
Reading posts on this thread, if you don't have access to an Apple ID, you can use OS X Internet Recovery to install the version of OS X that came with the machine when you purchased the Mac.
Nope, sorry. However, you can (questionably legally) buy a copy of Mac OS X and install it on a PC ("hackintosh"). Also, keep in mind that new Macs come with Mac OS X.
Also, please keep in mind that according to the License Agreement (or whatever), you can only install Mac OS X on Apple computers. (But it's possible to do so on other computers, just not legal).
Based on what I read on the Apple forums, if your Mac is really old (mid 2009 or older) you can use the supplied installation discs to reinstall the OS.
Alternatively, if you have access to another Mac or can borrow one from a friend, you can create a bootable USB recovery drive using OS X Recovery Disk Assistant and use it to reinstall Mac on your machine.
