If you are trying to maximise capacity on a very low memory system (< 2gb), then run a 32-bit OS. Otherwise, run a 64-bit OS.
I can think of no advantage for using 64 bit operating systems on a system, virtual or real, with less than 4 gig of memory.
If you do not have more than 4Gb of memory, it honestly does not matter what you pick. In practice, you will not notice the difference.
If you are running a VServer host, you should opt for a 64-bit system if the hardware can support it. A 64-bit host virtual server will be able to run both 32-bit and 64-bit virtual nodes. If you are running a VServer node, there is no real advantage to using a 64-bit system. It also depends if the host server actually runs 64-bit or not.
If you're talking about installing a host, you should go 64 bit. It sounds like you're talking about a guest, though, and since you mention that rather small amount of memory, I think you'd be better off going with 32 bit for the guest.
While I would personally probably opt to just slap in the 32 bit guest, it also depends on what you're going to do...if you're really concerned, you should probably install both versions (as a minimal Debian shouldn't eat a lot of install space) and test it with the configuration you're intending to use the VM for and see what you can do with benchmarking. With your memory being low there's no clear way to go one way or the other...so if you're concerned you'd have to actually try testing both. Create three partitions, install the OS 32 and OS 64 in partitions one and two, and use a data partition (okay, four partitions, since you'd have to have swap space most likely set up too).
The biggest advantage to 64 bit is native addressing of large amounts of memory, and you obviously won't hit the 4 gig limit. Plus I've heard of some cases where 64 bit can be potentially slower for certain applications.
Basically, I would recommend running a 32-bit system as a virtual node and only consider 64-bit systems for the host.
