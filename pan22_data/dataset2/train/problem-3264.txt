But if I click it nothing happens, no dialog appears. There is also this button "Type Exchange Password & Connect":
Alternatively you may try creating a new profile for Outlook as well. This can be achieved by typing mail 32 in the search box of the start menu. Click on New and then create a new profile.
I have the same problem outlined in this forum thread - my Outlook shows the "Need Password" in the status bar:
After going through all of the suggestions on many of these forum sites, I was able to remedy the problem.
In my case, this happened due to a company-driven automatic update to Outlook that I originally wasn't aware of. The fix was to simply restart the computer!
You might need to try to run an office repair as this issue is caused when the password across the Office 365 suite is not sync'd. Goto Control Panel, Program and Features, right click on Office, click on change and then Quick repair
If I click it a dialog briefly appears but then disappears. If I restart Outlook (close then open it) this fixes the problem for a time but then it appears again. 
In Windows, go to Settings -> Accounts -> Access work or school, see if your account is listed there, other than the AD account. If so, remove it. Next time you open Outlook it should actually show the login dialog and try to connect.
