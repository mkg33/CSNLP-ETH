I suspect that (a) this is not optimal and (b) this doesn't quite capture the spirit of what you need. But it does answer the question as stated. 
It seems that a lower bound for the problem is $2n$, assuming you're drawing on a grid (otherwise by @JeffE's comment, the problem doesn't make sense). This is implied by the claim that each new rectangle needs at least 2 units of ink (amortized), because it can be associated with (say) its lower right hand corner, which needs to extend nontrivially. 
Here's a scheme that yields this bound upto terms that vanish with $n$. WLOG assume that $H < W$ and $n < WH$. If $n = 2$, then the only solution is to draw a line of length $H$ dividing the rectangle into two parts, and it doesn't matter where you draw it. 
Suppose now that $n < H+1$. Then draw the length $H$ line to create a strip of unit "width", and then repeatedly subdivide that strip to get the desired number of pieces. It's not hard to see that the total ink used is roughly $H + n-2$. As $n$ increases, create more unit width strips and subdivide them. A quick calculation shows that as $n$ increases, you pay roughly $2H$ for each "full" strip and the last strip is negligible, yielding the bound. 
Following my comment above, the only parameter that matters is $n$, the number of rectangles. Since it isn't clear whether strict inequality matters, I'll assume that areas can be equal even if the numbers aren't, but that reverse ordering is prohibited.
