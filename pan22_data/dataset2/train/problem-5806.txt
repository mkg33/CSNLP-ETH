I can ping successfully each other machine, the "master" can access the internet, but when I try to ping google.com from the "slave" I get this error:
Simply calling a machine a DNS server does not make it one.  Try nameserver 8.8.8.8 (google's free public ones).  If that works,
Your need is a little bit more complicated that what it looks; to share your WI-FI connection on wlan0 with one (or more) devices, you may need a physical Ethernet switch, so both Ethernet  (I'm not sure is you can just connect the Ethernet port as peer-to-peer) 
you could try the actual router address (can't promise it will work, but it might), or if you want to get fancy, transfer the resolv.conf from the master after the connection is established (maybe if-up scripts can do that).
If dhcpd turns out to be running on the slave it may complicate this and you probably want to disable that as it serves no purpose.
Install dnsmasq: you will create a dns and dhcp servers, however you can still use fixed ip's on your clients; the goal is to have DNS/DHCP on the Ethernet side and a floating (public IP) on WLAN  
I'm trying to share the internet connection from a RPi2 connected to internet via wifi to a RPi B+ over ethernet.
