Check the cable you are using. It looks like you are trying to connect to the Pi from your PC with an OTG cable. You should use a regular USB-micro cable instead. Just connect the PC to the "USB" port on the Pi and don't connect anything to  the "POWER" port. It will get enough power from the host. 
If I then plug the Pi into my laptop via a Micro USB OTG to USB Adapter (specifically, this one) the Pi appears to boot fine but there's no sign of any new serial port on the laptop - nothing appears in dmesg and no exciting new things in /dev/tty* or lsusb
I have a whole bunch of Pi Zeros and Zero Ws. I've flashed SD cards with the latest Raspbian Jessie Lite, and I've followed the instructions at https://gist.github.com/gbaman/975e2db164b3ca2b51ae11e45e8fd40a with g_serial:
I spent a lot of time myself debugging my config, when I was actually using a USB-micro cable that was only suitable for charging. You need a fully wired one. Test this by hooking up an other gadget (your Smartphone?) and see if the PC and that gadget see each other. I used my e-reader. Using the first cable, it just started charging. Using the second cable, the e-reader asked me wether I just wanted to charge or connect to my PC as a storage device. Needless to say, when I hooked up the second cable to my Pi Zero, it turned out my config was already working!
