Again, it requires someone to take a manual action - but if she is that good, switching on Out of Office every Thursday before she leaves isn't that hard to remember (and you could set a Task with a reminder in Outlook for 4:30pm every Thursday).
Give permission to access the 4 day weekers mailbox to the person you would have forwarded their mail to.
Sure, you still have to make sure that the other member of staff checks the mailbox, which may be an issue if this is sales related.
You can set up the user account to send replies in their own name, on behalf of, or sent as the 4 day weeker.
Or you could just use Out of Office to forward the mail on to the appropriate member of staff.  Your 4 dayer could then just switch on Out of Office every Thursday.  She'll get prompted to switch it off when she logs back in.  Once Out of Office is configured, it will have the same config each time she opens Outlook.
It might also be easier to script switching on Out of Office, with whatever rules have already been configured for the user.
