Im currently developing an little "mmorpg" on my own. I started some months ago and i noticed that its pretty hard to add new content or features to it due to the complexity of the code, structre and the framework. Let me give your an little example...
In my game, players can build stuff. So theres a base class called "BaseEntity". It will be used for all entity related stuff, buildings, resources, duengongs and so on. Theres also a "BuildingEntity" which extends "BaseEntity" and a "TowerEntity" which extends "BuildingsEntity". So all in all this makes it very easy to add new Buildings to my game without writing the same base class ever and every again.
But there problems too. In many places i need to check if the "GameObject" holds an certain Class as a Component. For example, when my player clicks on the tower, i need to check if theres a building script assigned to it. And when i create new "branches" i need to add those to my existing codes every and ever again. This makes it very complicated at some point.
