Getting back at you, following the comment you posted. As I read it, you're looking into Windows 10's native screen resolution settings, not GeForce settings.
Right click the icon again, and select Open NVIDIA control panel (or something similar). You'll get the good ol' NVIDIA control panel, as the image below shows. Here you should find options and ways to more precisely adjust your screen resolution.
Now, download GeForce Experience. I'm not sure if the programme will automatically install drivers for you as well, but nonetheless, you can update your drivers from within the programme. You can find the GeForce Experience icon in the Windows tray at the right corner of the screen. Right click and Check for updates.
After you got everything working, you can go ahead and remove Ccleaner and Driver Sweeper. We don't want any residual waste to be left behind!
Disconnect the monitor from the mains power and disconnect the display cable from the back of the pc/laptop. Wait about 30 seconds. Reconnect the mains power to the monitor. Reconnect the display cable to the pc/laptop. That fixed it for me.
Better safe than sorry: get rid of any registry entries of drivers or manufacturer software, I personally use Ccleaner (the free version is sufficient). [Possibly not necessary as Driver Sweeper already seems to take care of this.]
