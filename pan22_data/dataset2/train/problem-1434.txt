Using a service such as MailChimp also provides you with a ton of analytics to see the open rate, bounce rate, etc.
I have setup my own linux mail server that sends direct to the internet. This seems to work fairly well. All my mail clients (windows) then has the linux mail server's internal ip address as their smtp server.
A good, hopefully easy but not necesarily the cheap solution would be to get a good ISP (as others have hinted at too). A business contract with a good ISP does not limit the kind of traffic you generate in any way. 
If your current SMTP mail server(s) does not support your email list size or sending frequency, there are some options.

Another solution, also good and will probably be quite cheap also, is to get a VPS (Virtual Private Server) where you most definitely will not have any limitation on the kind of traffic. This also saves you from having to manage a stable server environment (redundant power, cooling and internet access) at your company office.
