Save your money and buy the edition that's right for you, after analyzing your needs.  Even if you need one or two of the features listed above, there may be a more appropriate version than Ultimate.  The following page at Microsoft will help you choose editions: Which one is right for you?
If you're not going to use some of the features of Ultimate -- such as Aero, Media Center, BitLocker, XP Mode, joining a domain -- it's probably a waste of money.  You might not even have hardware sufficient to run Aero or XP Mode, and you'd need a tuner for Media Center to be very useful.
Ultimate would be a complete waste of Money for a Netbook.  Im running it Now on my Dell Mini 10 only because its apart of the Release Candidate.  My Netbook has the GMA500 Pretty Lowend. and Areo runs fine on it.  But I Disabled it and it gave it a nice boost in performance.
There is no difference in performance between the versions (unless you count the Aero theme, but you can disable that). Ultimate just has more features, so it wouldn't make sense not to get it if cost isn't an issue for you.
On the other hand, BitLocker in particular is useful for portables, from a security perspective.  It can basically encrypt your hard drive contents.  But, on the other other hand, you could do that anyway with a free tool like TrueCrypt.  :-)
