It seems Windows 7 is smart enough to maintain power to the USB hubs as long as there is a device connected that is allowed to wake from sleep.  I should also mention that this is despite having "USB selective suspend setting" DISABLED.  All very confusing but doing all of the above has made my USB ports power down in sleep/standby mode."
Maybe your laptop has something similar, the thing that allows my PC to do that has an option in the "Programs and Features" page that allows it to be uninstalled.
When I put the laptop to sleep, these devices are still powered on - the fan in the cooling pad is still spinning, the drives are still spinning.

I tried setting the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power option in the USB Root Hubs' Properties in Device Manager and enabling USB selective suspend in power options - it didn't work.
Most laptops tend to not use powered-ports (USB ports that have a charge even when the system is off or in standby). However, those that do have powered-ports will usually only have some of them be independently powered and the others will be regular ports that shut down with the rest of the system.
I have the same problem, and I am thinking on buying these 2 things to solve the problem, I guess we will need to check very careful power consumption...........

"Within Windows, I found I had to do two things; for each USB hub, I ticked "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power", AND I had to go through every keyboard & mouse device an un-tick "Allow this device to wake the computer".
As it's a laptop, BIOS options are extremely locked down, so I can't even see anything relevant to sleep in there.
My PC has an extra driver, or something, installed that allows charging of USB devices while the PC is turned off, which required me to unplug my USB powered headset every time I turned off the PC or leave the headsets control unit glowing at night wasting power.
You didn’t mention your laptop’s model, so assuming that it has more than the three ports you mentioned, then you can check your laptop’s manual for information on which are powered and which are not (though since manuals are often useless and generic these days, try simply plugging them into different ports to see how each one works).
