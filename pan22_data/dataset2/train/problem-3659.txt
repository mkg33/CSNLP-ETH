The Internet is chock full of tutorials on just about any subject. Not surprisingly, articles and setting up servers are very abundant. Take a break, do some Googling and have a good read of some of those tutorials. You might also consider investing in some of the many good books available. Any time spent learning the basics will be amply rewarded.
I have been given a static IP, default gateway, set the FQDN (not related to the operation of the network), and set these values in IPV4 on the one physical NIC. DNS server I have left blank as that will be the local server. I have set the IP of the local server in the DNS tab (http://www.walkernews.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/vista-dns-setting.jpg that tab).
At the very least, your DNS server will need information on the root zones before it can resolve DNS queries itself.  A DNS server you can forward requests is fine, but if you had that you could just point your network DNS settings there in the first place.
In general, start with the closest network devices (such as the router) and gradually move further away.
You need an entry for the DNS server in your IP configuration.  You can point it to your own server, but your DNS server will need a forwarder to an Internet aware DNS server in order to resolve Internet names.
Start Task Manager -> Networking Tab.  Is the state "connected"? If not, you have a physical cabling problem.  If yes, start by pinging your gateway address.  If that works try pinging one of your dns name servers.  To test dns, try: ping -a serverfault.com
Based on this and other questions you've asked I see that you are very much an entry level person an perhaps should take a couple of steps back and learn some fundamentals before proceeding any further.
I have enabled AD/DNS but one of the issues I have is getting connected to the network so I can surf the internet etc.
Despite this, the internet does not work and always has the exclamation mark on the network icon to the system tray.
