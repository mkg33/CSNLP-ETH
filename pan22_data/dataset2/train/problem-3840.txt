once installed on your machine with packages, you can use it to recreate a .deb file from packages you have installed.
to download only the package on the forst machine (on Debian apt store by default all packages here : /var/cache/apt/archives/ probably Ubuntu too).
you'll need to install it on one of your machines, but it is a very tiny package that you can easily copy over on a usb drive...
For those packages you do find, copy them to the memory stick, and then install them on the second machine with dpkg... my fore-posters have already covered that bit.
On the machine where the SW is installed (call it the "first" machine), check /var/cache/apt/archives for the packages (ending in .deb) you want to copy.  It's sounds as if it's not certain they're still cached, so it may be you don't find anything in there, or not the packages you want to install on the second machine.
find your dependencies at http://packages.ubuntu.com/ ; eg for mc and latest ubuntu it would be: http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/mc
Ubuntu also includes several utilities that can assist in maintaining package installations and updates for offline machines.  Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Offline for a starting point.  Several resources are available for both command line and GUI utilities.
