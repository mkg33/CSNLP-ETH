I work a lot with barcodes (UPC's) and excel will format them as scientific notation by default.  Drives me nuts!  Why this isn't an option I'll never know. 
This can be applied after you paste the data into the column, but you must do it before you save the spreadsheet.
A single apostrophe ' before a number will force Excel to treat a number as text (including a default left align).  And if you have errors flagged, it will show as a number stored as text error on the cell.
This worked for me in Excel 2013, including copy-pasting the cells out to other programs. Filtering the data helped, especially for the edit steps.
In Excel 2013, the same thing happened to me and I just went to Format Cells -> Number then made sure the decimal place is set to "0".
Excel is frustrating for CSV/bulk data work like this. Work with LibreOffice if possible, it doesn't do this, that is, if you open the same sheet (.xlsx) in Libreoffice, the large 'numbers' which are actually strings are not displayed in scientific notation (which is an absurd decision by Excel). LibreOffice's file fidelity is great: open the same .xlsx in Excel again, and the scientific notation instantly "works" just like usual.
