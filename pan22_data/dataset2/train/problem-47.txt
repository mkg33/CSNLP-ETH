I like where you're going with managing mail contacts (Exchange term) for external, personal email addresses.  
There's a free tier if you qualify, which might just meet your needs entirely.  Otherwise the paid options should be significantly discounted.  At only a handful of users, the subscription model should be easy to swallow.  
Make sure to note where Desktop Office comes into play.  You might lean toward the low-cost, but paid options to get that feature.
Given the problems above, I think the place to start is a directory server (hosted if possible), but I've never set-up ActiveDirectory or LDAP (I'm more of a programmer than a sysadmin), so I'm not entirely sure if that's right and how I should actually organize the directory. Most of the articles I've read about either are aimed squarely at the enterprise.
Since that this is a volunteer effort with no permanent IT staff and little budget, I'm trying to find the right balance of hosted, simple, and cheap.
The link above lists a few options and how those services stack up.  There are plenty of O365 pros here, so you could probably find some good targeted answers to questions here on Server Fault.
I've been asked to help manage my church's information systems. We're small (~3 staff, ~150 parishioners), which puts us below the needs of a lot of the "Church Management" software I've seen.
