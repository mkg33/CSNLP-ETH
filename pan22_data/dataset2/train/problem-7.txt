The other thing is that not all plugs are manufactured exactly alike.  Some are slightly shorter, have a smaller bulb at the tip or the bulb is shaped a little differently, or the molded handle may prevent the plug from going all the way in.  For that matter, the jack may be out of tolerance.  Any of these things can prevent the tip contact from snapping into place and making a good connection.  Through trial and error, you may find either a headphone extension cord, adapter, or replacement plug that fits the jack better.  
The contacts inside the jack can get bent or fatigue and lose their springiness.  It is not easy to do much about either of those if that's the problem except replace the jack, and that is not a trivial job.  
If you find such a replacement plug, use it to make an adapter or extension, and plug the headphones into that.  Don't try to replace the plug on the headphones.  The cord often has a type of wire that is very hard to work with to make new connections.  
What you're describing is a mechanical problem.  The tip of the plug is the left channel.  The very end is bulb-shaped and the contact snaps behind that.  It's likely one of two things.
