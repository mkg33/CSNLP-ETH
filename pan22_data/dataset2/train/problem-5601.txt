You are looking for BGP Dynamic Peering which, in the Cisco world, allows an entire subnet range to be specified as a peer and a given interface to be set to simply listen for new connections.  It's actually an older feature and the wisdom in its use both was- and is- arguably limited.
The right answer for maintaining lots of BGP peering info is the use of a tool like Ansible or Puppet (or most any similar scripting tool that can front-end a policy repository) but if you insist on a mechanism to dynamically form peers then the above works, as does the use of dynamically generated v6 link local addresses to establish NLRI (...see RFC 5549).
On a related topic, BGP I read that BGP exchanges RIB information and updates once the peer group is established. Can someone point out what exactly are the contents of that RIB and how is policy implemented through them.?
I was trying to configure BGP peers on sample topologies, Now considering that BGP is the protocol that routes the internet it must not be possible to establish thousands of EBGP peers by such manual configuration using CLI commands. So I was wondering is there a way to automate this process and how to do it?
Consider that there were (and are) good reasons for BGP relationships to be explicitly defined: security, management of scalability, consistency of policy application, stability of infrastructure, etc.  There seems to be a push periodically to make BGP act like an IGP.  I would suggest this is slightly better than trying to make OSPF handle inter-domain routing but still the wrong tool for the job.
