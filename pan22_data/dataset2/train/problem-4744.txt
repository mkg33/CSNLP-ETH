However, while the entry was deleted properly, this didn't help, and all traffic is still sent through the VPN. What am I missing?
The VPN is NordVPN, and the connection instructions I followed are here: https://nordvpn.com/tutorials/dd-wrt/openvpn-gui/ with one difference--I kept my DNS at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 rather than Nord's DNS. 
I'm trying to set up my DD-WRT router so that it directs traffic either through my VPN, or directly through my ISP, depending on the subnet of the requesting machine. In my case specifically, the subnet (either 192.168.0.0 or 2.0) is assigned based on the SSID a device is connected to, and that part seems to work fine. However, all traffic seems to go through the VPN, not just traffic from the 192.168.2.0 subnet, as I'd intended. The instructions I've been following are from here: https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/OpenVPN_on_Dedicated_Wireless_Access_Point_(VAP) The article notes the author was unsuccessful in getting this to work past a certain build, but their error message was related to TLS auth, which I don't think is relevant here.
These are the commands I run at startup (45 seconds seems to be more than enough time for the VPN to connect successfully):
As far as I can tell, this table should work. One thing I did try was adding this to my startup script right before the flush, as I thought the entry might have been forcing everything to go through tun1:
