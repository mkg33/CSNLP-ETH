I created a new security Group on "Domain A" for : "newadmingroup01" with one member "newadminuser01". "newadmingroup01" is a member of Domains Administrators group.
Several Remote Desktop Session Collections are configured and visible in Server Manager when I log on to both Remote Desktop Connection Brokers (RDCBA01, RDCBA02) under a domain account user "legacyadmin01". 
When I log on to both Connections Brokers (RDCBA01, RDCBA02) using the new account "newadminuser01" and navigate to Remote Desktop services role in Server Manager, now I can't see session Collections or other members of the RDS deployment.
We have an high availability setup for Remote Desktop Services  (Windows 2012R2 datacenter edition) all servers are member of "Domain A":
The server manager view of Remote Desktop Services role (on (RDCBA01 and RDCBA02) seems to be tied to current user, but I can't figure out in what way (GPO, group membership...).
How to ensure that "newadminuser01" (or other tailored admin accounts) is able to see & manage Remote Desktop Services server members and Collections in Server Manager ?
