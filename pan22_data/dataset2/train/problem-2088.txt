That ticking sound could be faulty HDD or in a lot of cases it’s simply a wire slightly touching spinning fans. Also are you meaning by “100% usage” the HDD is full?
So this just recently started happening again. It's happened before but I somehow fixed it, not entirely sure how I once did. The problem also occurs in smart mode. In addition to that, there's a strange clicking sound coming from inside the computer, almost like a turning signal. I've checked the task manager and nothing seems to be making it do this. Sometimes it'll stop making the noise and the computer will act completely normal for a minute or two. Is something in my computer broken? What could be the problem guys?
As a general rule, if your computer is making strange mechanical sounding noises, something is seriously wrong. Not always, but often.
In any case having such high I/O rates when not doing anything strenuous is a very bad sign. Backup your data immediately and buy a new hard drive.
Clicks are baaad! If the click sounds like this, or this,  your hard drive is dead or dying. There is a reason why it is known by the ominous name of Click of Death.
