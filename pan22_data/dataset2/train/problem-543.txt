The only way to share a PPPoE connection between multiple computers is to use a router (caveat - if you have multiple network cards in one computer that computer could be used as a router - see Microsoft's Internet Connection Sharing)
In order for more than one Point to transfer data to another Point (Point-to-Multipoint) there has to be some device to combine all the points at one end of the link into one (a router).
The router takes over the connection of the PPPoE and presents a standard TCP/IP connection to the network using NAT (Network Address Translation) to combine the data from all the computers on your network into one PPPoE stream.
If you look up the meaning if PPPoE you see it's Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet.  The clue is in the "Point-to-Point" part.  It's a protocol which transmits data from one point to another point.  Only one device can talk down a PPPoE connection at a time.
All a switch does is act like a roundabout in a road system - directing traffic between the different points on a network.
