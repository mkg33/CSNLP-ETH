Also you may want to try wireshark (from a OS-ed machine). Again, better to use a Hub in order to catch any communications from the BIOS machines, including broadcasts.
From a Unix machine, listening to the no-OS computers on the same LAN, and if possible via a Hub (not a Switch), you can try 
If you're using managed switches this information is likely available from the switch. Some end-user integrated routers/switches (such as the kind that often package ADSL modems as well) will sometimes have a DHCP client list which includes MAC addresses.
If any of the computers are running an OS and have an IP addresses, you can connect into the same LAN, you could use NMAP (or a GUI version like Zenmap) from http://nmap.org/... if you run this on the same LAN, you should get MAC address info for any machines that respond.
It would be useful to understand more about why you need to get the MAC addresses, in case there is a better way of achieving the same result.
The basic problem here is that this is Layer 2 information, so only switches see it. Some switches will provide an interface that lets you peek at this info, but if they don't the only way to get it is to intercept in the physical layer, by eg installing a hub between the switch.
If you're using unmanaged switches, and you really want to know this info, I recommend you buy a hub, and temporarily replace the switch with it. You can then connect a computer running wireshark to the hub and capture ARP packets to record MAC addresses. Alternately you could use Echolot to do this for you - it selectively tracks ARP packets and builds a MAC address database.
