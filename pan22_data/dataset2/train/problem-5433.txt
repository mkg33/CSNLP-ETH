You should make the loopbacks be /32s.  Then, you have the question, how can the loopbacks see each other?  Generally, the right way to do this is to use a separate routing protocol to inform the routers of each other's loopbacks.  
Connected interface have 0 administrative distance. Static route have 1 administrative distance. 198.18.1.1/30 network have 2 address(198.18.1.1,198.18.1.2). You need create route to 198.18.1.2/32.
There is no reason to have your loopback addresses with /30 masks.   We can get around this issue as mentioned above with more specific static routes, but its bad practice to make a loopback with a /30 netmask.
I don't think you can. Those loopbacks are on the same IP subnet, therefore each thinks its local and won't route out another interface. You need to make them different networks first.
In order to get my iBGP session working I want to configure a static route from the loopback interface on router A (198.18.1.1/30) to the loopback interface on router B (198.18.1.2/30) and vice versa. How do I do this?
