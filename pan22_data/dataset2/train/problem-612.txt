At current disk prices, it's often cheaper to add IOPS by getting more 7.2K SATA spindles than buying 15K disks. Even when you add in extra chassis and power costs. Plus you get all that capacity for free (use it for snapshots or whatever). If you need more, go SSD.
You still need discs to write your commit log - in this case it's the performance of small random writes which matters. Getting a battery backed RAID controller is essential as it makes small writes vastly faster (the controller does them in the background; if the power fails then it keeps the data in its cache until power is restored)
Such a small dataset should work fine out of memory. But if you want to invest in a performance disk, get a solid state disk. That can outperform any SAS disk out there.
it's not about the size, but the speed you require. SAS are lot faster. However, because the dataset is ~0.5GB and you have 4GB and the grow rate is so slow, you might as well just load everything into memory (mysql cache) and not worry about the hard disk speed.
A SATA disk can do about 60-70 random write IOPS, 15K disks can do 150+. Your RAID level affects this, too. RAID 1 will perform the same as 1 disk. RAID 10 will perform the same as num_disks/2 for writes. RAID-5 will perform the same as num_disks/4 unless there is a hardware controller with battery-backed cache.
If multiple SATA spindles can't handle your workload, I would look at some of the server-class SSDs, such as the Intel X-25E (2nd generation). They will blow away any 15K disk by a factor of 10 or more, even for random writes.
The file system cache will keep your whole working set in memory at that size for reads. I would measure your read and write IOPS, and assume they are all random. Use iostat on Linux ("w/s" field), or perfmon on Windows (Physical Disk writes/sec)
Looking at your working set, type of disks is the least of your concern unless you plan to read/wrote thousands of time per second. Put more ran and use that memcached.
