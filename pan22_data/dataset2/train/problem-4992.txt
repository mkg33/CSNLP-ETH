Now, the relog process will presumably hammer the crap out of your DB when it runs if you configure as above : once a day. Maybe you configure perfmon to restart once every 10 minutes, and then have your copy-and-relog processes configured similarly.
I am looking at running perfmon on our servers and storing the data to a data source, which is relatively easy to do.  However, my concern is with how frequently Perfmon will perform data updates.
At any rate, you should test out different scenarios on a test SQL server, if you're concerned about impact to production and want to get this right the first time. Either way, you can only spread out or concentrating the load, not reduce it. All those writes will hit the SQL server, from my reading of it, it doesn't seem like it will do a BULK INSERT, from the documented command line options.
Does it do this for every update?  Meaning, if I have the interval set to 1second, does it perform an insert every second?  Or does it wait and batch them together?  Is there any way to control this?
