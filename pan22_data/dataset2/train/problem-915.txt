All of these things require a knowledge of data structures. It goes way beyond what you see on the screen. I would suggest reading about arrays, lists, hashes (sometimes called dictionaries or maps) and then coming back to your problem.
Or think about shooter games where your enemy wanders around. Each of them has variables which tracks their location, life, etc. so that when you wound one, it will remember that it was hurt.
Mario Brothers (or similar) saves the state of the level you are in. that might include how far you have gone before you died, if a block was hit or not. In some a more object oriented sense, the game just says "be a block here" and the block exists. then when you hit the block, the block changes its own internal state to say "I was hit". Data like that can be stored in a variety of ways.
Your word processor saves its data in a data structure. Now there are lots of these and many ways they can be implemented, but probably it uses some form of a tree. In a tree you have at least one node. Anything added before it goes to the left. Anything added after it, goes to the right. After you add three nodes you have two of them hanging off the middle node. And the tree can grow even larger with new pieces being added anywhere and the tree will rebuild itself.
Well, if you are asking this kind of question you are going to have a long road to get to the point where you can make a game. But, getting to the heart of your question, the program can save the state of many different things in variables which are in the back end of your program. Let's look at a couple of examples.
