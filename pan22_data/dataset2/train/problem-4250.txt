Because it shows each router in the path, and the time it takes each one of those routers to return a response it is very useful to spotting trouble spots further downstream.
If you can ping past your router, it's probably their fault. If you can't, then it's yours. Use tracert to figure out where the packets are falling.
There is a wonderful, simple to use tool on linux called MTR (short for My Trace Route) which will show you packet loss at every step of the route, and can even help you hunt down flapping routes.
We had an issue with our ISP and the tool Ping Plotter came in very helpful.  You can set it to ping a router at the ISP's internet gateway, or in our example we told it to ping from a regional office back to the corporate office.  In this example, it was going through a couple different ISPs.  Best of all you can set it up on an old desktop or a virtual machine, and let is sit there pinging away collecting data until you need it.
Try pinging any Outbound website. If you can do so, everything is fine within you network. Contact your ISP.
The best tool is the scientific method. Form a hypothesis about the cause of the problem. Write it down. Formulate an experiment that will test the hypothesis. Write it down. Conduct the experiment. Write the result down. If the experiment confirms the hypothesis, then you're done. If it fails to confirm the hypothesis then you need a new hypothesis. If it's inconclusive then you need a new experiment.
