The idea is also to have only a "root" and a system users on the server, without adding user "john" to all servers where John can log in.
Additionally, you can look at netgroups or Kerberos so as to determine whether John is allowed to connect to that specific box. 
Lastly, since you mentioned SSH specifically, you may also be interested in looking at the LPK patches for LDAP which allow you to store John's authentication certificates for SSH within LDAP. 
Essentially, you're referring to Linux PAM authentication via PAM-LDAP bindings with an Active Directory server. In this case, you'd configure the linux box to authentication with AD via PAM ( the centralized "authentication controller" libs ). 
Any help or the idea how to make the above or something similar to the above? Preferred using AD but any other similar solution is also possible.
we have something on the server A (running Linux, the server has an access to the AD via i.e. LDAP) in the SSH server LDAP (or other module) authentication config like root=Project1_Developers,Company_NIX_Admins.
when john connects to the server A using his username "john" and domain password, the server checks the john's group in the domain and if the group is "Project1_Developers" or "Company_NIX_Admins", makes him locally as a root with a root privileges.
