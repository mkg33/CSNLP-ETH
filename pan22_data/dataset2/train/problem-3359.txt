What is the purpose of SETTINGS? Do I still need it? And most importantly, can I tell it to not mount to /media?
Initially I tried leaving its mount point in place and just setting noauto, but it mounted anyway. I think that's because Jessie's file manager's automatic mounting of removable media happens separately from (and well after) the initial mounting directed by fstab.
I have a Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian. It's my first one, so please forgive a lot of ignorance. I used NOOBS to install the system, which seems to have left its micro SD card littered with various partitions.
Milliways's answer is excellent, but I wanted to maintain auto-mounting of external media and just disable it for the SETTINGS partition. I ended up adding a line to /etc/fstab to stop it from auto-mounting SETTINGS on boot:
I'm seeing a mounted directory at /media/<username>/SETTINGS that corresponds to a little 32M partition at /dev/mmcblk0p5. Its contents are:
I can unmount it, apparently without ill effect. But on reboot it comes right back. I'm sharing the external drives with AFP, so for purely aesthetic reasons I would like to not have the SETTINGS directory in /media.
