Install Wireshark and watch all packets related to name resolution. Set the display filter to dns or nbns or udp.port=5355.
Repeat that server and machine2 commands for each IP address in your list.  One of them should fail with:
The timeout will be in the DNS resolution.  It may be because you have more than one DNS server specified and one of them is not responding.
(EDIT: In windows the file you're looking for is at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts by default.)
If your setup doesn't have reverse DNS configured for the 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa (or at least an entry for 192.168.1.1 in your hosts file, it's going to time out trying to reach a DNS server to complete the lookup, and it can't start printing the response packets until the lookup gets resolved (either by a correct DNS response in which case it prints the returned name, or by a timeout in which case it just prints the IP address).
Then it's just a case of finding out a) why that DNS server is not working, and b) if you should even be using it at all.
It could be that your DNS server is not responding to the queries, or that the other machines have NBNS and/or LLMNR disabled or firewalled. (I don't know the exact order, but DNS always seems to be tried first.)
The cause turned out to be that once return packets start coming, certain versions of ping by default attempt to do a reverse DNS lookup of the IP address the response is coming from:
