We have a number of users working for and located at an external company. They access the local network via a VPN and have local AD accounts with corresponding exchange accounts.
I want them to be able to use their local email addresses and access shared folders on the exchange server however, they log into their primary domain first and access their own exchange server via outlook. I understand this means they cannot access a second exchange server.
Extra Outlook is a freeware program that says it is designed to run multiple copies of Outlook at the same time.  I cannot vouch for its claims, but...
Just had a brainwave. Being developers they are able to use remote desktop to access a number of development servers. If we installed outlook on a development server, they could all use outlook on this.
You've pretty much got it there, unfortunately. There's no really good solution for what you're trying to do. You might try experimenting with running Outlook as different user with "RunAs" simultaneously with the user's normal session and see how it acts. You're definitely into "unsupported" territory with that, but it just might work.
1. Outlook web access. Unfortunately this is locked down to a subset of privileged users with secure token ids.
2. Use a different client via IMAP. This is currently not available so I would have to fight with the exchange admins to get this enabled.
