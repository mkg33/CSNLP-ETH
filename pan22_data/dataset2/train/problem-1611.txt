To disable the annoying animations in Excel, there is an option in File / Options / Ease of Access called Provide feedback with animation that can be deselected.
This should disable all annoying animations Office-wide. I've found this is the only way to stop the annoying folder opening / closing animations in Outlook. 
I found this to work for various versions, up to the latest version of Word. But please note that this will affect ALL Office applications, not only Word!
Close Registry Editor and open any Office application. Changes are instant: no more animations and effects.
If you want to restore default animations, change value of DisableAnimations to 0 or simply delete the DWORD.
If you don't feel to edit the registry yourself, you can download the necessary automatic script from that link. Otherwise, take the following steps: 
Check if there is a key "Graphics" existing. If not, right-click on Common key and select New -> Key option. It'll create a new key, set its name as Graphics
To disable animations in Office 365, use regedit and navigate to this key: [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Graphics].
