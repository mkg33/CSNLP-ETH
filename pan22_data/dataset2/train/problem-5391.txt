Some viruses also create exe files in places where there shouldn't be any. This can range from the obscure (e.g. in your windows or system32 folders) to the obvious (extra exe files in every folder in some of your partitions).
That said, random hard-drive use may actually be the OS or an indexer doing stuff specifically when your computer is not busy.
Another one is if you notice you can't view hidden files anymore. The autorun viruses often turn off viewing hidden files, and if you enable viewing them again, they change it back. 
I have never seen anything go wrong with sound panels that would tell me a virus was to blame - although if you say the actual symptoms, it may help.
Random network traffic used to be a good sign, but these days rootkits will stay fairly dormant until some point much later. When they do start sending spam on behalf of their new masters you might not even notice the extra traffic, and ISPs seem to have given up calling their clients.
Strange behavior is as often the result of badly written drivers and worse freeware more so than it is badly written viruses.
Settings that change themselves back shortly after you change them, or when you reboot could have been a sign, but now some programs are just that badly written. Though OS settings should never behave this way.
Well, most of them will use CPU/HDD/Internet connection, so any suspicious increase in usage of those is sure a good sign. And I think that thats about it, most viruses will try to hide themselves as much as possible, so there shouldn't be any blinking popups windows or any other obviously strange behaviour...
