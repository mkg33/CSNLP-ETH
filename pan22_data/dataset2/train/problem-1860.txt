Just like with webservers, the answer is "depends".  You will need to monitor the amount of queries hitting your DNS servers to determine if you need to move to suggestion 2.  
Loading a website at your domain will likely result in a single query to your nameserver from the person loading the site (technically that person's DNS server) and their resolver will cache the result for the subsequent lookups as the page loads. Unless the DNS for the domain is broken or the server is severely bogged down for some reason, the DNS lookup will have very little impact on the web page loading time.
for instance you can have both of these pointing to same ip and use either or as the primary nameserver 
for instance if these were your primary and secondary, they would have to be on differnet ips at the very least and usually not on same subnet
On, the other hand, for most domains, two nameservers will be plenty.  The bigger bottleneck will be the web traffic, not the DNS responses.  
In most circumstances even the smallest nameserver can serve many domains without breaking a sweat. This is for several reasons, including the fact that DNS queries are tiny and results are cached on every resolver that query your nameserver (so it's not getting repeatedly queried from the same locations, ISPs, ...etc). I'd recommend putting the additional domains on the same existing nameserver(s), at least for now.
