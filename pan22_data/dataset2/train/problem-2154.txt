Perhaps you can increase range and reliability without spending money on a router that your devices can't take full advantage of.
I have not seen any other wireless G being able to reach 4 floors and it was a good, expensive bit of kit they had, so I can only guess that some N equipment has a higher power output on the antennae than G.
Also you may want to take a look at either wireless bridges - getting a cheap ~Â£20 box, put it at the edge of where signal starts to degrade and allow it to extend the signal, or just buying more powerful Antennae. 
I had a client with a very large house and a G router, it reached the third floor but they had a converted attic for the kids that it could not reach. I changed it for a Netgear N router and as I said, technically I know it shouldn't, but the router was in the same place, the clients only had G cards in the laptops but it did reach.
One thing you might try playing with is antenna configuration. Type and direction of antennas will make a difference. Unfortunately, your house does things to the signal, so finding the right antenna configuration for you will be hit or miss. 
I'd try sticking a laptop in the 'bad' spot, then running back and forth playing with the antenna on the router and see if you can get better signal. If you have an SO to help, you'll save a lot of running.
