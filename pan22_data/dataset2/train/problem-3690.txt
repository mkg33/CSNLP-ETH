Before subnetting there was only Class-based addressing and the smallest networks were /24. So during the transition to subnetting, when the subnet masks were introduced to existing networks, most of them got 255.255.255.0 as being backward compatible. So that was the common thing and is also just a very easy mask to work with, being a round number (in binary) and preserving the Class C semantics of the last octet being the host number and the rest the network number. Using it avoids having to do decimal-to-binary conversion to determine if two addresses are on the same subnet or not.
Another reason I think it persisted besides familiarity and inertia is because there is a lot of broadcast traffic in IPv4 and by definition broadcast traffic goes to every device on the subnet. So in practice, by the time you are done routing and are allocating address to end nodes, you want to keep the number of devices generating broadcasts down to a reasonable number. The Class C subnet 255.255.255.0 is big enough that most organizations won't need more addresses than that and small enough to keep from being overwhelmed by broadcasts.
You do see smaller subnets, like 255.255.255.252, used when handing out publicly routable IPv4 addresses because those addresses are so precious. I did, however, once have an ISP give us 3 addresses with a /30 subnet only to have one of the addresses be on a different subnet than the other 2. That was annoying and probably a mistake on their part, but it was hard to spot because of the math.
