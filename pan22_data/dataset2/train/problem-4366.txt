If you just want to replicate a single system image across multiple boxes, I would look at the latter; you just configure one box "just the way you like it" and then either boot all boxes from the same image via the network or copy the same image easily to all boxes. Roughly, imaging is easier; netbooting tends to be more convenient.
I guess Puppet is much more complex, but depending on what you are doing, it might be absolutely worthwhile.
You can also distribute the required files to make fusesmb/smbnetfs to work across a network easily.
If you choose /etc/fstab, you just need to distribute the line required to mount your network share to all your hosts. If these are not too much, you could do it by hand, but as the number of hosts grows, or the maintenance required increases, you should automate it.
You could make it work using your current method, but it's probably more work. I know by certain that these two methods are more easily "scriptable".
There might be a way to make that work using your system, but I recommend changing the method of mounting the volume to something more "scriptable":
You should say how are you mounting the volume. I guess you are using some kind of GUI tool, such as Gnome's.
