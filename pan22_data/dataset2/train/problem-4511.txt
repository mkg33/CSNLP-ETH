I don't think you can actually do this exactly as you want per se, but I can think of a way for you to achieve the same functionality using a third-party program called AutoHotkey. It's basically a program for remapping keys and key sequences, but it also supports some rudimentary programming.
Assuming your multimedia keys actually generate keys and don't activate some other functionality (e.g. running a command or something), you could make a script that flips your function keys and your multimedia keys only when a Boolean variable is set. Then assign a key or shortcut to flip the value of this variable.
This would basically work for replacing any two keys conditionally (you can add more replacements inside the same #If statement the same way I did). When you hold down the Fn key and press one of your function keys, the keyboard actually sends a different key code to the system, so it's like you physically pressed a different key. That's why I don't think you can do this outside the BIOS settings, but it's also why this idea should work.
I have an Alienware R2 anw17-7493slv and I can't figure out how to change FN keys to multimedia keys at runtime. I know there is a option in BIOS to do this, but I want to do this at runtime.
Here is an example for a script that flips the functionality of F2 and the media Play / Pause keys only when the variable is set, with Scroll Lock toggling the variable:
There's a neat added feature here that if Scroll Lock is off when you start the script (for example if you run it when Windows starts) then the keys are flipped only when Scroll Lock is on. =)
