Another benefit of the POE Splitter is that it leaves all your GPIO pins free as it moves the POE capabilities off of the Pi and puts it in front of the Pi.
If you use an injector, you lose the ability to power-on a cold Pi.  But if the Pi is connected either directly to a POE switch, or indirectly through a POE Splitter (described below), if you disable and re-enable the port on the switch, the Pi can be booted from a cold state. A few more elegant (and cheaper) POE options are:
For £10 you can get this POE Splitter from Amazon.co.uk and it requires NO hat!  Plug it on the far end of an Ethernet cable which is connected to a POE switch and your Pi boots.  The monitor shown is a Pi touchscreen which makes the Splitter look large, but it has a small form factor.
Or, you can can spend £20 (inc VAT) and get a real POE hat- plug it into an Ethernet cable connected to your POE switch and the Pi powers on. I use this model and it works like a charm: I just plug it into my POE switch and the Pi lights up.
