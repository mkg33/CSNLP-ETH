This works for me. Type Date & Time Settings in the search box and click on it, then turn on set time automatically and also turn on set time zone automatically. This will automatically select your time zone and adjust the time.
This immediately fixed the problem for me. Note that I'd already right-clicked the clock, selected 'Adjust date/time' and on that screen 'Adjust for daylight saving time automatically' was already on. It was only when I also turned it on for the 2nd time in Control Panel that my clock stopped being an hour behind after a reboot.
Then I discovered via this answer that Windows and Linux make different assumptions about the hardware clock. By default Windows assumes it's set to local time whereas Linux assumes it's set to UTC. So, depending on your preference, you can either tell Windows to assume the hardware clock is using UTC, as in @juniorRubyist's answer; or tell Linux to assume the hardware clock is set to local time, as at https://superuser.com/a/1336320/576397 or https://superuser.com/a/198196/576397.
I have a dual boot Win 10 and ubuntu box. Originally I used Task Scheduler in Windows to force the action w32tm /resync /nowait to be run when any user logged on. This worked but it's pretty clunky.
