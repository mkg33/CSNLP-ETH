Sounds reasonable to me.  The firewall should work by blocking packets somehow, and having another hop outside the firewall should do nothing.  I wouldn't think that adding another very short hop via Ethernet would affect ping time or bandwidth.
The only thing you didn't mention explicitly was whether or not you disabled the DHCP on the modem/router.  I would think you want your DD-WRT to handle the managment of IP addresses.  Either way, you'll need to turn off one of the two so you don't get conflicts.
You could have as many routers as you want internally. As long as the default route of each segment leads to the next router and ultimately the internet, you're fine. And if someone breaks in the fist router, he won't be able to get further until he hits the next router. This doe snot mean that it is a recommended setup for a more secure network,as it needs more monitoring, perhaps. However, this lets you setup multiple wireless networks, for example. If you want to increase the security, I would suggest:
This is a perfectly fine configuration. I have my home network configured with an inner and outer router (not counting the cable modem). This is a recommended configuration for some purposes. There is some good discussion here, at GRC.com
The amount of lag is too small to notice.  I have 3 routers chained together in my house and don't have any problems.  Your DD-WRT firewall will still function and protect you.
The potential downsides as I see them are that you are removing their firewall and their wireless, and substituting your own.  It is conceivable that their firewall is better and/or their wireless more secure.  Unless you're substituting WEP for their WPA or something, I doubt there will be a problem.
