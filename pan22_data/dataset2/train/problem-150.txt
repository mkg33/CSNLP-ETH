If I shut down the DHCPD daemon on one server the peer doesn't seem to take over even if it detects that other peer is down
I can't remember having seen the message not responding (recovering) back then, but I also had peer holds all free leases on both DHCP servers.
The error message peer holds all free leases can also mean that the request has been received on the wrong network interface, e.g. if a computer is only configured to get an IP on eth0, but the DHCP request is received on eth1. deny dynamic bootp clients is typical for such a setup. In my case one interface was for the workstation network and the other one for printers only and someone plugged a workstation into the printer network.
IP helper (aka UDP helper) and DHCP relay is enabled on router that connects the network of the primary server with the network of the secondary server
See my blog posting about when I ran into that error message and found no obvious reason on Debian, too.
Try with a smaller pool to verify your failover is working correctly, then readjust. Your range is very large and likely the cause of why it seems to hang on update.
I've ran into this issue before.  For me it was the firewall blocking port 647/tcp on both servers.  I ran the following on each server and it resolved the issue.
The message not responding (recovering) indicates that the server is not responding because it is recovering from a failover (or initial start). And is probably still populating the lease databases with all of the free leases from your pool, which could take a while if you have a large pool.
