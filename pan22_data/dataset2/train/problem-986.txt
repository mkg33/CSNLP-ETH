The solution 3) you mention would be the best option. Try having the coordinates of the camera and the ships as small as possible. In particular their absolute value should be small compared to the distance between them. That is, don't place the camera at position 10000 and the target at position 10005, instead make it so they are closer to 0 and 5.
Solution (also for me was) is your option 3. Have static camera that can see, let's say 2000px far (much enough) and you move with world around it. Camera will be the origin of the world.
That jitter you see comes from the way floating point numbers work. A float  has only a fixed number of significant digits. If they are storing a large number, the decimals suffer from loss of precision.
Also, let's say the ship is positioned at 10.000, If you want to move it slightly, you could move it to position 10.001. However, if instead the ship is located at position 10000, you can only move the ship to 10001, which is a jump of 1, instead of the 0.001 you previously had. Hence the jitter.
I was facing same issue on "large" world. My PointLight shadows started to jittering at coords >4090, it also depends how you set your Perspective (near and far plane), if near plane is around 0,1 (for big close up), the world starts jittering at around 4000, if you set near plane to 1.0f, you are safe till 8000 coords (in my case). But this is not solution, just improvement.
Let me put an example using decimal numbers. Suppose floats can hold say, 5 significant digits only.
