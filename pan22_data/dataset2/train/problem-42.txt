Finally in my Flow Service, before using the "pub.client:http" component, I added a "pub.security.keystore:setKeyAndChain" component configured to use my new KeyStore alias and its Key alias.
In myWebmethod Web Console, in "Security" and "Keystore", I clicked on "Create Keystore Alias". I configured a new PCKS12 keystore and gave it my PFX file (had to specify both the keystore password and the key password separately).
I had to replace my JDK security policy files by those provided by oracle: UnlimitedJCEPolicyJDK8 (only if using JDK8 < 161). Then I imported the Key Pair in my cacerts file (%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts). I also imported the Root Certificate of the API URL (which is different from the one contained in my PFX file).
Then in "Security" and "Certificates", I clicked on "Configure Client Certificates" and added the Root Certificate from my certification chain (I had previously exported with IE). I also added the Root Certificate from the URL certification chain (different in my case).
In the "Manage Private Key" Import wizard, I added the key from the PFX file. Then in the "Manage Certificate" Add wizard, I imported the certificate from the Private Key's Certificate Chain (4th option). I then used the "Manage Certificate" Add wizard to import the certificate from the API URL (different certificate in my case).
Then in my policy, I right clicked on my "Route to HTTP(S) assertion" and clicked on "Select Private Key" to force CA API Gateway to use the private key I imported precedently instead of its default one.
