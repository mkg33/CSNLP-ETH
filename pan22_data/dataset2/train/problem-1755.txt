Snapshots are not a long term solution. If you have old snapshots, it could cause performance issues on the vm if you delete newer snapshots.
Consolidate the snapshots to ease your migration and upgrade processes. There's no reason to keep old VM snapshots around. It's inefficient and a poor form of backup. If you don't consolidate them, your upgrade will still work, but you'll be missing out on features available to the virtual hardware version (vmx-09 with ESXi 5.1). I'm not certain that virtual hardware can be upgraded when there's an outstanding snapshot.
It shouldn't matter. Your older snapshots should work fine. But, like I said before, you shouldn't keep old snapshots around indefinitely.
You shouldn't be keeping snapshots around indefinitely. There is a considerable disk performance hit when using snapshots and also, the larger they get the greater the chance of a failed merge down the road. They're meant for short-term use. 
It sounds like you're using snapshots in place of backups. Don't do that. Snapshots are a complimentary technology to a backup and also allow for neat things like vSphere-based SRM replication. They're not a substitute for a backup.
