It's doubtful that the issue has anything to do with the fact that this is a micro unless you went from a S3 backed instance to an EBS backed instance (relating to the fact that ephemeral storage isn't defaulted on EBS backed instances).
I have a Micro instance running Ubuntu 10.04 x86 (AMI ami-3e02f257). It has the OS volume attached at /dev/sda1 and a second volume attached at /dev/sdf (reported as /dev/sda1=vol-eaa0e982:attached:2011-03-08T17:17:42.000Z:false, /dev/sdf=vol-44a3ea2c:attached:2011-03-08T17:17:42.000Z:false). 
Have you tried removing /dev/sda2?  Since it's not defined in the block device config you posted it could be having an issue since the device doesn't exist.  I'm not sure if mount at boot aborts on error or if it tries to mount additional devices. As it was mentioned by @richard-bentley EBS backed instances don't have ephemeral storage and this part of the command will fail.
FWIW, I had this same problem on a small Amazon Linux AMI instance and it was caused by the nobootwait option in the fstab entry. Removed the offending option and it mounted at boot just fine.
When I reboot, /mnt/osm does not come online. If I run sudo mount /dev/sdf /mnt/osm the volume comes online immediately. This was working on a Small instance. When I removed nobootwait it bricked the instance. Any suggestions? The filesystem needs to come online so that the Postgres cluster running on it can start.
