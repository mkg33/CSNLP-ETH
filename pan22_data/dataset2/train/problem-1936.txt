Shoot-em-ups are a genre where the gameplay is heavily affected by the horizontal and vertical size of the screen. There is a reason why the genre had its apex in the era of home consoles and arcade machines where the developers knew exactly what screen resolution they were targeting.
I have drawn a gizmos around the allien formation, and written a script with some calculations that everytime formation hits the edge, it goes to the other edge, hits the other edge, and goes to the other edge, and so on and on. In the free aspect movement looks great, but however, then i change the resolution to any other, movement is stuck, or it barely moves. 
Thank you for your time, and sorry if you can't understand everything or something is unclear to you, i'm beginner at game development and English is not my first language. 
The problem i have now, is with display resolution after i build game. So far i have been working with 2D Space Shooter game (getting help from the tutorial), everything is working smoothly. The only thing that i hardly understand is the resolution, aspect ratio thing. I have made a game that looks like this:
If you want to have the genre on modern PCs, there are several options, but neither is really satisfying.
I will add my formation controller script as well(it contains several other things so i printscreened only the code that helps formation to move): 
Now here is my question. What should i do, to make the game look and work smoothly on every resolution like it works on the free aspect display? I tried to change formation height and width and so on, but i assume this is not an option.
