The Zigbee module will need a UART connection, but the RF module likely will not. Although simple RF modules do use a serial protocol, it's usually done in software and wrapped in Manchester encoding to make the transmission more robust.
The RF-module doesn't require the UART pin. You can use any GPIO pin you like. So the library you are using (found at http://weejewel.tweakblogs.net/blog/8665/lampen-schakelen-met-een-raspberry-pi.html), can easily be modified. Just change line 14 in kaku.ccp to int pin_out = <<some-other-pin>> and recompile.
The global idea is you just need to send real-time frames containing an opening sequence, a Manchester coded frame and a closing sequence.
I'm working an a home automation project, using a Raspberry Pi. What I want to do is connect an RF 433 MHz transmitter to control RF-controlled light switches, and a ZigBee/XBee module to connect to other devices such as curtain rails. I will probably be programming in Node.js, as I am already familiar with JavaScript.
