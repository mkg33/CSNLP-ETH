In general jitter of ~10% of the RTT is reasonable, especially long, contended or unreliable links can obviously affect that.
For VoIP a maximum latency under 10 ms will place you easily in MOS 5. People start complaining around 50-100ms. Above 100ms it's significantly degraded. For grading of voice quality have a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score
So the whole jitter can be explained with a single packet in queue at one of the switches. In practice you should be more interested in the distribution of jitter than single outliers. To get this data you need to do a lot more measurements. If this is your maximum latency you observe you are doing as well as Ethernet can. 
Jitter less then 5ms is likely to be overwhelmed by any general purpose OS (the scheduling subsystem) on the end of the connection.
I really doubt you're going to notice one twenty thousandth of a second delay in your network communications.
It depends on what you're trying to do, but a a general guideline, jitter under several milliseconds (I'd say about 5 ms) is utterly ignorable for most anything you'll be running between the workstations.
