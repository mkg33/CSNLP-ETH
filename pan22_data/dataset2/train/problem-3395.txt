Dropbox and Google Drive are two great sync products but they always sync everything effectively crowding your hard drive really quickly. And I'm not referring to the default setting of syncing all folders and files. What I would like is for a syncing application such as Google Drive or Dropbox to offer me the option of letting me sync the file whenever I really need to use it. Not because there is a sync checkmark next to the file/folder.
If the Google Drive folder simply listed the folders and files that I have in My Drive, then I would not want it to sync file X locally to my storage unless I actually wanted to use X. Maybe by double clicking on a word file this would then sync it locally to my computer and open MS Word. This I believe is how the sync apps work on mobile devices because of their limited storage capabilities. 
Furthermore, I would like to be able to delete all files in the Google Drive folder without syncing that action to the remote storage. That way I could control my local storage much better.
