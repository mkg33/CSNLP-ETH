The unit of the Tx strength is dBm or mw. Some vendor may include the Tx of the PA only, and some may plus the gain of antenna. It is normally 15-20dBm for our wireless ADSL modem routers(http://www.visonicom.com/wireless-adsl-routers/), depending on the requirement of buyer.
I'd say its the gain. A gain of an antenna is measured in dBi. The longer antenna with good gain (dBi) give a good wider coverage.
In common, a gain of antenna will be 2dBi (it may vary depending on some routers). 2dBi is pretty much enough to cover 70 - 100 meters. Usually for the signal strenght of a WiFi, its gain is more important (that is the antenna). 
The parameter shows the strength of the signal is Transmit Power (Tx). It is common used in wireless router, but for wireless ADSL modem people focus more on the DSL part, sometimes this parameter is omitted in the datasheet. Anyhow you can check the vendor for the Tx strength value.
What specification of a Wifi Modem + Router(for a DSL connection) tells us about the strength of the wireless signals? i.e. one particular router may be give out signals strong enough to reach 1 room away another may give out signals which can reach in the floor below or above. So which parameter of the spec tells us about this capability of the wifi modem+router. And how to interpret this parameter.
