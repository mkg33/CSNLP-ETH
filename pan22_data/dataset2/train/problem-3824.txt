I like the minibufexplorer plugin. It gives you a small list of open buffers at the top of a windows, that sort of looks like the tabbar in Firefox, and it allows you to close buffers (or at least remove them from the list).
How do I set up a buffer switch like Alt-Tab on Windows:? It cycles through a list sorted by last access first? So if I pressed Alt+Tab, I'd get the last accessed buffer. If I pressed it again, I would go back to the first file. If I pressed Alt+(Tab,Tab) I would go the second to last access buffer. Unlike the existing Ctrl+6 in Vim, I wouldn't want unopened buffers to be a part of the list. 
I personnaly use its sibling LustyExplorer which offers the same feature plus a similar one for the filesystem and a similarly designed "search in buffers" as well.
It allows you to use ctrl-tab and shift-ctrl-tab to navigate backwards and forward through the list of tabs, if you want to. Not alt, though, but I guess you could make a map to do that yourself.
Hit <leader>b to open a list of buffers with the most recent first, type a couple of letters to narrow the list down to the one you want and finally <CR> to open it.
