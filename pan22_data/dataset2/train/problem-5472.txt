also if u have register the domain with a 3rd party domain registrar u can get the DNS server config to redirect to new server or backup server. 
Another cheap, quick and reliable solution to evaluate could be to use Amazon Route 53 failover http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/health-checks-creating.html. This feature was released on Feb 11 2013 and provides high availability and/or load balancing between primary and secondary sites. 
You want to look into global load balancers like F5 and Cisco make.  Basically they do some tricks with DNS if the partner is down and if the partner is up they feed the data across to the otherside through the load balancer.
You can do this without using a network appliance using the following two methods at least, but they will require change control:
You can also do automatic load balancing and active-active failover, especially for a web server serving static pages by using routing protocols. Checkout EGP and IGRP. There should be help material online (related to Cisco especially) that detail how to do this with two or more hosts via a router.
Tell me if you are using any sort of reverse proxy in your environment if so u might be able to redirect it to the backup server.
