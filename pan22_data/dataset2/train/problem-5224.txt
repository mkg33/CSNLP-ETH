Last but least Microsoft is running an Skype for Business (=SFB) Feedback community, which you can access here. So you might wish to post your idea and maybe Microsoft will pick that up and implement such a kind of feature.
Out of the box this isnÂ´t possible with Skype. You might come up with a fancy SfB powershell script, which check a given list of users and then send only the users who have a special state a message, however this required access to the SfB server in order to run the powershell script.
Everyone at the office has the same IP address so that could be used to achieve #2 reasonably well but is suspect there isn't functionality to do this in the GUI. But is there a PowerShell solution?
Then you might wish to write something on your own based on UCWA for example which did that. But this might be an overkill for you.
