Ok then, 1000 users, what codec/player/bitrate? how much content? what's the average content length? presumably no QoS/multicast options? what's serving your front-end? what's your expected play-truncation rate? what's your uplink to the internet (be as detailed as possible)?
We stream on-demand lectures that run for about 12 hours each (broken up into one-hour blocks). We use Flash Media Server (but with a streaming-only license) from Adobe, and a custom-built app to display it in the presentation in the users browser (and tie slides/video/audio together).
i have did this for one of the Telecom using Cent OS with VLC player and TV Setup box. You need to install VLMa
We can up-scale our link with a call to our ISP and it's done within a few minutes, so if it's ever under huge demand we can speed it up for a few hours, then drop it back again to save money.
FMS has the ability to stream from live capture cards. It comes with a sample application that streams from your webcam, but it would not be difficult to have it stream from an alternate live source (capture card, etc).
We run the server on a Dual Quad Core Xeon 2.4Ghz with 4Gb of ram and we've never run into any scaling issues, except for running out of RAM on occasion (FMS is very ram hungry). We run a link with 2mb uplink, but our media is of very low quality (320x240, high compression, mono audio). We've never had any complaints. We also use the RMTPE protocol, which is encrypted and has an additional CPU overhead.
CRTMP Server gives excellent performance (especially on resource constrained systems) compared to some of the user Java-based servers out there. There's also a paid commercial offering of the same product with support.
As an example, this is the setup we use for streaming (and recording) lectures. We don't have 1000 users, but our solution should be scalable to that number.
