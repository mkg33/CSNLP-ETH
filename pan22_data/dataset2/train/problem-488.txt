you dont need to install flash for steam, you have to install flash for browser(like IE) and steam automatically hook it
When trying to view some content through Steam, if you don't have the Flash Player that Steam requires, you will get the following message:
When following those instructions and navigating to  http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions there is no option to select Windows 8 for your operating system:
I recently installed Steam on my Windows 8 desktop and the Flash content won't show up. I never had to install Flash separately for Steam so I wonder what's going on. I follow the usual instructions to install Flash but it installs it on my browser not on the application. Since all my browsers already have Flash installed, how can I install Flash on Steam under Windows 8?
Steam doesn't have a built in Flash player like Google Chrome does. It uses Adobe Flash player from your computer. In order Steam to display Flash content you must download it from Adobe's website: http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/
The IMHO best way to get Adobe Flash is through the distribution downloads page. Doesnâ€™t contain any unwanted additions and is a full installer (not web-based).
