I tried using, for instance on Solaris, pkgadd -R to try an install pre-compiled packages in a custom path (namely within the homedir of a specific user, rather than in the normal default path of /usr/local/...), but said pre-compiled packages all comes with references to other resources in /usr/...:
I have to install many application packages (by that, I mean: svn, httpd, git, perl, python, ...) on a few Linux (RedHat) or Solaris (10, in local zones) servers.
Each package source is downloaded, compiled, and installed in $HOME/usr/local (i.e. not in a system path).
The key is to have a .bashrc (for instance) which will change the $PATH in order to not have any /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin in it, but only $HOME/usr/local/bin.
What would you recommend to do in order to install in an isolated way different "services" on a same (Linux or Solaris) server, each one potentially requiring their own version of (perl, python, ...)?
(and by everything, I mean even gcc itself if needed, since the /usr/swf/bin/gcc installed by default on our Solaris servers is even older than the pre-requisite gcc 3.4.6)
All the versions used in this global recompilation are comming from sunfreeware, which will details all the necessary dependencies, and will provide a link to the sources for each packages.
