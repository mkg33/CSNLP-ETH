Open Sql Server Configuration Manager > Sql Server Network Configuration > TCP/IP > Properties > IP Addresses
under TCP properties i have enabled tcp for the ip (of course this part must be owrking as if i disabled firewall it works) and the port number is left blank and dynamic ports is 0
Have you tried specifying the executables as the exceptions in the Windwows Firewall? Just this weekend I setup my own Win 2008 with SQL 2008 machine with these steps, things are working perfectly. No port numbers were involved in the process. Can get to this instance remotely from Sql Management Studio with no problems.
I have opened a port as 1433 on the server firewall. And tcp is enabled, is there some other port i don't know about.. I also open 1434 ...
I have setup sql server express 2008 on a windows 2008 server. And i have done all the standard stuff in sql to allow remote connections. The strange thing is if i disable the windows 2008 server firewalll .. it works.
Check if the rules you made (ports 1433 and 1434) are for inbound connections not for outbound connections.
Double-check your settings with this article from Microsoft: Configuring the Windows Firewall to Allow SQL Server Access. Assuming you're not using a named instance, port 1433 being open for inbound connections should do it. Review the article anyway, you may find that you've missed a step.
