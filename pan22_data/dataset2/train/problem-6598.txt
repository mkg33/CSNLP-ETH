An alternative would be to use a tool like AllChars, which adds additional mnemonic key sequences like Ctrl, O, A to type å.
Advantages: Works across all applications; you don’t have to remember code numbers; your fingers will adapt to the additional key combinations quickly; you get to annoy others with ›extra pedantic typography‹ and ★ funny ♥ symbols in emails. Disadvantages: A bit of work initially; only works on your computer; you need Administrator’s privileges to install the layout.
You can use the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator to create your personal keyboard layout. It’s not that difficult, because you can build upon an existing layout and use a nice graphical tool to select keys and modifiers. There are lots of free places with AltGr or AltGr+Shift in latin layouts. 
You may enter special signs from several fonts (symbols and windings, webdings) but IMHO it isn't the best way, because if you're giving this richt text further, person without your font will see only letter (for example if I remember good N is smile in windings or webdings)
