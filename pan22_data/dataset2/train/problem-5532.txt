The simplest and safest solution would be to simply format the usb disk and recreate the TrueCrypt virtual encrypted disk as the only file on the disk.
I use a program called USB Safely Remove, which knows about TrueCrypt and can be configured to automatically pop up the TrueCrypt password dialog when certain USB drives are inserted. It also allows you to unmount the TrueCrypt drive and safely remove the USB drive with a single click.
It should prevent Win7 from asking you to format the partition, while letting you mount the partition in TrueCrypt.
I've started using TrueCrypt to encrypt a partition on an external USB hard drive. I've opted for using a raw partition as opposed to a file container.
If it doesn't work, you could try this suggestion, which is to use Autokey to automatically dismiss the messagebox when it appears.
But here's the annoyance. Whenever I connect this drive to a computer running Vista or Windows 7, I get the message popup "You need to format the disk in drive J: before you can use it". 
It's a commercial product (with a free trial), but they are currently giving away some free licenses, if you're quick. It's legit -- I got my license in their last giveaway.
I managed to achieve it by creating the drive as a GPT and then using diskpart to modify the partition GPT ATTRIBUTES...
0x8000000000000000 Prevents the partition from having a drive           letter automatically assigned.
