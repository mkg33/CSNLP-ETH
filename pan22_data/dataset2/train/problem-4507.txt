Pros and cons: first option gives the user too much power, but he may install whatever he needs to; second option gives no power to the user, but you'll have to do extra work to publish any software he needs. And it's to come in MSI format!
Your other option is to push the software through Group Policy. That would allow to you to install the software on computers in the OU without users having administrative access. To do you will need MSI installation packages for each program you want to install.
No, the problem you have is that to install a program the installer usually needs to write to C:\Program Files, C:\Program Files (x86), and C:\Windows. All of those directories are protected by the Operating System and can only be written to by an administrator. Additionally, if you make a change for all users on the computer (e.g. installing a program) usually the installer will write to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in the registry. The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry hive is also protected by the Operating System and requires administrative access to write to.
