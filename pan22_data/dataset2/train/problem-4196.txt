Long story short, there's a registry setting that controls what level of SuperFetch is appropriate. You can see below the EnableSuperfetch value is now set to 1, which seems to be "prefetch all executables and libraries". The default is a 3, which seems to mean "prefetch all executables, libraries, and documents". I have many documents, so I think this was taking way too long. Every document opened is another one that SuperFetch has to "analyze" to see how you're using it.
So far the only downside is that my outlook folders take a few extra seconds to open, and some commonly used documents like MS Project files take longer. But those delays pale in comparison to the disk thrash I was getting before!

This is an older question, but I had this issue, and for me it was SuperFetch. I tried everything I could find on PID 4 excessive hard drive usage, and some of it helped. A RAM upgrade from 4GB to 8GB only made the issue more obvious - RAM usage was low, no paging, but yet the hard drive was lit up for ~10 minutes after my laptop booted.
