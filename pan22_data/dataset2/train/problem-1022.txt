You might need to back up your transaction logs more frequently than hourly if your database has a lot of transactions.  Every 15 minutes isn't uncommon.  I'd suggest editing the maintenance job to run log backups more frequently.  
One of my DBs is having a problem with the transaction log filling up. It's set to full recovery and is regularly being backup via maintenance plan. I have a full DB backup every weekend then daily differential backups during the weekday along with the transaction log backup every hour. I checked log truncation status and the current status is LOG_BACKUP. I can clear it out doing a on-demand backup but why isn't it being cleared out with the maintenance plan?
Yeah. Happens if you are never making a backup. Similar to the tank in your car getting empty if you never bother to do your job and fill it up.
Transaction logs should get deleted after a full or incremental backup - if you do not make backups then put the database model to Simple.
Also, does the .ldf have enough disk space?  If the physical file is prevented from growing, it'll run out of space even with truncation.
If you regularly do full backups then obviously someone did not know how to make them and forgot to put the deletion of the transaction log into the sequence. The maintenance plan has a setting for that.
