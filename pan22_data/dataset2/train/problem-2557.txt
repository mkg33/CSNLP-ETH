If you can, login to the router and try change the DNS settings it uses for DHCP (it can be external servers, doesn't have to be BT). Also check the DHCP settings and the range it uses (ie. see if you have enough "slots" etc.).
Ignoring point 1 for moment, my gut is telling me DNS. It is an up to 20MB line that usually gets to between 13MB and 15MB downstream. The router is capable of dealing with the amount of wireless devices that we're throwing at it.
Try to ping 74.125.224.244 and then ping Google.com. If the former works and the latter fails you have a dns problem.
We get our office broadband through a BT Business Broadband WiFi router. We have a mixture of macs and windows PC/laptops connecting to it at any one time.
The reason why Skype still works but not web browsers is because Skype doesn't rely on DNS. Make sure you have the correct DNS server addresses for your network interface or use the router's IP address instead.
However, only two computers (one windows, one os x) are able to consistently connect to the internet. The other three (one windows, two os x), while they can always connect to the wifi, exhibit one of three characteristics.
The above answers are correct. You are having problems with the DNS settings on the flawed hosts. What I can add is you may have problems with DHCP also. As long as you get your LAN settings automatically it means your DHCP doesn't work correctly giving a mistaken dns address to the hosts. When I had such a problem in my office, using Windows machines, I typed at the command prompt (run as administrator):
Try to manually override the DNS settings on the local machine to connect directly to a known DNS server. If this work then the router has a problem with the DNS servers it provides for DHCP (assuming you use DCHP). (And connecting directly gives a little speed-up on new look-ups btw.).
