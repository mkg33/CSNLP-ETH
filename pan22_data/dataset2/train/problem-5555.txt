But, to be honest, I never needed to rollback any change that came from updates on my debian/stable systems. I use it to fix mistakes I did manually.
Depending of your VM technology, you can stop/suspend/pause the VM, dump the core and copy the image of the VM. If it failed, just restore the original.
Or using the gold old tar(1). You create a complete tar ball of the userspace, restore the files and removed the files that were not in the original tar ball.
If you are straight on a logical volume, you can create a LVM snapshot based on the original LV. Test an upgrade and if it work you redo it on the original VM (see lvcreate(8) -s)
There is a tool called Timeshift. ( http://www.teejeetech.in/p/timeshift.html ) I haven't used it, but looks promising and I've heard good things about it from the users. The snapshots are designed to avoid data duplication. And don't get scared by obscure-looking website. :)
You could try the manual approach with backups. Simply backup your home directory and the list of programs from Synaptic and use that as a restore point.
You could try using a tool like etckeeper. This tool simply keeps system-wide configuration files in a version control repository and makes it easy to rollback and apply again any change.
TMK, the Windows restore feature only reverses changes to the registry and some critical directories. Linux does not have this.
It is not needed, since the package manager takes care of which file is from which package, and also is able to roll back the package update or installation.
