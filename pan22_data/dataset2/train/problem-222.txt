In a tmux session inside xterm when a programs generates lots of ouput (like a cat very_long_file the whole session in frozen for a while. Even if I press Ctrl-C nothing is interrupted. Presumably because tmux is frozen and it's not forwarding the Ctrl-C to the program generating the output. Is there any way to prevent this. 
Unfortunately the c0-* options for rate limiting have been removed as of tmux version 2.1 (changelog). As far as I know, the only way to customize rate limiting is to update the variables influencing it in the source code (tmux.h):    
"READ_SIZE is the maximum size of data to hold from a pty (the event high watermark). READ_BACKOFF is the amount of data waiting to be output to a  tty before pty reads will be backed off. READ_TIME is how long to back off before the next read (in microseconds) if a tty is above READ_BACKOFF."
Try different terminal emulator. On RedHat 6.5, the konsole (KDE) does not have the freezing issue (tmux 2.3 and master); however, xterm and gnome-terminal both experience bad freezing.
