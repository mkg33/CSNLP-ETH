You'll find that most folks really don't need what they say they need, and after 6 months, any legit need to move data to the new system will be done.
We have a huge large mail system, and routinely ingest users from other mailsystems (typically Notes or Groupwise). One common thread in all of these migrations is that the data migration piece is always a disaster. There are always intractable problems, VIP issues end up taking priority and the normal user population suffers. Migration tools have bugs that never get fixed because nobody does a Notes->Exchange migration twice!
What we're looking at for a future strategy is a mostly greenfield mailbox, with users identifying email that must be retained. For you its easy -- keep the dovecot servers running for 6 months, setup Outlook profiles pointing to the old imap system (I believe this is scriptable with Outlook 2007) and let users migrate in their own time.
Another option is to use a mail archiving solution. We have to archive all email due to litigation, and oftentimes you can "ingest" messages from an old system into a hosted archiving solution. Check out Postini and Microsoft Hosted services.
