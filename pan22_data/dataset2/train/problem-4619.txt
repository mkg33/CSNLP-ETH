There is an application called granola for windows that can be used to underclock the cpu to consume less power. 
Sure. Open up the case and remove the RAM. Seriously though, RAM doesn't use that much power in the first case. You'd save more power by removing the video card.
If you have an aftermarket motherboard (such as Asus or Gigabyte), it may come with an overclocker's utility (Windows application) that allows you to change settings such as the FSB multiplier (or HT or QPI). This would allow you to run the RAM slower. There will be a small but measurable performance hit. Usually these utilities overvolt automatically for overclocking, I don't think they undervolt automatically though.
To answer your question, no you can't underclock the RAM in realtime, RAM is constantly used and the moment you boot up it stores all information for you to use your system, if anything like the speed is changed then it'll crash the system.
If you have an OEM motherboard, you can underclock RAM by putting slower RAM in, in place of your standard RAM. Your motherboard will read the SPD and use the timings there.
Yes you can underclock RAM.  The best way to do so is to use any utility that will allow you to read the SPD entries.  Look for the lowest frequency spec common to all DIMMs.  Then enter those settings manually into your BIOS.  If you're BIOS doesn't have advanced config options you can use SetFSB, FreeSFB, or a proprietary utility provided by your motherboard manufacturer.  There are probably other software packages as well.
Is there also an application that can be used to underclock the ram to consume less power when you are just using the computer to download?
For true flexibility in undervolting/underclocking, any motherboard oriented towards overclockers should give you the functionality you need to do what you want, but you will probably find it in the BIOS setup, not in an application.
