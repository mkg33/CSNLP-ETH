If you Still want a lower temperature, you can purchase an aftermarket CPU cooler that will perform better then the stock one that you have. 
I partially agree with Arthur's suggestion, if it were a more modern PC then fitting an aftermarket CPU cooler would be sensible. However with a machine that old, an aftermarket CPU cooler will probably cost as much as a new machine twice as fast.
You should really monitor the temperature in Windows when it's doing something that matters, using something like CoreTemp (watch out for bundled crapware) or SpeedFan. The latter also allows you to control fan speeds on some machines. 
65'c on it's own is not "wrong". It could well be designed to constantly run at 65'c. The Lenovo Yoga for example, does exactly that. NVidia graphics chips are also typically run at 65-85'c target temperatures and some AMD cards have normal operating temperatures of 95'c. If it only shut down suddenly once then I would hardly consider it a concern.
I have solved the problem.If you look in the motherboard picture you may see that one latch is opened, creating a huge crack between the heatsink and the cpu, and I didn't noticed because it looked like closed. After the fix, the CPU temperature sits nicely at 40Â°C. Thank you everyone for sugestions and answers.They all helped me :)
The best thing you can do is check the CPU fan to ensure that it's functioning, that there isn't an excessive amount of dust on it and that it's seated in the socket properly. 
Edit: I just saw the comment that it was shutting down while you are playing video games - that is an indication of something wrong. The above advice applies regardless.
