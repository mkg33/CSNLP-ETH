You likely blew the polyfuse. But, pins GPIO pins +5V and ground (2 and 6) could be used to power Raspberry Pi as well. That pin is connected after polyfuse, so if you power it this way you may well bypass your blown polyfuse.
My personal recommendation is to always power the Pi using an official Raspberry Pi power supply. Yes you can power the Pi using USB ports on computers and USB phone chargers, but your asking for trouble. 
The answer to your problem is if you really have killed your Pi, well its not the end of the world, we've all done it at some point. If you do get a new one be sure to use an official Raspberry Pi power supply.
In your case you connected the Pi to a powered USB hub, and also an external HD. Yes I suppose that setup should work in theory. However it really is not a good one. When the product description said the USB hub was recommended for the Raspberry Pi, they did not mean it was recommended for powering it.
Its reasonably likely that you blew the fuse.  The Raspberry Pi has a polyfuse, which will "blow" if you draw too much power from the Pi.  A quirk of polyfuses is that they can take a long time to reset.
Be aware, this will cicrumvent protection that polyfuse gives. But, I think you could at least test if your RasPi is still functional and this is really polyfuse. And don't try to power it from same hub you connected to RasPi USB ports. Yes, you will have two plugs, which is better than broken RasPi.
