Sounds like a flaky flash drive.  If it has demonstrated itself to be problematic, and replacing it would set you back all of ~$15.00, why try to salvage it?  I say it should "hit the dustbin".
I have a Sandisk Cruzer Micro 8GB flash drive. It used to work just fine, but now when I plug it in, a drive letter for it only appears for a split second and then disappears. Sometimes the light on the drive also goes out, sometimes it stays in idle mode (slowly fading in/out).
Disk Management does not show any device plugged in; I see USB Mass Storage Device in the USB section in Device Manager, but I feel that it isn't my flash drive. I tried multiple PCs, and the same happens on all of them.
If you have anything important that you need to get off it, you might (like me) just get it working long enough to get those files, by repeatedly unplugging and replugging it. 
Q: When I plug in my USB drive I hear the audible "ding" sound but nothing happens after that. I don't see that the drive is being recognized at all. If I leave the thumb drive plugged in and reboot, Vista will then recognize it. How can I get the system to recognize the thumb drive without rebooting the system?
Chek your warranty. I had similar symptoms with a Sandisk Cruzer. Mine was the Titanium model, and still under the warranty (4 years I think), so Sandisk sent me a replacement.
I have a bad feeling that this is a hardware problem and the flash drive is going to have to hit the dustbin :( But maybe there still is something to try?
