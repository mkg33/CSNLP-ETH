If I was you, I'd try and dig up some sales figures from some modern or recent racing games. Those might be hard to come by, but you might be able to scrape some data from the number of active TrackMania 2 players (or similar such online games). Actually, "active" players might be a more realistic market for your product than mere owners of racing games.
You could create a website that advertises your theoretical product and pay for some advertising on Google, etc. to generate some traffic to it. Explain that the product is coming soon, and provide a way to sign up for a newsletter.
You also need to keep in mind you're competing in the racing wheel market, which may generally have better responsiveness and offer a better overall experience for the player (it's car racing after all, not hand waving). But for a couple dollars as an iOS app, you may still be able to drive a decent amount of impulse "lets give this a try" purchases.
You can watch trends in traffic (repeat hits, how many first time visitors stick around to read your content, etc.), which should give you some idea of whether there is any interest. Your newsletter subscriptions will not only give you an idea of what kind of interest there is, but also help you have a stronger release.
As for ascertaining actual demand for something, you Google it. Look for people asking for the exact app you're asking for "let me play my PC racing games with my iPad as the controller". Now yes, you stand a very good chance of finding nothing, which may actually mean there is no demand. However, that's not to say nobody will want it once they know it exists. It could be something they don't yet know they want.
