It is similar to Fiddler, except it doesn't have so great scripting capabilities, but handles reverse proxies + ssl, which is what I need. Charles Proxy is java-based, so it should run on Mac too.
I already use tcpdump for network traces, but that's far to much info for what I'm trying to accomplish, and the output data isn't as easy to read as it would be in the above Windows HTTP trace programs.
I use HTTP Scoop which you can get from tuffcode.com.  It costs $15 but is completely worth it (and I am not a Tuffcode employee).
Other proxy-based solutions are burpsuite (free to use, afaik) and NetTool (opensource). Both are written in java, have graphical interfaces and should work ok on MacOSX. I have mostly used the former and have been quite satisfied with it.
Does anyone have any good suggestions for a graphical HTTP trace program for OSX? I'm looking for something similar to Fiddler or HTTPWatch. 
You could use wireshark which has a graphical interface (and a CLI one called tshark).  It has a menu entry called "Follow TCP stream".  That way, you see all requests and answers from a given TCP connection.
