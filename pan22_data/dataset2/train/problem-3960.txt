Assuming a UK keyboard layout, it can be a pain to input # (the hash symbol), due to various factors (meta key, Hash on Alt+3, etc).
On the off chance you're using a Mac with a UK keyboard layout, you need to use alt+3 to get a # symbol.
There is the very remote possibility that the user is using an antique unix that has # mapped to delete and @ mapped to kill (^U on most traditional modern systems).
If his system is configured this way, he will not be able to type a # because every time he does it will delete whatever character is to the left of where he is trying to type the #.  The simplest way to fix this is stty erase (ctrl-V)(backspace key).
This is unlikely to be the case -- it's not likely that anyone is running irix 5.4 or hp/ux 10.20 these days, but who knows, right?
For fixing this in iTerm2, left alt key is set to Esc+ by default, change this to Normal. Presumably there will be something similar for other terms.
If you're in insert mode, it should be just the same as any other application. If it doesn't say "--INSERT--" at the bottom of the terminal, hit i, then try typing. When you're done, hit escape to get out of insert mode and back to "command mode".
