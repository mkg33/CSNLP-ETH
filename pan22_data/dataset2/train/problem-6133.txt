If I understand your question correctly the majority of your servers on your domain exist on your internal network and you do not want to proxy those, but you do want to proxy the externally hosted servers.
You might suggest to your IT guys to also consider setting up WPAD this technology allows you to specify the exceptions and proxy configuration in a single javascript file hosted somewhere on your network.  I find that a WPAD configuration is far easier to maintain then the a group policy exception 
Are you actually using a .com - if you're a uk based hospital and have a .nhs.uk based domain the rules for subdomains become a bit tricky because of the odd way connecting for health administer the domains. 
One way to do this may be to simply remove the *.ourdomain.com exception and instead add exceptions based on your internal address space.  So if you where using private addresses inside your network you might add an exception like this 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16.  Of course you would just use the network or networks that is actually being used.
