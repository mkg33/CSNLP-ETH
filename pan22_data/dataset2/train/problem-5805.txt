I have two devices, a PS4 and a Raspberry pi that I'd like to connect to the internet hub through ethernet. The hub is 20m away from the devices by cable, so running two cables isn't suitable. I'd like to use one cable. The raspberry pi is to be used for streaming both video and game, so requires high bandwidth. The PS4 might stream but will mostly be used from playing online. Only one device will be in use at a time. It seems an ethernet splitter would split the wire and reduce bandwidth. Is there a device that could switch between the two devices automatically?
If there is a power socket nearby, I think your best option is a powerline, with two ethernet ports.
What you are looking for is an ethernet switch/bridge. It is a device that connects layer 2 network with each other. Most routers today have one built in allready (about the last sesible integration that has found their way into routers). You need a switch, a long cable running to the router and shorter ones to connect all the devices mentioned.
