TestDisk to the rescue!  You can use TestDisk to recover/repair the filesystem on the disk, and then proceed to attempt a data recovery.  Unlike dd, TestDisk will actually recover things on the filesystem-level (i.e. it will allow you to browse through the disk and select files/folders to recover, and you can set how to handle bad sectors manually).
The basic process would be to scan the drive, select the partitions of interest, restore/fix the partition table & headers (if required), and back up your data.  Assuming the filesystem wasn't corrupted, it's much easier to fix the partitions with TestDisk and re-copy your data from your operating system.  However, if you suspect any kind of corruption which might make copying under an OS unfeasible, TestDisk can also be used to recover your files.
Unfortunately, it may be so bad off that it's unrepairable.  Thats when you might try some external tools like ntfsfix from a linux live boot disk.  Good luck.
Let it attempt to repair.  Worst case scenario, you might have boot off a Vista installation disk and open the recovery console to perform a chkdsk -r.  If it doens't work on the first try, do it again.  I have repaired a few NTFS file sysmtems using chkdsk more than once.
