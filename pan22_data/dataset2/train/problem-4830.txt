the same problem happened with my laptops desktop I also run Windows 10, the only thing I had to do was powering my laptop off and then on again, and then it refreshed When Moving/Renaming/Deleting Files & Folders. I hope it helps you too. 
look out for a DWORD value called "DontRefresh" which is set to "1" (on). Change the value to "0" (off). 
This script is for resetting desktop icon issues in Windows 10. Any shortcuts on your desktop should return to a default position to the upper-left of the primary screen. 
I had a samba share to a network printer scan folder pinned in the quick access folder. After trying all other solutions including resetting my Windows, this worked! Look to see if you have any shortcuts to poor performing network locations.
Haven't tried this solution for your specific problem, but I'd consider it worth trying if I came up against your set of symptoms:
Settings -> Personalization -> Themes-> Change desktop icons -> Restore default. Then uncheck "allow themes to change desktop icons" and Apply and OK. If this does not work, Restore default > check "allow" again > Apply > OK. Then go back in and Restore default > uncheck "allow" again > Apply > OK. Dunno why I had to do this more than once, but works now.
