I have lost many electronics that I keep unused for a long time before due to the near sea (high humidity area) area that I live in. I learned this the hard way, so in order to protect hard drives unused for long periods that I use as back up, I wrapped them using a cling film to be air tight and prevent moist air or dust to the hard drives. Then I heard hard drives need access to normal air pressure. I have three WD hard drives one external (My Passport 1 TB) two internals one is SATA the other is IDE, which I sealed for more than a month now. Is there a problem with sealing the hard drives that way, should I worry about the drives?
First of all "normal air pressure" and "air tight seal" are not mutually exclusive. Secondly "normal air pressure" requirement is just for the operating mode not for the storage. The bottom line is your drives are going to be fine. I mean if they fail - that won't be because you stored them in an air tight container.
Wrapping the hard drives in cling film does not seem to change the pressure much, unless you used some sealing technique involving a vacuum to suck the air out. 
Wrapping using cling film should keep dust out. Keeping moisture out is less likely. I think there will be little effect on moisture in the air INSIDE the wrapping unless it is completely air tight and has been wrapped in a different atmosphere. So, other than regular moisture problems, I suggest that the most important problem is temperature. If the drives are cold, moisture can condense causing a problem.
I don't think you should worry about your drive, as the air pressure is actually around the same (at least it should be, maybe with small differences). As long as water or large amounts of dust does not collects inside, your hdd should be fine.
