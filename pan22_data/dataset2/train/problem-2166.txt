How-To Geek suggests in How to Reset Your Forgotten Windows Password the Easy Way to exploit the StickyKeys feature to reset your password.
Anyway, I haven't done it with Windows 7, only XP, but Hiren's Boot CD has a password recovery tool that should work.
His kid brother installed a password on his windows 7 home premium desktop and now he forgot. How does he get in?
To complicate matters further, his CD drive doesn't work. In that case, what options does he have available to recover his password?
If it's a desktop, can you take the HD off and install on a machine that has a working CD drive, can't you?
I made a bootable USB drive with Offline NT Password http://pogostick.net/~pnh/ntpasswd/ You can then just locate the user profile he logs in with and blank the password.
Don't see why you have to be so drastic as doing a complete reinstall. And why would you need to empty the drive first? The installation of the OS does that for you.
Just make sure the BIOS of the PC is set to boot off USB first. (Or whatever you decide to put Offline NT Password on, if you burn it to a CD then make sure the BIOS is set to look at the CD first)
