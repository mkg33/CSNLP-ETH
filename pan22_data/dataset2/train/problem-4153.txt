The lowest end Adaptec controller is the 6405 with 512 meg cache, and the AFM 600 is a plugin module.
Currently in both cases, the flash cache plus RAID controller will end up costing at least US$500 to $1000. But more RAID manufactures will probably move in this direction and prices will come down.
These yield ballpark figures to help you nail down about how long it would take to drain the battery. I'd assume a 25% margin of error just to be on the safe side since you don't know how many amps the RAID draws, or the actual condition of the battery.

Normally the batteries have the rating printed on the side of them. In the case of one server we have, the RAID battery is listed @ 3.7V -- 7Wh. Watt- hours are calculated with voltage X current X time. Your battery should list the voltage, and at least the amperage or watt hours. Either one of these is sufficient to find the time before the battery dies.
The newest RAID controllers no longer need a battery backed cache. Instead super capacitors are used to provide power to the controller, and provide time for data to be saved to a flash memory module in the event of an outage, allowing for months to years of cache preservation with no high-stress 3-day recovery time limit. They look like they have a battery module, but instead they use a group of supercapacitors which should never need replacement.
