How do you know that flipping a given bit the wrong way isn't going to completely destroy something and cost your target thousands or millions of dollars.
The other two answers to this question (when I read it) are excellent, so I would just like to add a small suggestion. Don't take for granted that you can't gain the same amount of knowledge through completely legal means. Studying encryption, trying to find security holes in the source code of free open source software, setting up your own dummy systems that you can experiment on safely, reading articles on internet security, etc, can be just as educational.
If you stumble upon a security vulnerability during normal use of their system, I would argue it is absolutely ethical to alert them of the problem, but to explicitly go searching for vulnerabilities when you are not contracted to do so is not only unethical, in many localities it is also illegal.
"Is it ethical to break into someone's house, just to prove that it can be done, even if you don't steal anything?"
The key flaw I see in your question is that you seem to believe it is possible to correctly assess from the outside what the damage hacking will do to a given system.
Since ethics are very subjective I will answer you this way.  It would be far more ethical to leave stuff alone that doesn't belong to you or you don't have explicit permission to touch.
Calling upon my advanced knowledge of what the question "is it ethical to do X?" means (1), the answer is "no".
If they take you to court for illegally breaking and entering, the judge will not let you off because you were "testing your security knowledge and learning something new".
