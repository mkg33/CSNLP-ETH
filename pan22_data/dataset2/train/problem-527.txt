For a server I would recommend CentOS. It is Red Hat without the support or trademarked logos, but line for line the binaries are identical. The amount of documentation available for a Red Hat server is far greater than for any other distro. At the very least it is worth a look.
It all basically comes down to personal preference.  Linux distributions are sort of like cars.  All of them will get you to where you want to go, it's just that individually they look different, have different feels to them, and that some may require more maintenance than others.  If it is your first go around, I would use Ubuntu.  That being said, don't hesitate to check other distributions out.
I won't repeat what has been said already (all excellent points by the way) and I'll just add this - gentoo is a good system for test server. It allows you to easily customize your system in exactly the way you want (and compile times are not an issue).
To a Linux beginner, Gentoo may be overwhelming. I'd recommend getting your feet wet with a pre-packaged distro.
Gentoo has nice docs, and when you know what your are doing, looks like it can be very nifty. But since you usually want a server to work, I'd stick to something you are more comfortable with, perhaps Ubuntu Server?
I would suggest Ubuntu for now for it's simplicity... however in the future I fully recommend trying Gentoo out just for the experience you'll receive in installing, configuring, troubleshooting linux.  It's a great OS and you'll learn a ton.
