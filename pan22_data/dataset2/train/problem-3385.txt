My old HP nc6400 laptop played the same 3 "windows hardware disconnect" notes a couple of times a minute after I upgraded it to Windows 8.  I knew I had 1 defective USB port on the machine, but it didn't play any sounds when I had Windows XP running on it.  
I had further problems with USB devices disconnecting themselves, making restoring my backups from my USB hard drive very difficult. So out of desperation I installed the motherboard manufacturer's Windows 8 drivers, all of which are marked as beta, and all of which predate Windows 8. I wasn't therefore expecting much, but in this particular case, installing the audio driver seems to have fixed the problem. No more annoying noises and no more randomly-disconnecting USB devices.
I thought I was having the same problem until I figured out that it was Facebook notification sound and it could be turned off at Account Settings -> Notifications page. Yours could be the same too.
I went into "Device Manager" and disabled the USB ports 1 at a time.  After I disabled USB port 27C9, the beeping stopped!
I have the same problem with Windows 8 except it plays the device disconnect sound. Three tones down, it's even more depressing.
The good: no need to choose between annoying sound and no musics or films. The drawback is if you like to have sound notifications. 
I disabled all notifications in the Modern UI configuration but it did not work. Eventually, I found a solution: I right-clicked on the speaker icon in the taskbar, click "Sound" entry. In the dropdown menu, I changed from "Default Windows Sounds" to "No sounds".
For me this sound was coming from D-Link Shareport, version 1.17. First noticed just disabling  WLAN keeps the bing sound away. And now 'Exit' to 'D-Link Shareport' program made the silence. Nothing connected in WLAN-router. 
My PC's motherboard is an Asus P8Z68-V PRO/GEN3. Perhaps this will help somebody else with the same motherboard, and the same problem.
