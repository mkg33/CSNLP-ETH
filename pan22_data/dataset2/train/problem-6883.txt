A remote possibility: The HD has a virus on it. Solution: Don't boot from it, don't run any programs from it. 
There's always risk if you connect anything to your PC, but I'd say that dust is no problem; if the hard drive casing isn't damaged, the dust has no way to get inside. Hard drives are designed to keep out small particles because they'd damage the drive surfaces if they could get in. Also, dust usually isn't conductive, so even if you have dust in the drive itself, it shouldn't damage anything but the hard drive itself.
If you are still concerned, connect it to a hard drive enclosure with a USB interface instead (it's even more tough for bad voltages to get a) to the hard drive's interface connector and then b) through the USB interface). 
The chances that any problems the drive had will adversely affect your computer hardware are just about zero. It's really tough for problems in the electronics to cause damaging voltages to appear at the interface connector, and nothing else the drvie does could damage your machine. Even if it puts a dead short across your power supply, that is hardly ever a problem - at worst, remove the drive, do a hard-power-off (flip the hard power switch or unplug the computer from the wall), wait about five minutes (to allow the power supply's "crowbar" circuit to drain), and power up again. Computer PSUs are extremely robust. 
Yes, it's possible to damage your computer by installing an old HDD - in case you break something in your PC while connecting the disk :) 
Humidity might be a risk factor; if there are corroded parts in the power lines inside the drive, it might produce a short. But I think it's unlikely. I've connected ten-year-old hard drives I'd stored in less-than-ideal conditions to my PC and apart from some of them failing with unreadable sectors, I've never had problems.
