You can upload a folder of images to Google Docs and have them converted to Documents, which will contain both the image and the OCRed text.
Then from within Acrobat I select "Document|OCR text recognition", then save the document as plain text.
I'm not sure how much sophistication you need, but since I also use Adobe Acrobat, I just right click on my Evernote attachment to open with Acrobat.
If you name all the Evernote images with a hash (e.g. md5), it should be easy to link up plain text files downloaded from Google Docs with the original image.
Also, Evernote apparently doesn't decide a particular image is equivalent to exactly one word - e.g., Evernote doesn't determine that a particular image is "clue" and is not "due". Rather, it will track both, and a search for either would return the same image. Hence, there's no way to get a full-text equivalent because Evernote isn't deciding what the full text actually is, only what it could be.
Evernote API has functionality to get text and rectangle where this text is present inside the image. See http://evernote.com/about/developer/api/evernote-api.htm, check out "Evernote Recognition Index XML Format" and functions to retrieve it. Problem is that they don't do traditional OCR ... their OCR algorithm may produce different words for single "word" on image. All they use it for is search, so this is fine for them, but not fine for using it as a recognition engine. (Although they give you weight for each word alternative, so maybe you can use that)
evernote pays a decent sum to the creator of the ocr-stuff OR paid a decent sum to put something working together. thus, i really doubt that they will let you get the extracted text (+ positioning on the image).
