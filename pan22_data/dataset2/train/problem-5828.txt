A nice site for getting some test results can be found at http://www.av-comparatives.org/ so you may want to look there for some stats and information on some big-name company offerings.
I've had problems with every antivirus I've had to use except AVG and ClamAV (although Clam is designed to be used on Unix systems to scan email more than anything else; it's an on-demand scanner that is best used in systems as a plug-in such as having your mail agent call the scanner to scrutinize incoming files).
We've been using the Trend Micro "Worry Free Business Security Suite" and have been reasonably happy with it. It's inexpensive compared to the Symantec / McAfee / CA offerings and appears to suck less. (All antivirus sucks, to some extent, just by the nature of the problem it's trying to solve. Having operating systems that did a better job of not executing arbitrary code would be a better thing, but that's better left for a [SOAPBOX] post...)
Forefront Client Security is stupid cheap, but incredibly time consuming to setup.  Maybe most of them are.
I question the need for third-party firewall functionality on top of what Windows XP already provides, but Trend Micro handles that, too.
If you are running XP Professional in a domain environment, Symantec Endpoint Protection meets the criteria.
I've been very happy with the latest Outpost Security Suite from Agnitum.  It has antivirus and a firewall.  After having fought with significant problems in the offerings of TrendMicro, McAfee and Norton, I have been very happy with my choice.  In my limited need for their customer service, I have been satisified.
