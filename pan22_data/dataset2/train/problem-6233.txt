Getting back to the present. Sounds like your case just needs an increase in the screensaver timeout. In my opinion the difference between screen off/Screen saver is not comparable to the distraction that it causes when you are deep in thought. 
Nowadays, the main use for them (in my opinion) is to hide your screen from prying eyes with something other than the boring lock screen.
In CRT Monitors, if you display the exact same image for a long time, the colors tended to "burn in" and cause a ghost image when you are looking at anything else. This is why they had screen savers and why the screen savers tend to be active ( moving/changing).
Is it better to let the screen switch off and instantly on again, or to leave the screen saver to avoid the off-on?
I read recently this HTG article and I agree with the author in general. But I find myself sometimes reading a non-trivial article, or debugging some tricky bug in my code, and in these cases, I either stare at the screen or have a paper where I write down stuff, and always look at the screen but don't do anything. So the moment the screen saver starts, I move the mouse to continue my work. I think this is better because turning the screen off and on will be worse, but I'm not quite sure, so:
