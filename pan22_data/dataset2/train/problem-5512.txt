In general, yes.  As long as you know the thermal limits of the system's components, you can use the same monitoring tools, and same guidelines for keeping the system cool.  Hard drives, for example, will have the same general operating temperature range.  GPUs, on the other hand, follow the same trend as CPUs - check the datasheet or the manufacturer's website and you will find the safe temperature range.
In my experience, it's not comparable. On paper, the laptop and the desktop motherboards may look the same, but the laptop has the added issues of limited ventilation, which makes the computer heat up faster. The graphics are integrated as well, which would worsen the lack of ventilation by concentrating the heat so much.
Generally a processor can operate outside of it's maximum temperature range, but it will have a severely degraded lifespan.  I have seen some laptop CPUs have a maximum temp of 72C, and some at 90C.  It all depends on your particular hardware.
No.  Do not make hardware assumptions in regards to temperatures, especially when you can find this information readily available on the internet.  Look up the datasheet for your particular processor (or family of processors), and there will be all the information you need in the section detailing thermal specifications.
I feel I know the range of desktop's HDD, GPU and CPU ideal temperature. Can this knowledge be applied to test laptop's temperature? 
Just remember, however, that laptops have significantly less efficient cooling systems.  They keep all of the components in a very tight configuration, and it is difficult to move enough air over the components both efficiently, and quietly.
