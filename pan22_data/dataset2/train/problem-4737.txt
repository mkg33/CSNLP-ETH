Can you give me an idea for a simple and interesting mission for online text-based game that doesn't require much reading? Or maybe link to a website with a list with missions?
How about exploring a space craft adrift in space?  You could start with 15 rooms or areas to explore and throw in puzzles.  Maybe the onboard computer has gained self awareness and actively tries to trip up the player to protect itself (remember HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey?)  Throw in some rogue androids, maybe some mercenaries are in the middle of ransacking the craft and the player now has to evade them.  There's a bunch of "surprises" you can throw in to this setting and it can grow if you want to expand it.  The player used a pod to escape from the mercenaries and has now landed on a planet. Now we enter another adventure.  The possibilities are endless!
Might be worth having a read through these common RPG scenarios. Hard to say if they'll apply directly to your game without knowing what you're doing but they should be applicable to any genre really without too much imagination.
I'm inspired to create my own adventure game now!  I haven't made one of these since I had my Atari 800 as a boy (I'm 40.)  Anyway, good luck and have fun!
I love programming, but I hate when it comes to create things like this, because I am not creative at all.
Also I second what the first poster said. If you like problem solving and programming, you ARE creative.
