Depending on what you find out, you may be able to make your life alot easier. If an SMTP relay gets compromised, and you determine that it was due to a missing patch exploited by an outside party, you're done. Reinstall the box, patch whatever needs patching and move on.
You have to check all the logs of running applications. For example, Apache logs may tell you how a hacker could execute arbitrary commands on your system.
I highly recommend reading "Dead Linux Machines Do Tell Tales", an article by The SANS Institute. It's from 2003, but the information is still valuable today.
Often when the word "forensics" is brought up, people have visions of CSI and think about figuring out all sorts of excruciating details about what happened. It can be that, but don't make it a huge lift if you don't have to.
Going beyond that often doesn't make sense. The police often don't care, and if they did, they would impound your hardware and do their own forensic analysis.
Also check if you have running processes that scan servers or send spam. If it is the case, the Unix user they are running from can tell you how your box was hacked. If it's www-data then you know it's Apache, etc.
