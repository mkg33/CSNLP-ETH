You should investigate why you're running out of connections, first and foremost.  Do clients grab a connection and then hold it for a long time?  Does each child of a web server have its own connection, or does the server manage a connection pool?
I was requested to split a MySQL in two, it's kind of a horizontal partition, in which some rows correspond to one site, and some other correspond to another site.
I'm no DB expert but I guess keeping them in the same MySQL server with the same amount of memory and processor and the same platform won't improve things.
Increase connections only because you genuinely have some large number of clients who are known to manage connections properly.  However, it most cases, "too many connections" indicates a client-side problem.
I recommend turning on the general query log to investigate - it records connection details.  Note that you probably don't want to have the general query log on in general production use!
You are correct, that won't help a connection problem (assuming you mean two dbs and one mysql binary running, not two different mysql installations on the same hardware, which might help but is a totally backwards way of doing it...)
