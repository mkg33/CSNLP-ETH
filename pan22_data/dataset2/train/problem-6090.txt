As a long time nVidia user, I believe that it is best to download stable drivers from nVidia's site. 
There could be even newer drivers from NVidia, and often are, if you look on their site but the WHQL version is what they got certified from Microsoft. Check NVidia for newer drivers if you want the latest but to get certified use the Windows Update version.
As the driver is a third party update, Microsoft doesn't write drivers for other companies hardware, it has gone through WHQL. If there is an update it is going to be newer and was released by the card manufacturer (NVidia).
If the drivers are less than 3-4 days old, it may be a good idea to wait until they are at least a week old. One time they released bad drivers as stable. It was fixed almost immediately, but some people had problems. If I remember correcctly, the bad drivers were also WHQL certified.
In the olden days you would have been told to never take the Windows Update video drivers. Instead, you would use that update notice as a trigger to go visit the card's chipset site for drivers.
I never have issues with the Windows Update versions as they are submitted to MS to be stable and resolve issues found in older versions of drivers.
These days, for casual users I've really not had issues with the Windows Update versions. If I were a hard core gamer (I'm not) I would probably stick with manufacturer's versions though.
