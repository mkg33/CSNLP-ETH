You could install Ampache on a LAMP or WAMP server.  There's an Android client (Amdroid), and the nonworking skeleton code of an iPhone client (Amphone).
Just put VLC on all your computers and on whichever one that has your host-library, set it up to either play the music from a playlist or grab it from the line-in.  If your host happens to be a mac, you can use SoundFlower to snag the output.
It's basically an internet radio station on your own network. Set up any computer in the house and connect to it and you're done.
I don't know how well it will keep individual client playback in sync (this would have more to do with the Localplay backend than Ampache itself).  As Fake Name points out, if real sync is desired, it's probably better to run speaker wire.
I like foobar2000, though it's not entirely open source. foohttpserver plugin lets you control it over the web.
While you wouldn't be able to do the iPhone control thing natively with this software alone,  you can get pretty good low-latency streaming using VLC & it's Multicast features. Admittedly it's a little finicky to setup, but it's worked well for me for some similar setups.  Lots of trial and error.
You can use it as a backend to supply your player of choice with http-streaming audio goodness, or configure it's Localplay system and use it as frontend and/or backend to control Shoutcast or MPD.
Alternatively, Winamp has multiple plugins for a web interface, but winamp is a bit bloated these days.
On the software front, many media players have plugins that let you control them over HTTP. This would let you control the player/playlist with your iPhone, assuming you're connected using WiFi.
To get the iPhone control working, @Fake Name's answer does mention software tends to have HTTP control these days.  I'm sure you could find a decent music player that does, then just use VLC in the live/line-in configuration to snag the audio from that computer.
