Edit: To my knowledge, there were no updates that happened before this started. It seems to be out of the blue.
When I turn on my computer in the morning or if I restart it during the day it seems to double-up the night light filter. If i try to turn the night light filter off completely it only un-doubles it bringing it back to about where I usually have except that the cursor is completely unfiltered and does not get the doubled-up effect. (This makes the cursor very bright and irritates my eyes).
I have been using the Night Light feature every day for a while (so long I don't remember when I started). At first it worked perfectly, a few months ago the timer stopped working so every morning I had/have to open Night Light and turn it on. As of yesterday I am having a new problem.
So far the only solution I have found is to switch users to an admin user and switch back to my usual user without logging out of my user account. If I log out and back in it does not fix the problem.
When this first happened I made sure to get all the latest windows updates and I updated the Lenovo drivers. This did not fix my problem.
