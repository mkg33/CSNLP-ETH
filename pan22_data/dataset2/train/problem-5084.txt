The use of complex analysis (and other "continuous" math) to attack "traditional" graph separator problems was memorable and is the main reason this paper stuck in my head even though it is completely unrelated to my research.
Jon Kelner won the STOC Best Student Paper Award in 2004 for his paper "Spectral partitioning, eigenvalue bounds, and circle packings for graphs of bounded genus"
Perhaps this application is somewhat between TCS and Disc math, but I was slightly surprised when I read the paper "On the bent Boolean functions which are symmetric" by Petr Savicky (http://www2.cs.cas.cz/~savicky/papers/symmetric.ps). The theorems are only concerning Boolean functions, however one of the proofs uses complex numbers.

There is use of complex numbers and analysis in a recent paper by Naor, Regev and Vidick, yielding results in approximation algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems:
Nister, Hartley, and Stewenius used Galois theory to prove the optimality of certain algorithms in computer vision. While not specifically an instance of Complex Analysis, this work is intimately associated with $\mathbb{C}$ because of the fundamental theorem of algebra.
In Section A.4 of this paper we use complex analysis, which leads us to a derandomization of Indyk's algorithm for $\ell_p$ estimation in data streams ($0 < p < 2$) that provides optimal space guarantees:
You can get away with writing a proof that doesn't mention complex analysis explicitly (see the first bullet in the "notes" section for that paper on my webpage), but even that proof has complex analysis lurking under the covers.
