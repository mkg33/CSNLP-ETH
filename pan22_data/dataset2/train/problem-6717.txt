HTML email is normally self-contained, so Word is probably including the images with each mail, therefore inflating their size, and transforming the HTML as necessary. The images are probably encoded in base64 format, which includes 6 bits per byte, therefore further inflating the email size.
I think (but am not sure) that Word may only do that with relative-addressed images. If the HTTP references to the images are converted to absolute, it may stop including them.
I have noticed that Word and Excel documents I formerly had in the Office 97-2003 format become huge when saved in Office 2010 format.  For example, I have a Word report with a lot of embedded enhanced metafiles that was 1.1 meg when produced in Word 97-2003 that grew to 86.5 meg in Word 2010.  I prepared the report in exactly the same way, using the same exhibits and the only change was using Office 2010 instead of Office 97-2003 format.  Obviously, this is a problem for storage and email purposes.
A further remark is that absolute-address images may not display on some mail clients. Even when displayed, if the link to the image contains parameters, these parameters are omitted when retrieving the image as an anti-spam measure.
