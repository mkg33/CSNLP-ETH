I'm still running W7 Beta but will move to the RC soon.  It's a really old machine, with an nForce 2 chipset, which as all nForce 2 owners know, was tossed to the curb in Vista; there are no Vista drivers for nForce 2 chipsets, meaning it's a "driver orphan".
Microsoft would really, really like it if you upgrade your hardware to something that has "newer" drivers.  However, the old drivers work just as well, and if those drivers were stable to begin with, you can get by with them in a pinch.
I think the minimum requirements say 1 GB of RAM is needed, but I'm not sure that is the issue.  The laptop has some older hardware in it of course, so I'm sure that is part of the problem.
This is hardly an optimal solution, and is of course fraught with peril.  However, I have not had a single crash in the entire time, and with the exception of some display artifacting (the video card is AGP FX5200, also a driver orphan) has worked like a champ.
Any drivers that work in Vista should in theory work in Windows 7 due to them both running the same kernel.
I just installed it on my HTPC and did not have any problems other than MKV playback locked the system up to the point of a hard boot. 
The only problem I have while running 7 is with my onboard sound chip. The drivers for the Realtek HD Audio (Realtek ALC889A codec) contain a management application that can only be installed under WinXP. Without this app you cannot set the levels for sound input (microphone, line in). The windows integrated mixer does not show the controls for these two, so I have to live without sound input.
When you start it up, it jams before it even gets to the windows loading screen.  Just sits at an eternal screen of blackness.
