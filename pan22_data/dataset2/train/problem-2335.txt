Etam: This problem has existed for ages -- ever since guilds were invented in Europe. The modern solution is to write an Employee Handbook, know it well, and ask the employees to sign-off that they have read it.  Intellectual property and security should just be one chapter in the handbook.  
the other stuff you have in mind is the same as DRM (digital rights management) and that is doomed to fail.
Word and Excel can do this themselves. Hit the big office button (2007), "Prepare and encrypt". There it is.
As one of the commentators mentioned, building trust is also essential.  Trust comes from 1) knowing the kind of people you hire; 2) fully explaining to them the expectations of the job (and not just entirely making it up as you go).  Think of the Employee Handbook as the list of 12-20 rules that appear at most public pools (at least here in the U.S.).  It will contribute greatly to the order of your office, without resorting to a bunch of yelling and tears.
There is a GPO for Windows Server that disables USB storage devices on client machines.  Along with allowing outgoing email to only specified contacts, you can make things at least a lot more difficult.
Oh, and if it comes down to one bad apple, I recommend you secure competent legal advice and sue anyone who breaches your security under contract law and applicable intellectual property statutes.  Speak softly and carry a big stick.
You will find that a) the Handbook limits bad behavior in a plethora of areas; and b) the handbook can be a useful tool to measure the overall quality/compliance of an employee's work.
There are solutions to prevent cut'n'paste for read-only documents. Never heard of such solution for writable document. Nor would it make much sense.
