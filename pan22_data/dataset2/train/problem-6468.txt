Our fiscal year starts in July. I want to show year over year data as a chart below, but I want the month to start at July.
I looked at More Sort Options and sorting manually, but I don't see a way I can drag chart axis labels around.
Pivot charts don't allow much customization. They're useful for a quick look at  the data, but for a presentation quality chart, you really should create a custom chart, using the pivot data as your source.
However, if you want to group the dates by your company’s fiscal year, which starts in July, there’s no built-in way to do that.
It also improves readability to format the bars of each series and remove the shadow that Excel adds by default.
To make the graph, select the data in the table, leaving out the headers.  That would be A2:E13 in the table above.  Then choose Clustered Column from the Column section of the Charts tab.  Resize the graph to make it bigger, and right-click on the various elements of the graph to format them.
In the graph above, I made the text of the axis labels and legend bigger, added axis and chart titles, and changed the series names from Series1, etc. to the Fiscal Year.
If you decide to go down this path, and run into any problems, please feel free to comment back here and I'll see what I can do to help.
To get your  Monthly axis labels, you just need a column containing the labels as part of your data table.  Not knowing how your data is arranged, I put together a simplified data table to build a graph from.  You might have all these columns in your pivot table.  If not, it should be easy to create a similar table.
I used the short names of the months as the x-axis labels, but you could use numbers, if that's what you need. 
You can use a workaround solution, by adding in the pivot table source data a column with a formula that calculates the fiscal year, quarter or month, and then adds that field to the pivot table.
