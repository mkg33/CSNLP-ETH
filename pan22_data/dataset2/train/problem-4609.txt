Also, this is my first post on any of the Stack Exchange sites.  I hope this question is both merited and on the correct site.  If not, please do let me know!
I have verified that I'm not using any public DNS forwarders (such as Google's), so it's not an issue of all or nothing being blocked.
What's most confusing is that this configuration works for the majority of messages received which are on an SBL:
Taking for instance an email that was received recently from IP 66.248.197.240 which is most certainly on the Spamhaus SBL as well as a few others (http://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=blacklist%3a66.248.197.240&run=toolpage) and correctly identified by the Edge server as such:
I'm including the full message headers (with my server's identities redacted) of an email from an IP address that is on an SBL below.  It's clear that the inclusion of all of the SPAM filtering I have is impacting the time it takes for a message to make it through to the mailbox server (in this case, 8 seconds between submission and delivery), however it doesn't seem to be enough.
I have configured our Exchange 2013 Edge Transport server to utilize several IPBlockListProviders including Spamhaus.  While they work great most of the time, there are still some emails which despite being matched by one of the block list providers get through.
Interestingly, one thing that seems to have made a significant difference is modifying the priority of the transport agents such that the Connection Filtering Agent is first.  This is my current configuration in case it's pertinent:
