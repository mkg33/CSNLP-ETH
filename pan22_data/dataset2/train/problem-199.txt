I am not sure,  but possibly Windows Shared Folders Offline Availability/BranchCache might let you to do something similar. Some info here - http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755136.aspx
I am looking into the same problem. On a Mac, my idea was to use rsync in combination with a script. The job of the script is to decide which files to sync/cache. Rsync then just executes efficiently on this towards the network share. So if we for example want a 5GB cache, removing least recently used, we'd need to program a script that outputs a file list corresponding to the "5GB most recently used files", and have rsync sync it locally and deleting any files in the cache that is no longer in that list.
I looked into windows offline files, but as far as I could tell this requires manual interaction to disconnect the server or go into offline mode in order to use the cache.
The server would probably be running Linux or freeNAS, the pc runs Windows xp, but could be upgraded to 7 if required.
Ideally I am searching for something that caches writes as well as reads, since only one pc will be accessing the server (and one day of lost changes if the local cache is damaged would be acceptable)
Is there a way to cache frequently acccessed files from the remote storage automatically on the local PC?
(I am not looking for a way to sync whole folders like rsync, but rather something that automatically and transparently caches the last accessed 50 gb of files.)
