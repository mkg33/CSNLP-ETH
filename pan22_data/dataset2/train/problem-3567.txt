Chrome and IE have "private" browsing modes that don't keep or send any cookies outside individual sessions.  Depending on what you're trying to do that might be good enough.
Then you should untick the Don't ask at startup box, then the Profile Manager will appear every time you run Firefox, allowing you to select the profile you need everytime it starts.
If you are using Firefox (I assume you are since you mention it) you could just set up different profiles. Each profile has it's own set of cookies, plugins, configuration, etc.
In Google Chrome, incognito windows and non-incognito windows have separate sets of cookies. However, incognito windows have other side effects, and all incognito windows share the same sets of cookies (so you're limited to two identities in a single browser instance). Chrome also has a Swap My Cookies extension which is similar to Firefox's CookieSwap.
If you want to run a single instance of Firefox, you may be interested in the CookieSwap extension. In summary, it's a workaround, and the author considers what you want to be difficult to achieve.
If you are using IE8 google "Frame Merging".  There's a command line switch and / or a registry fix that will allow you to have separate cookies for separate instances.
I'm not sure you can run two instances at the same time on different profiles, but you haven't made it clear if that is also required.
First you need to access the Profile Manager by running firefox.exe -profilemanager, from here you can create any number of new profiles and rename those you already have.
you can run two instance of firefox at the same time with "firefox -P -no-remote". each instance will have a different profile folder and so will not use the same cookies.
