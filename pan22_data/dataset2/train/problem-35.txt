Well, if you just need to read these files you can use Batch PNG to JPG to flatten them. It includes a Preview which allows you to actually look at the PNGs if that's just what you want. But if it is animated it will only export the first frame.
The only programs I've seen apart from Fireworks that preserved those PNG layers were Freehand and Flash (both are ex-Macromedia).  The last time I did that was a few years ago so I'm not even sure if the current versions retain that capability.
Meanwhile I noticed you came from Stackoverflow.com. If you need to programmatically access this format, you will need a patch for libpng that gives you support for APNG. It's an excellent (albeit, slightly non-standard) addition to libpng if you need it. It's after all what all the above applications use. ;)
Looks like you can still get the creative cloud to download fireworks cs6 here https://creative.adobe.com/products/download/fireworks.
If that's not an option, my only advice is to download a trial version of Adobe Fireworks (registration required) to convert these photos.
PNG files do not have layers, so Fireworks layers are stored in the private chunks of the PNG files in a proprietary format which is not PNG. I don't know of any program that can read them. You'll need to ask the owner of these photos to convert them to flattened png (mono-layer) or into another multi-layered format such as psd.
