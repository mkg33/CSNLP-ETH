BIOS passwords only prevent people from being able to access the BIOS and change settings.  Such a feature is only really used in enterprise environments, mostly to keep "users" from accessing settings that they have no idea what they are doing with and changing things, such as boot devices or boot order, and then creating a service call.
That option tells the bios to modify and work with the windows bootloader to ask you a password before continuing to load the os any further.
Don't use it.  It doesn't provide any form of security. Some BIOS have a feature that requires someone to enter a password before the system will boot up, which may be the case with your system, however no BIOS provides data encryption, thus to retrieve all of the data on your computer, it's as simple as popping your drive out and reading it in an external device, or booting from a liveCD or bootable USB disk. You need a disk encryption product, such as Truecrypt or Bitlocker if you want to keep your data secure.
