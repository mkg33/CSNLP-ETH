gives you a UTF-8 file.  Other valid (but untested) encodings that Out-File supports are: [[-Encoding] {unknown | string | unicode | bigendianunicode | utf8 | utf7 | utf32 | ascii | default | oem}].  You can also pipe stuff to Out-File to give the file some text data to store, and also an -append flag.  For example:
If you are unsure about what encoding you have, I've found VS-Code has a nifty feature where at the bottom right hand corner it says what the encoding is.  I think Notepad++ also has a similar feature.
The zero is filesize in bytes, so this is also useful to create large file (they will not be useful for testing compression since they do not contain actual data and will compress down to pretty much nothing)
Here is a version that creates a new file if it does not exist or updates the timestamp if it does exist.
However, the other common use of touch is to update the file's timestamp. If you try to use my sc example that way, it will erase the contents of the file.
