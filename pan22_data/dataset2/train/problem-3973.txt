No, external speakers only use the signal provided by the computer's audio output. If the speakers have problems, it's highly unlikely they are generating any voltage on the  computer's sound card's output that would cause damage. About the odd speaker noise, try to isolate if it's actually a noise being generated by the sound card or speakers. Use some headphones to do this.
I did experience one case where a set of speakers with a poorly-designed "wall wart" caused an overheating situation that nearly melted down the speaker wire.  The "wall wart" grounded one side (the "wrong" side) of the DC power wire, and this created a large ground current through the speaker wire.
It's also possible that a "dead short" on the audio port could damage the computer's internal circuitry, though a well-designed computer would protect itself from this.
Check in the sound control panel that the rear speakers are enabled. Windows 7 might have turned that jack off.
For the spark, it sounds like a blown circuit breaker. If you lost power to the pc, tha would probably cause that disk error thee next boot, as the power loss probably corrupted that file (that was then repaired). Sparks at plugs aren't a good thing. That's more a concern then any thing else.
Active ones, its possible - you have higher voltages involved, a seperate power supply, and if somehow, there is a short between power and signal, or a surge through the speaker power supply and you have your power output somehow going out the signal input, it sounds like a recipe for very bad things.
In theory a malfunctioning active speaker could put enough voltage on the center pin of a speaker wire to damage the computer audio port.
But to convince yourself that any computer problems are unrelated to the speakers and previous problems, try using headphones for awhile and compare observations.
