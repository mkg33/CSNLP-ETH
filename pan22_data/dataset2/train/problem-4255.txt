The example below shows a snippet of my client (OS X) configuration ~/.ssh/config What is commented out are the exact recommendations from the guidelines noted above. Most of those didn't work. What does work are the ones not commented. 
My first question is how can I get these supported on the client side (OS X). Do I need to compile it myself? The version noted below is the most recent homebrew version. It seems recent enough. 
My next question is more ssh specific: Where do these HostKey Algos and ciphers come from? Is there a command I can run to see what's available? 'ssh -Q [cipher|mac] doesn't work with this client. 
I'm having a difficult time understanding why the HostKeyAlgorithms and Ciphers don't work with my OS X ssh to my sshd server configured following the guidelines mentioned above. 
I'm working on some ssh hardening in our environment. I've been following these guidelines. I'm not a crypto wizard but I generally understand my way around OS X, Linux, and UNIX based services.
