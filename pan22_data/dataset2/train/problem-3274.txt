A complete reference of environment variables can be found here, on the microsoft site, it can also be found in a registry key.
Several other answers and comments on this page have made reference to using "reg query". Below is the correct implementation that takes into account spaces in the path, as well as different versions of Windows:
(With three tokens, by declaring %%A in the FOR statement, %%B and %%C will be declared implicitly. In the same way, by declaring %%X in the FOR statement, %%Y and %%Z will be declared implicitly.)
Note: Using the asterisk in the tokens= option is important for Windows XP, which usually contains spaces in the path for My Documents.
The linked article gives the exact ordering of the variables that will be declared implicitly, but it is essentially alphabetic.
Note: If using implicit variables like %%B and %%C seems a little strange, you may have a look at this article:
The first variable is declared in the FOR statement and subsequent variables will be implicitly declared via the tokens= option.
For all who, like me, stumble upon this post while searching for a way to simply get the users documents folder, having next to zero experience about batch files, but want to use the great solution by Werkkrew or (probably?) the derived version by user55644, that's how I made it working on my windows 7 Pc:
This does not take into account localization or internationalization. This has not been tested on non-English versions of Windows. Comments on that topic are welcome.
In the event the My Documents folder is not in the standard location, pulling the information out the registry key is probably the most reliable way.
That'll be the place that the system knows about (although it's My Documents in XP), however you'll have to judge for yourself whether or not that's a safe assumption for your environment.  If you use My Documents redirection, though, that variable should be set to whatever you redirect to with the default set to c:\documents and settings[username] in XP or c:\users[username] in Vista.
