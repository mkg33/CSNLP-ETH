I experimented by turning the SSID broadcast on, and then immediately my computer could connect with no issue. But when I subsequently (manually) disconnected my computer, disabled SSID broadcasting on the router, and then tried to reconnect with the computer, I run into trouble.
As you can see I end up in a real-life infinite loop. It's telling me "the network already exists," but it's nowhere to be found in the list of existing networks. What do I do?
I am having trouble getting connected to my Linksys wireless router. I have it set up with a specific SSID -- which it is not broadcasting -- and wireless security turned off. I'm sure you could lecture me about how this is bad practice, but I'm not interested in that; I need to know how to get this working.
Wait... I feel silly; I just figured it out. I need to click "Manage wireless networks" on the left in the Network and Sharing Center, locate my old profile, and click "Remove." After doing that, the steps I described above worked like a charm.
