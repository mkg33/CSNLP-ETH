It sounds like your repo has been corrupted.  The easiest thing to do would be to recover your repo from a backup or re-clone the repo from the original source (assuming you didn't have tons of work in the repo).
If that file was corrupted and full of NULL characters Edit that file and put the sha1 of the latest commit from .git/logs/HEAD or the one before the last commit.
If resotring/cloning is not an option I would recommend reading through Pro Git (free online book or the paper version).  The whole book is very informative, but especially take a look at the last chapter to get an understanding of how Git works internally.  Once you have an understanding of how Git works, take a look at Linus' instructions on recovering corrupted objects.
If .git/HEAD exists and its content is ref: refs/heads/master then checks the file refs/heads/master it must contains the sha1 of the last commit.
