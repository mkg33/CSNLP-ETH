So, at each spawn check (end of period e), take one sample from the resulting distribution, and you have the total number to spawn.
The number of spawns will be distributed as a binomial, the sum of the Bernoulli RVs of your spawn windows.
With this, you take into account that the dt can be smaller than what it was with a fixed timestep, and you can also handle larger dt. 
If each engine step is, say, 1/30 of a second and I have some event occur with a 0.001 probability each step, how do I translate this to an engine with a variable time step? At the end of 1 second I could have nothing spawned or (in a very unlikely event) I could have as many as 30 spawned.
E.g., say for a window w of some number of ticks per spawn opportunity, and an elapsed ticks e since last check, with Bernoulli probability of p per spawn window, the number of spawns will be distributed as 
Now if the engine hasn't done an update for a full second, how can my spawner simulate the same behaviour and probabilites? What if my steps are much smaller, say 1/100 or 1/1000 of a second?
