This error is a bit misleading, it (usually) refers to a problem with the virtual devices you've assigned to the machine.
Are you trying to do some kind of hot copy, or are you shutting down the VMs before taking the image?
Are you just trying to move the VM from one server to the other to have them run on a different server? I would look at just copying the VM's configuration and drive files over with the storage managing utility (maybe using a shared storage directory as an in-between). It'll take awhile, especially if the files are large, but then you can just tell the new server to create VM's based on those drive files (pre-existing). As long as the versions are matched, this should work just fine.
I think the converter may work best on machines that are shutdown, so it isn't having to snapshot memroy etc.  Also, check any snapshots you might have of those VMs.  That may make the process more complex.  It is possible that converting to VMWare Server is working as it isn't trying to convert any ESXi specific features.
Why not export the VM's as virtual appliances on the source host and import them on the destination host? That's the way I move VM's around and it works like a charm. (Of course I'm a complete VMware neophyte).
When you run through the converter wizard, how far are you getting before it fails? I suspect you've got all the way through the wizard, can inspect the source, can browse the target, and are back at the job screen when it tanks?
Check the devices you have assigned to the virtual machine, and remove everything but the bare min. Check that your defined VLAN networks are available on both ESXi machines and are labelled the same.
