I remember a previous option where you could download a zip file containing everything you need to run 7-zip.
After unpacking 7za920.zip you can extract 7z1801-x64.exe from the command line with 7za x -o7zip 7z1801-x64.exe
For the 7zip program, the >instructions say that you still have to "install" it once to extract the program parts and set the configuration file how you want, but that the resulting executable (and its config file) can then be redistributed as it is
I guess you want the "portable" version of the program, that is one that can even be executed once burned on a CD. You can find many of them at the portable apps site.
After that, you just copy (or archive) everything from that directory, which can be used as a "standalone" archiver. Thing you'll lose from that are system integration features like the right-click menu items and file type association.
First go to http://www.7-zip.org/download.html and download the exe for the latest version (http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1801-x64.exe). Also you should download the command line version of 7zip 9.2 which you can get as a zip (http://www.7-zip.org/a/7za920.zip).
Now all the download page has is executable files, msi (Microsoft installer framework for Windows), and .7z packages of extras.
So you want to avoid having to install it? Luckily the installer exe is just a 7z file bundled with an unpacker so you can just extract it.
