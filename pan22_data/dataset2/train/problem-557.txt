Your 32-bit, 33Mhz PCI bus can transit a maximum of 1,067 megabits per second (Mbps) or 133.33 megabytes per second (MBps).
So although you card should be able to fully saturate the line you'll actually only ever get about 90% utilisation because of various overheads.

80 MB / second is actually pretty good!  That's about 640mbps, which is pretty darn close to the gigabit capacity of the NIC.  If you take into consideration the TCPIP overhead, and disk speed you're probably at your maximum speed.
The bottleneck is probably somewhere else unless you have another card using bandwidth on the bus.  
How sure are you that it is the card that is the bottleneck?  It might be that is the best speed it can negotiate with the device on the other end so it is stuck waiting.  The other device might be stuck running at 10/100 speeds so 80 would be about right with a bit of overhead.
Gigabit ethernet is just over 1 billion bits per second.  With 8/10 encoding this gives you a maximum of around 100MB per second.  A 32 bit PCI bus should be able to put 133MB/sec through and you should be able to saturate it (I can demonstrate saturation of a PCI bus with a fibre channel card and get a figure close to the theoretical bandwidth of the bus), so it is unlikely to be the cause of the bottleneck unless there is other bus traffic.
Either way if you're getting 80 megabytes per second (MBps) then you're not far off and I would be reasonably happy with that for now.
