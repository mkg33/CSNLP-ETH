Since there is little information (and a lot of confusing one) I need a clarification for Raspberry Pi 2, Model B.
Unfortunately - it is not possible to archive such a speed with RPi. From my experience (I made some add-on cards /intentionally I do not call them HATs, as RPi foundation specification of the HAT is extremely limiting for more complex and intelligent add-ons/ for RPi), about 30MHz is the maximum reliable speed. 
There may be possible to enable the 2'nd SPI module and pins are accessible to 40 pin header of the board.
I am NOT speaking to enable the 2'nd CS (chip select) of first SPI module, just need two separate SPI peripherals, each one with it's own
But you can actually work it around by using another micro. This "middle" micro will communicate with your peripheral devices and transfer the results back to RPi. I afraid there is no other way. Most of my add-ons now have their own uC (this ones STM32F3):
Also, from your experience, seems that SPI modules are clocked from APB clock with a 16 bit divisor. Now there is possible to divide with 5 for example? Or should be 2's power only.
From little information available, the BCM2836 has several SPI peripherals but I am not clear if for RPI 2B there are accessible both in the same time.
You can use both SPI interfaces - and it is easy to configure only changing the config.txt file. The second SPI can have 3 CS lines.
