I have a Linksys WRT1900ACS V1 with DD-WRT installed and want to choose the optimal WiFi channels since we just moved. I'm using both the 2.4 GHz and the 5 GHz networks (the 2.4 GHz is mostly for our visitors, we use the 5 GHz one when supported) and I have Net Analyzer installed on my Android phone.
Now, I'd like to know if I chose wisely or not. The general rule of thumb according to what I've read on choosing a good WiFi channel would be to use channels 1, 6 or 11 since they don't overlap. However, looking at everyone else, they're ONLY on these channels already. Is it better for me to be on the same channel as them (in this case channel 1 seems to be the best) to avoid overlapping with those on channels 6, or is it better for me to stay on channel 4 because there is nobody there? As for the 5 GHz one, it seems easier to avoid any interference, however I'm not sure if I should stay as close as possible to the others or go the furthest away possible (something like channel 108). Any help would be appreciated.
