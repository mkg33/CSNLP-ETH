Thunderbird with the Lightning extension. I use this combination via DavMail gateway to get seamless access to Exchange. Works perfectly (and is much better/faster than Outlook 2007).
I was in the exact same boat. You've certainly found that Linux is a viable OS but you will run into snags when trying to connect to Exchange.  Evolution will be your best bet but I don't think you'll be incredibly happy.  Running Windows/Outlook on a virtual machine is a viable solution but it's a bit of a pain when you need to open links or attachments and want to do it on the Linux side.  I ran an XP virtual machine on VMWare for a few incarnations of Ubuntu but recently rebuilt with Win7 RC1.  Definitely play with it and see what suits you, but I found that it's best to play with Linux on the servers until I find a better challenger to Outlook.
It appears that they are also working on an EWS-based plugin that will replace this MAPI plugin for the future:
Is there something wrong with the calendaring support in OWA (besides the poor support for shared calendars)? It should work fine with Firefox in Exchange 2007.
Get your Exchange admins to upgrade to Exchange 2010.  The web client is actually usable in Firefox, in fact it's almost identical to the experience in IE.
Apparently Evolution has improved their Exchange support.  Check out the newer versions of Evolution and their exchange-mapi plugin.  It didn't use to work for me, but I just tried it in Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 2 and it worked!
I've been looking for something like this for awhile.  My office has been on Exchange 2010 and I've been just barely managing with IMAP.  Today I Googled around again and gave it another try.
