I dont think it is any of the other answers so far. I would have agreed with Randolf's answer if it weren't for you saying that OTHER PC's don't experience this problem. If the VM's were registering the public IP's then all PC's would report back the public IP's
You prob also have two DNS servers set in the TCP/IP properties for this machine. one is internal and the other is external. This means (in combination with the domains being the same name) sometimes it will query your internal DNS server and sometimes the external DNS server. This will resolve different IP addresses and is typical of this behavour.
When you ping by name what name do you use? I suspect you are using the same internal DNS name as your external DNS name, something like company.com and not company.local?
Also this next bit is very important...When you ping it in the command prompt what you actually type sometimes is different to what actually it says it pings. Here is an example.
This is important for reasons I won't go into yet. Just tell me what you ping and what it says IT ACTUALLY DID ping.
