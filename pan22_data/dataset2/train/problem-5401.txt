I would agree with the others on the SD card.  Sometimes the cheapo SD cards will give you issues - I'd suggest formatting the card before flashing the image, try this:  https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/
You've already indicated that you've tried different power supplies, to no avail, but have you attempted running the board with a different (known working) SD card? If you've ruled that out, I would also look at power load. Are you running any USB devices on this board that aren't on the other boards? If not, it's most likely your board, which does happen, although rarely. I would contact Element14 for a replacement.
The problem turned out to be an apparently troublesome SD card slot. Every time the slot gets too warm the card apparently looses contact and the system stalls. A few months after asking the question I've moved the OS to a hard disk and left only the boot partition on the card. I didn't do this to solve the problem but only to figure out if it was possible to move the OS at all. Since then I've never experienced a problem with this particular board again.
