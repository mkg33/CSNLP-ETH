Please mind that answering this kind of questions is difficult without all the information, but I hope this gives you some guidance.
Since directory listing work, ths excludes the common case where all data connections are blocked by firewall or NAT device.
It looks like only outgoing connections to ports under 20000 are allowed. Make sure outgoing on the client and incoming on the server is allowed in the entire PASV range of the FTP server. If you can't find the range there, 1024-65535 should work.
That's the IP address of the VPS plus two more numbers, let's call them p1 and p2. These numbers are telling you the port where you should be connecting to, by following the formula "port=(p1*256)+p2". Based on that I'd recommend you to get simultaneous network captures on your computer and the VPS to see where the issue is. If you see the connection on the passive port initiated from your computer but not reaching the VPS, then the problem may be on your local network (as you said there's no firewall in front of your VPS). If the packets get to the server but it doesn't reply, the problem may be on your FTP setup on the server.
Directory listing and file transfer use the same basic mechanism, that is both open a data connection and transfer data. In your case the clients opens a connection to the address specified by the server within the response to the PASV command.
Apart from that I recommend to use SFTP (file transfer over SSH) instead because it is more secure (encrypted login) and  causes less trouble (only a single connection, no extra data connections).
