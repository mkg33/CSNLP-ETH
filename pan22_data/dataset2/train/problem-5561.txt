I'm known as a hater of RPM/Yum based OS, just because i think their lacking of decent package repositories (at least for recent software).
While in Debian/Ubuntu, there are a lot of good repositories with recent packages. I'm not  "bleeding edge" admin (for that i could use Gentoo) i just don't like being forced to install things from source or trust any random RPM found on the web.
Tread lightly with Dag repos in CentOS. Normally, they're quite okay. But every so often we've had trouble rolling back when things don't play nice.
There are also lots of not so active / small repos for some specific applicationss. You could try digging thru opensuse build farms or just google with two keywords like:
I know any decent sysadmin should be able to maintain is own repositories, but since I'm mainly a programmer i like to leave this work to a 3rd party.
rpmfusion.org is a very good repo for Fedora. RPM Fusion is a merger of Dribble, Freshrpms, and Livna.
Centos has a few repos of its own; RedHat sponsors Epel which contains a limited, but high quality number of Fedora packages ported to RHEL.
