Click File > Info > Account Settings > Data Files, select an email account and "Set as Default" then select Outlook Data File and select "Remove"
I use Outlook 2010 to connect to two different gmail hosted email accounts, but do not use the default Outlook account. Is there a way for me to delete the 'Outlook Data File'? Nothing will ever be delivered to that folder, so why would I want it to show up in my list of folders? It says I need to select another as my default delivery, but neither of my IMAP'd gmail account will allow me to do this.
According to the above, and since gmail does absolutely not use Exchange Server, the answer to your question is unfortunately negative.
If it bothers you that the default account is still there, the following text from the same source explains how to set the gmail account as the default :
Outlook Data Files is set as the default. You have to make your email account the default. I have two Gmail and Hotmail accounts set up. After setting my email account as default, remove the Outlook Data File.
delete the Outlook folder which is the default microsoft folder rename your email folder which will say whatever@gmail.com...blahblahblah rename that to Outlook and your done make sure its spelled identically to the one you deleted.
