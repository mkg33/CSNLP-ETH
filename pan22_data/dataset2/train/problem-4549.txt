Are you sure it's the speakers themselves and not the computer's sound output?  I've been finding that since sound has been included on motherboards (instead of requiring add-on boards) that this is common occurrance.  For whatever reason, it seems that on-board sound picks up a LOT of interference and sends it out the speakers/headphones.  Especially if you've got the cpu set to be able to idle down to less than full speed.
In addition, it may improve your audio sound quality. When everything is set at or near 100%, a form of distortion called clipping occurs. This is when the tops and bottoms of sine-like waves get cut off flat, because they exceed the capacity of the amplifier (or sensitivity of the pre-amp inputs, etc). The result looks more like a square wave than a sine wave and sounds more like a square wave, too.
As the comments say, it's in all likelihood normal electrical interference. It's quite common in unshielded audio/speaker cables. 
Why does this work? Amplifiers amplify, and when there is no useful sound to amplify, they will amplify noise. By turning down the sensitivity of their inputs and the volume of their outputs a bit, you'll cut the noise a lot.
Another thing you can try is to update any audio drivers you have, there is a small chance this could help.
Try moving the speakers/woofer around a bit, hopefully you'll find a place that minimizes the interference.
