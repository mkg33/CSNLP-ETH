Which of the four checkboxes (and the dropdown box) do I check at the minimum as a tradeoff for less powerful machines?  Please presume I've done everything to everything else to "speed it up". Sorry, the Microsoft site is short of information on what these checkboxes mean or do.
I suggest that you check what other background applications are running, including other anti-malware applications, software updaters (Google and Adobe are bad about this), and unnecessary running services. If you're not using MSN Live Messenger then shut that down, as well as the printer monitoring service and other junk running in the system tray. Shut down bit torrent clients, ActiceSync, iTunes, and other unused applications.
How much memory are we dealing with here? Have your checked the minimum recommended hardware for the applications that you are using?
If I check all the following boxes in an old computer or one with minimal memory, the computer becomes slow or unresponsive while doing basic tasks such as playing music, opening documents and visiting basic websites.
