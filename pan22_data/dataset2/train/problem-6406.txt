If you're trying to launch a GUI terminal, say gnome-terminal you may be expecting the shell to read your bash startup files. However, this doesn't happen on Ubuntu and maybe other systems by default.
The logic behind the below trick -> On Ubuntu, /bin/sh is dash. You can switch your system to using bash. On Ubuntu, /bin/sh is a symbolic link to dash. You can make it a symbolic link to bash instead.To change it, run
The way I've fixed it on Ubuntu is to edit the gnome-terminal preferences, and set the startup command to be bash -l.  -l is short for --login.  This tells bash to startup as as login shell, which causes it to load the startup scripts as you get when logging in via ssh.
I have a .bash_profile in my home directory, but it isn't getting run on login. If I do the following, then things seem to be as I expect:
If you somehow don't see your username in the /etc/passwd file [this is the case when your system is under control of some other domain e.g. in IT companies]
To make any shell your default, first verify it is installed and recognized on your computer by looking at the contents of /etc/shells:
I'm sure there's a good rationale for this being the way it is, but I found it surprising and a more than a bit annoying as I share the same profiles across linux, cywgin and macos systems.
Bash executes .bash_profile only for login sessions. .bashrc is executed for all bash sessions, not only login sessions. Try sourcing .bash_profile from .bashrc (avoid circular dependency!) or configuring your terminal program to run /bin/bash -l as a shell program.
There's not enough information in your question for me to say for sure, but I've hit the same problem before.  Assuming you've already get /bin/bash set in your password entry, it may be the way your terminal launches.
