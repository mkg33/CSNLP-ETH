You can correctly store the 15 most significant digits of an integer in Excel (my version is Excel 2010).
When you don't need to calculate with these numbers, you can treat them as text, see the other answers.
For example, instead of passing just the barcode, I was passing ="barcode" so that excel interprets as a string a shows the whole number without any other characters as in the ' solution. This way you can copy and paste the number easily.
If you enter 999,999,999,999,999 in a cell and add 1 to it in the cell below it correctly shows 1,000,000,000,000,000, but try to add another 1 and you get 1,000,000,000,000,000 again. 
When you need to calculate with them, then it becomes difficult because Excel has only 15 siginificant digits. The possibilities I know are:
I had the same issue with barcodes that I was pulling from a database, the solution that worked best for me is to pass the number to excel as a formula that displays text. 
2) Use FORMULA>TEXT>CONCATENATE to combine the columns into one column and you should get your desired result.
In any case that you need to do so for running numbers like serial numbers for example, seperate the numbers and run them down in GENERAL format first, then combine.
