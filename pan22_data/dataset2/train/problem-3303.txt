How exactly to do this from application space I am not sure, but the free USB Device Tree Viewer (by Uwe Sieber) can set the port VBUS off and on using pop-up option "Restart Device". Keep in mind that a USB port usually have a sizable capacitor attached, so it might take some time to bleed the VBUS, so the Clear and Set command must be properly apart in time. Unfortunately, the USBTreeView does it too fast. Alternatively, you can restart the entire hub, it takes long enough time to turn VBUS off on its downstream ports.
One solution to toggle the VBUS power by software would be to use a USB hub with switchable port power controllers (These are usually difficult to find, but still easier than to find a PC mainboard with port power controllers). Then you should manage to issue ClearPortFeature(PORT_POWER) to the port with connected IRTOY, and then SetPortFeature(PORT_POWER). 
If Uwe doesn't have his source code open, you will need to go to Microsoft SDK for main USBView source code, and figure out how to issue the port disable/enable commands to driver. 
Apparently the IRTOY has a bug, and needs total reboot, and the power-off is the only means to do this. Bad.
