I work for OpenStack and am happy to provide you some guidance on service providers implementing it.
Regarding Compute, this is actually not yet implemented at Rackspace (or anywhere else), as the code is still being written.  We are going through the process of merging the best of NASA's Nebula cloud code with Rackspace Cloud Servers, and the first release of that code is scheduled for October 21st.  It will be some number of months after that before you will see service providers put it into production, including Rackspace.
First, it's important to note that there are two OpenStack projects:  Compute and Object Storage.  It sounds like you are looking for Compute, but FWIW on the Object Storage side Rackspace is currently running this code as "Rackspace Cloud Files".  We expect other service providers to implement Object Storage in the coming months.
I hope this answers your question.  Fee free to follow me on twitter @sparkycollier as well as the project @openstack and also keep up with the latest on the blog openstack.org/blog
