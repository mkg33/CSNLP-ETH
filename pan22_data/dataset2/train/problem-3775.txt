You are correct about adapter type. "Nat" is creating a different network & adapter for each VM. You need to switch the VMs' adapter types to NatNetwork or Internal networking or Bridged Networking. But certainly just "Nat" is not proper type of adapter.
The host is an OSX machine and again, all images are running on the host. I suspect I have not selected the correct adapter type for one or both of them. 
from an elevated command prompt, I get a message indicating the DNS server is incorrect or does not exist.
A second image, also hosting Windows Server 2008 R2, is up on the host. It too has a default adapter type of NAT. I would like this image to use the DC as its primary DNS server. It's address is 10.10.10.20. However, when I try to set the DNS to .10 using
I have created a reverse lookup zone of 10.10.10.x. Its adapter address is 10.10.10.10. In Virtualbox, I have left the default adapter settings for the machine alone; it defaulted to NAT.
I am attempting to set up a set of VMs on Virtualbox and have configured one as a DC running Windows Server 2008 R2, and it's intended to function as a primary DNS server.
