Also, if I am not wrong, VPNs not only protect against unauthorized accesses, but they also encrypt all the traffic (stopping sniffers) and authenticate connections (blocking DNS poisoning attacks etc).
I was thinking, thus, if it was possible to protect the connection in some way. We connect to those devices from all over the world, using different IPs and different kind of connections (cellular data, WiFi, etc), so a simple firewall accepting connections only from a specific range of IP addresses will not work. Additionally, we connect using different kind of devices: from laptop computers (all using Mac OSX) to mobile phones (iOS and Android).
If the VPN was the best option, then, how can I set it up? I would rather not use any software that runs on PC, as we do not have PCs running 24/7 and a software solution requires more maintenance and the PC uses (generally) more power.
In our office (and in our home too) we have some security equipment connected to the Internet, like ip cameras. However, we are not satisfied by their level of security: the only protection the DVR has is a 4-digit numeric password that is sent in plaintext.
