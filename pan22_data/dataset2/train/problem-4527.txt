Q1: Previously, I have purchased other Microsoft Certification books and have normally got a PDF version, along with the printed book. Is this not the case anymore? Am I missing a disk or something?
On the page you linked to, it says, "This title is also available for sale with a practice test." You would want to click that link and buy the other version with the practice test if that's important to you.
Q3: Practice tests also used to come with the book, however this does not appear to be the case any longer. Is this by design? Or am I just missing something here?
On the page you linked to, there were 3 options: book, ebook, and book + ebook. You would need to buy the book + ebook option if you wanted both.
Q2: The book has many URLS for supporting resources, however, these don't appear to be valid any longer. For example, early on within the book, there is a URL given for a list of useful links which accompany the book, I cannot find these online at all.
Yeah, typical problem with dead tree printed versions of the internet: the links are often out of date. You can try using the Wayback Machine at archive.org to see if they've been archived.
when buying books from microsoft press, you can select what option to purchase (printed book / ebook / printed + ebook). The prices are different.
