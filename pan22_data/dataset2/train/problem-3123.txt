You can simply force redirection on default web site to - https://owa.domain.com/owa and remove "require SSL" in SSL Settings.
The old trick to just redirect the Default Web Site or the iisstart.htm redirect only works with https://webmail.domain.com (note that we need to specifiy https). Using only http:// will end up in a 403 Forbidden page for IIS.
I'm trying to set up an automatic redirect from http://webmail.domain.com to https://webmail.domain.com/owa of our Exchange Server 2013 CU1 using the IIS interface.
I like to require SSL and bounce the 403.4 error to https://domain/owa on the root and OWA applications.
And don't forget to disable the "Require SSL" option in the Default Web Site on IIS Control Panel or you'll get and 403 Unauthorised error page.
Anyway, just downloaded and installed the IIS Rewrite Mod from here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7435
I was able to solve my own problem using IIS Rewrite Mod. I was little confused when found this, since Rewrite Mod is well know in Unix world with the Apache Web Server.
The question is: how to setup this correctly so our users can connect in webmail.domain.com and it automatically redirects to https://webmail.domain.com/owa
I know, for a fact, that simply redirecting default web page to https://mail.server.net/owa works perfectly fine with exch13.  You must uncheck require ssl, but this is known.  I have had this setup since inception and it works fine.  You do NOT redirect the backend, only the default website.
