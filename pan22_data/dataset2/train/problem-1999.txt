On the Ubuntu system I am currently using, you can find what you want at /var/log/installer. IIRC, the Fedora/RedHat installer also leaves log files somewhere in the installed system (feel free to edit this answer to add their location).
Please list the OS and the best way to find out when it was born and for S&Gs how long yours has made it without being killed by you.
Linux - I'm not sure there is a standard or even reliable  way that will work for all distros, unless the installer of your distros leaves logs.
Getting on over 8 years on a coupla Win2K boxes here too; there's one in particular I strongly suspect will outlive humanity and cockroaches.  Since the advent of automatic updates continuous uptime is a thing of the past, but I've seen uptimes in the order of 600 days before.
For Solaris (since at least version 8), check the install date of the SUNWsolnm package.  It's the package containing the /etc/release file and won't be updated/patched.
You can try stuff like the ctime of the /etc or /root inodes, but they may have changed (though they are less likely to be changed than other dirs)
