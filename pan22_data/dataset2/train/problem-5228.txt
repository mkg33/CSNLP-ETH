Essentially, this is the role ZFS plays by adding zpools, but I think you'd be nuts to run OpenSolaris on a NAS. Hope and pray someone figures out ZFS in userspace or Solaris GPL's the code.
Get a Windows Home Server box. Besides the internal expansion, you can hook up additional drives through USB. It will seemlessly add new storage to the existing shares, so you don't have to worry what data is on which drive.
USB has a notion of "host device" and "guest device". A->B. An external usb drive is B, so it can work, but you can't connect two A devices together, so you need another transport. The obvious choice is the ethernet port, but you'd still need some way of doing volume management. 
Many of the Thecus NAS solutions can be chained together easily - even the cheaper ones such as the N0503.
I am concerned about the redundancy on the NAS. Without it, it can't be used as server storage. I am tended not using NAS but SAN instead. Nowadays, getting a SAN isn't an expensive solution anymore. You can either use cheap solution like Drobo or DIY it using Open Source software.   
Yes the Western Digital NAS boxes can do this. Just plug in an ordinary USB external disk. However I think the new disk is only available as a separate share, you can't extend the internal disks to include the external one.
