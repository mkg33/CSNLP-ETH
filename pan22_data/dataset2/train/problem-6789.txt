I personally rarely use table variables. The lack of statistics (including distribution and density) and cardinality information (all separate considerations) provides less information to the optimizer than an equivalent temporary table. My experience has very much been that table variable plans do not adapt as well to changing circumstances over time.
I only use a table variable when there are special reasons to be sure that it will always be adequate from a query optimization point of view. Only you have enough information about your databases and queries to say whether that is true in your case or not.
A good general rule of thumb is to provide as much information about the data and query task as you can to the optimizer. If there is a key, say so explicitly. It's not as if declaring the key will add much cost (beyond a little keyboard work) in most cases.
Yes it might do. Estimating one row (with the understanding that estimates can be incorrect) is different from knowing that the table contains only unique values. Certain plan space explorations require a key, for example.
