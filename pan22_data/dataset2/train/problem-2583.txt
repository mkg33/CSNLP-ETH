Recently I read this article in LinuxMagazine.com, which describes a special linux distro (ClearOS) exactly for this role. I did not try it yet, but the article was very well written, and may give you an option to consider.
So this is really up to you - you want ease and less complexity - go for SBS, you want to play around, and possibly eventually get the server to perform better than a windows box - go for Linux.
If you ave the time, and especially the knowledge, sure, you can install Linux (why Ubuntu when there's Debian and CentOS available escapes me, but it's your choice).  It will do everything you need, and probably better than windows, but you will still lack the total inter-application integration that ms products provide. 
As much as I hate to say it, but if all the desktops are windows, I'd say you need windows SBS. Very easy and straightforward to install and set up for a SOHO.
Go for ubuntu server. As you are small office, it will suit you . Even if you grow you dont have to worry about spending more money on server 
I really like unix way and linux in particular(in fact, I user Ubuntu on my PC to manage the network). But if you have a small all-windows network, then Windows server is your best choice. The price is not that bad either - you will probably spend more in terms of time figuring out how to setup SAMBA(which is definitely not the most enjoyable OSS to work with)
