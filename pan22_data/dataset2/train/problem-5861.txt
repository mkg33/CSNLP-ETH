This doesn't work on the main chrome theme site cause they have some weird re-direct thing going on but if you right-click on the link and click save-as, you should be able to save the .crx file itself rather than running it.
The default profile number is 1, but yours may be different depending how many profiles you have and which one you want to access. 
Once in there, the hard part begins if you have a lot of apps. Open each folder and/or sub folder and just look for some image files. It is the easiest way to tell what app the folder is for because you will see some icon images or .png images.
The name of the theme inside of your AppData\Local folder is in the URL from the chrome web store. For example :https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/robot-theme-inspired-by-a/oeljdmeofcikjblcoehpmdnooimalbmj
I Found its easier to create a folder called themes in my bookmarks and save the page there so when ever i feel like a change i just go into the said folder an choose one ive previously saved.
For Windows 7, go to the file path mentioned before ==>  C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions
I opened up a folder called "mgihmkgobaljfehcadcckdggpeojaadh" and a sub folder called "images" and right away saw my theme picture. Somewhere in that main folder ("mgihmkgobaljfehcadcckdggpeojaadh") for the app is a file called "manifest.json". Open it with notepad, but don't change anything in there. Look for "name": "(your theme name here)", (it is usually on line 4) and you will see the name of your theme! Mine was "name": "Into The Mist",
