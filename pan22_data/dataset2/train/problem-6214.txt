Are you sure you need three distinct networks? That requirement takes you out of the $200 SOHO router category and forces you to choose between running PC hardware with multiple network cards (with the corresponding MTBF, heat, space, and power usage issues), and "serious" routers which are expensive and don't have pretty GUI interfaces that "just work" as soon as you plug them in. 
I agree with the commenter who said your requirements seem contradictory - it seems unusual that you have a configuration that requires three distinct networks and static routing but there's no network admin around who's comfortable with a CLI and with their own preferences about hardware.
If you want to run on PC hardware, you might look at pfSense or m0n0wall. Actually, if you're accustomed to Vyatta and it has otherwise worked out well for you, you could just buy dedicated PC hardware to run it and avoid the problems you're experiencing with the virtual setup.
On the other hand, Vyatta in a Windows-hosted virtual machine is a pretty unusual router setup, too, so you're already operating in a relatively idiosyncratic environment. No offense intended, it sounds like it (sort of) gets the job done, which is what counts.
