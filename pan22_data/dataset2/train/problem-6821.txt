Without resorting to architectural changes, we've used portable air conditioners in addition to large fans for times when we were doing structural work (like swapping out UPS systems). 
Make sure you've got the hot and cold aisles right with the air flow configured properly. It'll help the servers a lot if you haven't done that. 
Of course there was really good airflow in and out of the room, so I guess it's an exceptional case.
I was working with a company whose server room was on the first floor in a very well ventilated corner of a building, and they kept complaining about the server room getting too hot despite the air-conditioning.
I know it sounds obvious, but I've seen numerous servers left on for no reason, or because people weren't sure they were being used!
Turned out that opening the window dropped the temperatures to below 25C for most of the year, and below 20C most of the winter.
To add to the advice of "Turn unneeded servers off!" is virtualization.  The best way to control heat is to eliminate it.  If multiple server can be consolidated into fewer servers, less power is consumed and less heat is produced.
Portable air-conditioning units where you just hang a heat-exchanger out of a window work well for a short-term solution until you can get something designed-in.
