I currently use Nokia Podcasting program on my Nokia phone which does this automatically for me over wifi.  
I used to use Applian's Replay Radio 7 on my computer, to automatically download podcasts, encode them in my desired format, and transfer them to a folder, mp3 player or CD.  Replay AV is the current product.  Try the trial version and see if it will meet your needs. 
While I run this under Linux (I use a command-line program called hpodder for downloading podcasts) the essential step of two-way synchronizing the downloaded podcasts between the computer and the phone should work independently of platform. Unison seems to be available for Windows, and I am sure there are other equivalent programs out there.
The product page says it syncs to phones, however I only have experience with iPods. If Media Jukebox works as well for phones as it does for iPods, you will love this software.
Check out doubleTwist by DVD Jon. The basic functionality is free of charge, but they plan to introduce some premium features that you will have to pay for.
Have you tried Winamp? It has a Podcasting service and it can sync with my Nokia N95 (don't know if it does with the E71, but you could give a try)...
