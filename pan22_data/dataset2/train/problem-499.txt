Note: which ever of the above you use to you start a program with a hidden/minimised main window, there is nothing to stop it creating new windows that are visible, or bringing the main window up and into focus, once it is running.
Maybe you had guessed ,I use OmniMarkupPreviewer plugin to preview markdown.I had fixed this bug(or not perfect feature) that it uses different view id  every time.
This result is that it works to avoid to show sublime text window.and it work conflict with sublime text normally opened.
In Vista you should be able to type the name of the exe in your path and have it live after the command prompt is closed.
If you have Microsoft's new new PowerShell installed, then there may be an easier way to do this (I've not worked with PowerShell yet).
It would be a simple exercise to wrap this up in a generic "run this command hidden" script that you could use from the command line.
Where the "0" states that the resulting window should be hidden (for other options, see the documentation at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d5fk67ky(VS.85).aspx) and the "true" states that you want to wait for the command to complete before your script carries on.
If you are happy to have the window minimised then you can do that with the "start" command that other mention. Unfortunately the "/B" option (which sounds like it is what you want) is only for commands and it doesn't stop windowed applications appearing on screen.
HaHa,I successed ,To use sublime text3 as a server of markdown preview is my propose,after I closed sublime text's window,i won't work.
Is there any equivalent in Windows?  I can't seem to figure out a way to do this with the windows version of emacs.
