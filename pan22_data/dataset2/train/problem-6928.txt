Now: I resized Ubuntu partition and on free space, between Main and swap, I made NTFS. I get the ISO, made short USB format, FAT32 Partition, and used WoeUSB for ISO installing on USB. My laptop/BIOS/whatever see the USB stick and it starts the installation process. But after language and keyboard layout menu, and before the main installation part (or maybe at the beggining of the first main installation part) I have this error message. I can't go on with installation.
But it shouldn't change anything. WoeUSB is working for thousands of people, I tried putting USB into USB 2.0 port, error is not with partitions? and I don't think the format type of USB can change anything. But I don't know what the problem is, so maybe some of the things above will abtually change something? I'm out of ideas.
Whatever it did, I can't find this old solution. I don't think, it's same problem, but I'm a little desperate, so would be happy to try this solution if anyone have link to it.
Before: I had Lenovo-Yoga-300-11IBR with Windows 10 already on it. I destroyed hard drive inside, put in new one (old one Crucial_CT240M500SSD1) from old laptop and installed ubuntu 16.04 LTS (didn't have disk or any other way to get Windows back, even serial is not anymore visible under the laptop, I will get it back other way. I hope.) Now I want windows 10 on it again, preferable on dualboot.
p.s.2 Looong time ago, I had same/similar problem with windows 8 (7?). Had to install it on new desktop machine without CD/DVD as dualboot. Had similar (I think there was something about CD/DVD driver, but I'm not sure)/same error message. And I fixed it after few days, by letting some program make changes on the win boot usb stick. It did something to some files so the installation would be possible...
