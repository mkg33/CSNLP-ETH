The deployed folder (in your case "/var/www/vhost/domain.com/httpdocs/") can be the working copy or an "export"ed copy.  If you use the deployed folder as a working folder be sure you secure the .svn folders from being served via HTTP.
I don't quite grasp the concept of a repository, so if I could have a pointer from you guys in the right direction it would help me a lot.

The repository may be created anywhere you like but preferably in a safe place, not /var/www. As hinted by Chris you may (and should) instead checkout a working copy there. I also suggest that you use a separate checkout (maybe in your login directory) for development. 
The working copy is the version you will be editing that contains .svn folders in each subfolder.  This is created by doing a checkout.
Create your repository anywhere else, preferably on a different server that is regularly backed up. Then you make your existing httpdocs into a working copy for that repository, according to these instructions.
