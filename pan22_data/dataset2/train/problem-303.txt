If you need a stable version of the Linux kernel then you should be using one of the stable releases. In the 2.6 series these had a fourth version number. In the 3.0 series it is the third version number.
3.0 is identical to 2.6. Linus simply thought that the numbers were getting too big at 2.6.40 so anything after that point is called 3.0.
Better yet is to let a major distribution do this for you. Redhat Enterprise (and clones like CentOS and Scientific Linux), Ubuntu Server, SUSE or Debian all have stable versions which will have kernels that contain important bugfixes while not including unstable new features.
How long you wait for a kernel to be stable, and what you would classify as stable are different questions. A newer kernel (especially if its provided by your distro) is perfectly stable for 99% of cases.
I personally would have no problem using 3.x on production servers, as long as I had a cluster or failover that could quickly replace any system with a problem. 3.0 is just a new name for 2.6.40. It's no more unstable than any new 2.6 kernel release.
