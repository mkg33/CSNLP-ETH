I've experienced this on a low end SD card where the image would look normal while Windows Photo Viewer rendered the image, but as soon as it finished, instead of grey space, there were colours and distortion all over the image. 
Also - make sure you reformat the card in your camera as it sounds like you have a problem with your SD card.
Sadly, from what I know, you can't really fix this, as the images were saved incorrectly. I'm certain that with a bit of Google-fu, though, you could find something that could perhaps salvage some of your images.
Something about copying it from the phone to the pc caused this for me. When I emailed the photos to myself solved the issue. 
If you have an image editing software like Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, try opening the file in that and make a minor adjustment (nothing that will change the picture drastically).  Then SAVE AS the photo back to the same location, overwriting the original file.  In many cases, it will properly write the data that was missing from the original corrupt file. I had to do this with about 50 photos when I had a bad segment on my camera's SD card.
While kobaltz has the reason down, they didn't specify a source of the problem. Assuming your photos were taken with a digital camera recording on to removable media (SD card, CF card, etc), this photo corruption is caused by a failing or faulty storage media. 
These are most likely JPEG images. I have seen this in rare cases when the image was not fully copied over and left corrupted.
