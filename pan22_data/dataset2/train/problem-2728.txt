To see this done in an extreme way, check out the game "QWOP", where the player is 100% ragdoll and you use key commands to move the legs.  
In any case, it's very CPU intensive and difficult to tune procedural animations which is why you don't see everyone jumping on the bandwagon.
At lest some of the Unreal games use ragdoll figures, but they are only visual, the game mechanics rely on simple physics.
It's hard to underestimate how fantastically sharp our brains our at discerning realistic human behavior and when an animated model steps just outside of that, it's in serious uncanny valley territory. Remember the horror show that was Polar Express?
You can see if there's any information out on "Die By The Sword," which was all procedural animation, and its successor "Draconus."  Also, I believe that "Spore" is all procedural animation.
I worked with an engineer who spent an entire year implementing ragdoll support in a AAA game for when a living character gets knocked down. After all of that, they ended up cutting it completely. It was the right decision: it looked horrendously artificial and shattered your suspension of disbelief.
