The correct way to add a VPN connection to access an Active Directory domain prior to Windows login in Windows 10:
I want to connect to my Active Directory domain through a VPN connection. I am using Windows 10 and connecting using the Windows VPN connection. I understand that in order to do this I must connect to the VPN before authenticating and have followed these steps:
I read somewhere that I needed to enable split tunneling for this to work so I followed these instructions:
This did not resolve the issue. I still do not have a link to connect to the VPN prior to login and I still get the error 87. How do I resolve this?
It says to choose the option to allow other people to use this connection, which is done at the time you create the VPN connection.
If you missed the option to allow other people to use this connection, then you can copy the VPN connection file from your user profile to the shared user profile to make it available to all users:
Please go back and re-read your instructions. It does not say anything about turning on internet connection sharing.
What you show you are trying to do is enable internet connection sharing which is completely unrelated and should not be turned on for the VPN connection.
Where I get hung up is that the VPN connection isn't available at the login screen as shown here (I understand this is via Windows 7 but the idea is the same and the connection should appear):
