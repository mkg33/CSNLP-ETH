@ewwhite right. I'll just explain some thing. When you test your link between two machines, you use only one NIC, LACP will not split packets across multiple interfaces for a single stream/thread. For example a single TCP stream will always send/receive packets on the same NIC. So you could see higher speed only when test with more then one destination. There is good answer, where it described.
But the short explanation is that you'll never achieve more than one connection's throughout with a single source-destination pair. If you need more bandwidth on a single connection, you'll have to move to 10GbE.
Tried all sort of google stuff but can't seem to get it working. And I am out of any ideas. Appreciate if someone can drive me to the correct direction.
I have DL380 server with QLogic Gigabit Ethernet installed. Simply trying to create a bond but can't seem to get throughout more than 1 Gig link.  All 3 cables from 2 servers are connected to S40 switch where I created the LACP (Lag) the link comes up and lag shows active, but I just can't get more than 1 Gig throughput. I am testing with iperf3. Tried all different bonding modes, rr, 802.3d everything but can't just go more than 900 Mbps or so. I am missing something but can't figure out.
