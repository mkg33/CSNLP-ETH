Firstly, I'm unsure if this belongs here or in electrical engineering, but I decided on here incase anyone else has attempted a similar thing. 
I've sorted all the parts from various spares, but I'm struggling to understand how I'm going to power it. The monitor I've salvaged is powered by a kettle lead, but the raspberry pi is just a 5v dc cable I believe. I don't want to have multiple cables running out of this thing, so I'm looking to somehow combine them. My initial thoughts are to use a PC PSU, so there can be a single kettle lead going into the box, and then use the PSU to power the pi, as well as any fans or hard drives that I add, but I have no idea if I can run the monitor through a PSU. To my knowledge, PSUs tend to have 5v and 12v outputs, and the screen will need the full 240. Should I somehow split the kettle lead input as it goes into the box, so that it feeds to the PSU and the monitor separately, or can I run everything through the PSU? 
Apoligies for rambling, I just want to know if this is going to have any chance of working before I start. Also, I know what I'm doing is not efficient and I could just buy a laptop, but it's about the aesthetic and using up parts I have lying around. Thanks for your help. 
I've had a raspberry pi and an old wooden chest lying around for a while, and I've decided to combine the two into a portable emulation device. Somewhere between a build and an art project. I've build towers before so I'm not a total noob, but I have almost no experience with the complex electrical side.
