Make sure your use the correct path to installer file; i.e. http://localhost:port/wp-admin/install.php
I ran into the same problem and  managed to view the details of the error (Error 500) by making some changes at the web.config file. Check the link below for more information.
I fixed the problem..the problem was that there was no config file, (wp-config.php) I remote desktop to the server to see the error and word press showed me a screen telling me. Then it had a button saying create config file..and it worked.
I am lucky becuase I have a dedicated server so I could remote desktop to the site. If you are using shared hosting what you need to do is find away of showing the error, and you will be fine.
There are a number of possible causes for that error. The best thing to do is look at the server logs for more specific information about the error. Contact GoDaddy support for assistance.
I would cancel the account, call up HostMonster (its only 5.95 a month with unlimited access) and they have a "Simple Scripts" control panel that sets up Wordpress for you and you dont need to do a thing.
