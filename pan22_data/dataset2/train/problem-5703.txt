One thing, please check your /etc/passwd for your apache user. I had my shell stupidly set to /bin/bash this is probably safer to be set as /bin/false 
As a precaution I'm changing my ssh port again, I've double checked and I've set PermitRootLogin no in sshd settings so I'm pretty sure they couldn't have gotten in directly as root
I'm hoping that all that happened is that they were able to install these cron jobs through a vulnerability in php/wordpress basically they:
Next thing to do is to rebuild the entire server. It's just a VM and I wanted to automate the configuration anyway using Ansible, but it's still no fun to have to do it in a hurry. But it's the only way to be sure nothing is tampered.
Also if possible ensure that your apache user cannot execute commands like crontab, wget, or curl to stop this from happening again. Those commands seem to be at the core of what they did when they got in.
I was just compromised by this on my server. I can see in my logs that I was being hit on an old wordpress site, and then seconds later they had the cron jobs running over and over. Interesting that I've had this site for quite some time now, and it only happened when I changed over to nginx and php-fpm, is your setup the same?
