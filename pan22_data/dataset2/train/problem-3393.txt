As what will happen when a disk starts to fail (but isn't completely borked) is that the smartarray controller will simply disconnect the whole disk.  You might think this is the correct thing to do, however if the disk is still functional (on other parts of its surface) then it's still useful to have, especially when re-silvering to a new disk. ZFS can still use a failing disk. It has CRC/etc and can manage this for you. The smart array simply disconnects the whole disk and if you're not on something like raidz3 (or don't scrub regularly) then you could be in for a bad experience when resilvering and you find another disk has an issue in a different area (such is the life using HP SAS)
If you simply delete the volume in the RAID BIOS that exposes the disks directly in some versions of the SmartArray controllers. We always use the controller even with things like ZFS.
tl;dr HP Smartarray should not be used for ZFS until it can do passthrough without disconnecting disks that are having problems.  Use a different HBA card that won't interfere if a disk has a problem (let ZFS manage it, it's very good at this)
ZFS is best used where the controller won't disconnect the disks if it sees a problem. Let ZFS manage that itself. Smartarray will disconnect the disk if it sees a read(or any other issue) - this is not ideal for ZFS at all, and can cause you a lot of grief!
This means, avoid smartarray stuff P420, P8*, etc at all costs for ZFS until HP allow direct passthrough without the smartarray disconnecting the disk even if there is an issue.
The other option is to create each disk as a single-disk RAID-0 array (yes, it should let you do this). Then ZFS will see all the indidual disks.
I simply moved the internal SCSI cable from the smart array card to the on board SCSI Controller located on the system board. This gave me access to the raw disks.
