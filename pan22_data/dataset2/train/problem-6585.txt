modulo will now contain your subdirectory number that will be never greater than numberOfSubdirectories you have chosen.
You do have a better solution - use a different filesystem, there are plenty available, many of which are optimised for different tasks. As you pointed out ReiserFS is optimised for handling lots of files in a directory.
I'd suggest deciding how many maximum subdirectories you want to (or can) have in the parent folder.
Generally you want to avoid having directories with a large number of files/directories in it.  Primary reason is that wildcard expansion on the command line, will result in "Too many arguments" errors resulting in much pain when trying to work with these directories.
Go for a solution that makes a deeper but narrower tree, e.g. by creating subfolders like others have described.
We had a similar problem, the solution - as mentioned previously - is to create a hierarchy of directories.
Just be glad you're not stuck with NTFS which is truly abysmal for lots of files in a directory. I'd recommend JFS as a replacement if you don't fancy using the relatively new (but apparently stable) ext4 FS.
Of course if you have a complex application which relies on a flat directory structure, you'll probably need a lot of patching. So it's good to know that there is a workaround, use symlinks which doesn't have the mentioned 32k limit. Then you have plenty of time to fix the app... 
Is the profile image small?  What about putting it in the database with the rest of the profile data?  This might not be the best option for you, but worth considering...
