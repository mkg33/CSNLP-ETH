If you want to automate it even further, I guess you could have the script poll for save dialogs at regular intervals (say every 5s, although I don't know about the possible impact on the system), then have it add the date as required whenever such a dialog is found open.
I know that due to time constraints the "defaultsavename" attribute in microsoft silverlight language is not open to editing though it is on the list of things to do for the developers however if the attribute exists, its probably set on a program by program basis by the coders
That's one way you could possibly accomplish this. As for the script itself, someone far more well-versed in AutoIt coding needs to help, else you can always post on the AutoIt forum.
You could conceivably write an AutoIt script that runs in the background and sets a global hotkey. Then every time you are in a save dialog, you could press the hotkey and have the script get the handle of the dialog and auto-insert the current date in the filename field.
