ARIN, the American Registry for Internet Numbers, assigned IPv4 net block 159.65.0.0/16 to a company called Digital Ocean. Thus, Digital Ocean's authoritative name servers get to answer all inverse (reverse) DNS requests asking for the hostnames associated with IPv4 addresses in that range.
When you send an inverse-DNS request to Digital Ocean's authoritative name servers to ask what hostname is associated with 169.65.158.229, Digital Ocean's DNS servers respond with the string "ubuntu-18.04". This is not forbidden by the DNS protocol, but it is not considered a best practice. The best practice would be to return a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for that host, and for that FQDN to have an "A" (address) record pointing back at that IPv4 address. But for some reason, maybe by mistake, Digital Ocean's servers aren't returning an FQDN for that query. They're just returning the string "ubuntu-18.04".
For some reason, "ubuntu-18.04" is the answer to reverse-DNS queries for that IP address. That's unusual and not best practice, but it's not forbidden by the protocol either.
