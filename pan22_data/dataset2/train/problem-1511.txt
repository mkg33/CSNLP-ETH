After chasing some red herrings in the comments, I'm pretty sure the actual problem has nothing to do with either ProxyJump or the -L tunnel; it's because of sudo. Running sudo ssh runs the ssh command under the root user ID, and hence it will look for .ssh/config under the root account's home directory instead of yours. And ~root/.ssh/config doesn't have an entry for my-server (if it even exists).
HOWEVER, I haven't tested this but I think the IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa entries in your config file will break, because they'll be resolved to root's ~/.ssh directory. You may need to give the explicit path to your home directory instead of the ~ shortcut. Another possibility would be to add -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa to the command line, so that again it'll be expanded by the shell running as you.
You should be able to fix this by adding -F ~/.ssh/config to the ssh options, to tell is to use your config file rather than root's. Note that the ~/ part will be expanded by the shell before it's passed to sudo (and then ssh) as a parameter, so the shell will expand it to your home directory rather than root's.
Also, you're likely to get warnings about unknown hosts etc because you'll be using root's ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.
