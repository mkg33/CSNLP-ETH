There is lots that can be improved here. I won't repeat the great points that others have already made. Some thoughts:
Moreover, textix, hi and work_hi are meaningless names that don't inform me what they are and what they contain. Give them proper names, e.g. instead of hi: greetings or salutations. 
This is the Knuth Shuffle, also called the Fischer-Yates shuffle, and it is very efficient. Can you implement the code from my description? Can you produce an argument that this shuffle is both efficient and unbiased?
I note that some people on StackOverflow will tell you to sort by a new guid rather than by a random number because guids are random. This is a bad idea. Guids are unique; that guids happen to gain their uniqueness through randomness is an implementation detail subject to change. Use guids as a source of uniqueness, not as a source of randomness.
That is: generate a random fraction associated with each element. Produce a sorted sequence -- without modifying the original sequence -- that is sorted by that random element. Then turn that thing into a list and return it.
You should let your class handle more than you are doing now and inside your class divide all tasks properly. I've rewritten it so you will understand:
