But the distance traveled by the sphere is greater than it should, if you wanted to be to be realistic :
This is because the sphere has a zero friction and simply slides along the surface. To correct the problem, add PhysicsMaterial2D to your sphere and set friction value greater than zero:
So my question is : how can I make the angular velocity realistic in this situation? Or am I doing something wrong?
you can see that the radius of the circle is equal to the size of the squares' sides, so the circle circumference should be equal to ~6.28 (in square side size). If the sphere was traveling realistically, it should travel ~1.57 (in square side size) to turn 90°.
On this first image (http://imgur.com/8wBoGms), you can see the sphere in 2D and in its initial position. On this second image (http://imgur.com/ArCRSZn), the sphere was moved by rolling until it made a 90° turn.
I'm trying to make a small 2D game with a rolling ball/sphere using Unity 5.1, but if find the angular velocity of the ball weird.
