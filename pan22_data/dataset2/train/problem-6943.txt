Using this method we are always using the company's own machines for working on.  Also meas I can use any machine I want.  Great if I called out when visiting friends.  I've even used an Internet Cafe.
The set-up we use is terminal services via SSL.  All you need on the client pc is a web browser and Java.  We login via a web page using our DS Gold cards and a pin and the get the option to open a terminal services session to a server.  On the terminal servers we have installed the basic applications we need; MS office, SQL client, putty, various in-house apps, etc.  We can also RDP to our own servers from their or vnc to our own desktops.
I'm only a user, so I don't know the specific set-up. The only clue to what we use is the name of the java applet.  From a google of that it appears we are using software from HOB. Probably HOB WTS Computing and HOB Desktop-on-Demand. 
A new option they have just added for those of us with the new standardised desktops is to instead of choosing to connect to a terminal server we can now connect to our own desktops.  You can even take advantage of having multiple screens at home.
Were I work we are actively encouraged to use our home machines rather than use work laptops.  There must be tens of thousands within our company that take advantage of this and it is a strategic part of our continuity of business plans.
