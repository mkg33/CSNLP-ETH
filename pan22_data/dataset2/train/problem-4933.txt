If you wish to delve further into how ext4 works start with https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Disk_Layout
Your calculation is incorrect, as you added rounded human readable sizes. Storage is allocated in blocks (typically 4k), so you should look at these.
It is also possible that some storage is appointed to SWAP, if you execute grep swap /etc/fstab you can check what partition or file is appointed to represent the swap.
The reason why this happens is because the system needs a fail safe to report if something terrible has happened.
If you want a proper breakdown of your block devices it's partitions on linux, you can try: lsblk. This is part of the util-linux package.
As @Milliways already mentioned, the ext4 filesystem reserved some space for various reasons. By default this is 5%, so for you this should be 0,8 GB. Although this can be larger if defined.
The ext4 filesystem reserves space for various purposes, including inodes, hash tree, journal and just "reserved" (for performance reasons - to prevent the system filling up, and crashing).
