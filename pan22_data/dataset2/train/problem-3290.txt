accordingly, UltraVNC supports seamless windows. XPRA also offers this functionality, but it's only for X sessions.
Apparently UltraVNC does this too now - but I have never seen it in action. SSH's X11 forwarding also does a seamless mode of sorts by default, but you won't be able to suspend and resume your sessions, which I assume is important to you.
I was surprised when I first tried VirtualBox to discover a seamless mode in the menu which allows you to view windows from your virtual machine, without seeing the entire desktop.  They give you a special key to access the menu to start new applications, otherwise all you see are the apps themselves.
VirtualBox is not remote desktop software per-se, but virtualization software, which allows remote console access to your virtual machines.
Sun Secure Global Desktop supports that type of window.  In order to use with Windows, you'd need an intermediate server/VM to handle it.
Simply ssh to the box with the -X switch, and run the program from the commandline.  The application will integrate with your local desktop as if you were sitting at the remote computer.
