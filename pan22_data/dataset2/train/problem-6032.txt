Now obviously this is a very insecure way to do it, as anyone could create this file to kill your program, but I am guessing this is just for hobby use and there will be no issue there. 
Also preforming killall python is not doing you any good as the reboot is going to force the program to close anyway. If you are worried about your program needing to shutdown gracefully, you should notify the program to shutdown rather then kill it.   A simple way would be to use touch in your crontab like so:
This is, however, a poor way of ensuring a reliable 24/7 system. If it crashes there is no guarantee the reboot itself would happen.
The normal solution would be to use a watchdog timer. The Pi has an inbuilt hardware watchdog which is suitable for the purpose - although setting it up can be a bit tricky. It SHOULD cause a restart on system lockup, but it would be better to have it monitor your process.
As a side note your crontab probably wouldn't work - you should specify FULL PATHS to all executables, including python3.
