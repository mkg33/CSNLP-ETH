Your DNS would also need to resolve Internet names as well, and be available all the time on your network, as it would have to be the main DNS server for your entire network (or any computers you want to access the websites on).
Your home router probably has a built-in DHCP and DNS server. Point your web browser to it and see if there are configuration options for those. See if you can add some static host name entries. I'm not familiar with that model, but others that I know do have those features. The configure your hosts to use DHCP and they will get that router as a name server also.
You would need a Domain Name Server.  This is a service running on a computer (or a cluster of computers) which resolves names into IP addresses.
An alternative would be to purchase your own domain (or sub-domain - they are often cheaper, sometimes even free) and have the DNS hosted on the Internet somewhere.
There are a number of different free DNS packages available (Windows Server comes with one already built in).  Mara DNS looks pretty promising.
One big benefit of using names instead of IP addresses is you don't need to allocate a separate IP address for each website - they can all run on the same IP address but differentiate using the "Host:" header of the HTTP request (settable in the IIS config for the website).
