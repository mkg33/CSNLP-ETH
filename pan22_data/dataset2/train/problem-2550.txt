I would download a STIG viewer from the DISA site and pick the correct STIG for your device and start going through them one by one.  This is what my company does for all their devices they implement on DoD networks.  Additionally we have to pull all our configurations and send them to an accreditation body who grants us permission to connect and have them operate on a DoD networks.  Security like this is maybe a bit of an overkill, but it will give you quite a few good guidelines for you implementation.
There is a lot to say on this field. I would like to add at Andy answer the following guidelines provided by Cisco. 
I'm pretty new to IOS and I've been building up a configuration file in Packet Tracer. I still have NAT to setup, as I have to account for a couple of streamers. So, what should I do to configure the security portion of this router? Does this configuration leave the router wide open? The model is the 891F ISR, but I'll also be configuring some 881 routers as well. 
About the configuration itself, well you can improve ACL on line, service password-encryption, disable not used service like http and so on.  
I have participated in quite a few certifications for Department of Defense network devices and ALL DoD devices have to adhere to Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs).  They are a list usually sorted by device type, then by vendor on standards to follow in order to provide security and Defense in Depth with network appliances.  
It will be a zip file that contains vendor specific guidelines as well as a generic file with generic guidelines.
