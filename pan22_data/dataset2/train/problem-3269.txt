If you are always having problems you are probably always doing something wrong.  Are you downloading packages from non-standard or non-Raspbian repositories?
And yet, I am completely certain that I have not deleted any of these packages, though I have a right to think again, because these problems seem to have started when I ran sudo apt-get autoremove.
