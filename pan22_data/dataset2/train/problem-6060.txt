If you want both old and new versions of the application to serve clients and talk to DB, and smoothly transition traffic to the new version you can achieve this with Istio and Virtual Services.
Maybe you've seen this already, but here is a pretty good article discussing different approaches to rolling out updates in K8s: link
Because of the way our architecture is thought out, I would sometimes need to only update a few nodes with the latest image and keep the other nodes on the old deployment image for a few more hours. (this is because, with certain updates, the newer webapp can't talk to the old backend app, so I need to split the infrastructure, to keep some nodes alive on the old version, while updating the others).
I have spent many hours searching for an option in the documentation, but there doesn't seem to be an easy way of doing this with Kubernetes.
This all works well, but it becomes a real problem for the scenario that I described above. Anybody has a suggestion, a path that I could follow?
