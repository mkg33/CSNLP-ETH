What you are describing is actually an extremely common way of terminating locations on the floor to a central point. You will find that many datacenters and organizations that tend to adhere to cleaner and flexible structured cabling models will do exactly this. When I worked for a major Electrical Contractor, most of our structured cabling installations were exactly as you describe. In fact, while you probably do not want to take this approach with 10GbE, this will work just fine with 1GbE over CAT5e and runs shorter than about 400 feet. I think the term acceptable implies that this model is in some ways sub-par, which could not be further from the truth. The art of structured cabling is rooted with this design, and while it could be done poorly, no doubt, when done right, it is an extremely flexible, robust and datacenter proven model. I have seen some really poorly done 110 panels, but when done right, it will last for many, many years, and is easy to maintain.
I recently started a new position and upon investigation it appears all data drops from the floor first gets punched down on a 110 block, cross connected to another 110 block and then connects to a patch panel.  I was horrified and surprised that this setup was even working.  They are using un-shielded cross connect cables between the two 110 blocks.
I started searching the web and it appears that some shops consider this acceptable.  I would think there would be cross talk issues up the wazoo.  Am I wrong?  Is this type of setup acceptable?
