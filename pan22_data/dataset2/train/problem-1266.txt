I just had another thought.  Although probably not as ideal but if your real underlying goal is for a cheaper distribution model this may work.
Make your DVD as normal and then create an iso of it.  Then setup a private bittorrent server to distribute the image to all the stores using an rss feed.  A computer with a burner is probably already present in most stores...if not these are relatively cheap.
We don't want a full box running this at each location, something embedded that just plays videos/music will do, but it must have the functionality, or the openness that we can add the functionality, that we need.
Cost-benefit analysis shows that utilizing the existing WAN connections at each store to update a playlist weekly with new videos instead of shipping a DVD to each location once a month would be more cost-effective.
We're looking to replace our current in-store video distribution model, which involves the production of a DVD ISO and several people burning discs and shipping them out.
We need something that can be remotely managed over Ethernet, can sync a folder of videos with a remote server, and play those according to a playlist file that will also be provided.  It shouldn't really need end-user interaction, nor would we want that.  We prefer that it have component or HDMI output, but will settle for S-Video/Composite if that is what is available.
However, I'm having some trouble locating a device that does or can be reprogrammed to do what we want.
