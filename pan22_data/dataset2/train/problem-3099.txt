First of all, few organizations own their IP address space, and for them, setting up correct reverse DNS is a hassle involving contacting their ISP and asking for that service. This is often a manual process. This means that in the "typical" case you have no idea what organization is currently using a specific IP address with any tighter granularity than on an ISP level.
If you want to increase security beyond this, plan for a VPN tunnel. An alternative (that isn't necessarily good against targeted attacks) would be to limit access to your system to explicit IP addresses.
This in turn means that if you want to do explicit client certificate lookups, you'll ask the client to create a self-signed certificate and hand you the corresponding CA chain that identifies it as valid from their point of view, or to purchase a certificate from a well-known CA that you can verify independently. In such a case no IP address validation is required, because an eavesdropper who doesn't own the correct private key will only receive an encrypted mess from you - one encrypted with the rightful client's public key.
