Sorry for not linking, but I'm under the novice links limitation. The WebDAV ones will work as a mapped drive using Netdrive. All the above have a web interface to let you recovery individual files. Dropbox and SpiderOak have file version history.
Another possibility is Crashplan. Their software is now free, which could let you partner with someone else, so that you back up to them and they back up to you. All encrypted of course, but it does mean opening a port on your firewall.
I don't have WHS so can't confirm if any of these work on that, but below are some services that I have used successfully on 2000 and XP. I've listed geographical location, as I've found it can have a significant impact on speed:
I've looked at using s3 but the pricing ends up to expensive with the amount of data I have. Mozy and alike don't support WHS. I was considering just getting a cheap linux VPS and using rsync to backup, if thats possible with WHS.
Personally, I'm not backing up that much data and have been using JungleDisk for WHS with Amazon S3 as the backend. At the storage levels you're talking about though, S3's storage cost is almost twice as much as KeepVault and the transfer costs alone will be pretty horrible as well given your stated update frequency.
You don't state what a reasonable cost is, but KeepVault seems like the most viable cost-oriented solution specifically for WHS. A review at WeGotServed seems to indicate it's a decent cost-savings compared to Amazon S3, and reputable.
Mozy advertises unlimited package at 4.95 a month. I have only used the free version with a 2gb limit but their service is good and easy to setup.
