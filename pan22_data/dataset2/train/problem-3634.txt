Whatever you choose, if it will be exposed to the public internet, you want to ensure that it supports selinux.  This has saved my butt on at least one occasion where otherwise I surely would have gotten hacked due to a security flaw in software I had installed.  Not only did selinux totally block the attack, but via setroubleshoot it raised a pop-up window to warn me about it.
I learned a lot working with this distro, but you will need plenty of time and patience. Slackware is user-friendly, it's just very selective about who its friends are.
I personally prefer rolling distros, since there is no such thing as upgrade to a newer version (which either way might be risky). That's why I prefer Gentoo for my servers. Unfortunately setting up gentoo requires a bit more effort, yet thanks to portage system maintaince (if you use the stable branch) is really easy and painless. The very cool feature is slots and ability do downgrade to literally any old version of the package with one simple command. On the other hand gentoo packages, even in the stable branch tend to be much newer than Debian (see point 2) - if you need a machine with recent software gentoo is for you.
Release distro - I'd choose Debian here, mainly for it's popularity around all the hosting companies and a huge packet base. Although I don't use it myself it seems to be the most reasonable distribution with a really high security level. Deployment is fast, no need to compile packages (unless you really need to).
Debian is my server's distribution of choice : it's very stable, available for almost all server platforms and security is a keypoint on that distro !
