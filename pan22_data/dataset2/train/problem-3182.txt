Edit: After considering a suggestion posted I now have only one network adapter configured in my virtual Fedora 17 drive which is NAT. My configuration is as follows  
I had a similar problem when I installed windows XP on virtualBox (host was Ubuntu, but virtualBox is more or less exactly the same regardless of OS). I fixed the problem by installing the networking add on. If you haven't done that already, try that first. Also, I recommend you try pinging the host PC's IP address instead of name (I've always had troubles when pinging names, but IP's are [mostly] trouble free).
So, you must ping your host via its IP, either the NAT one or the external one (probably 192.168.x.x, reported by ipconfig on Windows). The NAT address would be, as the VirtualBox manual says in 9.11.1 : 10.0.2.2 (gateway if it's the first NAT VM). You can know it with this command (on the guest) :
So try this tips to begin with. If still no luck, let me know and I'll see what other help I can provide. Good luck!
In a bridged, enterprise environement, you have a local DNS server that knows the name of all machines on its local network. Then you could use names to contact your host.
I just installed Fedora 17 on my virtual Box. My host PC is a Windows 7 machine and connects to the internet Wirelessly. Could anyone tell me what network configurations should I use on my virtual fedora box so that I could be able to ping my host Windows 7 system and at the same time use the internet. I am currently using a bridged adapter setting with promiscous mode set to "Deny"
It is likely you can't use the host name to contact it because it is most probably not known by the DNS that answers your guest. Windows machine can know each others through some broadcast discovery, but GNU/Linux won't do that.
