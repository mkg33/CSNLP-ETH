That phrase is a classic adage in the Linux world and it is meant to be taken quite literally. In the Linux world, (almost) everything is a file. This includes pipes, directories and devices. So, the way of changing permissions for a device is the same as doing so for any other file:
You shouldn't need to do this though. Adding the correct user to the cdrom group shoujld be enough. You have not explained what users you have and who does what. I assume you are launching the VM with your normal user. Is that user in the group?
Trying to create a new virtual server using VirtualBox and phpVirtualBox on a physical Centos box.  Installed the software and all seems good.  Put the operating disk in the CD drive of the physical machine, but got the following error from phpVirtualBox:
I found that group 11 is cdrom.  I've since added this group to my phpVirtualBox user, but still get the same error.
If this is what you've done and it doesn't work, please update your question and show exactly how you added which user to the group.
I assume the error you are receiving is the VM complaining that it cannot access the physical drive. This probably means that the user launching the VM is not in the cdrom group. 
I understand how Linux files have user permissions.  Do devices have something similar?  How are permissions on devices viewed and modified?
