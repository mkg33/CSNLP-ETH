I like Xfce because I have experience with it, check out LXDE and OpenBox too - see if you can Google around for some live-cd's of those if you want to experiment.  The major idea to keep in mind however is that there are always options.  If you need something even lighter than the above three you could even go with Damn Small Linux or Puppy Linux.  There will always be something that will work.
On one of my older machines, an Athlon 64 3500+ single core running at 2.2Ghz I have Arch Linux with Xfce and it works like a champ, couldn't ask for more.  Arch Linux is different in that it is exactly what you make it and I chose to make it Xfce.  That does require an intermediate level of Linux experience however so if you are a newbie you would probably be better served with something like Xubuntu which is Ubuntu but instead of coming with Unity comes with Xfce.
Xfce and LXDE and OpenBox are three good candidates for machines that don't have a lot of horsepower to work with.
What you should be rather looking for is a "light-weight" desktop environment.  Something modern yet consumes about the same resources as Windows XP does so that it will also run well on that particular machine.
