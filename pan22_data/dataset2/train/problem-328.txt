Task Manager will show every resource currently loaded into the memory.  Even if they are resting and not using any resources.  
ClicK on "Performance" tab.  This shows your CPU usage.  At the bottom of the page click on "Open Resource Monitor".  That opens a separate box that shows which programs are actually using the resources. This can be very important in isolating run away programs and malware.
It often helps to diagnose problems with Task Manager.  That does take some resources, but is very manageable. I keep Task Manager running in the background at all times. If a program freezes and becomes unresponsive, I will close it there instead of booting the machine. Often, after using a CPU intensive program, such as photo editing, I will need to reboot Windows Explorer from there, instead of booting the machine.
Press CTRL, ALT, and DEL (Delete) at the same time.  This is known as the "MS Three Finger Salute" and has been used since Windows 95. You will get a Blue Screen with several options.  Choose the bottom option which will be "Task Manager".
