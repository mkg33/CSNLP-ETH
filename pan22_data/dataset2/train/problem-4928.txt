I had the same issue while trying to reinstall peachtree on a windows 10 machine on the domain. Ultimately I just mapped the drive via the name of the server instead of the IP. I also changed the network type to domain via static DNS as pointed out above because it got switched to private. With both of these setup I was able to install without a problem. Hope this helps someone. 
In my case, as uSlackR suggests, the issue was origined by the order of the DNS in the adapter, i put the primary DNS the AD instead of second, and i recover the domain "location"
If windows firewall is enable, you need to disable it. Since you already behind a firewall no need for windows firewall on the machine to be enable.
The Computer Browser service must be running in order to view computers on the domain.  You can check to see if this is running in the Services snap-in.  Many organizations disable this service via Group Policy to comply with security requirements (so you may not have the option to turn it on).
