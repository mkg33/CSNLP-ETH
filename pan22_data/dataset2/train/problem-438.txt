What I can say for sure - you are doing everything correctly from the SAN software stand point if the cluster is still creating. 
First of all I don`t really understand why do you need Storage Spaces in this scenario - StarWind is fully powered to give the SAN disks and the clusters CSV. If the problem is that your E drive is storing the StarWind image files, then just stop bringing it to cluster and move all the data on the SAN.
I have two host servers with Windows 2012 Hyper-V installed. I have also configured File and Storage Services with one Storage Pool, one Virtual Disk on each server. I used Star Wind SAN for Hyper-V and configured Quorum Disk using iSCSI. So I have C: for Windows install, E: for the Virtual Disk and Q: for the quorum disk. When I run the Validate Cluster Configuration Wizard, it sets the quorum disk to offline to run the storage test. This is expected but it also sets the Virtual Disk E: to offline for the duration of the test. The test succeeds and I am able to configure the cluster but a few of my services were down because they depend on the drive E:. Is there a way to tell the Validate Cluster Configuration Wizard not to look at the drive E:?
