If that is the case, then you probably have to open up port 80 on your windows firewall. (I assume the site(s) on your IIS are running on port 80.) The firewall has to allow incoming traffic on port 80.
If you ping to the name of your computer which ip address do you see in the results? Is that the ip address of your network connection?
You can also put the computer name in the c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\host file along with the 127.0.0.1 address.
When I'm trying to connect to my iis with localhost, everything works fine. When I'm trying to connect with the name of my computer instead of localhost, it doesn't work.
I've found that turning off windows firewall resolves the problem, but I would like to turn on Windows Firewall. So, which program or port should be allowed through the Windows Firewall to make it work?
Very old post, I know. But for the sake of history and knowledge; Chances are you are using a proxy, in this case you need to add exception for your computer name in the your browser.
