There is no podcast in the iTMS that goes by that exact name, though there is "The Economist: All audio." Maybe a podcast you used to subscribe to was discontinued on iTunes? A quick Google reveals that The Economist Audio Edition so described is a pay-for subscription podcast. Maybe that's a recent development, and why you can't get the episodes anymore.
Try searching for podcasts in iTunes by selecting the Store, entering your query, and then limiting your results to podcasts.
There currently isn't a resolution to the issue, but they did determine that the buttons are actually hidden and you can click them if you can find them.
I verified that this is the case - if you know where to click, you can click the invisible buttons. I'll stick with double clicking to download new podcasts until the issue if fixed.
To fix it, go to control panel, then Add or Remove Programs (or Uninstall Programs). Then scroll down to find iTunes, right-click on it, and select repair. 
I was wondering about the same thing earlier, just double-click the episode and it will be downloaded.
The "GET and GET ALL" are hidden. For me the buttons were hidden under the Date Released. clicking that will present the buttons.
