To reassemble the chunks, you can use cat. They say that COPY /B works as well in Windows, but I never dared. If you feel adventuresome, try
Actually, I'd start downloading from one computer, then add another, and another... until I would notice that the actual download speed has fallen below the theoretical maximum rate allowed of 50 Kb/s. That would mean that the uplink is now saturated, and there's no reason to continue adding clients (actually, that would slightly decrease transfer efficiency).
Important: whatever you say, if there is a 50K/s per PC policy, it means that bandwidth is at a premium and/or there have been bandwidth hogging problems. What you are doing now will recreate those problems, therefore you had better first clear this out with the network admins and maybe agree on some time frame to perform the download with minimum disruption to the network (at night, during lunch break, at weekends and so on). This could spell the difference between a quick download and a quick termination of your work position.
Since you say that the limit is per computer, you can download the file in, say, ten chunks from ten computers.
If you already know in advance that you can use at most, say, seven clients, you divide the file length by seven and download seven large chunks. That will make optimum use of TCP connection. If you don't know the size, 10M is a reasonable chunk size: just keep monitoring the clients and start another download as soon as one is finished.
