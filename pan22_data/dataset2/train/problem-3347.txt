Using TZ or date IS NOT RELIABLE because it tells you the USER's timezone, not the default system timezone.
The default system timezone is stored in /etc/timezone (which is often a symbolic link to the timezone data file specific to the timezone).  If you do not have an /etc/timezone, look at /etc/localtime.  Generally that is the "server's" timezone.  /etc/localtime is often a symlink to a timezone file in /usr/share/zoneinfo.  That path to the correct timezone file will often give you geography information as well.
Although advices above on using environment variable or just date command output sometimes work better, depending how you want to use that.
(as a side-node, if you have an ancient system that still uses the OLD hard-coded timezones, you can probably copy a modern timezone file onto it and it will work.  I have had to do this many times to resolve changing timezones on older equipment).
I wanted to find the timezone in "US/Eastern" or "Europe/London" form instead. You can find this in:
Usually, the TZ environment variable will tell you something useful. However, it is best to use functions such as mktime() and localtime() to convert between time_t and a local timezone representation. That is, don't try to do the conversion yourself.
