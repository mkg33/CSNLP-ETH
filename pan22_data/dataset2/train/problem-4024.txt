If you're just backing up one system and that's all you want to do, then NAS is probably the right solution.
Offcourse it really comes down to your budget and what you really want to do with it. But for backups/storage use i would most certainly go for a NAS with a RAID setup for maximum reliability. 
You can build your own NAS: buy a motherboard that supports RAID and which got > 4 SATA slots. Buy a few HD's from frys or newegg (I just bought 1 TB 7200rpm, 32mb, barracuda hd for $60 + tax from fry's store). Install freenas, you are done with it.
If you want a media/streaming server and other extra's i would lean more towards the Windows Home Server because in the end it will offer more flexibility and power.
So, NAS vs. Windows Home Server? It feels like I'm getting a bit more with Windows Home Server - but I'm really not sure.
Personally i would go for the NAS, Modern day NAS systems can be really powerfull, meaning they could even download your favourite torrents. And host a website complete with PHP/mysql etc.
It depends upon the firmware in that NAS. If it is a commercial NAS, they support all clients: linux, windows, Mac. From linux, you can use mount.cifs; from windows, it is like any share; from Mac, samba share. 
There are also other add-ins that I haven't yet had the chance to try out - for things like sharing my iTunes collection in the house, controlling devices via X10, etc.
Then you can add as many drives as you want, and the cost is not much different from what a good NAS unit would run you.
If your technical skills are up to it, another option is to build a linux system based on something like this:  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813186194
If you have multiple computers, I can't recommend WHS highly enough.  It's been a GODSEND in my house.  Here's what it does for me:
All modern day NAS systems will support MAC/Windows/Linux etc (either trough shared folders or FTP etc)
