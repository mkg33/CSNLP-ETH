If you are just transferring the data over and you don't plan on using them as drive space in the new machine, I would just get an IDE to USB (and/or Fireware) enclose and put the drives in the enclose.  I did that when I went from a PATA box to a SATA box.  
I took the second connection from my DVD drive and hooked up an 80gig drive at work, If you can fit everything try it out. I removed my 3.5" and the end of the HD fits perfectly in the whole it left behind, heh.
I also picked up an USB to SATA/IDE cable.  It's handy If I need to diagnose a friend or family member's PC.  You can hook that up to a drive while it's still inside another computer and run the USB cable to your machine.  There are a bunch of them out there, here's one at Tiger Direct.
SATA is the same cables, just with a new plug format, so it should be possible to find a simple adapter if you need it.
The easiest thing to do would be to buy a external enclosure, and use that to power/access the drives. 
The downside to this is speed. If you can connect through firewire you should be alright, however, if you have to connect through USB you loose some noticeable speed communicating with the external drive. Also, many of these external cases are not built to run 24/7 so be careful that the one you get has a small fan or some other form of cooling. If you just need to access the drive occasional this is a great way to go (will cut down on drive wear if it isn't hot all the time), but if you want continual access, I'd look into internal options.
