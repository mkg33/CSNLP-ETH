We are all connected to the same network, so I assume that the answer to my question will be yes, but when I run Wireshark it doesn't capture packets sent from the other devices connected via WiFI.
I am working on a PC which is connected to my router using a LAN cable, and the other computers in my house are connected to my router using WiFi. 
Can I sniff the packets being sent to and from the wireless router even though I am connected through cable? 
If you want to capture traffic on the wireless network, you would likely be best using a tool dedicated to this task (e.g. kismet Wireless) or airodump-ng) along with an appropriate wireless adapter configured in monitor mode.
If you're are not listenting on the wireless network you won't be able to see most of the traffic on that network.  Most wired networks these days are switched, such that you will only see traffic that is either from your machine or to your machine (either because it's sent directly to your system or because it's broadcast traffic sent to all systems on the network).
The other option you may want to look into is an inline tap.  You could set the tap in between your router and your modem and monitor the traffic at that point.  The Throwing Star is a cheap inline tap example:
No You are not able to directly sniff the packets from the Wireless interface on the wired interface.  You may be able to depending on your router either monitor the traffic directly from the router it self, or by setting up a monitor port where all information the router receives is sent onto its destination as well as the monitor port.  The monitor functionality is something usually found in managed switches but it is worth looking at your router's configuration.
