I played with kvm and liked it. I did build one small 20gb file system image as master in kvm and successfully managed to build another machine by "basing" on it. I am thinking of using this approach and sharing host file system using 9p. This way I don't have to worry about figuring out the disk space requirements for each machine etc. 
Looking for pros/cons of using this approach - master file based VMS and sharing host file system. Data on any of the machine is not sensitive and machines are not exposed to outside world. The machines are mostly used for qa setup and access to host and vms is controlled by active directory permissions.
Ours is a small setup. Currently we have two windows/hyper-v servers running around 8 ubutu server virtual machines. The virtual machines were built long time back to the extent that ubuntu version is no longer supported. We are planning to move all virtual machines to Ubuntu 12.04 as its supported long term.
Ideally I would like to build one master machine and clone it and then install machine specific stuff on it. Doing this in hyperv seems to be painful (might be because of my lack of knowledge).
