I have had many different combinations down to even mounting horizontal (no hard drive space, so just put a screw through the hole for a fan!
Under situations where cooling is at premium and you don't have the means to increase cooling of your system, mounting the disk horizontally with the label facing upwards could be seen as an advantage, since heat rises away from the disk surface more efficiently than if the disk was mounted vertically. But even so, any impact on performance or disk lifetime would only be noticeable in years to come. Just thought nevertheless to make this note.
It shouldn't matter which way you do it these days. But there's one possible caveat of making it vertical:
These are statements taken from the hard drive literature at each manufacturer's website; it's four years old but things probably haven't changed much.
According to several manufacturers, mounting a 3/5" hard drive horizontally, vertically, or sideways doesn't affect the hard drive life significantly.
I had a drive that did not work anymore in vertical position. After dismounting, it ran successfuly in horizontal orientation and I was happy to be able to make a backup...
