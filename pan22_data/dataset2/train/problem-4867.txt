My small (22") monitor went bad on the pc I use to watch hulu/netflix with... The kids like to use this computer to play online games.  I am considering buying a HDTV (~32") to replace the smaller lcd. Is this a viable solution that will give satisfactory performance for both types of use?
I have a 50" DLP HDTV. While it is great for movies and gaming, it's pretty terrible for reading text smaller than the standard fonts in Windows Media Center's interface (games with text that I actually need to read aren't pleasant either, like Civ4).
As long as you use an LCD with a square pixel aspect, sure - no problem at all. If the PC is already an HTPC why not have it connected directly to such a device?
Typical 32" LCD has 1366 x 766 resolution, and wouldn't be comfortable for daily work. Casual online gaming should be ok though.
I've seen 27-32" HDTV LCD's that were passable for reading text on, especially when switching to 120 DPI in the display settings.
Televisions and monitors have different characteristics, such as brightness, reflectivity, resolution, price, etc.
Obviously, playing pc games on it could be quite a ride if trying to sit as close to it as before (keyboard+mouse games) - that's about the only problem I can think of.
It might lack some features or sharpness (or do way too much post-processing) for it to be comfortable for professional use but for playing games, watching videos and some surfing - definitely usable. Try to get one with a standard native HD resolution so you can easily set the PC at the native resolution as well - to avoid scaling artefacts.
