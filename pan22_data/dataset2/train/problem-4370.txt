I've been using GetDropBox for some time to synchronize files across machines.  Its up and running now and runs across Windows, Mac, and Linux boxes.
For a Windows system where you're wanting to do it across the internet, Live Mesh is pretty good; if you're syncing folders that are accessible from one machine (ie server to laptop) then SyncToy is a really good piece of software.
You have a lot of options to do that. From simply using rSync tool to a lot of paid and free software. Here is a small list to get you started (assuming Windows OS) :
I'm now using SugarSync, which also syncs multiple computers but in addition maintains copies of all files on their servers as well for backup and/or for accessing the files from a non-synced machine.  They've got a 45-day free trial but after that you pay based on how many gigs you're syncing.  I'm on the $100/year 60GB plan.  Because all files are necessarily synced to the cloud, it's not nearly as speedy as Live Sync if all your synced machines are on the same local network.
For simple syncing between multiple computers, I used to use FolderShare, which is now Windows Live Sync.  Works over a local network or the Internet, but is limited to 20,000 files per "library".  It's free.
