This requires hardware level access to the usb device, so it is rather difficult to propagate as a virus.
Assuming that you're dealing with actual files (as opposed to something more interesting, like an infection that sits in the control portion of the circuit), they may be hidden. You could try any of the different ways to enable display of hidden files (configure your machine to show hidden files, extensions, and show system files, or running something like the following on the contents of the disk:
Are you sure it is a usb drive? What you actually are is a gentlemen agreement. The usb device tells you and you can only hope it doesn't lie to you. Then I think you can switch modes and pretend to be something else. It is useful for "self installing devices". You plug it in, then the software auto installs relevant drivers and you are then good to go.
To reveal hidden files in linux, hit Control+H in most file browsers, or navigate to the folder in the command line and execute ls -a. Or in windows, look for files or folders that start with .
On Linux, you can check it in lsusb output or by going to console (not terminal emulator), starting showkey and then plugging in this device.
Previous to this, there was the USB Switchblade but it requires Autorun in order to work (that's my understanding anyway).
USB devices can also be configured to act as a HID (Human Interface Device) such as a keyboard. For more info, check out the USB Rubber Ducky.  Many of these types of devices are made from Teensy which can be made to fit inside of a standard thumbdrive case.
