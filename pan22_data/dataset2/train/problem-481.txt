I have two different ISPs in my home and also two different routers. I'm using one for Wireless, and one for ethernet.
On my PC here, it has both wireless and ethernet connections setup at the same time (which is what I want). But I want to use my wireless connection for connecting to the internet. However, it seems like the internet connection is getting prioritized to my hardwired ethernet connection instead.
In the network adapter properties window, double-click Internet Protocol Version 4, and then click on Advanced button.
After this, your wireless interface has a default metric of 10, and wired interface has a metric of 100.
Uncheck Automatic metric button, and put 100 to the Interface metric box. Then click OK to exit the adapter properties windows.
Is there anyway to change this without disabling the ethernet connection? I need both of them enabled.
You can go to your Wired Network adapter properties via Control Panel / Network and Internet / Network Connections.
Interface metric is the cost of sending a packet through the interface. Since the cost of wired interface is now higher, packets are sent via the wireless interface.
