What was done previously to the other machines was badly documented and I know that people were poking around in the registry to try to get things to work unsuccessfully. As such I would like to put an image of the Windows 10 machine I have got working and tested on each of the other machines. 
After reinstalling Windows 10 Pro and a lot of fiddling with the hardening applied to the fresh install on one of the machines I have managed to get SNMP, Remote Desktop, PerfMon and user security and remote commands working. I now want to do the same to the remaining 5. 
If so, what methods are closest to Microsoft recommended best practice? I have read about Sysprep but it doesn't sound like it is appropriate given that it is a tried and tested working machine not a new image.
Is this possible given that I have been running it as a regular installation (i.e. not just in Audit Mode) for a few weeks?
But, in your scenario /generalize is NOT optional. You have to use /generalize to reset the security IDs of each machine or they will conflict on the network.
I have 6 machines which all run Windows 10. They are networked up to 2 servers running Server 2012. They were all hardened to meet CIS Guidelines by an engineer who didn't take into account what they were to be used for. Nothing network based worked properly after that. 
If not then you could still use sysprep and use the generalize option to strip all drivers etc from the machines.
