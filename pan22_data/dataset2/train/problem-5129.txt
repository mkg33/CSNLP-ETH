I am planning to deploy a server at a customer location, probably either of  linux/bsd based system. How can I ensure that the server is protected from data-theft/replication, for eg. someone(maybe customer himself) making duplicate copies of the disk.
The only 'secure' way would be to tie the encryption into the hardware somehow so the disks (or images of the disks) can only be used on one set of hardware - maybe use something like the BIOS ID as part of the encryption key maybe?  Not quite sure how you'd go about doing this.
I understand disk encryption could help, but anyone with a valid passkey can decrypt, is there any way to make it transparent from the user/customer, so that he doesn't have to enter passkey at boot.
You could store the sensitive data on an encrypted partition, then require someone to login through SSH and enter a key to unlock it. Obviously, after a restart, the system will not be working properly until someone unlocks it.
The only way I know of is to include the passkey on an unencrypted partition on the hard drive.  Hardly secure - the customer could just read that partition.
