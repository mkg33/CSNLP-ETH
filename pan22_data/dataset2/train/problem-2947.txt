I personally use Piriform's "CCleaner" it allows you to export a list with a lot more information that some others.
Personally, I like System Information for Windows.  For home use, it's FREE.  For a technician, you can get a fairly cheap license that lets YOU run it on any computer you want.  And it's a single file (well, when registered, there's also a license file).  And it will export to HTML and the paid version can also do XML and CSV (and another format I've forgotten).
And if this is a network that you might have to get information on more than one machine, then you can try SpiceWorks which is free even in a business environment (generally minimal/unobtrusive ads).
In order to do this without installing any software go to the command prompt with Administrator privilege:
The MyUninstaller freeware utility from NirSoft can save the list of installed applications in different formats (text, tab delimited, HTML and XML). It is tiny and doesn't need to be installed. 
Note: Don't publish your Belarc profile on Google as it contains license keys and perhaps other 'useful' information!
as it gives you an overview of the most important information you might want to have of your machine. Including hardware and software. Oh and it's free too!
