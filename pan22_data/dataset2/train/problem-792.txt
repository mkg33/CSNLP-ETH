Make sure you do have a local backup of your files though, or you will kick yourself when the hosting company inevitable suspends your account or goes down.
Have you contacted your hosting provider for advice? They would be in the best position to tell you the best option since they ought to know the ins and outs of their setup better than anyone on SF.
If you are moving files between folders on the same server, then it would be much, much faster to use the copy command in your control panel. This involves disk transfer and not network transfer. 
As for the transfer through ixwebhosting.com -- It looks like you have unlimited transfers a month but you will have to know how fast your connection is from Domain A to Domain B to calculate the time.
I you are talking about using Microsoft's file sharing service then by copying the files from Domain A to Domain B using a third computer will cause all files to be essentially copied 2 times.  Once from Domain A to the third computer and once from the third computer to Domain B.
The best choice is to use a tool that initiates the copy/ move from the server for Domain A.  It sounds like that server admin tool will work great.
