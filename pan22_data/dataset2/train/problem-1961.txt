Basically, if your partitions, especially usually C, end up in the same order, you will be fine regardless of size. So if you had a disk with 3 partitions, utility, C and D, you can get rid of D to a new disk, since the boot would still be from disk 0, partition 1. If you somehow deleted the utility partition, C would now be disk 0, partition 0, and it would not boot and you would be repairing.
Running multiple partitions on one physical drive merely reduces performance, so it would make no sense in eliminating the 73BG drive and repartitioning the 300BG drive into two partitions. However, if you're going to eliminate the smaller drive just put everything on one partition on the larger one. Too many people underestimate, or even completely disregard, the performance cost of having the head assembly thrashing about to meet the needs of multiple partitions.
I once cloned a drive on a domain controller using a DOS boot disk of Ghost, and when it came up, I got some error that prevented me from logging in. I re-did it using the -IA switch to force a sector by sector cloning, and that worked.
Windows would have issues booting only if you changed the boot partition's physical position (f.e. if it was the second partition and you deleted the one before it); if the partition stays in the same place but just increases in size because you're taking advantage of the space freed by deleting D:, you should have no problem at all.
Short answer, yes that will work. There will be no problems booting the machine after resizing the C: partition to use the full 73GB drive. Using the 73GB drive for the system and the 300BG for the data makes the most sense.
I would point out this: When cloning a server drive, depending on what software you are using, check that it clones the drive bit for bit or it may not boot.
