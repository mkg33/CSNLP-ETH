However you can get close. Right click conversation window and select "full screen". Note how at least 25% of screen real estate is consumed showing a participant gallery. To hide this, click the icon to the top right of the gallery and click "pop out the video gallery". The mugshots dialog can then be minimised and you can reclaim another 20% of the screen. Clicking "Fit to screen" allows you to use the largest area possible, without scrollbars.
My colleagues and I use Lync presentations every day and this problem is immensely frustrating to us. 
This does not display the content being presented in Lync full screen. It displays the content as only a portion of the Lync window, where a user may still even have to use scroll bars to view the content, along with several other brackets (e.g. chat box, participant list) around the content.
Below those four icons, you have a "Fit to screen" icon if all the presented content doesn't fit in your Lync window."
Incredibly, lync then replaces the video gallery, the raft of buttons, the scrollbars, the window bar and all that cruft with a thin black band (maybe 2% of screen) that entirely borders the videocast and then a further 1px wide band around the outside of that and a final yellow band on the inside. It's really, really poor but it's as good as you can get with and out-the-box lync install.
Just stumbled on this today.  Double click the presentation window and it goes to full screen.  The only problem is you lose your toolbar at the bottom but if willing to live with that this way of viewing is much better.  If a separate lync chat is started you will still get a pop-up in this mode. 
How can I watch a Lync presentation in fullscreen? This is using Lync 2013. By default it does 'three quarter screen' which makes text difficult to read.
The short answer is that Microsoft Lync does not have the capability to view content in full screen.
