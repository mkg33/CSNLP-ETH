I remember trying this once with Windows Xp (on a desktop) and the OS crashed on boot and I had to reinstall everything again.
My laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate (non OEM) died on me today and it has tonnes of stuff on it - my projects, Visual Studio and office installations, etc. etc.
At work I can take a Ghost image of an IBM T60 and apply it to a HP EliteBook and get it to run. The first thing I do is once I have put the original image on the new laptop I run a repair on it. After the repair, that's when the fun starts in terms of updating the drivers. So yes, I absolutely think this can be done.
I have read about sysprep but by the looks of it, it can be used only when the host computer is alive and kicking -- which mine isn't.
My old laptop was a Compaq Pressario v3000 (3 years old) on an AMD and the new one is going to be a new dual core Intel HP laptop.
I am getting a new laptop from somewhere and was wondering if I could just unplug the hard disk from my original (dead) machine and plug it into the new one.
I've never been successful in swapping harddrives around for the issues Nathan mentions above... If you're unsuccessful swapping HDDs out like that, you could mount the old HDD in an external caddy and get your data off that way, but that won't solve the issues with your installed apps :/
the drivers in use are completely different between your old computer and the new one.  You can plug it in and turn it on, but be prepared to spend a lot of time updating drivers, if it works at all.  you should try booting into safe mode first, and then update your chipset drivers first.  HP should have a list of drivers for your machine and the order to install them.
