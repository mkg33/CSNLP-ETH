On linux there is the gupnp-av-cp app that is part of gupnp-tools.  I have read that it's also possible to to use pulseaudio (with rygel?) to push all system sound to a UPnP/DLNA device and am in the process investigating/implementing this.  Will update when I know more.
For pushing local video/audio content, it's a lot easier: install the Emby server (google for instructions), then hook up to the web-based interface of the server via a browser (on the linux PC itself or a browser on another device). The web interface gives you a media player complete with a "Play To.." option where your dlna renderer is visible.
For Android there is BubbleUPnP.  This is capable of serving all DLNA/UPnP purposes outlined below, and is an excellent tool for carrying out tests.
For audio only,the pulseaudio-dlna package does the job on Ubuntu 19.04 despite some errors during install. There is a 12 second lag (on my setup) and some stuttering during volume adjustment. But simply amazing functionality and simplicity. It's the only I've way I've found to push internet audio to a dlna renderer via linux. There are a huge number of options for Android and an almost complete dearth of them for linux.
