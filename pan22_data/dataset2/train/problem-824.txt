Another possibility on BIND (and I've never tried this) would be to set your example.com domain on the internal DNS server with only the records you use internally.  Then, set a "forward" statement with the "first" argument (in conjunction with "forwarders").  In theory, this would go ask the external DNS server (as set in "forwarders" for an answer, which wouldn't have your internal records and return a failure response.  Then, the internal server would look at itself for an answer.  Not sure if that would work, but it's a thought.
Essentially, you will need to make a copy of your external zone file and prop it up on your internal DNS server, then change or add the records needed specifically for your internal network.  This is a pretty common setup, though it can be a pain to keep the "external" records synchronized between the two DNS servers.  If you create or change a record on the public server, it will also need to be created or changed on the private server as well.
This can be implemented regardless of what DNS server implementation you use.  In most setups, you will have one DNS server that serves the external network, and a different one that serves the internal network.  With BIND, as possibly other implementations, you can have both versions of the zone on the same server through a use of the "allow-query" statement within the zone section of the named.conf file.
