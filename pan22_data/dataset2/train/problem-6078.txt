The catid variable is being corrupted here. ASCII code 28 is File Separator, and code 29 is Group Separator.
This is against an Apache server.  I don't think it's an attack as it's too infrequent and it wouldn't cause a problem on any HTTP server I can think of, except throw 404 errors.
Are all the requests coming from one IP range? Have you tried running a packet capture to see what the full request headers look like?
In general it may look like either highly specific or specially crafted crack attempt that is made to look like a bug, but I suppose it is not. You should also analyse previous and further requests from this user. If it is sometimes occur from different places with no other suspicious things, it is a bug, not crack attempts.
If possible, I would check processing of the catid variable, and otherwise ignore it if the program handles it correctly (and rejects it).
Short answer, it may be. But given the information you give us I would say no. More logs could change the answer.
