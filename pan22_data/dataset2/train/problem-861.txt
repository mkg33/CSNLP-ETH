Assuming that you're using the default shell in OS X (BASH), you can add the following to the .bash_profile in your home directory (so /Users/gav/.bash_profile - you may have to create this file yourself if you've never used it before):
I have the latest executable screenfetch-dev in /Users/gav/scripts/ folder. I can execute it fine by running /Users/gav/scripts/screenfetch-dev
Alternatively, you could add your scripts folder to your PATH, by adding the following line to the same .bash_profile:
The second method (adding the folder to your PATH variable) allows you to use any of the contents of the scripts folder from anywhere inside the shell, although you still have to use the script's full name to access it - in this case it would be screenfetch-dev.
The first method (creating an alias) allows you to assign any name as a "shortcut" for anything else - when the command is run, the BASH shell simply substitutes the "shortcut" for the full command. In this case, you could run the script simply by typing screenfetch.
