It appears HP just reformatted the disk, hoping the problem gets away. It won't, your disk is broken. Ask for a replacement, and if they want you to send in the whole system again, write the serial number of your disk so you'll notice if they send the same again. Also, I would insist on getting  just a replacement disk, without the annoyance of having to ship your whole computer. 
I then ran WD DataLifeguard program again (twice), and each time it came up with a message to the effect that it was bringing down the computer "to prevent damage to the computer"... and brought the computer down!  It didn't do that before I sent it off to HP!   
My machine is a  HP Pavilion Elite HPE-110f, and the hard drive is WD10EADS-65M2B1 SCSI Device.  When my machine arrived, it had RAIDXpert running on it, and about 3 months after I bought it, it started reporting bad sectors.  I also ran the WD DataLifeguard program, and it also reported errors - and said it couldn't fix them.  As the machine was under warranty, I shipped it off to HP, who cleaned off the disk and shipped it back. 
HP did not include any indication of what the problem was, or what they had done - except that they cleaned all the data off my disk. 
I have posted the above info on the HP support site, and there have been many views but no answers!  Could someone tell me what is going on, and what I should do about it? I don't need a terabyte of space, so is there some way of just marking the bad sectors (if the error messages are valid) as unavailable, and reformat?  Or is it possible that a terabyte just strains the various scanners to the point where they die or give erroneous messages? 
On the second day after getting it back, RAIDXpert started reporting errors again (same sectors as before).  I contacted WD, and they told me that the disk is "not a RAID device" - whatever that means!
