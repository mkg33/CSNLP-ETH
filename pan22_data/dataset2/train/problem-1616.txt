Depending on the workstation, you can also setup fast-user switching if users complain about having to close everything & re-opening everything... that way they simply need to log in once & have their windows where they want them... then can lock their session (manually or on a timer) and another user can log in & do what they need.
The only other (but slightly hacky) way to do it would be to record all of the files, and registry keys the installer creates (with procmon) and then bundle all those changes into an MSI.
You could always setup the software then copy the user profile you used to set it up with over the Default User profile. That would probably get your software to work with any user that signs in.
If you're stuck in a situation where you MUST-HAVE a shared workstation... I would cripple it almost to the state of being a thin-client to prevent users from going to myspace/wherever & downloading whatever virii or other improper applications that are out there.
There are tools that will bundle up EXE installers into an MSI, but I have found them to be hit and miss.
As a rule... common usernames/passwords is ALWAYS a bad idea.  It will quickly turn into the blame game as to who did what & such.  That aside... You really should look at making full use of the Remote Desktop features including RDP-Web & remote-app available in windows 2008r2.
With the RDP-Web stuff all a user needs to do is go to the "company page" ... and login.  All running programs carry over... and all the settings stay the same.
