There are new features available at each AD domain/forest level, so there is little reason to stay at a lower level unless you have DCs running that OS. E.g., if all of your DCs are 2008 R2 or higher, you should consider moving to that functional level. 
Of your I expect the answer is Yes but I have never done this before and my boss would not like it if I messed up our domain.
Active Directory does not have an "offline mode" or anything similar.  All updates to the data or the schema are made live, and replicated accordingly.  AD schema modifications are non-reversable, but I've never had any of Microsoft's schema updates cause a problem.
It should not disrupt services or user activity. I have never seen it break anything. There is no real reason to prohibit other AD activities, as the change is virtually instantaneous.
I am preparing to migrate our OLD 2003 Windows Server to a Windows 2012r2 Server. I have discovered we actually have a 2000 forest, not 2003.
So my question now is --- can I upgrade the active directory forest level from 2000 to 2003 while the domain is in use?  Note: Nobody will be adding users or computers during this, just accessing the domain.
