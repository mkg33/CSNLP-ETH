It sounds like your card may also have a problem (potential hardware issue) related to hardware acceleration.  That would at least explain why the problem appears when running games.
You might have more than one sound card in the computer: A simple one on the motherboard, and a more sophisticated one connected to the speaker. The programs you cited may be trying to use the better sound card, while Windows uses the in-built one.
You must have had one hell of a LAN party if you managed to break a couple of sound cards. Or maybe you had a power glitch.
Look for a management program included with your soundcard driver.  It may be muting one app but not the others.
Finally, if you're running Vista or 7 this could just be a poorly written audio driver, even if it is the latest available.  Windows Vista forced a re-write of many old sound card drivers, and many vendors went to the bare minimum effort to get something that seemed workable on older cards, with no plans ever to do any improvements.  I myself suffer from that problem on an older sound card.
