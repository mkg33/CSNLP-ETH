To see more information in Windows Explorer property pages and menus about Matroska Video (.mkv) files, similar to what one can see when selecting native Windows media (.avi, .asf, .wmv or even just plain old mpg) files, Matroska links (from http://www.matroska.org/downloads/windows.html) to a download of the MatroskaProp shell extension (http://www.jory.info/serendipity/archives/14-MatroskaProp-2.8-Released.html).
Can this extension be made to work under Windows 7 or x64 systems?  Are there known problems with installing this or other old shell extensions on x64, or on Windows 7?
Now I have Windows 7 x64, and downloaded, installed and ran it.  Configuration and settings page is fine.  But it does not seem to actually register any shell extension.  Nothing is added to Explorer windows, menus or property pages when selecting .mkv or .mks files).  I tried calling the register hook manually using regsvr32.dll, that again invoked the configuration window and let me set all options, and when confirming even said the registration succeeded, but seems to have had no effect.  In the registry I cannot find any traces of the shell extension being installed.
