So now I have Outlook 2007 reinstalled and I have my .pst files and so forth from the previous installation.
I would re-import.  Outlook 2007's import option is pretty painless, just time consuming.  You could always try the old switcheroo, open outlook, don't configure email, the close it once it generates an empty Outlook.pst.  Then quit outlook entirely, make sure it it no longer a running process in Task Manager (you may have to restart), and swap the empty one (rename it, don't delete it just in case) with A COPY of the old pst.  I have had mixed success.  Sometimes it works.
Outlook mail settings are stored in the registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows Messaging Subsystem\Profiles
If you're not a coder,or ven i you are, Google that registry key & a few keywords. If you have already wiped & lost your old OS, um, don't bother.
What I'd like to do is be able to just put the .pst file where it's supposed to go and then have Outlook 2007 just "remember" everything. But I'm pretty sure this doesn't work.
I haven't tried it but ... there's some VB.NET code here (if you're a coder) to display these values.
If memory serves the answer on getting all those emails back into Outlook again is "create a new .pst file for the account and then reimport everything".
