Personally, if I were you I'd go the DOSbox way before considering VMWare. VMWare support for DOS based virtual machines isn't brilliant anyways and DOSBox makes a much better job at emulating a DOS environment with support for different types of hardware. Until recently installing windows 95 with it was a challenge. But not anymore.
I have a certain old program that needs to use IPX for networking.  It is being used with the Hamachi VPN software (which does support IPX/SPX). I found this site that shows how to get the IPX/SPX protocol on Vista, but for my case it isn't good enough because I also need to be able to change the settings. Is there any other way to get it working on Vista?
A free alternative is going the emulator way with DOSBox. You can now install Windows95 on it and it also includes support for IPX/SPX.
I've tried the solution you mentioned before to play Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 game, which uses IPX rather than IP, and I could NOT manage to make it work, after that, I've found a patch to use the more modern IP.
Currently there aren't any fixes to install a fully function IPX/SPX networking protocol under Vista or Windows 7. The best you can get is the hack you see on that link.
The alternative is for me to install Windows 95 in a VM. How would I go about setting up a Windows 95 VM to use IPX over a network?
A VM may or may not be a good alternative depending on what you need to do. A good VM is VMWare, but this isn't a free program. You can however install Windows 9x with IPX/SPX support.
