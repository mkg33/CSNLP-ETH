Caveat: Their site is subscription-based.  But, I understand they need subscription revenue since they don't accept ads, as that could compromise their independence.  Nevertheless, US$26/yr or US$19/yr if you subscribe to the magazine are great deals.
Final interesting tidbit:  Consumers Union recently bought The Consumerist blog/web site, also a worthy resource for consumerrs.
Consider AllTop.  I know of it; I don't really use it - I find Google better for my purposes.  And so far, neither Bing nor Wolfram Alpha has provided me with better answers than Google for the questions I've wanted answers to.  I guess I don't ask the same questions as the general population - which doesn't surprise me too much.
I use Google to search Lifehacker anytime I'm looking for a piece of desktop software to do... whatever.
I've created a keyword search bookmark for site:lifehacker.com, so I can just type "lh -keyword-" to search. 
For programming, my first point of research is always the documentation. PHP and Java have excellent docs.
For general stuff, I'll use google to site: search (mostly SO, SF, SU). Just knowing how to use google properly, though, beats everything else.
I check ConsumerReports.org any time I am interested in buying something for the household, except for IT-related items.  ConsumerReports.org is the web site companion for the Consumer Reports magazine published by Consumers Union, and they have an archive of the ratings published in the magazine, plus additional content and user forums.  Whether you are buying a dishwasher, BBQ, automobile, lawn mower, etc. chances are good that you will find some useful information on which models measure up, and which to avoid.
For buying computer parts, especially for building a PC, I use a combination of Wikipedia (specifications, model #'s, cross-reference lists) and Newegg (to get the best deals, reviews) and Amazon (mainly for comparitive reviews if applicable).
