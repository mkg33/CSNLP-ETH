To keep this short and rap it up you don't just take the 'CAR'S' horse power and multiply by how many days you drive a year by how many years; you calculate an average daily usage of HP and use that to calculate your HP for the year, that way your engine should last a whole lot longer than FULL THROTTLE!
When I managed a medium-size population of workers, I instituted a cyclical replacement program.  Each fiscal year I would replace 25% with brand-new systems.  The entire population would be upgraded in 4 years.  Never once did I encounter an internal battery problem.  We simply replaced the PCs in a timely manner.  The oldest PCs got repurposed or sold off to sister agencies.  All the PCs were from Dell.  
I have read more than one time that you should get on average about 5 yrs. out of a 2032 or any typical lithium watch battery. But then I am sure that would have to do with the efficiency of the circuit drawing the power from it and could fluctuate 10-20% either way. then you would have to factor in how many months (12-24 or more) that it sat in the store before purchased for use.
Unfortunately I'm on my phone I probably shouldn't chime in... Your math is not entirely accurate and what I mean by that is the milli-amp/hr is not I have X amps - Y hrs = 0 volts if you can fallow along I'm not trying to make this a history lesson but amp/hrs is 'HOW MUCH' current a battery is rated to put out, so you have to calculate how MUCH current is being used/drawn from the battery it should be considerably less.
When the CMOS battery in my father's Dell failed, it read about 1.5 volts on my multimeter, well below the 3-volt nominal voltage, but not quite zero volts.  A battery generally has virtually no energy remaining this far below the nominal voltage, so you shouldn't expect the battery to be usable all the way to zero volts.
