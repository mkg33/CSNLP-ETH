My recommendation is the book Computer Networks by Tanenbaum... gives a great overview of networking functionality and protocols - I found this an excellent book to actually read cover-to-cover, and you can fill in the gaps by googling. It won't make you an expert overnight, but will give you a superb grounding. I originally read it as part of my degree and have bought the 2 new editions since.
I am wondering if anyone can recommend resources on networking I don't mind if they are books or web pages. I just want to start learning a bit more about it as I want to take a gap year as a System Administrator or a IT Tech. I have experience programming and have been doing so for many years however i'm not a graduate so unlikely to get a software development job.
I suggest you get hold of a copy of cisco packet tracer software which is a sort of virtual network simulation. It'll teach you how to setup routers and switches, including right down to the actual commands you need to run on them (cisco gear, anyway). It'll also go a far way towards helping if you decide to do a CCNA or similar in the future.
If you want to get into the Sysadmin Job you have to know very well the basics of how a network functions and this can also help you if you go the developer way.
One of the "bast bang for the buck" would be to acquire a layer 3 switch. A ton of networking technologies in one box - switching and routing. If you can find any in stock, Asus has a very capable layer 3 switch for under $100 USD. It's not a Cisco, but has a very comparable technologies/features line-up and will at least provide you a chance towards good/meaningful exposure.
You can find a very comprehensive tutorial about how a network works in Networking Fundamentals by Juniper. I hope you will find this a easy as i did.
