You are right. PCI cards, video cards, etc all need to be mapped to that small amount of space that 32 bit provides.
I would first try installing latest drivers for all devices and then try to boot with 4GB of RAM. If this doesn't work, upgrading to the latest BIOS might be worth a try, also you could try to go with smaller AGP Aperture -setting in BIOS as Drake suggested. And it never hurts to download Memtest to check that the memory isn't faulty.
Remove the extra RAM that you installed (ie go back to 2GB). If that fixes the problem, then it is definitely a mapping issue.
You can verify this in the device manager / Display Adapters : right-click on each video card, then Properties and check the Resources tab of both cards for conflict.
In some cases, updating your BIOS can fix the issue. However, the only sure-fire fixes are to either:
I don't know how much memory your displaycards have, but it is possible (though newer cards should be smart about this and not allocate all their memory directly) that they eat up all the available memory.
It could be that your computer is set to prioritize RAM over allocation for the cards. I would go to the BIOS and change the setting of PNP OS Installed (it'll be different for every BIOS but the idea is that the OS can change the settings of your PCI cards). If it's set to disabled or off, enable it. This will let Windows change the settings of your cards and could allow them to work. If it is already enabled go ahead and disable it since it could be Windows that is reallocating things in the first place.
Also, a 32 bit PCI card can only see 2GB of ram, the system has to double buffer it to get the data to the other 2GB of ram. Remember that from your ISA SCSI cards and having more than 16MB?
Your problem is that the first video card is using the same resources that the second video card is requesting. You're probably getting Device Manager error code 12, for which Microsoft counsels to disable the conflicting device.
You could also try to enable PAE, that would allow you to use all of your memory. Unfortunately there are some device drivers that won't work with this setting.
In 32bit Windows your memory address space is divided in two blocks. First block from 0 to 2GB is accessible for you applications. The range from 2GB to 4GB is reserved for the Windows kernel and device memory. All your devices usually require some memory to work and this is mapped into the 2GB - 4GB area. Displaycards also map their internal memory there. If you have 2 cards with 512MB memory in each, that would mean 1GB of that memory would be allocated to their needs. As the video memory on displaycards got bigger, they began to map only part of their memory to that 2GB-4GB area, atleast when running 32bit OS. So that shouldn't usually be a problem.
