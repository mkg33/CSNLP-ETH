There are no Growl plugins for Lync and none in the works, but I don't really need that... I've already discovered how to issue Growl notices from a shell script, and all I would need is the hook into Lync to fire off a bat file (or perhaps Powershell). Is there any way to jigger or connive this into being? 
For those that aren't interested in the hows and whys, I intend to make my script available publicly in the near future. Check the Growl For Windows website.
The Microsoft Lync SDK documentation makes it seem like it might be possible, but it sounds like gobbledegook to me. Can anyone help me get started, or at least rule out scripting as a possibility?
I've just upgraded to Lync 2013, and I'm considering using it instead of Pidgin+SIPE. One of Pidgin's many nice features is Growl integration... and I would miss that. 
Most importantly, you need something at the end of the powershell script to keep it from exiting, while(1) {} is sufficient. Finally, you might want to also hook the ConversationAdded event and inside that register new InstantMessageReceived events. Otherwise it will only work for existing conversations.
Each conversation object (open IM window/tab) has at least two participants (sometimes) more, the above code checks each of those conversations and each participant in them but ignores the participant that is "you" (IsSelf). This code then fires off the newInstantMessage function every time someone sends you a message.
A Powershell script can hook into Lync events, if the Lync SDK is installed (in particular a dll called Microsoft.Lync.Model.Dll.
