I've seen this on a machine where I'd plugged in a USB key drive weeks earlier and forgotten about it.  The machine was a Dell with a front flap that hid the key drive.  I know you say you've unplugged all peripherals, but it sounded similar enough I thought I'd mention it.
The best way to determine if it is your hardware or your windows installation is to boot from something else. Download a liveCD (it does not matter which one), but that and try to use the computer for a while.
If it is not slow then you either have a problem in software, or with the hard disk (which is not used when booting from a liveCD/live pen drive.  Mount the drive and try to use it (e.g. copy everything off the HDD to another location). 
Windows 7 before it even gets to login. On the "starting windows" splash screen takes no less than 15 minutes to finish more like 25 minutes most times. During this time the hard drive activity led indicator is blinking maybe once every 20 seconds. 
If it is as slow then you have a hardware problem. The next step would be to determine which hardware part is broken.
When I finally get to the desktop everything runs normally.  I have unplugged all peripherals with same result. 
I'd install a fresh Win7 on a SSD drive. It's super fast for my setup with Core i7 running. However, when I did install a SATA peripheral it slowed the startup way down... FYI.
