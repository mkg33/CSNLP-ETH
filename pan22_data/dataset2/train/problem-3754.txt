Check your /etc/environment file to make sure /usr/local/bin or whatever path your custom ruby build is in exists. You may also need to logout and log back in to update environment variables.
I think the older version of Ruby is still there in the PATH. SO, how do I change this to use the new Ruby instead of the old one?
Best way to have multiple ruby version is to use rvm. after installing rvm you can install multiple ruby version simply by
When Ruby 1.9 is installed from apt it installs as ruby19.  If you really want to use this version you can setup an alias in your ~/.bash_profile, something like:
run which ruby to check which one in your path got executed first. But the question is how did you install the 1.9.1?
I've just installed Ruby 1.9.1 in my Ubuntu 10.10. When I give the command ruby -v in terminal, I'm getting "ruby 1.8.7 (2010-06-23 patchlevel 299) [i686-linux]".
Installing RVM is really easy to Ubuntu, I've written a short tutorial here: http://blog.dcxn.com/2011/06/20/setting-up-rvm-on-ubuntu-11-04/
This is kind of a hacky solution.  A much better solution would be to run RVM.  It's a ruby manager which allows you to have several versions on Ruby installed and seamlessly switch between them.  It also makes staying up to date much easier.
