To determine if a domain member is configured for domain time sync, examine the REG_SZ value at HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters\Type. If it is set to "Nt5DS" then the computer is synchronizing time with the Active Directory time hierarchy. If it's configured with the value "NTP" then the comptuer is synchronizing time with the NTP server specified in the NtpServer REG_SZ value in the same registry key.
The low-level details of the time synchronization protocol are available in this article: How Windows Time Service Works
In a stock Active Directory deployment the only computer configured with a time server explicitly will be computer holding the PDC Emulator FSMO role in the forest root domain. All domain controllers in the forest root domain synchronize time with the PDC Emulator FSMO role-holder. All PDC Emulator FSMO role-holders in child domains synchronize their time with domain controllers in their parent domain (including, potentially, the PDF Emulator FSMO role-holder in the forest root domain). All domain member computers synchronize time with domain controller computers in their respective domains.
Beware that not every domain controller (the KDC's, as James directs you in finding via DNS in his post) may be running a time service. In a stock AD deployment every domain controller will be, but some deployments may use virtualized domain controllers that have the W32Time service disabled (to facilitate hypervisor-based time synchronization) and, as such, you would probably do well to implement functionality as described by the "How Windows Time Service Works" article if you're developing a piece of software that needs to synchronize time in the same manner that a domain member computer would.
I'm assuming that you're looking for the server used by the W32Time service to perform time sync on domain-member computers.
