It then holds that $L_0^{(2)}$ is a DCFL and any DCFL log-space-reduces to $L_0^{(2)}$.  In that sense, $L_0^{(2)}$ is the hardest tape DCFL.
There actually is a hardest DCFL, which is a deterministic version of Greibach's; it was introduced by Sudborough in 78 in On 
with $\gamma_0, \gamma_a^{(i)}, \gamma_b^{(i)}$ words over $\{a, \bar{a}, b, \bar{b}\}$, such that there exists a word $w_1w_2\cdots w_k \in \{a, b\}^k$ with $\gamma_0 \; \bar{w_1}\gamma_{w_1}^{(1)} \cdots  \bar{w_k}\gamma_{w_k}^{(k)}$ a Dyck word.
As mentioned by contributor Mateus de Oliveira Oliveira, DCFL is not a principal AFL, and it is unknown whether there exists an exact characterization involving the closure of a single language under some operations.
storeâ€”it is however hardest w.r.t log-space reduction.  The language $L_0^{(2)}$ referred therein is the set of  words over $\{a, \bar{a}, b, \bar{b}, \#, [, ]\}$ where:
gives a short proof of the following result (credited to Greibach) which seems to answer your question: 
$$\gamma_0\;[\bar{a}\gamma_a^{(1)}\#\bar{b}\gamma_b^{(1)}]\;\cdots\; [\bar{a}\gamma_a^{(k)}\#\bar{b}\gamma_b^{(k)}]\enspace,$$
