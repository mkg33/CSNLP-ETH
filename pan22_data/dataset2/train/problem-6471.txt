You could disable the mirror driver in Device Manager, or entirely uninstall the remote software.  Of course, this will inhibit your remote functionality, so it's a tradeoff.
For whatever reason, it thinks it's rendering with that mirror driver. It's possible that simply having it installed is enough to disable Aero - it might have hooks in place all the time even though you're not actually using it, which are enough to throw Windows off. 
You may not have performed a Windows Experience Rating test, this will always prevent you from enabling Aero.
I noticed my machine no longer using Aero and going through the exact process posted here. Instead of disabling the driver, I logged on from my iPad and logged back off and watched my Win 7 Ult desktop refresh with Aero functioning normally.
2) Click on "this computer has not yet been rated", or "Windows Experience Index", and run the assessment, or re-run it. Since mine has been assessed, I can't describe the exact way to go if you haven't.
Guaranteed fix if indeed you are using LogMein: log in either from your tablet or another computer and then log off.
