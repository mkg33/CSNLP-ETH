My company recently upgraded their XP laptops from 1 GB to 2 GB and my machine is currently using 1 GB of RAM, so XP probably uses more, too.
No you would most probably not be using 43% of your RAM if you upgrade to 2GB. Some programs utilize RAM in a logarithmic manner - more RAM detected, they will attempt to use more then.
It's not like your memory is only RAM. There is also the pagefile, which is basically used for the same data. Just think of RAM as the faster part of your system memory. If the OS notices there is more RAM available, it will use more of it to store data that would normally reside in the pagefile. But if needed, the memory can be released quickly again, so that's nothing to worry about.
Having recently upgraded my RAM, I know that XP will use more for buffering and caching purposes when it has more to mess with.  With 768mb RAM simple services in Windows like spoolsv.exe (printer related) would use about 1 to 1.5mb of RAM.  With an upgrade to 2.5gb of RAM spoolsv.exe is now hogging 4mb, as are many other services that previously used around 1mb.
