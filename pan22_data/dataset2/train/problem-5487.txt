Hosts with a BIOS that works over the serial port, USB serial adapters and Paul Vixie's rtty (packaged as remote-tty in Ubuntu and Debian) logging continuously.
These days KVM-over-IP is a waste as all good servers have some version of remote management built in, whether IPMI or HP's excellent iLO, just make sure to not use versions which share a NIC as those have BAD failure modes if the NIC dies.
For dark cable racks permanent gooseneck LED lights can be great, although I don't have any favourites there.
We use blades for 98% of our servers and often don't need KVM access...EXCEPT that one time when you just do need it of course!
Personally I love serial concentrators for the few bits of gear that haven't added management ethernet ports.
I'm going to turn your question around - I've found something that specifically isn't rack-mounted that I find better than its rack-mounted equivalent (for us anyway).
HTTP controlled power switch with ACL has saved a lot of time. Just give customer access to power-off/on their own server anytime so they don't have to call every time they've broken their server. 
So rather than install a KVM into each rack we have 'gurneys' instead. They're wheeled trolleys with an LCD glued to the top and a keyboard and mouse/trackball on a shelf below. In the event of having to KVM into a blade we simply wheel the thing along, connect in and off we go.
There's tons of rack-mount stuff around. What accessory you didn't know back then and now can't live without? 
The primary advantage of this system is that when a server spews a huge amount of information out to the console and then wedges or reboots, you have a complete log of what happened, as well as what anybody was typing on the console up to that point.
