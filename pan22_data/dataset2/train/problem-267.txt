I think that learn.dvorak.nl is better online typing tutor for dvorak then http://gigliwood.com/abcd/ mentioned by Simon.
My tip: don't physically put the keys in the Dvorak positions - then it is too easy to look at them.  I can now type on a dvorak keyboard, but I don't actually know where an individual key is.  When I had the keys in their mapped locations, I got a sore neck from looking down all of the time!
Dvorak.nl will have you type actual words, which should help you learn how to type faster, rather then just individual letters.
Another good way to get proficient is to just make the switch and work with it in whatever you do daily. I learned Dvorak a while ago, tried to switch, but gave up and went back to Qwerty. Recently I made the switch for good. I was too lazy to put stickers on my keyboard or rearrange the keys, and as a (positive?) consequence I'm not at all helped by looking at the keys, even on a keyboard that's arranged for Dvorak. I don't think my speed is as good as my Qwerty speed used to be (yet, hopefully), though it's still good.
It basically just follows you through repeating patterns of letters and gradually introduces more letters and builds up words from the letters you've learnt so far.
The GNUtypist program may fit the bill.  Also near the bottom of the page it has a list of other free typing tutors some focussing on Dvorak
I got the latest version of Mavis Beacon to support Dvorak - from memory it's version 5.  Well worth the investment...
