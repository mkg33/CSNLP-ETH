Effectively, this allows users to authenticate, and read all objects, as well as overwrite their own user objects so they can do things like change their passwords and such.
The reason that ldapsearch works for getent & sss daemon is because they are probably using either your LDAP administrator credentials, or if you've configured it correctly, your bind proxyuser account. (You should never do bind auth via manager directly).
Go to the documentation and read it thoroughly. LDAP is a huge monster, and it's unfortunately all too easy to mess it up.
Bear in mind that this configuration is only slightly more secure than the default which allows anonymous binds, something no administrator worth his salt should ever allow. You should be VERY strict about what users have access to by setting access controls on specific attributes. This ACL is very open-ended, so you should make sure you go the extra mile to lock it down further. 
Properly configured LDAP servers with good schemas already have some built-in security for guarding passwords and other sensitive objects, but you should always verify this.
The issue is caused by your ACLs (access control lists) for LDAP. What you essentially want to do is allow all users to read the full directory (with the exception of sensitive objects like password fields and such. 
This is a bit misleading because "INVALID_CREDENTIALS" is actually a much more generic error than it implies. In reality, this usually is the result of a permissions error rather than invalid credentials. I ran into this while configuring a local OpenLDAP server of my own. The problem is likely that your user does not have the permission to bind/authenticate to the LDAPS server in the first place. 
I don't know what your ACLs look like currently, but what you want to do is begin with the following ACL.
