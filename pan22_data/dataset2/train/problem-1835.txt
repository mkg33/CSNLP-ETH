(The nodes would only be there to proxy peer-to-peer communication (e.g. temporarily pass data about one peer to another). They would never store any secure or private information.)
I read in this link the maximum theoretical number of A records for a domain is 65535 records due to SOA overhead. So, it seems that it would be technically possible for at least ~65,000 records. 
To do this, I envision scripting automatic DNS record creation done at the main server that I control. So, once a new server is brought online, it would notify my server to add a new A record for that new server, and my server would then update DNS programatically. The way I would do this is using cloudflare and the Cloudflare API
I'm theorizing a system which would allow a single domain name to be disbursed among any number of servers. The idea behind this is a decentralized communications platform with many "node" servers that anyone could establish by downloading a prepackaged VM, but I would want only one domain name to serve them all. 
I hope this question falls within the guidelines here at superuser, and my apologies in advance if it falls short. If it does, please leave a comment and I will delete. 
What I need to understand is whether or not this idea is even practical. Are there other things I should be concerned with like security that I'm overlooking? There probably are...please go easy on me :)
