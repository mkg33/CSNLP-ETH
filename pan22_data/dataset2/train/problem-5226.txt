There is a hosting company called joyent and while i was looking into them as a hosting provider, for problems etc, the only thing that came up as an issue with them was some serious slow downs they had a little while ago, and from what i can gather it was from the Netapp filers. They've now switched to thumpers and zfs, because they are a Sun shop. And this apparently fixed their problem. And this was a few years ago from what i remember. But it might be worth to check up.
I have never heard anyone complaining about performance on their NetApp. I've never been able to afford one to back up that claim, though ;-) 
No nightmares but be aware that all the software cleverness does mean that overall system performance does vary - if you need your SAN to perform consistently at all times of the day then you may be disappointed. Otherwise they're great, oh and they're dropping their trousers on discounts at the moment :)
We just purchased one to replace some OnStor Bobcat filers.  We have no complaints thus far, with two months in.  Quite to the contrary, they're very robust.  The NDMP backup speeds are amazing.  The management thus far has been easy, and everything has worked the way we expected.  
Things to remember about this sort of solution, your antivirus software has to be hosted on another box for scanning the files on the NetApp (this matters with public storage at a University, it might matter less for you).  Quota managment is by user per host(once again this may not matter to you).
