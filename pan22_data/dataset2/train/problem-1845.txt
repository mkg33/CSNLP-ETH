Some PCI SSD's will even reach this bandwidth limit and saturate the connection, meaning they have to be connected to a x4 (PCI 3.0) or x8 (PCI 2.0) connection to utilise the greater number of lanes to provide the maximum throughput. 
SATAe drives are, however more costly Â£/Gb than conventional SATA drives and you need to make sure you purchase a boot-able drive.
Therefore logic dictates (to me at least) that you should go for the PCI SATAe SSD if you want the fastest solution to your storage needs.
One new, high performance SSD will saturate the 550Mb/s transfer rate of SATA3 6Gb. Two in RAID0 would see a max throughput of about 1Gb/s.
On the other hand, a SATAe PCIe 3.0 port, using two lanes (x2) can reach nearly 2Gb/s which will allow for around 3.5x more bandwidth for data throughput. This is the standard most consumer PCI SSD drives will operate with.
I have a new motherboard and it has 1 sata express port that's up to 10gb transfer. So I'm wondering which would have better performance? 2 SSD on raid 0 in a sata 6 port or 1 SSD on a sata express port?
