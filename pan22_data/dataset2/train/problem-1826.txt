The third and fourth lines indicate your servers' outbound attempt to deliver the email to the remote systems and indicates that the emails are being deferred at the remote systems.
As voretaq7 suggested, can you establish a telnet connection to port 25 from your server to the remote systems and carry on a successfull SMTP conversation (try sending a test email while connected via telnet)?
The first two lines indicate that the server you're sending through (127.0.0.1 - localhost) accepted the client email for delivery to the remote systems. These first two lines indicate that the local server (yours) accepted the email from the email client (which may be the server itself). It doesn't indicate that a connection has been made to the remote systems and that the remote systems have accepted the email.
It could be that the remote systems are graylisting your incoming emails. What's the outbound FQDN of your server? Do you have A, PTR, and SPF records set up in your public DNS zone for this FQDN?
