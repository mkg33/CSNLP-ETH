As noted by joeqwerty, you should check actual bandwidth consumption using some available calculator like the one hosted at http://www.erlang.com/calculator/lipb/
For 55 g729 calls, you will use a lot of CPU for compression. Don't discard using some hardware assisted coding, Digium has a card just for that. You will spend on the card but save on the codec.
And - for the love of every person who's going to make calls - Use QoS agressively if you're using the link for anything other than SIP. This also applies to your internal routers/switches that the VoIP traffic runs through.
The best place to start would be with the voip equipment vendors documentation. Barring that, there are several web based calculators. Here are a few to start you off with:
Also, with VoIP, jitter and latency is as important as bandwidth, so you should go with a good quality link.
As a rule of thumb, we usualy reserve 35kbps symmetrical for each active g729 call, so 55 simultaneusly used lines would requiere 2 Mbps just for VoIP. If the link will also be used with some other app, QoS and traffic policing is a must.
If this system is an important part of your business and you need high up-time I'd strongly advise against SDSL, it just can deliver the quality you'd need, it's just not designed for that. I was called in to sort a very similar problem with a 100-user call centre a few years ago just outside London, we moved them to a pair of 10Mbps BTnet leased ethernet lines and the problems literally disappeared overnight.
We are looking at VoIP right now, and our vendor said that each active SIP channel would use 64kbps. For 55 active calls, you would need about 3.5mbps sustained bandwidth. In our case, we'll never have more than a couple calls running simultaneously, so 200 kbps would be plenty.
