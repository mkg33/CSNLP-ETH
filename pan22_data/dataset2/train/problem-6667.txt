I'm working on some simple automation for a haunted house. The idea is to have 3 inputs (will be capacitive sensors, right now I'm using buttons), an led, a button, and a relay. When all three capacitive sensors have objects placed on them and are all giving input to the gpio, it will light up an led and "activate" the button which previously did nothing. The newly active button can then be pressed to turn on the relay. Using the following code I have gotten to the point where all 3 sensors are activated and the led turns on, but I can't figure how to "activate" the button. I'm guessing maybe use a separate function which gets called when the led goes on? In an ideal world the button press would also play a sound effect and go inactive again.
There are more solutions - for example you could have your fourth switch connected between an output (which you'd set low/high to enable/disable it) and an input (which you'd read).  That seems a bit of a faff, though.
Anyway, based on my understanding of your requirement, I have written up a python script (not tested at all) which I hope will help you in some way. if you find any errors or require any clarifications, please leave a comment below
Alternatively, if you want the player to have to place the three items, and then allow him to remove them and keep the fourth button active, you can set a flag:
Will all three items still be on the pads when the fourth button is to be enabled?  If so, all you need to do is check for all four conditions:
I find your question quite interesting as it requires careful modelling of the different states and transitions between them. I feel your question only partially related to the Raspberry PI and is more specifically related to modelling states, events, state transitions and behaviors which might make some moderators mark it as off-topic.
