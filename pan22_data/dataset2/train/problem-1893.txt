All of a sudden, my local installation of the web-app has started returning 503 (the only recent changes I have made since it still worked were a few modifications to JavaScript files delivered as a part of the web application). While trying to figure out the cause by means of the Failed Request Tracing module, the following new issues appeared in IIS Manager:
Rebooting the machine doesn't help. Rebooting the server causes endless wandering of the green status indicator, until finally, an error message is displayed, saying that the service W3SVC cannot be launched.
I am working with IIS Manager 8.5 on Windows 8.1 x64. I have been using this installation for more than half a year for developing a large web-app. Everything was configured based upon an internal step-by-step guide on how to set up development machines.
Clicking on the Sites node in the Connections tab gives me an empty list. Trying to expand the Sites node in the Connections tab will make IIS Manager freeze (i.e. busy cursor and no response).
I could find an applicationHost.config file that appears to contain the server configuration. It was last changed today, and it did contain pool_A. It is a well-formed XML file.
