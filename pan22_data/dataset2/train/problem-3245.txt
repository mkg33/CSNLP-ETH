(By that I mean use Firefox Portable but disable its password manager and use keepass for that purpose instead.)
The closest I can think of is that you could always use Apache or any webserver and install a OpenID service on it, then have that as an OpenID provider - you would then have to use something such as DynDNS to make sure that the DNS record is the same (mind you, I am not an OpenID expert, maybe this isn't required) - but you would still have to ensure that the firewall of wherever you are allows incoming connections to where you are running the web server.
The OpenID provider merely authenticates, the application (web site) itself sets a cookie. You can't "save" the OpenID login.
... And, after re-reading, I think I got your entire question wrong - if you just want to take passwords with you, I would recommend KeePass
Is it possible to store a Google Account/OpenID details on a USB drive so that instead of typing in the details you can just plug in the USB drive. Without any modification to the Browser. I use different computers a lot, and can't be bothered to keep typing in my details (can't have random computers having my details kept logged in).
The best way to (securely) keep your logins (incl. OpenIDs) safe on your drive is to use Firefox Portable coupled with KeePass Portable.
