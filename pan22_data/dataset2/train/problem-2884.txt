My desktop kept going into powersaving mode even before windows could start up. I thought it was the monitor or software programs.
I had to take out my video card unscrew the case and Clean it out because it was really dusty. can air is best for this but I didnt have any so I used Q tips and water. Make sure its really clean! If that alone doesnt work you might need to add more thermal Paste to the the card.
Turns out it was the video card... My videocard wasnt bad it was just overheating. If this problem happens to you I would suggest Checking the temp of your video card and see if its hot or not.
It is not always what others say the problem is, it can be as simple as a DVI cable going bad. I have a computer that I built, it has no dell insides, and yet a LG monitor kept giving me the DVI power save mode message.  I checked with a second monitor and it did not say any message but was just dark with no image. I tried a new DVI cable and I have not had a problem since.
This just happened to me.  Any chance you installed a Windows update that included an optional installation for a driver for your video card?  My monitor would go into sleep mode as soon as I started it.  If I started it in safe mode it worked fine.  Then I remembered the Windows update.  I did a system restore to a time before the driver installation and no more problems.
Easy to fix problem. Shut the system down. Open your case and remove one stick of ram. Don't put it back in yet! Restart and your system will wake up because it is forced to recognize the change in ram.
