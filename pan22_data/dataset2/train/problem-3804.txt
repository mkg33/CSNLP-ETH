PowerGUI has some downloadable add-ons, one of which is a Script Explorer. I've not really used add-ons much. In this one you have to add in folders and files manually, which isn't great, but might be ok for what you want.
Note that I am not looking for a "Open PowerShell here" option that opens PowerShell in a different window. I want the PowerShell window to be embedded inside Explorer as a pane.
It is the graphic user interface of powershell with multiline editing, tab completion, syntax coloring, selective execution and context-sensitive help.
I typically find myself using both Windows Explorer (for navigation and viewing) and PowerShell (for commands).
Is there any way to embed the PowerShell console into Windows Explorer? Or is there any Explorer-like tool that can embed a PowerShell console into one of its panes?
I've just implemented this funny feature in ConEmu 120625, so, may be buggy :) However, it works (test passed) in Windows 7 and Windows 8 RP.
Just launch the "Windows Powershell Integrated Scripting Environment" (ISE)" and you will be in business!
