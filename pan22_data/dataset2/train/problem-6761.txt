With enough computing power it is possible to do litteraly anything with deep packet inspection. For example see ever last image, video, or text sent across the wire aslong as it is "in the clear" meaning not SSL or other strong crypto. However doing this in near realtime requires an insain amount of computing power far more then a decent size server can deliver, something along the lines of a HPC GPU cluster. The cost of doing this would be in the mid 6 figures GBP. 
Someone told me that deep packet inspection works on the content of the video being said - aka if i am watching a video they can get the content/text and filter/censor it based on that.
I don't really know if this question belongs to this site - but i thought this is a place where i can find my answer consider the type of people who view this :) 
Are you asking if someone knows you're watching a particular kind of video? Any network traffic that's not encrypted can be intercepted and monitored, and/or the source can be easily tracked (it's not hard to figure out what someone on the network is watching if there's a gig of data streaming from an IP belonging to hustler.com). But the firewall doesn't know what is in the video. If this level of sophistication were available then we'd have far better content filters in schools.
TL:DR-no, routers and firewalls aren't this sophisticated, or we'd have far better filters. But your activity can be monitored if someone were interested.
