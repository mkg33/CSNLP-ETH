So deflating internal zips before compressing the whole thing might lead to smaller results, but more importantly, it leads to better usable results. 
I recently had a project that dealt with tar files. The resulting file contains all of the files but they are not compressed. In my opion tar files are a excelant way to archive zip files.
Zipping a zip might confuse AV software. There are zips, which contain themselves as a new zip of themselves, which leads to an endless recursion if your AV software tries to inspect a zip in a zip, and to avoid such an recursion, the AV software might make a false alarm. 
.tar files are not compressed files. .tar files are for wrapping multiple files into one. .gz files can only zip one file. So to make a multiple-file .gz compressed file, you make a .tar file and turn that into a .gz file. But there are no merits to compressing a pre-compressed file. So it makes no sense to make (for example) a .tar.gz.gz or a .zip with only .zips in it.
You can do that, you shouldn't see any problem but compressing a compressed folder, you won't gain a lot of compression. That's it...
Tools which search in zips like zgrep will not inspect zips in zips. But if you are aware of it, this might not be such a problem.
