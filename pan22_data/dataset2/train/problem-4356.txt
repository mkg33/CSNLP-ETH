Hoping someone knows of a solution, ideally integrated with outlook or exchange server, something that will keep a list of users email addresses, and automatically send them a time sequence of emails.    In the affiliate marketing world, this is known as an autoresponder, though I am NOT looking for 'out of office'.
In our case, this is intended to be used as a training reminder system for employees.  The first email might welcome the employee to the company, and introduce them to the series of training emails.   Then the weekly emails act as a reminder to continue their training each week, giving them a link or similar.
Basically, I need a user to be able to enter a list of emails (and add new emails in the future for new hires).   This autoresponder would then send a series of emails, but on a timed basis.   For example, as soon as the email address is added, the first email can be sent.   After a week, the second email, two weeks and the third email will go out, etc. until the series is complete.   
I believe there is a dedicated piece of software out there to do this, but not sure if there are any others, or hopefully one of outlook/exchange?
