From the calendar Views panel, under Lists select Entries and Notices. Then you should be able to find the declined meeting request. Sort by an appropriate column to find the request (Last Modified worked for me since it was a recent request).
If you open the declined meeting from the 'all calendar entries' view, you can choose to accept it, cancelling the decline.
Off the top of my head, I don't think there is a way. Perhaps ask the meeting organiser to remove you from the schedule, and add you again?  Or just manually book the time on your side, and use a post-it on your monitor to remind you of the meeting :p

With Lotus Notes 7 you can go to the calendar view and select "All Calendar Entries" tab in the main window.  This will show the declined events.
In Lotus Notes 8.5.1, I ended up declining a meeting due to a earlier, conflicting meeting. About an hour after I declined the second meeting, the first one was rescheduled. So, now I want to un-decline the second one. Is there any way to do that?
