Also I think it would be good idea to avoid windows if you use mysql. Few years ago, I used win2003 with mysql, but when I migrate to linux (host only running mysql service) The performance gain was a lot.
At home, i am running a core 2 duo, with 3gig of ram. Its running 20 openvz container with 4 web pages (like 15 connections at same time) and a lot of bots crawling internet (this makes like 1000 querys a second to mysql databases) and I dont have any performance issue.
Since in a comment you said that you have a table with 1 millon registry, its possible also you need to improve query and not only hardware.
quad AMD (Its a lot for 20 connections at same time,but that computer could run other services also)
As Chopper said, we can't really give a concrete answer without much more information about the size and requirements of your applications. But in general:
Well, this depends heavily on the size and workload of the database. If it was running fine on a 6y old desktop machine, everything you get today as server grade hardware will likely fit the bill. 
What do you see as the main reason why you want to replace the current system, except it's age and the fact it's running XP? 
Some fundamentals: Basically, I would focus on lots of main memory and a really fast disk subsystem, as these are the main bottlenecks with databases. CPU speed isn't so much of an issue for moderate or low loaded databases, but 64bit CPU/OS is important, if only to allow more than 4G of RAM. 
If i am in your situation, I will buy new hardware if that is possible and also check the slow queries.
