Now,as users will add data to the table row by row, the table will get extended and the formula will automatically be copied to the next row
Save the new workbook and see the difference in file size. If useless bloat has crept in, this may fix it.
Ok, so you have an unknown number of rows into which data will be entered and a formula will be applied row wise right?
My suspicion is that Named Ranges cause Excel to retain the data behind them, even if they are not being used in the worksheet.
You could try opening a new (empty) workbook, and copying/pasting all cells from each existing worksheet into corresponding sheets of the new workbook. The ranges sound small enough, it should be a few minutes work.
In your check for links to other worksheets, also include Named Ranges. I had a worksheet that I had attempted to copy off a single tab using Copy to New Workbook. I dutifully broke the link to the original worksheet using Edit Links ... Break Link, and thought that would do the trick.  The file was still way too big.
I then went back in and looked at the Formulas ... Name Manager and found a bunch of broken references to ranges that were in the prior sheet. These references were originally used in VLOOKUP's, but not in the sheet that I had copied out. I deleted all these bad references and saved and the size dropped to where I expected it to be (< 50K).
