Let's say your AD Domain FQDN is local.contoso.com, go ahead and create the following records in public DNS:
In order to find a Domain Controller so that the clients can join the domain they need to query the DNS server that holds the DNS SRV records for the domain. The only way to do that is to set the clients to use the DNS servers that hold the AD DNS zones.
But even then, after joining, you still have to provide the clients with a preferred DNS server address that can resolve your AD zones. 
It might be possible to configure the clients current DNS servers to forward queries for the AD DNS zone to the appropriate DNS server for the AD zones, but that doesn't strike me as a viable option in your case.
If you have DHCP enabled on the network, you can have the DHCP server hand out the DNS Server address via DHCP options.
I'm trying to join my clients to my domain.so i used Netdom command to join PCs.every thing is perfect but i have to set DNS for clients.i want to ask,there is any way to join PCs to domain without setting DNS?
If you are trying to support a BYOD scenario where clients come to you with a preconfigured network profile with access to public DNS, and you don't mind a bit of information disclosure, you could simply create the DC Locator record in public DNS.
