It seems to me that if Firefox can read the certificate then the user can copy it as well.  The user also has shell access on the laptop because they are using the laptop to write a test. 
What you say is true, if a client can read a file, he can also copy it. You could make it more difficult, but they are usually only stop-gap measures.
I want to use SSL certificates to identify a client to an Apache server. The client runs Firefox on CentOS 7 on a laptop that I loan out. The client network connection uses NAT so multiple clients will appear to the web server as having the same IP. Only the laptop that I loan out should be able to access the server.  I've read the documentation on SSL client certificates and that seems easy enough to setup. However,  I don't want the user to be able to copy the certificate from the Firefox install to their own laptop. 
If you want to make it really secure, you could issue the client with a smartcard. The smartcard is designed to hold a private key and to never let that private key leave the smartcard (or be copied). You could also store a private key in the TPM chip that might be in the laptop (TPM is like a smartcard, but built-in to the computer). This will make it nearly impossible to copy.
