Today I installed 24 "critical" updates for Windows 7. After rebooting, my secondary monitor is not detected. It is not showing up in the control panel screen resolutions settings dialog, or device manager. The NVidia Control Panel cannot find it with the "Rigorous display detection" button available from the "my display is not found link" in "Set up multiple displays".
Just an update to anyone still looking this up.  I was having the same problem with my GTX 470 and the newest (Sept 18 2011) drivers not showing on my LG 46 inch tv in the Nvidia control panel.  I am using a DVI-hdmi adapter connected to a 12 foot hdmi cable.  It is very hard to find mini-hdmi or long dvi cables in Alaska.
From reading online further, it seems there is a disconnect somewhere between Nvidia's drivers (and some day also ATI's) and Windows 7.  Not sure where the problem lies but this solution worked for me at least, though it is not ideal (i am sure people with 3d tv's need access to the nvidia panel for this)
Anyhow, even though the TV was not showing up at all in the Nvidia panel, I did notice by accident that when I opened up My Documents the window did not appear on my computer monitor. I happened to look behind be and there it was, on my TV...even though Nvidia did not think it existed.  So i instead right clicked the desktop and went to screen resolution and sure enough windows recognized my TV and i was able to do what I wanted with it.
