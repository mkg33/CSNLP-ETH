I thought I might pull down the kmod-kvm package as a source RPM and build it against my kernel, but doing yumdownloader --source kmod-kvm fails to locate a source version.
The default kernel in CentOS 5.3 is 2.6.18-128.el5. If I do a "yum upgrade kernel", I get 2.6.18-164.el5. As far as I can tell, the CentOS repositories don't have 2.6.18-160.el5. At least, I can't just do "yum install kernel-2.6.18-160.el5".
I'm trying to get kvm installed on CentOS 5.3. Doing "yum install kvm" doesn't quite work. The problem is that the Intel kvm kernel modules won't load: 
The kvm kernel modules (in the kmod-kvm package) are compiled against kernel 2.6.18-160.el5, but I'm running 2.6.18-164.el5. This means that the kernel module I need to load is /lib/modules/2.6.18-160.el5/extra/kmod-kvm/, but since I'm not running this version of the kernel, it doesn't find the module if I try to load it.
if you see the flag, but still can't enabe kvm, check the server BIOS - you might have VT disabled. if it was disabled, enable it and do a full powercycle of the server. 
Once upgraded you can follow this steps I wrote to install KVM on CentOS, It's mainly for CentOS 6.2 but I with a few adjustments you can do the same thing on CentOS 5.x.
