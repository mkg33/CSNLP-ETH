After executing the query view the "Messages" output window and save the information. After modifying the query and executing again you can compare the I/O statistics.
Optimizing queries is as much art as science. Try and do the least amount of work possible in a query. Break a query into multiple parts and use temporary tables or table variables to store your work instead of derived tables or sub-queries. If something seems too complicated then it probably is (this is the "art" piece of optimization.)
Finally, learn how to use the SQL Profiler tool to quickly capture and compare lots of statistics like total read, write, cpu & duration (ms) for every query.
And execute this statement before every query to ensure that you are always starting from a baseline:
My only suggestion would be to make sure that you have a good index on the username column, so the lookup can be as fast as possible. Typically optimizations need to happen on frequently used and/or complex queries. For some databases (like Oracle), recomputing statistics on a table can often help as well (since as a table grows, these stats may grow stale, leading to the wrong optimization choice inside the SQL engine).
