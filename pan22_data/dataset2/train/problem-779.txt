Two Domain Controllers. both also DNS servers, clients configured to use both for DNS. That is how it's done.
Typical configurations include at least two domain controllers. Domain Controllers typically act as the primary DNS servers also, so it's good to have your DC's first look at themselves, and then then the other DC for DNS. The same applies to client PC's. 
To make sure that you're clients don't loose internet connectivity, apply a second DNS server IP in the network configuration (such as 8.8.8.8 for Googles DNS). This can be done either through your DHCP server (if you have one) or manually on each client.
We have a Windows 2008 R2 Domain controller and every PC on the network has the IP address of domain controller set under DNS settings.  Is it normal to have the Domain controller also be the DNS server and lose all internet connectivity to all of the computers on the network when the domain controller reboots?  I understand that DNS is a core part of group policy, but how can I make it so all the machines in my network don't lose connectivity when the Domain Controller goes down?  Do people normally have a backup/mirrored DNS or something?  Sorry I'm self-taught and this is how the existing network was setup, before my time.
And perhaps set Google DNS (8.8.8.8 & 8.8.4.4 or OpenDNS) as a lookup in the DNS MMC Snapin on the DCs, though this is not required; it makes me feel a little safer.
