More recently I am wanting to try working with FreeBSD for certain features it has like ZFS and such.
Both have their advantages and disadvantages. A lot of people will probably tell you it boils down to one-system architecture (*bsd) versus the distribution-system of the various GNU/Linux distros. For a good in-depth analysis of the various differences, look at BSD For Linux Users
How much does the administration of a FreeBSD box vary from that of a Linux box? Such as package management, device management, network configuration, etc...
Personally, after using OpenBSD and FreeBSD for many years, I've grown to like their way of doing things, for example the ports tree. But recently I've come across some snags in the BSD way. If you want to live on the edge and use really new software (not versions, I'm talking new stuff that haven't got a huge following yet or is more niche) then a GNU/Linux distro is easier to get working of the bat. At least in my experience anyway. I'm certain you can find BOFHs that disagree ;)
Somewhat of a subjective question, so it kinda depends on your perspective. Package management, device management, network config and similar things are all done with different commands. But the concepts are the same. You have packages (usually), you install them, etc. You have networks, you connect do them. Conceptually, not that much different. Practically, very different. But most of it is pretty easy to pick up and well documented in the FreeBSD Handbook. Best I can say is give it a try and let us know if you have more specific questions.
