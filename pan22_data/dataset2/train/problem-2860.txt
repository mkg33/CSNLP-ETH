I am looking to configure SSL with tomcat 6 and apache web server, using the tomcat connector mod_jk. I am pretty new to this, so please bear with me.
If certificate paths need to be configured in both apache and tomcat, then i have cert.p7b and certreq.csr files, which are surely not apache compatible, can you please tell how can i do that?
I have SSL certificate purchased and configured in tomcat using keystore file. It is perfectly working if access tomcat directly via https. Now i need apache in front of tomcat, my question is, do i need to provide certificate both in tomcat and apache or just the tomcat? Isn't apache supposed to just pass on the request to tomcat (using JkExtractSSL) and let it handle ssl authentication (verification of certificate)?
Important to mention here is there is no SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile configured in httpd-ssl.conf, as i am not sure, if it is needed in both tomcat and apache web server. I have it already configured in tomcat using keystore file.
So based on your response, I generated .cer file from keytool -exportcert command as you suggested. However, now when i start apache, i get the following error:
well, it seems i cannot comment on your post larsks, so i am posting this as an answer. Thanks for your response. It helped me clear few things. 
I did some google and found that "Apache is unable to read the password protected private key" . Is the key not supposed be exported along with the certificate? apparently not. Then how do i make apache read the private key and where do i find the private key?
