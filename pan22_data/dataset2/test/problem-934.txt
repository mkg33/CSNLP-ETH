It seems possible that three monitors might be the best. Two vertical and one horizontal (for testing).
Whichever way you go, I'd recommend sticking with the same style (less distraction), and using a nice multi-monitor tool like UltraMon.
Goes without saying that LCDs are much easier on the eyes than most CRTs.  I found the three 20"s to be the best for me, due to the extra real estate.  Those were 1600x1200, and that was quite a bit bigger than 1278x1024.
Two monitors is more important than big monitors.  Although I would say 19" is the minimum.  24" is great though.  Additionally there are tools to allow better tiling of windows on large screens.
As a developer, I personally I find a second monitor a cute but somewhat redundant addition -- I usually place MSN Messenger, Skype and Process Explorer etc. windows on it. At work I have a decent primary 24" and el-cheapo secondary 22" set up and it's terrific; at home I just use the 24" and don't miss the second monitor all that often.
I second the 24" suggestion. 22" is the bare minimum, but cutting costs on monitors is, I think, one of the least practical strategies; a really good monitor can easily last 5 years in practical use. My personal favorite is the Dell 2408WFP  (updated 2407, which I use at home and enjoy greatly. The HC variant is event better, I think). It has an SD card slot and internal USB hub (both of which are great for developers), and features best-of-breed display quality. Where I come from it's ridiculously expensive, but in the US the price is probably much more reasonable.
For me, three was a good number since I was working on a desktop app with a database backend.  One screen for the IDE, one for the DB, and one for the app to run in works nicely.
While I haven't tried this myself, I saw this at an interview I had. The interviewer had two 20" wide screen lcd monitors turned vertically. It seems naturally better to read code vertically than to scroll down on a horizontal screen.
The 24"s, with a resolution of 1920x1600 looks pretty nice too. Another nice configuration is a 30" with one or two 20"s turned sideways on each side (wingmen).
