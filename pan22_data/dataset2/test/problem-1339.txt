My question is: is there an easy way to check which disks have a bootable MBR with a command line tool or some OS utility? I am aware of the DISKPART tool and its basic functionality, but I haven't found how to view the information I need.
Although Windows does not, to my knowledge, have a built-in tool for displaying raw disk data, it is possible to extract this information through DiskPart. Windows's non-standard naming obscures it somewhat, but both here and in the graphical disk manager, the flag is called 'Active'.
When using compmgmt.msc, [Using Graphical Mode] right-click the 'Disk 1' (or the target disk desired) in the furthest left box, select Properties, select Volume.  The information is displayed.
The computer I am using right now has 6 physical disks attached. Using the BIOS's "select boot device" functionality I have discovered that I can boot off 3 of these disks into the exact same bootloader. This means that all of these disks have the bootable flag set on their MBR, even though I had been under the impression that only 2 of them are in fact bootable.
Shown above are details of an apparently bootable partition. The flag can also be set with a subsequent active or inactive command, or through the graphical disk manager by right-clicking the partitions, then choosing 'Mark partition as (in)active...'.
Above is an example of part of a master boot record. Notice the signature 55 AA at the end. Highlighted in blue is the partition table. Each of the four entries is sixteen bytes long. All but the first are non-bootable (and empty).
When using compmgmt.msc, [Using Graphical Mode] after right-clicking the target drive, select Properties, then select Hardware tab, Click on the target drive in question, Click Properties, Click Volumes, Click Populate, then the desired target drive information is displayed, including the Partition Style.
In the MBR style, the so-called 'bootable flag' resides in the first byte of the partition entry. If the first bit is set, the partition is marked bootable. For compatibility reasons, the other seven bits are usually left at zero, yielding 0x00 for non-bootable partitions and 0x80 for bootable ones.
