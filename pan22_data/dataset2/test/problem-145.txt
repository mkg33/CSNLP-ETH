My problem came from having a .dev domain, which was apparently recently registered as a gTLD and put in a commit to Chrome Canary. I found this out from a recent post I came across as I searched for my problem.
If you are facing the problem on a subdomain then this line in Nginx might cause a problem even if the subdomain is in another server, as the browser will cache this information.
This should take care of it doing any Auto-fill based on your previous browsing. Also, it will remove any of the cookies that could also be causing problems. 
If you have the same problem I do, it appears that the best solution is to change your domain to be something other than .dev. The article suggested .test with a potential solution of .localhost later down the road (via this proposal).
As the other answer said, the only way to stop this once it starts is to clear the browser cache (or wait for the browser to expire the order).
There could be a couple of reasons for this, including plugins but assuming that you do not have any plugins installed you can do the following:
https://www.3rdrevolution.com sends the Strict-Transport-Security header so accessing it over https once will make browsers like Chrome/Firefox redirect http requests to https until some specified point in the future.
A less drastic alternative than clearing all cookies ever is Settings>Show advanced settings>Content Settings>All Cookies and site data then search for the sites in question and clear cookies for only those.
