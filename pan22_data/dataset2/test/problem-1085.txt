To reach your computer B, which is on a totally different network, computer A needs to know how to get to computer B. All computer A cares about is what IP address in its own network can help it get to computer B. This IP does not have to be directly attached to computer Bs network, which it does not seem to be in your case.
Your wlan0 of your A computer exists on its own IP network block, you have not specified the netmask so let's assume it is 255.255.255.0 or /24. In this case, A can reach any system with the IP 64.103.56.1-255 without using a router (those systems of course need to be connected to the same layer 2 broadcast domain, ie. switch).
You need to figure out the routed path between your network A and network B. Your computer A will never be able to directly send packets to a router with IP 10.0.0.251 as it doesn't know how to get to 10.0.0.251, A can only send packets to a router in its own IP network block. This is also everything A needs to care about. When the packet reaches the router connected to network A there needs to exist a route entry in A that knows how to get to B, either by being directly attached to router Bs network or by forwarding the packet to yet another router.
