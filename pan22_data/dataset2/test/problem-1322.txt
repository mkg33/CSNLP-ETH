I'd go with Michael Gaff and then put some money on the hosting company - these kinds of traffic problems very easily occur with failing patch panels, nics, nic driver issues or bad cabling, amongst a thousand other infrastructure things.
Are all the requests coming from the same location, which have the problem?  If so, try another location, perhaps a laptop in a Starbucks or something.  If it happens from more than one location, using different browsers, on a very simple page without AJAX or complicated Javascript, that is valuable information.
The problem was a large number of open TCP connections, a new connections was dropped occasionally because of this.
I'm counting on you having tried this from different locations (or have reports from other places with the same problems) and gotten the same problem regardless so we can rule out a problem at your end, correct?
I'm a hardware freak so, I tend to lean towards hardware failures as the cause for weird software and network issues and mass destruction in general.
If using the IP address works reliably, then it is likely DNS.  Knowing the domain name in use may help narrow it down.
