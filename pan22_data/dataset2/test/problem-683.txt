I have 7 partitions in my single hardisk. One is NTFS where Windows 7 is installed, two are FAT partitions (bigger than all) for storing data files/movies/photos and rest all are ext4 which I use it as Linux partitions. All were OK till few days back when I decided to re-size one of the larger FAT partition to accommodate Linux swap. 
Also every time I try to open any program (especially explorer.exe), windows simply hangs and I have to hard power off the machine. 
I used GParted from Arch Linux to re-size FAT partition and at the end of process it did not show any error. I was able to access and still use the re-sized partition from Linux. However, when I boot from windows 7 and try to access the re-sized partition, it says the partition needs to be formatted before ready for use. I rebooted in to another Linux partition and tried to access files from re-sized partition and I was able to do so. 
I used 'MiniTool Partition Wizard' to check if any bad sector exist. The tool was showing the re-sized parttiion and no bad sector was found on the partition.
