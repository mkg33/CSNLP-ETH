Multiple facilities of the same type might have diminishing returns is that there might be other resources or facilities which they depend on, or which result in bottlenecks, or other limiting situations, such as a road network, or available workers or transportation or fresh water or electricity or whatever.
If you want a generalized equation to mess around with, you could use a cosine graph: A*cos(Bx+C)+D 
But modify it to half a period, so it would include the pseudo exponential rise at the beginning, then a short period of linear increases, to a finally diminishing point of returns. The only problem with this is that it would require to to create a impassable ceiling. So after a certain amount of farms you would see no increase. 
One farm can produce 10 food per day in ideal circumstances, but it requires two farmer-hours per day as well. It also requires one fresh water per food per day, and its own well only provides up to 5 water per day. The rest must be taken from an adjacent stream or river or brought in by transportation. And getting the food to where it needs to be to be useful may also be an issue. Etc. Remove some or add more depending on what you want to represent, but these can be much more interesting and meaningful reasons, which add interest and value to your other game systems, as opposed to an artificial mathematical formula not based on other game elements.
The Image below is a graph of increases in pace for 30 min runs, doing the exact same workout in preparation. It's obviously not perfect, but you might be able to work off this to find what you're looking for. 
Would a linear diminishing return do? production per farm = (1 - (0.05 * (f/10)) ) * production rate. This gives a total production (rate * # of farms) peak at f = 100.
There are formulas out there for a diminishing return equation; however, those usually involve exponential. What other ways are there for coming up with such an equation? Take, for example, the following test case -- One farm produces 10 food, for every 10 farms produced, the production rate drops by 5%.
