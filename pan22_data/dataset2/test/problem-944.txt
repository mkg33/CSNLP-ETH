Now, if you don't have Active Directory, I'm definitely not suggesting running out and setting up an AD forest just for this purpose, but if you do, and if the solution is otherwise applicable to your scenario, you might as well use its functionality to save yourself some work.
I need that my Windows machine, which is part of that network, with update from time to time a very specific A record - so all machines in the network will be aware about it.
Let me suggest an alternate solution. I'm not sure if this will apply to your scenario, but it will apply if you can answer yes to these three questions:
As part of the normal operations of an Active Directory domain, Windows maintains DNS registrations for all member PC:s (unless this has been changed from the default configuration.) A possible simple solution might for you to make a CNAME from your BIND zone pointing at the record in the Active Directory domain. This of course is also dependent on your clients being able to resolve names in your AD domain (which is critical to get right anyway, if you're running AD).
