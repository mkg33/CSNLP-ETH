Perhaps create a folder in the root of a drive (e.g. "E:\TestExport" or similar) so that you have fewer parent folders to worry about, then use this within Oracle to determine if this is the case.
Yeah, I found the solution. It is because my oracle database is located on another computer on the network. So, when I try to export to like 'c:\' directory, oracle is trying to export to its own C:\ directory not mine. 
check the file permissions because the export is done by oracle user whereas the directory belongs to osman user
I just wanted to chime in and share what got me past this error.  In my case (Ora 11.2.0.3 on Win 7) I found I needed the trailing '\' in my directory path.
oracle SQL statement "CREATE DIRECTORY Mydir AS 'C:\Users\osman\Desktop\Export';" can't create any direcotry on Windows or Linux, it's just a mapping between variable Mydir and directory 'C:\Users\osamn\Desktop\Export'
The problem will almost certainly be permissions related.  The user that is running the Oracle database is the user that attempts to write to the file, so check that user can write to the folder in question (and can access it through all the parent folders).
