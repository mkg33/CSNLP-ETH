i found my php.ini file in the etc directory in my remote server, if i wanted to change the file contents, how could i do that, can's i first download the file change it then upload it using ssh clinet? sorry newbie :)) 
As you mentioned, there's also the possibility of downloading the file to your local machine, editing and uploading it back - but in my opinion, that's normally a waste of time since you would only normally change a few config values, for which the server side text editor is just so much quicker to do.
If you haven't neccesary access level to alter the /etc/.../php.ini it's possible that your hosting let's you to modify your php variables via .htaccess files
If doing so you got an error 500 either the syntax of your file is wrong or your hosting don't let you alter php parameter by this method.
To edit the file, issue the command (for example) nano ./php.ini and that will bring up your editor where you can make changes.
If I were you, I'd learn to use a text editor such as nano, vim, or emacs, so that you can edit it directly on the server (after making a backup copy, of course).
