Hi I am running multiple applications on the same machine like Plone which is using ZOPE application server that is running on port 8080 and Tomcat which is hosting multiple web applications and running on port 8081.
The problem is that the configuration works only for either one of the port not for both. For example if the Plone rewrite rule is above it will take the precedence and the other tomcat configuration will not work. Individually they work smoothly.
I want to redirect all my incoming traffic from apache server which is running on port 80 to these server, so that external world will see only apache's default port 80. I tried many configurations for doing the same but none of them seems to be working for both the severs but yes individually if I am configuring its working flawlessly. So, only one configuration is getting used and the other has no effect.
How can I make them work simultaneously for both the servers (Zope, Tomcat) may be even more in future. So, that I can divert all incoming request from apache to these servers and the external world should see only apache in the front not these servers.
