If you do that properly, you break the host/client time loop and all machines should get the proper time.
From an elevated command prompt on the domain members run w32tm /query /source and make sure that the source is your PDCe. Then run w32tm /query /configuration and make sure the type is NT5DS.
The standard setup is to disable the time service on the domain controller and set it up to get an external time.
Describes the steps. This is pretty imperative as otherwise you alck any decent time source (no, computers have lousy clocks).
The Time synchronization Integration Service should be disabled on all domain members that are virtual machines running under Hyper-V, not just the DC. Your PDCe should be configured to sync time with a reliable external time source.
From an elevated command prompt on the PDCe run w32tm /query /source and make sure that the source is a reliable external time source. Then run w32tm /query /configuration and make sure the type is NTP.
On boot up, the virtual machines will get their time from the Hyper-V host (because they have no RTC of their own) and from that point forward they should be syncing their time from the domain hierarchy.
