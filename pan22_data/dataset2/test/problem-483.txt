With this setup I am able to have failover capability, in case a cluster node goes down, and am also able to have live-migration capability, should I wish to switch my virtual machines to a different node.
I haven't tried any other virtualization platforms, but you should be able to do what you want with any of them.  The "magic" really happens with the cluster software, of which I've also not used anything other than Heartbeat+Pacemaker.  
I recently setup Ganeti with a CentOS 6.2 guest server. Ganeti provides both high availability and live migration, however, does not provide automatic failover. One must issue the failover command onto one of the nodes in the cluster to failover the guest to another node. It is one command, but it is not automatic. Ganeti doesn't currently support automatic failover. I am currently researching possible solutions to automatically failover my Ganeti nodes. So far, I've read that Heartbeat and Pacemaker are not viable options due to the way they handle DRBD replication (Ganeti manages all DRBD replication as stands, so it would be a conflict of interest).
RHEV provides all of this and much more. It's free to try for 2 months, and you can always go for the upstream project at ovirt.org
I use Heartbeat + Pacemaker in CRM mode, running on OpenSuSE 11.3 to do this.  Storage for the virtual machines is provided via an iSCSI SAN LUN, managed with LVM.  I have two volume groups, one for domU storage, the other for service data storage.  Since I am not running a cluster aware file system, the cluster is "active-passive"; I can only have a virtual machine running on one node at a time.
