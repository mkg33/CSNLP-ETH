Try deleting any thumbs.db file that exists. You may have to enable the display of hidden and system files to see it. Those files are safe to delete (thumbnail cache) and will be automatically regenerated by Windows.
Right click on the white-space and choose properties.  Alternatively, go up one level and right-click on the "Application Virtualization Client" (or whatever it's called in your case) folder.  Hopefully shadowcopy/previous versions is turned on.  You will see a previous versions tab.  Open a previous version of the folder from before everything got screwed up & rebuild the path.
If your MSOFFICE (or any application) is installed on a different disk than your OS and that disk becomes unavailable or very latent, icons will behave this way.
I had a similar problem.  I have Office 2007 and uninstalled 2010 Starter.  All the icons got screwed up for Word & Excel (the two programs in Starter edition).  I dug in the registry and was able to fix the .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, and I probably could have done with ALL of them, but it would be a painful process.  Then I realized, what if I just put back the Icon Cache folder that was there before!?!?
If you browse to that path, it probably won't work since the folder was deleted when you uninstalled the newest version of Office.  Go back as far as you can, which in my case was "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Application Virtualization Client".  
Oddly enough, Office programs donâ€™t seem to have a user-friendly, built-in associate file-types function like pretty much every other program. Nevertheless, there are a few ways to restore the Office file-type association (though be aware that .docx is also used by WordPad in Windows 7, not just Office).
Just type "winword /r" in your search box or run, and your problem will be solved immediately.  Don't waste time to change IconCache.db because it often doesn't work.
