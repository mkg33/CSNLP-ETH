In my experience using Virtualbox 4.x under a NAT situation, Virtualbox creates a virtual network inside the Host with its own IP range and Gateway (gateway being the host with a static ip) which the VMs live within. All external access is through the NAT'ing gateway on a virtual network adapter separate from any physical adapters and cables.
Should this be successful you will need to ensure the VM providing DHCP gives the same network details as the host otherwise you will loose access to them via the network. However with my little experience of VMWare, you should have a console session available in order to configure the DHCP machine should you loose network access.
Configuring DHCP is one config option ( --dhcp-range ), and its the same with more advanced features.
If you need just simple DHCP server, I would suggest using dnsmasq ( http://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html ). Its a powerful DNS forwarder but comes with integrated DHCP server. I am not sure if you can disable the DNS part completely but should it be problem you can configure it on a different port. 
I'm sure you could use iptables to simply block any incoming DHCP requests from other machines but another option is to set up your DHCP server with just enough scope to supply your VMs, which should have reservations set for each. That way there will be no other addresses which can be handed out, even if the server did happen to receive a request.
DHCP will not traverse outside of a gateway unless it is specifically routed, for example through a VPN tunnel.
Therefore it is possible under Virtualbox, knowing the internal NAT network details, to disable the Virtualbox DHCP server and provide your own from within the virtual network.
