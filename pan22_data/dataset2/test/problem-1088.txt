If I wait a little while after the above error message, the raspberry pi becomes unresponsive (I have tried it connected via SSH and RDP).
I was taking some pictures with it, and it was working fine. Then suddenly, it stopped working after a reboot and gave this error message:
I have tried rebooting, adjusting the connecting ribbon (the little red camera light lit up on start up) and re-enabling the camera through raspi-config.
With me it was because I had mine connected to a large monitor via HDMI. After connecting it to a touch screen (a lot smaller power pull) the camera worked fine.
My experience of this error, other than the ribbon cable coming loose, is there is not enough power available to run the the RPi and camera. Remove any un-needed usb devices or try a different power supply. I have two power supplies rated at 1Amp. With a USB stick that has a light it often gets errors as described, I never have an issue with the other supply.
In my case, the camera was the Arducam Spy Camera.  I got the same error as indicated in the question.  After trying all the other suggestions, I found that the ribbon cable was not staying firmly in the socket.  I added a bit of scotch tape to the back to improve the friction hold, and it started working.
The problem turned out to be the small rectangular pad (labelled "SUNNY"), which was a little bit loose.  Make sure you've grounded yourself to avoid static damage to the camera, then push it into place - this tab is actually a rectangular plug that fits into a socket underneath.
