In India, the quality of power is not good (there are power fluctuations) and not to mention that we dont have continuous power supply 24X7, 
UPS helps in providing the backup power required to clean shutdown your system and save your work in case mains is down.
A couple good answers here already, but it really comes down to you:  what are your work habits, and how much is your time worth?
A cheap (offline/standby) UPS gives you no significant protection from over-voltages (about the same as a surge protector) and will only give you a chance at a clean shutdown.  If you have regular power outages however that itself may be enough.
If you figure a good, cheap UPS is around $100 then, over the life of that (say, 3 years), given the power reliability of where ever you live, what's at risk?  Do you work for hours before saving, or save every 2 minutes?  Does your power go out rarely, or a few times a month?  How much do you worry about losing components to a power surge or brownout?  
There will be almost no damage to your PC during power cuts. It is however possible, that you may loose data. If you are using windows, you can be sure to face some problems as windows 10 or below, yet donot provide for a good crash management. i can however vouch for unix(Mac OS) or linux systems, that you can somehow recover data, if its lost in power cutoffs. Speaking from experience, i couldn't start my Mac PC, after a power cutoff, while i wasn't using UPS. It was easy task to recover data without starting mac os though terminal. But if you're using windows, and if you're unable to start Windows OS, then your data will be lost indefinitely. 
A good (online) UPS gives you some protection against over-voltages (how much depends on the type of online UPS), as well as a chance at a clean shutdown.  Of course, instead of replacing your PC you may simply have to replace the UPS.
