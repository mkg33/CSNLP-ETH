The initial deployment was a little rocky, but it's pretty smooth now, and since it's centralized and can be "clustered" (to a certain degree), we're planning on replacing all of our local "monit" installs.
We use Intermapper extensively. Our Telecom group got it, but it quickly expanded into a unified server/network monitoring tool. We've even written a few custom probes for it.
We monitor some basic system stuff - cpu load, free space, memory. We've also developed some template-like checks that allow us to easily add a new server and it will inherit all the existing monitoring checks, simply based on its group membership.
System Center Operations Manager: Operational Health Monitoring of Windows systems and services.  Also has some new Cross Platform capabilities.  Also does Security Health Monitoring with 3rd party solutions.
Munin is the simplest graphing system I've seen. It's yet another wrapper around rrdtool, but with none of the pain. It takes 5 minutes to get something up and running. Adding new graphs is pretty trivial too.
