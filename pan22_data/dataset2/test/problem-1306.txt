I think you have the versions wrong. Apache 2.2.22 is the version in 12.04. The first version to get 2.4 will be the upcoming 13.10 release. 
So you can set it before running make install and have all files installed in $DESTDIR path. Usually I use it when do some testing with software compiled from source.
Best way is to create/download replacement deb packages so you can rollback/upgrade apache anytime you want, also you must satisfy dependencies. You can create local repository and easily manage updates/downgrades with puppet.
Since I didn't want to upgrade right away, I setup Puppet to compile and install Apache from source. Since this generally takes awhile I was wondering whether I could build and compile Apache and keep reusing the built version? 
I use Puppet to automate setting up servers for work. The only problem with this is that installing the specific version of the software in my stack is a bit tricky as dependencies are sometimes not met. For example, I use Apache 2.2.25 but Ubunu 12.04 currently has 2.4 as the base. 
For the software in production use it's better to make your own package, deb, rpm or whatever your distro use.
