I used an mSATA SSD with an mSATA to SATA converter board and a SATA to IDE converter. I had to cut down the mSATA board so it would fit in the bay - possible because some of the wafer had no circuitry. 
I have just installed a SATA SSD in my 2005 PowerBook G4 17" 1.67GHz running 10.5 Leopard. It is not straightforward swap because you need an adapter which will not fit in the drive bay with a conventional 2.5" laptop drive. mSATA SSdrives are now available and they are tiny. BUT they have a different physical interface to regular SATA - much smaller. 
Yes, it is possible, and I am attempting to do exactly that at the present moment, in 2019, for a computer that was manufactured in March of 2003. You will need to purchase a case that fits the old hard drive space, and then you can easily find an MD-2 type SSD that will screw into that case which will then adapt it to the IDE interface that this laptop accepts. I am awaiting the purchase of an SSD drive from China that will fit the connections and the space. When that arrives, I will reassemble the laptop and let you know if it works. This will replace the older IDE Fujitsu drive at 80GB that did not last very long.
