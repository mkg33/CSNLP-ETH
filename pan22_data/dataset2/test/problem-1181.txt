Just another thought here. Firefox 17, which should launch on November 19 will have an inline pdf viewer. Therefore, you could download Firefox Beta if you don't want to wait. This allows you to have a pdf viewer without any extensions. 
It is currently available for Firefox for Android 11.0 - 16.0a1, Firefox 10.0 and later and SeaMonkey 2.7 and later.
Both Adobe and Foxit offer a web browser plugin.  There are also plain viewer addons like PDFVue, but that one didn't rate particularly well.
For newer versions of Firefox, an add-on which doesn't require the installation of plug-ins is also available. It's called PDF Viewer and is based upon the PDF.JS project.
Note: PDF plug-ins such as Adobe Reader can conflict with the add-on. You'll have to disable these via Ctrl + Shift + A > Plug-ins.
I've installed Adobe Reader. If you go to Firefox -> Options -> Applications you can select that PDFs should be shown within Firefox. Have a look, if your PDF reader is plugged-in there, too.
The most well-known free PDF readers, which both offer a browser plug-in, are Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader.
The open-source Sumatra PDF reader is another alternative. Note: you'll have to enable the installation of the plug-in during the setup.
