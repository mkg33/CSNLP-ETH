There are 2 sources which seem particularly good to me. One, as someone above suggested is Venkat's and Ryan's lecture notes.
For the "classical" (i.e., pre-Dinur) proof of the PCP theorem, I found Prahladh Harsha's thesis the best resource.
This brings me to another source by Subhash Khot. Search for it on Google. You should be able to find those.
I would suggest going through  Eli-Ben Sasson's lecture notes. Also, Prahladh Harsha's lecture notes contain and exposition of both the proofs of PCP Theorem. The link to Prahladh's course can be found on his TIFR webpage (U Chicago Fall 2007). The course notes of Venkat Guruswami and Ryan O'Donnell (as suggested by Hung Q. Ngo) are very good too.
There was a nice tutorial on the PCP theorem and applications a year ago. Their lecture notes should be helpful: Limits of Approximation Algorithms: PCPs and Unique Games (DIMACS Tutorial Lecture Notes)
Currently, this course is being offered at Georgia Tech by Prasad Raghvendra. Sadly the page is not up yet.
Dinur's paper (linked in the answer by Daniel Apon) is well written and worth reading.  An extended discussion was also published about this paper and the proof, which is useful when reading the paper itself: Jaikumar Radhakrishnan and Madhu Sudan, On Dinur's Proof of the PCP Theorem, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 44 (2007), 19-61 (preprint).
(Personally, I have not looked up Khot's notes either, but just remembered that he taught this course once at GaTech as well)
