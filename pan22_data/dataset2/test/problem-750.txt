From the WHS remote access web page, you can access your files, music, documents or whatever. You can customise the pages to a limited extent, but you could add a link to another IIS website on the same server.
Setup a separate box with either IIS or any alternative ASP.Net server and FTP server. I recommend you configure both of those to use non-standard ports, to maximize security, and a firewall to lock down all other unused ports.
You could try a Windows Home Server setup - it is aimed at home users who want to consolidate files, photos, document onto a central server, but it also allows remote access via a custom domain name (yourname.homeserver.com).
A novice inernet site is to hackers like blood is to piranhas.  That said, if are determined to setup your own site, then I am sure that you will learn to fend off attacks, and I wish you luck.
First: Check with your ISP to see if that is or is not a violation of your TOS. Some cable companies get all in a twist if you start hosting a website and you're not using their "screw the small business" package.
recommendation: just rent a windows vps from a reliable data center such as PEAK the same company that host SuperUser.com and StackOverflow.com check them out peakinternet.com
Lastly: Decide what your ultimate goal is. If you are ultimately going to put this on a server with IIS (for work, for someone else, or whatever) you're probably better off starting with IIS. Last thing you need to do is code around some quirk in another server software only to find it jacks with something in IIS.
There are other lightweight web servers out there, and they have been discussed in great detail at StackOverflow and ServerFault.
I hear what you say about wanting experience of running your own webserver.  I considered that option myself.  But I am glad that I stuck with my ISP simply because of hackers, we ordinary webmasters have no idea of their dasterdly tricks.
I recommend building something to your hardware specifications such as large hard disk and or powerful cpu. Than install Windows 2003 or 2008 server on it. After you do that you can use the IIS built in to the operating system, and you could use miniportal for the rest of the services such as pro/pure ftpd, httpd, dns etc...
Second: How much disk space do you really need? You start out saying you don't need it to take up a lot of space, and then say that shared hosting is too small... FWIW 1 and 1 has some decent cheap hosting with enough space for me to run 3 low traffic sites, one of which has the last 2 years of sermons as MP3 available for download.
