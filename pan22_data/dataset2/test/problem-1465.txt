I have about 20 installations of Proxmox around, from single host, to 2-node cluster with drbd arriving to a 5 node cluster on FC SAN (>80VM).
Then Ganeti came along.  It was written for exactly my use case -- n-way clusters using Xen and DRBD.  Those hours of painful, risk-filled operations are now compressed in some cases into a single ganeti subcommand. I love it.  I've migrated most of my VMs into one big 10-node ganeti cluster now.
By the way, even though you're talking about only a 2-node cluster right now, I'm pretty sure that, once you see the utility, you'll find yourself adding nodes and migrating everything you can into virtual machines.  If your clustering platform can support more than 2 nodes, like Ganeti, then you'll be able to do that.
My complaint (possibly based on ignorance) about ganeti: I'm happy to do things at the CLI if necessary, but I don't believe wanting a GUI makes me a wimp.  There seems to be a web-based ganeti management tool, but last I looked, it was VERY far from being plug&and play (e.g. a couple of pages of commands to type in on the host), and in a couple of attempts on a mock server, I never did get it to build and install correctly.
I've also migrated our Windows desktops into a Ganeti/KVM cluster -- Linux only on the desktops now, and they use VNC to get to the Windows VMs.  The big advantage here is easier snapshots and backups, and the ability to sandbox each Windows app into its own VM.
For years I manually managed LVM, DRBD and Xen configuration files in several clusters ranging in size from 2 to 5 nodes -- that was a nightmare.  DRBD made things wonderfully reliable, and Xen made VMs easy to migrate between nodes, but whenever a node failed, I was in for a long, tedious process of creating new LVM volumes, getting DRBD configured and the mirrors rebuilt, then making sure Xen and the other configs were replicated... for a 5-node cluster, keeping things straight in my head could sometimes be painful.  I kept wanting to script it all, but life kept getting in the way.
I've been using Xen since 2003.  I've been using Ganeti for about a year now, and would highly recommend it.  I've never heard of ProxMox.
One of the project main sponsor is the Autrian governament and this ensures that the develop of the product will be financed for a long time. Starting with the version 2.0 even the development process is open (before it was a closed list and you had to request the access to the company behind proxmox).
I don't use ganeti, but I use proxmox and I know it very well. Proxmox VE is a FULLY OPEN SOURCE project and all the code is available with the binaries. The base system is a Debian 64 minimal distribution with a custom installer, but you can also install your Debian system and add the proxmox repositories.
It features a user friendly interface, with almost all the feature found on vSphere, cluster support (based on corosync), HA for VM high availability, automated backup and restore support from interface. It supports also container virtualization with openvz, seamlessy integrated in the same infrastructure and interface of KVM, so you can choose the best virtualization strategy based on your needs.
