I then removed the Control Panel from the start menu and I could search the control panel from the start menu.
Don't know if it will help anyone else but I just got around this by pinning the Control Panel to the Start Menu and then re-indexing everything.
Click on the Windows start button and locate Cortana. Right-click > More > App Settings. Click the 'Reset' button. 
I had one user account this was working for (User1|) & a newer one that it wasn't working for (User2). Copying the files from 
What language are you using? As I was using English (UK) and the control panel items led me to the settings program and the settings program was unable to search. On converting everything to English (US) - the same as my control panel indexing file (C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages\windows.immersivecontrolpanel_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Indexed\Settings) language - the indexing worked fantastically for everything.
Also, in my case search didn't look into control panel until I simply pinned it to the start menu. That is search for Control Panel, right click it, select "Pin to Start".
Hope this helps as it worked for me after looking through forums with similar suggestions to those above.
