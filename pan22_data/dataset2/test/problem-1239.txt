Software called "NTLite" can do this but it's shareware. Is there any freeware alternative to this software? 
I can do these with some (dirty)registry edits and manual deletion of files but i'm pretty sure that there is a high possiblity to damage os. 
How can i customize the operating system i'm currently using? I want to remove some components like "Accessibility Tools" , "HomeGroup", "TelnetServer" , "Windows Firewall" and etc.. I also want to remove some pre-installed drivers and services.
Some Windows 8.1 components, folders and shortcuts are vital for updates to succeed (e.g. folder C:UsersDefaultAppDataLocalMicrosoftWindowsWinX; see http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-8-1-update-fails-to-install). To my own regret, I found that by "cleaning up" some of the shortcuts in thePrograms [All Users] folder, Windows update failed. So rather than try to remove those items, you might be better off hiding them (such as changing a file attribute to hidden) and/or disabling Windows Services associated with some. They take up little room and consume virtually no CPU time.
