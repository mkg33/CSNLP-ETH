Depending on your specific requirement, it could be a good idea to double-check these technical requirements with a security specialist as well.
Your question shows that, right now, you don't know enough about the technical aspects of things and will most likely not succeed by yourself so you need either a lot of additional training or you need help.
You state that you developed the application so you will need to go back to your developers and ask them to write the specifications. They should contains things like:
Get someone who is familiar with Windows Server but also with medium to large deployments or Terminal Services (Citrix would be a good reference). He or she needs also to have a good gasp of security. Give them your documentation and ask them to prepare a technical requirement for your hosting. Be prepared to discuss the ins and out with them and even change plans: some things like high availability are VERY expensive to do right with terminal services.
Explaining you all the details would be out of scope for this place (that's probably a few days worth of consultant work) so let me suggest to you a few steps that you should take first (since I had to answer the same question from several customers over the last 12 years, I'm starting to figure out what the pattern for getting these rights is):
Once you have all this, you will be in a good position to search for a service provider that matches your needs.
