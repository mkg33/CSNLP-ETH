This array, the Dell PowerVault MD1000 is normally connected to a PERC 5E/6E or H800 card, as Robin says you can see the configuration of the RAID controller pressing CTRL + R during the post.
Look through the output of dmesg and lspci. If a RAID card is present, evidence of it should show up in one (or both) of those places.
After a reboot, enter Control - R when prompted and you will be able to get into the RAID BIOS and confirm the config.
It's likely that your server is using some sort of hardware RAID card, not software RAID. When using hardware RAID, the card itself takes care of all RAID tasks, and presents a single volume to the operating system.
If you have Ubuntu or Debian you can install the community version of OMSA, check this link http://dell.to/wcN71S for more info about OMSA.
I am out of means to find out if my server is using RAID or not. If yes, which mode? The server is connected with the disk array box. So I am pretty sure that it's supposed to use RAID. Can it not?
Also, if you have a supported OS (Red Hat or SUSE Enterprise Linux, VMWare ESX), you can install OMSA to see the hardware configuration, the files to install it can be found in support.dell.com.
