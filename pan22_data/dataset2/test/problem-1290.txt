A shocking example of jump-in-hardness arises from the question, "How many satisfying assignments does a planar formula have, modulo $n$?"  This was widely thought to be #P-hard, and it is for "most" values of $n$, but if $n$ is a Mersenne integer (for example $n=7$, because 7 is of form $2^3-1$), then the answer can be computed in polynomial time.
We can consider a parameterized family of distributions, and then talk about what happens when we change the parameter. You might be interested in what is called the threshold phenomenon, "where a system undergoes a swift qualitative change as a result of a small change in a parameter ...". Take a look at this survey: Ehud Friedgut, "Hunting for Sharp Thresholds", Random Structures Algorithms 26, 2005.
Minimum bandwidth problem is to a find an ordering of graph nodes on integer line that minimizes the largest distance between any two adjacent nodes. A $k$-caterpillar is a tree formed from main path by growing edge-disjoint paths of length at most $k$ from its nodes ($k$ is called the hair length). Minimum Bandwidth problem is in $P$ for 2-caterpillars but it is $NP$-complete for 3-caterpillars. 
In many cases, approximating NP-optimization problems give rise to sharp complexity jumps. For example, SET COVER can be approximated within a factor of $\ln n$ in polynomial time (by the Greedy Algorithm), but it is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $(1-o(1))\ln n$.
I think one of the most striking and beautiful examples is the random k-SAT with clause density $\Delta$, the phase transition is really amazing.
I think that it does not make much sense to talk about instances. We can talk about two distribution of input instances with different difficulties, but it would be more interesting if there is relation between the distribution, or between instances in the distributions. 
Here is a very interesting fact, Minimum bandwidth problem is solvable in polynomial time for 1-caterpillars (hair length at most one) but it is $NP$-complete for cyclic 1-caterpillars (in cyclic caterpillar, one edge is added to connect the endpoints of the main path). So, the addition of exactly one edge makes the problem $NP$-complete.
Finding ground state of planar Ising model with 0 magnetic field is in P, with non-zero magnetic field it is NP-hard. Partition function of planar Ising model with 0 magnetic field is in P, with non-zero magnetic field it is NP-hard.
