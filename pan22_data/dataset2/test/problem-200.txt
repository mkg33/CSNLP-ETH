Physically, "drop fiber" tends to be a good choice for applications like this - it's a fairly robust fiber cable that's designed to "act like" telephone cable and is relatively hard to kink or bend too sharply. It also tends to be comparatively inexpensive.
For the fiber itself, it somewhat depends on what you are interfacing to, but in general, at this time, Reduced Bend Radius Single-Mode ends to be the best choice.
I am assuming this problem/solution would also be applicable to a building with old copper infrastructure so hope it can help other folks as well.
In any case you'll want an "outside plant" type fiber, since it's in conduit underground and exposed to moisture as a result. So long as it's not more than 50 feet inside the house or room, that's fine; and "indoor/outdoor" type cable can be used if there's more than 50 feet inside the buildings.
Cabling from the [room] to the [box] is from 1990s phone infrastructure, copper. From the [box] to [home] it's cat6 but only 2 of the 8 is used like good old days as noone around here has any networking knowledge and assume all cables are like old phone lines.
The result is a 2/3mb internet speed at home. The saddest part is there also is fiber that arrives to the [room] but obviously it's kinda useless because of [room] to [box] part.
Apparently from [room] to all [box]es around the compound there are housing pipes so it's possible to replace cables relatively easily without digging. Obviously everyone has this problem so even though people don't understand what causes it they're willing to invest to upgrading.
Assuming everyone wants to use fiber going forward and with these constraints what would be the best practice for an upgrade to this system? It would be great if you could also mention if there are any hardware requirements for the [room] and the [box].
I have a cabling challenge: we live in a compound that has a cabling room [room] to where all telecom infrastructure (copper and fiber services) arrive. That [room] is ~300 metres to our home [home]. The cabling then arrives to a box [box] in our street (10 metres to home) and from there it comes [home]. Telco operators only undertake work until the [room].
