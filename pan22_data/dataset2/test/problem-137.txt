Windows 10 has been crashing on keypress every 8-12 work hours for around 6 months now and it was stable before. No problems with hours of gaming with a gamepad. Major things changed between now and before are new GPU and installation of Docker. Can't tell if crashes started at the same time and can't afford to remove either.
Bug check string in these situations is always DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL and BlueScreenView shows ntoskrnl.exe to be the culprit.
I estimate the crashes happen roughly every 8-12 work hours. I write code, so that's a lot of keypresses.
Any search so far have yielded either too broad results or none at all, so I thought I'd see if anyone here has heard of anything similar.
During my previous employment my PC was mostly crash-free. Between that and my current employment I've upgraded my GPU. Since there was months of unemployment in between, I hadn't noticed similar crashes then. For my new job I had to install Docker but I can't even say if the crashes started at the same time. Can't really afford to test either one blindly.
My work involves a lot of typing and most of the time the BSOD happens exactly (audio buffer starts looping the exact moment) when I press a key on my keyboard. I've noticed this mostly in Command Prompt, Atom or while typing something in Chrome. On the other hand I can play games for hours without problems using a Xbox One gamepad.
