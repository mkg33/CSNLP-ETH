For your third question, in some cases, yes, you can make a backup off of a replica, instead of the primary. If you can manage it, doing the basebackup and archiving off of a replica is the way to go, because taking a basebackup generates a lot of I/O, and it affects your OS filesystem cache. Unfortunately, it is not supported until 9.2+ with pg_basebackup, so you'll need to use an external tool such as OmniPITR or to upgrade your version of PostgreSQL. So long as you have the WAL to go with it, there shouldn't be any timeline issues or consistency issues with the snapshot from the replica.
I would recommend using a specific solution such as WAL-E, barman, or OmniPITR to make the logistics of managing basebackups and WAL archives easier on yourself, or using pg_basebackup. Some of these tools, depending on the versions, will allow you to back up off your replica, which will reduce load on your primary server, and not push data out of the filesystem cache, which are all very good things.
For your second question, either one works well, though, pg_basebackup is easier to use and requires less of your own assembly. If you use rsync in your own script with start and stop basebackup, you have to check the exit code of every command. If you don't and a command fails, you can end up with a corrupt basebackup that's useless. The above mentioned tools, along with pg_basebackup, take care of all of those pedantic details for you.
So that is not ideal, and most people tend to take a backup on a schedule that allows them to meet recovery requirements, and sometimes keep multiple basebackups as their storage allotments allow. 
Finally, a lot of your questions and best practices are covered in the following talk from Magnus Hagander at PgCon 2013: PostgreSQL Backup Strategies
A general rule I've heard and use myself is if I take weekly basebackups, keeping around 3 weeks of WAL segments and 2 basebackups allows me enough peace of mind to have at least one known-good backup, and a known-good set of WAL, and a fairly reasonable restore time. I am a huge believer in testing the backups I take regularly.
Additionally, with a very, very, very large WAL archive, sometimes things can happen with individual WAL segments (which is why you always test your backups), and if a WAL segment fails to restore, no following segments will restore, and you're out of luck.
For your first question, you have to consider that if you take a single basebackup and just keep archiving WAL segments, the time to restore will grow longer with each WAL segment you archive, as it takes a significant amount of time restore each file.
