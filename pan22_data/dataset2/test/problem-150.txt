I tried to strip Windows to the max, stopped all unnecessary services, removed features, followed many performance enhancing guides..
[Linux is pretty efficient, and you might try booting temporarily into Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or other distro from a USB drive, to see if you can play video without artifacts. There's no need to actually install the OS, just test to see if it's faster than Windows 8.]
Are you using the older Media Player Classic, or the newer Media Player Classic - Home Cinema, http://mpc-hc.org/, which plays 1080p video even on my vastly underpowered Acer D250 with 2 GB RAM and Intel Atom CPU. It may take some twiddling with settings to get the best display. Before investing in hardware, try the free software. 
It has Windows 8 installed and it can play some 720p videos, depending how they're compressed, even when it can play them fairly OK it still chops during fast motion scenes..
I wonder if it's going to bypass the weak video card in the PC and use the USB converter adapter instead. Is that possible?
I'm looking for advice on how to increase video playback performance, I'm thinking of getting a USB-to-HDMI adapter that supports 1080p resolution, example:
Try using a different video player that support GPUs better. I would say your CPU is the bottleneck however as opposed to @rrirower. Try using VLC or CoreAVC.
