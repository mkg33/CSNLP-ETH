I am in an environment where all the machines are behind a switch that I don't have access to.  Each ethernet wall port has limited bandwidth depending on how much has been paid for each port. The problem is that some people have 10Mbps connections and some have 100Mbps connections and this causes problems with local intranet file transfers and operating system/software deployments. Operating systems can take hours to be deployed if the machine is on 10mbps.
Enterasys switches have ACL functionality built into their switches that fully supports this sort of thing.  Make sure you get one of their switches that has this functionality built-in and turned on (the B series has it but as a licensed feature; the C series has it as part of the core functionality).
For example, the internet might be limited to 10Mbps, but internal servers would get gigabit speeds?
If you don't mind installing an additional PC to act as a bridge on the network, this software may be of help.
Do you know if it is possible with most switches to set a rule that would limit bandwidth coming in/going out to an extranet, but keep full bandwidth if the packets are destined to go to a local machine?
I like putting my rate limiting and other ACLs as close to the user as possible, ideally at the port the user is connected to.
On Cisco routers you can use rate-limit based on an ACL that would do just that.  I am not sure about switches though, so not sure if this information helps you at all (Other than maybe if these are catalyst switches it give you a keyword to google or try from ios):-/
