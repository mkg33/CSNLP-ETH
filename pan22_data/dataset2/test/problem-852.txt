I have a Zabbix configuration problem here in the company a few days ago. I'm having this error on the hosts page in the Settings portion. I have already done several tests, being:
I do not know what this network problem can be, I'm a beginner in linux and I'm having a bit of trouble correcting this without having to configure a new server.
UPDATE 2: I identified that the server did not contain the google DNS (8.8.8.8) configured in: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 so I added this registry and it solved the network problem, now it's ping google.com , before of this was only the internal DNS of the company. But the initial problem still persists and I think there may be some relationship with network configurations
UPDATE: I noticed that the server apparently has some network problem. I have managed to install normal zabbix using yum in Centos 7. However, the server is taking too long to ping google.com and is missing the settings in the resolv.conf file.
If you can help me thank you, I only need this communication so I can proceed with the finalization of the installation.
