For me the problem appears to be with a McAfee security program. Last year I got the program with an internet subscription and the problem started. After deleting the program, the problem went away. Yesterday I got the McAfee again through a Spectrum service and the problem popped back up. I will be deleting the program and am sure that the problem will be gone. 
Using the clean reboot, I hid all the Microsoft services and disabled the other services on the PC until I was able to isolate the service that was resetting the taskbar back to 1 line. On my PC it was the  "Intel(R) HD Graphics Control Panel Service". By disabling this service I can set my taskbar to any size and it will be maintained across system restarts.  It does not matter if the taskbar is locked or not before the reboot. The size of the taskbar remains the same as the last setting.
Is there a fix for this, registry or otherwise? I already checked "Taskbar settings", but to no avail.
I set my taskbar to auto-hide and a height of two rows of icons/buttons. But each time I restart the PC the height is reset to one row. (Auto-hide is preserved.)
On another computer running the same Windows build (10.0.15063) the two row height is preserved between restarts.  
My taskbar height kept reducing with each restart until it was a single bar in height.  Strangely enough the taskbar was locked after resizing and this happened.  However, if you leave the taskbar unlocked after resizing it retained the intended height, go figure!  Just size it and leave it unlocked. Seems to work for me.
This was a brand new install of Windows 10-Pro 64 bit that had all the latest updates applied (As of July 18,2019).  Motherboard was an ASUS Z87-Pro motherboard with Intel Z87 Express Chipset.
