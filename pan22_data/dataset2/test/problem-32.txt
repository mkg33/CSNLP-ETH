At the high end of the scale you have Storage Area Networks (SANs) but these are designed to allow many operations from vast numbers of separate clients in parallel; a benefit of this is that the throughput is very high for a small number of connected machines, but is likely overkill for your needs, and very expensive. At the low end, you have Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices that others have mentioned, but although much simpler than a full server, I don't recommend them since a NAS is frequently a black box; they're designed to be plug & play for most users, and as a result you have little control over the OS - I have just had to send back a small NAS I bought for a client's office as it became unstable after a day's use.  
You could buy a pre-made rackmount server from Dell or HP and use the hardware RAID card, or if you're more of a hardware person, you could buy a cheaper chassis from Supermicro and build the storage machine yourself, using software RAID in either Windows or Linux. Hardware RAID is often faster when a RAID1 is involved, since software must write to each disk in turn and wait for the write to complete before moving onto the next operation; a RAID card can generally write to both disks in parallel, and cache the write operation, returning control to the OS immediately. Do note, however, that although a RAID0 would be even faster, you have no redundancy and a single drive failure will cause complete data loss; never use a RAID0 when you have data that you want to keep. I recommend contacting Dell or HP or another big name to see if they can help you spec out a system to meet your needs.  
If you stick to SATA disks, implementing 10Gb ethernet and building a reasonably sized RAID10 on the server will net you a noticeable performance increase beyond that of a single SATA disk. This will be a worthy investment because you can share the server among as many workstations as you need, and add in the future by adding switches. You'll need to run Cat-6 ethernet cable, as Cat-5E won't cut it - don't forget to add this expense to your calculations. You could also add SSDs as cache to speed the system up even further; since you're working with video footage, I assume you need vast amounts of storage space, which would be extremely expensive to build purely with SSDs.  
Another advantage to building a server is that you're concentrating all your footage in one place, which makes it practical and relatively easy to back it up regularly. Never neglect your backup strategy; one day you'll need to depend on it!
