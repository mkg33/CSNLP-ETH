I have a custom built desktop, built by myself over time. In the past few days, I noticed Overwatch (game) was running abnormally which I've had no issues before. Yesterday, I decided to do some maintenance. I dusted all the fans (little dust as I have pretty good airflow [Full+ tower]. I also cleaned and reapplied thermal compound to both my GPU and CPU. Last night, it ran 'fine' but was still 80 deg C with some studdering. Framerate was not dropping according to in-game debugging and network issues are definitely not the problem. Today, it hasn't gotten any better. Idle, it will go into thermal shutdown. 
-Tried a fresh install on a different hard drive (to see if some software setting was the issue, no difference, 80C idle immediately)
Thermal shutdown when idling can only mean that the CPU is not getting cooled at all. There is no other hardware component that can be causing this - it is either the CPU or the cooler.
So, did you verify that the Water Cooling Kit is operating properly? Simply checking that it gets power is unfortunately not enough. For example, the pump might be clogged, stalled, or even broken and still be drawing power and even buzzing gently.
The H110i should have an USB diagnostic connection that can be used. Or you can gently squeeze one of the water tubes - the tube should give a distinctive thrumming when the fluid passes through. And of course the air from the heat exchanger should be slightly warm. Also, if you hold the cooler in your hand while it's working, you should feel it cold and remain cold. If it warms after a few minutes, the cooling is obviously not happening.
Please help. I have no idea what else it could be besides failing hardware but have never had this issue due to old or defective hardware. I can live with high temps but now it's shutting off.
-Lowered thermostat in house (current ambient temp is 80 Fahrenheit, but I've had much worse and doesn't help)
Before you answer, here's my background. I'm not an idiot and computer hardware isn't foreign to me. I am a computer science major and have been working with them (professionally and as a hobby) for years. I've build computers before and helped others. Respectfully, PLEASE don't ask stupid questions like "did you put the paste on the side of the CPU WITHOUT the pins"? Also, please don't be a smart ass and say "Oh Windows 8.1. There's your problem"
