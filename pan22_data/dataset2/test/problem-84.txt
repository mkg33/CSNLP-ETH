If your network connection changes, Windows checks HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet\EnableActiveProbing value in the Registry and, if it is set to 1, Windows (actually, Network Location Awareness service) tries querying the server specified by HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet\ActiveWebProbeHost value, which, by default, is set to www.msftncsi.com.
In case ActiveWebProbeHost (www.msftncsi.com) cannot be reached, it assumes you might need to authenticate to the network and it helpfully opens your IE homepage (http://www.msn.com) via the default browser (Chrome) for you. As your connection is actually working and you do not need any additional authentication, you end up with MSN page opened in Chrome.
In your case, I am pretty sure you can solve this by changing EnableActiveProbing value in the registry (under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet) to 0. Yet, I would consider this more as a workaround than the solution of the root problem.
If you are curious about the underlying problem, you might want to confirm that HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet\ActiveWebProbeHost is indeed set to www.msftncsi.com and not some other hostname and, if it really is, try pinging this hostname once the VPN connection is established, to make sure the host is really reachable through your OpenVPN tunnel. In case it is not, you can try setting HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet\ActiveWebProbeHost to a different hostname, which you are sure is reachable.
