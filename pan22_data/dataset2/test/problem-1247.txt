Your networking is quite messed up, and you don't tell anything about your private NIC configuration, but I'll give it a try.
Finally, you are mixing the terms "private" and "public" here; in cluster terminology, the "public" network is the one through which flows all communications between the nodes and the rest of the world, while the "private" one is only for the cluster nodes to talk between themselves. This means the DC should be on the "public" network, not on the "private" one.
First of all, you can't use a default gateway of 192.168.106.1 on a computer which is connected to the 192.168.1.0/24 network; there's just no way that computer could actually reach the gateway. If VMware has automatically configured your virtual network to use the 192.168.106.0/24 subnet, you need to either stick to it or configure it to use the same subnet you want to use for your VMs (192.168.1.0/24). For the sake of simplicity, let's just assume you don't change anything: then, your main network should use the 192.168.106.0/24 subnet, and your virtual servers should be configured accordingly.
Your setup should include three networks (public, private and iSCSI); as I said above, the main network should use the same subnet where your default gateway resides; you are free to choose any other subnet for the other two networks.
Then there's the iSCSI setup; while it is possible to run iSCSI on the same network used for public cluster access, this is definitely not a proper setup; you should use a dedicated network for iSCSI. You aren't saying where you are actually running your StarWind software, but chances are you are running it in another VM. You should add another NIC to that VM and to the two cluster nodes, and use those NICs for iSCSI (BTW, if it's a Windows Server 2008 R2 VM, you don't need the StarWind software: Microsoft offers a free iSCSI target software for this system; see here). You should configure your iSCSI target software to offer its services on the iSCSI IP address, and then configure the cluster nodes to use that IP address as their iSCSI target.
