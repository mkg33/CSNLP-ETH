You can check Portable Linux Apps. Just download portable binaries and make them executable. all the needed dependencies are included in the binary.
To make any app portable, you might be able to make symlinks that you put in the home folder when you log in; the app will save preferences through the symlink to wherever it leads, say the flash drive. I've used this for portable Minecraft saves.
Linux for Travelers tracks this topic and has several tricks to get around the fact that there aren't (yet?) portable apps installs aimed at Linux - likely for the reason you mentioned: if you have install privileges already adding new applications is easy enough to not need using your portable ones.
The problem with running apps on existing Linux systems is that often apps are compiled to use shared libraries. There are many Linux distributions and many versions of base libraries. If you are lucky, the existing Linux system will have the same versions of them and your app will be linked against the correct version of libraries. If not, it won't work. A workaround would be to compile the apps you need with statically linked libraries, but this leads to much bigger program sizes.
There's a new player on the field, AppImage. Applications are packaged as a single file, with all dependencies included, so they may be run regardless of the underlying distribution.
