I've previously had experiences where the PSU fan would spin up fine, and even reported correct voltages on a PSU tester, however soon as it was put under load it would die and simply leave a single light on the motherboard flashing weakly.
Pull out all adapter cards and all but 1 known good memory DIMM. If there is no integrated video on the motherboard then install a known good video card and connect it to a known good monitor. (At times like these I'm glad I still have some ancient PCI video cards I can use as an alternative).
All the fans are moving: psu, gfx, cpu etc, so I don't believe it's a power issue. Here are the specs I know of:
Power up the computer and see if you can get into the BIOS. If you can't then I would suspect either a motherboard (my bet) or PSU problem. 
The only way I know how to approach situations like this is to isolate the problem by trial and error. It's tedious, but it's all I can recommend.
The computer in question worked last week. It's brand new, never been connected to the internet, up-to-date parts, etc.
Remove all USB devices except those absolutely needed to boot. (I'd frankly try booting at least once with no mouse and keyboard just to see if anything shows up on the monitor).
Last week, I installed some 3D software on it, then shut it down and waited for the license files that arrived this week. I've done this to 4 other PCs with the same hardware and software.
and a handful of other things like switching which port it's plugged into before and after a restart. I have the driver disc, and a windows reinstallation disc, but they won't do me any good because no display at all for any interval of time.
If you verify that all the parts are good by testing them in other systems and this system still doesn't work then I don't know what else it could be but the motherboard.
I'd be tending to agree with BloodPhilia and irrational John however it's probably worth testing another PSU to make sure it's not that before you send the motherboard back.
If you can reach the BIOS with parts removed, then start restoring the components to see where it starts to fail again.
(Well, it could possible be a bad connection. Reseating the adapter cards, RAM, and power connectors usually fixes that though. Sounds like you have covered that already though.)
EDIT:: Another thing I wanted to mention is when I plug in a keyboard, it's not detecting it at all. This keyboard works on other PCs, but it's not getting any power from this one (no caps, num, scroll lock lights working)
I tend to agree with BloodPhilia's post, it sounds like the motherboard or some other basic hardware failure.
Start by stripping the computer down to bare essentials. Completely disconnect all the hard drives, both data and power.
