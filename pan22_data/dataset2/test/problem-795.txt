You will find that the reason you could drag maximized windows was that your T410 had the nVIDIA screen drivers installed.
On my current Windows 7 install (relatively stock from Lenovo) I cannot click-and-drag on a maximized window and drag it onto my second monitor.
You need to "Restore" (or "un-maximize") the window before you can drag it to the other monitor, and then "Maximize" it again from there.
If you can't see the title bar to access the Restore and Maximize features, you can press Alt-Space, then the letter "R" to restore the window.  Then, if you still can't see it, press Alt-Space again, then the letter "M" to move the window, then use the cursor keys to move the window around if the mouse isn't doesn't move it.
I'm sure there's some Windows config/registry setting that enables "detaching and dragging" of maximized windows when click/dragging on the title bar of a window, but I can't find it on Google or here.
I have the same problem now that I have a new laptop: I can no longer drag maximized windows to the other screen and it is really annoying once you have got used to it!
Although this doesn't aid you, at least you now know it is not a Windows setting but something enabled by a 3rd party.
