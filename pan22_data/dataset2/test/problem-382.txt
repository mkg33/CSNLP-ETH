I can unlock the PDF in Adobe Reader, but it's not allowing me to save a copy without including the password protection. I've also tried unlocking and then printing the document to PDF but Adobe is smart enough to stop that too.
It's geared toward Air Printing for iOS devices but it works for OSX too. It allows you to print to a local folder on your hard drive, dropbox, or real printers etc.  
I'd like to install a postscript printer in OSX and choose that as my printer option when Adobe asks me to select a printer. Is this possible somehow?
Years ago I have used Ghostscript and GhostView to circumvent DRM, as these products used to simply ignore the DRM and let me freely access the PDF. I don't know if this is still the case today.
This particular PDF cannot be opened in Preview.app so I'm stuck opening it in Adobe Reader.app. This is particularly annoying because Preview is much better than Adobe Reader and I'd love to use Preview.
It's a simple virtual printer that fools Adobe Acrobat into thinking it's printing to a physical device.
