What is the best method for me to get the information out of  my RFID key and save it so I may put that information into a new more powerful RFID key/card
3. a more powerful RFID key for the key to register on the sensor which is about 2 feet from the front door, so a RFID card/key that can send a RFID signal 5ft
There are several types of RFID tag. Most are passive, this means that the detection range for a specific type of tag is mostly dependent on the RFID reader. 
If you know the details of your tag, it may in principle be possible to find a larger tag (with a bigger aerial) or a battery assisted tag that would be activated at a greater distance. 
You would probably have to be able to register the new tag with the reader though. RFID tags for opening locks are likely to be carefully designed to resist duplication.
As of right now I know almost nothing about RFID's but I am willing to learn anything I need to. My goal is to be able to create a copy of my apartment RFID door key that is more powerful  so I do not have to press the RFID key/card against the sensor next to the door to open it, my goal is to walk up to the door and have it read the RFID key/card from my pocket.  Since the RFID reader is something outside of my control, I want to create a RFID key/card that is powerful enough to send its signal about 5ft from where it is.
