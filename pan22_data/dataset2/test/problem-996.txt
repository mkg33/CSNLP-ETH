You might also want to try the check_snmp_int plugin, here: http://nagios.manubulon.com/ I think it will work with switches, but you'd have to double-check to be sure.
There are doezens and dozens of brand-specific SNMP plugins on http://exchange.nagios.org and http://www.monitoringexchange.org that will do this. On Nagios Exchange, for example, there are 37 plugins in the "Cisco" category.
Are you sure you don't want a tool like MRTG? That's made for this sort of thing. The only wa i can think of would be using an SNMP GET from Nagios, but I've never used it for that... most of my remote stuff has been through NRPE.
Once you've found a comfortable way to poll the data you're looking for, PNP4Nagios will give you a pretty good way to graph it automatically.
For this kind of thing I use MRTG to record and graph the traffic and Nagios to alert based on what MRTG reads. Check out Nagios plugins such as check_rrd_bw.
Whether or not MRTG is a good answer to this question depends on what the asker means by "monitor"; MRTG will make nice graphs, and gather the data for you, but it does no alerting. Using check_mrtgtraf, you can have nagios "monitor" the MRTG data, this is a lot of work unless you already have MRTG set up.
