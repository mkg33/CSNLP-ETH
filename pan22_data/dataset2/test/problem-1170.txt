First, VMware products are pretty good. Virtualbox is still somewhat unstable on a Windows host (but is fine on Linux from what I hear).
Now, before you plunk down any points at all on this answer, keep in mind that I do not use this software in a production environment, I'm only pointing out the built-in limitations of it.  Instead of following up with a comment (which tends to get lost) I thought I would leave an answer.
If you require more control over how the virtualization works (networking setups, cpu affinity and the like) AND have hardware that ESXi will deal with -- ESXi is probably the way to go.
I know this is not about choosing hardware, but one thing to consider when using the Opteron 8 and 12 core cpus, is that Vmware ESXi free license will only be capable of using 6 cores per cpu. For that reason, a good 4c or 6c intel xeon will give a lot better performance than a 12c opteron (of which 6 cores can be used). 
Personally I've found the VMware Server configuration more flexible in terms of spinning up and moving VMs; however ESXi gives you a better chance of giving guaranteed levels of performance to your VMs.  ie: if you are just playing around, VMware Server is the way to go.  If you are going production, go ESXi.
Other than mentioning that you have a 64 bit AMD CPU you tell us nothing about your hardware. You also haven't hinted at the reason for wanting another OS on the machine. Are you going to use it for "real" work or just want to have a bit of a play with another OS or two?
If you have a fairly beefy server such that your Win2K3 Server will not be starved for resources, AND won't be running work loads that require lots of I/O, then running VMware Server on Win2K3 will probably be acceptable.
As long as your hardware is supported on ESXi, and isn't not missing any features you want, go for that. No only is it faster for the guests, but it's incredibly stable, whereas running vmware server can only be as stable as the Windows install it's on, which leads to either an unpatched, unmaintainted host, or frequent downtime as you reboot the host to patch it. Enabling SSH on your ESXi machine, and using some of the ghetto scripts can add back features you need.
If you plan on going the ESXi route, I would seriously look at how much hardware you can pack into the machine for the forseeable future, because that's going to be your limiting factor.  If you know that you'll never run more than 2-5 server images, then you're probably going to be fine.  But if you plan on hosting several simultaneous images (1 more than the number of cores available to you) or you have very fluid requirements (lots of images coming and going, or on-demand services), the missing ability to migrate images and perform other feats that are only found in its big brother (ESX) will become readily apparent.
If you are going to use virtualisation you really need multiple CPUs. Multiple cores could be used but will still cause a bottleneck if you're going to do anything heavy. As a simply guide, you need the same amount of everything as if you were to run two independent physical machines PLUS the overhead your virtualisation software requires. Can your hardware cope?
Not that I have anything against ESXi, but it is a "lightweight" offering meant to be an enticement once you start to outgrow the box you're on, at which point some money to the fine folks at VMWare will propel you forward to bigger and better things...
