The other scenario where the "beefiness" of the server matters would be if you're using it as a build server (where you're running something like CruiseControl or Hudson as a continuous integration platform.  Then the speed will matter since you're actually going to be doing something on the server other than simple tasks...
Here at work, a small Flash game developer, I've been tasked with setting up an SVN server. I need to advice the boss on what machine he should buy.
subversion itself is pretty light.  Trac and MediaWiki are pretty light as well.  So your hardware should be fine (I run subversion on a tiny linux VM with 256mb ram and it runs fine).  
The server will run SVN, Trac and MediaWiki and the repository will contain fairly large binary files. We are with 10 people, and the server will be accessed over LAN.
Basically, for your use case (with only 10 users) any server should be fine.  The more RAM the better (Since MySQL can perform better with it), but it's not absolutely necessary.  If you ever decide to make the server public, then you have a different issue...
