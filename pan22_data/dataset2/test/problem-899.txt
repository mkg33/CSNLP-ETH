In any case, if you wanted to load test your device, you would need the ability to generate sufficient and relevant load from inside your networks, which means deploying enough servers with a load testing tool, setting the tool up with your specific test cases, running it and then analysing the results.  Sounds like you may have a few test cases, but have a look at this slide deck first and go from there:
Analysing the result is usually the most challenging part, because you have to sift through a lot of data to understand what happened (or didn't happen).
There are commercial tools you can use, such as NeoLoad or free ones such as JMeter.  In any case, it is up to you to select the best tool, that closely meets your objective(s).
You are correct to say that most firewall/appliance vendors overestimate the throughput of their devices (some by measuring UDP throughput, rather than TCP).
You can also hire a 3rd party, however they are usually not cheap (the ones that know what they are doing anyway).
