If you just want to get on and take a look from software, look at Remote assitance built in to Windows - Go on MSN and ask her to click on "ask for remote assistance" is the quickest way.
Get on their desktop remotely, check event logs, check the startup programs, check the services running. You can't really go into the BIOS using the above programs, but you could get the update for them and tell them how to install it step by step. Update the drivers on the machine and run a scan for malicious software (note that a chipset update will probably disconnect your session if the NIC is onboard). If it seems to be a hardware issue, you may have to tell them to bring it in to a shop.
I personally use Crossloop with my friends/family. It is very secure, and requires that the party you want to control shares a code that changes every session. And when you do connect the user has the ability to deny you. It also has built in file transfer support. Best part is you don't need to open anything in the firewall/router.
As the problem seems to be that the system is freezing, there is no use in using whatever remote access system per se. Remote access tools (I recommend FogCreek Copilot) help you getting the information about the cause of the freezing from the remote computer.
Well, it doesn't directly solve the problems from a distance, but you could use the built-in Remote Desktop feature or Remote Assistance from within MSN Messenger. You may want to look into TeamViewer as well if the previous 2 give you problems.
If it is BIOS issue, or you need a bit of extra control - you may like to buy a KVM over IP, I cannot recommend any over any others but I can say these come in very useful and it is nice to have one hanging around that you can post to people in situations like this!
Next, if you are still unsure once you are on, ask about the problem here. Hopefully it is just driver issues, in which case you can do from software - if it is hardware problems such as hard drive or PSU etc, you will not be able to help without seeing the computer. 
I've used mikogo for that. Quite easy to use. Set up a meeting. Let her connect. Switch the presenter request for control.
