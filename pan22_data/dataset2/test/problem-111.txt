Unfortunately, you're probably going to have to give Microsoft a call to straighten it out. If your copy is legit, then it should work out. But, I agree, it is a pain.
I've had the same issue with Office 2007 when I changed the motherboard. I reactivated Office by calling a special phone number (in my country) and following several steps. After that, it was reactivated again. The procedure is described here.
Phone Microsoft and tell them the story. I know windows binds to the mobo... If you replace the mobo, windows will no longer pass the Genuine advantage. I assume Office is the same.
Sounds like Microsoft ties their software to your hardware. Since you're hardware changed, they assume that it is pirated.
This might be an opportunity to explore the alternatives, such as OpenOffice.org.  No purchase costs and no licensing issues.  But, as others have said, with enough time on the phone to Microsoft support they will probably allow you use the software you paid for on your computer again.
