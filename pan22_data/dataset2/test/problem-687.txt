The DVDs I have are in standard DVD format, and can easily be played by a normal DVD player. However, when I tried importing them into Live Movie Maker to do some editing, only a small part (I believe the 1st chapter) is seen by the program, and the rest is ignored.
You'll need to get the video off of the DVD using software like Handbrake, and then opening it using Windows Live Movie Maker.
I think that Movie Maker should be able to load this video, because it is the same format and no recompression was made so there is now quality loss. 
Movie Maker probably won't import directly from a DVD since most DVDs are copyrighted. (Standard video DVDs are a little more complicated than just a video file on a disc, which would be a data DVD.)
I really enjoy using Windows Live Movie Maker to preform basic edits on my home videos. Recently, I've been given some older home videos that were taken using a Canon DC-210, which is one of those video cameras that saved the video directly to a DVD.
I would use Avidemux to load the first larger VOB file from the DVD and Avidemux automatically indexes it and asks whether to append the other ones. Select yes and after loading the whole video select in the left panel Copy both for Audio and Video and save the video (Ctrl+S) with the "mpg" extension (Avidemux often forgets to add a extension).
