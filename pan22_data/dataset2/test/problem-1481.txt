And one other thing, if i have written one line, and moves the marker back to an earlier command (marker is where the ^ is):
Because of that difference, PowerShell allows you to override the tab-completion functionality with your own function.  I haven't had time to mess with this myself, but you basically override the function tabexpansion in your profile, the same way you can override the prompt function.
"Get-PSS^ | Remove-PSSession" auto completes to "Get-PSSession^", removing all trailing commands. In bash the trailing commands would still be there unaffected. Is there a way to make Powershell not remove the trailing commands when auto completing? 
For example: Get-PS expands to "Get-PSBreakpoint" which is the first matching command. In bash if there is only one command matching bash will expand to the matching command. If there is several hitting tab once does nothing, double tapping tab will show a list of matching commands but not expanding. Is there a way to make Powershell behave like this?
I found this article, by Lee Holmes (author of the awesome Windows PowerShell Cookbook), that describes a tabexpansion override that is very similar to what you're looking for.  You could probably tweak it to give you exactly what you want.
A bonus would be to get CTRL+L to clear the screen. CTRL+A to go to the beginning of the line, and CTRL+E to go to the end of the line.
I love Powershell, but coming from a Linux background there is a few things that is really bugging me. Like for example how the default auto completion works.
PowerShell uses its own parser for commands, so in a sense it is a different shell than cmd.exe, even though they share the same terminal (gui window).
