Hi Ryan, I think you are asking the wrong question. Of course what you are asking is technically possible. In fact arrangements have been made in the past to that effect.
If they are spending days, and not hours uploading data, shipping the data directly to your data center is probably the fastest. UPS shipping a box of TB SSD's is a much higher bandwidth then most internet connections. You can also pay for shipping for your customers, allowing you to pay more for higher speeds.
Your best option is to create a program or use an existing solution for your customers to compress their files and then send them to your server to be processed.
However, if you are prepared to pay, you can utilise a load balancing solution to your problem. Either with the use of additional LTE/WiMax modems or with a combination of multiple traditional ADSL connections. Or both. 
Take a theoretical case study. Bob lives in a rural area which is only served by a fictional ISP. We shall call this Cast-Com. Bob likes his TV streaming and has signed up for a third party TV streaming service, we shall call WebFlicks.
I am sure this is not the type of response you expected, but it is quite common when uploading data into the cloud for new companies to mail disc drives in to be loaded. 
No it is not possible because it is likely to be illegal in the country you are operating in. The proviso of course being that if you are in the US, the FCC/Trump are currently in the process removing the laws that protect users from the evils of such an arrangement.
However Cast-Com is owned by Temporal Magazine, who also have been their own inferior TV streaming service, which they would like to push onto their Cast-Com customers. Cast-Com begins throttling back the bandwidth from Cast-Com customers to WebFlicks locking Cast-Com users to the inferior TV service.
If traffic levels get even higher, you could then look at then running connections directly to your client with weighting on their BGP compatible router so traffic destined for you goes over the direct link.
If you think you'll have sufficient traffic (think at a minimum several PBs worth month reasonably sustained), you could look at a "private peering" solution with their ISP (so traffic would go from your client, to their ISP and then directly to your datacenter). It'll cost a lot to setup (the cheapest option would be if you and the ISP both have facilities in the same internet exchange: most expensive would be fibre cables being routed between them and you), but they'll get savings as they wouldn't then have to pay to go out to the general internet before reaching you. 
I used to work for a major UK educational SaaS provider and we were looking at a private peering solution with JANET (who is the "main" ISP serving UK schools and universities) so clients could access our service in a similar way to you, but the cost/benefit ratio came nowhere near reasonable for our several hundred TBs per month.
I've been working in Telecoms for 10 years and my experience says this would be too expensive to implement in the operator's systems. It's not worth expanding on why, but a lot of answers above have touched on the major technical problems. 
You question falls under the realm of Net Neutrality, which is where all ISPs treat all data the same. You want this because the world you imagine, taken to the logical conclusion would mean that you cannot access any website (at any appreciable speed) without that website forking lots of money to your ISP, assuming the ISP accepts their money.
