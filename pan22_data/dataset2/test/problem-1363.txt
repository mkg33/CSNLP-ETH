Then visually, you implement groupings of the territories so you can see who owns what at increasing sizes.  These wouldn't have an affect on gameplay but satisfy most of your "pros".
I dislike idea #1—as a territory system—and will try to provide a compelling argument.  Unfortunately, these kinds of design decisions are hard to reason about.
From a technical (maintenance) perspective, multi-tiered territories are significantly more complex to implement and maintain.  In the future if you decide to refine your system, you are working with multi-tiered data versus an array of squares (oversimplified I know).
From a gameplay perspective, this sounds like a management nightmare.  Most RTS's are about command bandwidth: quickly and accurately controlling your units.  Having to zoom-in and out to regions seems like it would exponentially increase the complexity of controls at least one magnitude.  Games with learning curves will limit your audience.
There are a lot of particulars that I think need to be answered but the biggest problem as I see it is that players can't see/interact with players operating on scales above and below them. This sounds great in that the big players can't just squash the newbies, but complete isolation isn't going to be possible in practice because players need to be able to cross into the next scale up as they grow otherwise they are all just playing 10 different games. Given that you indicated there were 10 different scales, this means that for any particular location, there can be 10 overlapping domains, but at any scale, the location can only be owned by one player.
From a game design perspective. The complete, consistent, and well understood model beats out the incomplete model with unresolved (or unresolvable) technical or conceptual issues.
What happens if this was the only territory controlled by The Overlord? (Are they out of the game from a threat they had no options to defend against?) 
You and your partner could collect server metrics, and if Partner mode (or Arj mode) shows to have too few players, you can decide to shutdown that mode later.
Finally, don't fall into a sunk-cost fallacy.  Just because you spent 2 months designing and developing this for pre-alpha, shouldn't be an argument for keeping the feature in the game.  A feature should be in the game because it's right, the only option, or because there isn't support/motivation to change it.
Lets leave off the technical issues presented by the map API's for a moment, and just explore the multi-scale world conceptually for a moment:
Have the world broken into a grid of a base size (e.g. 5km x 5km).  All game logic only care about that.  This simplifies the coding and the gameplay.
But if one server is offline, the players can still play your game on the other server. You can also sell Partner mode as a game expansion, to cover the costs of implementation.
In other words: The game could be made to work consistently in a readily understood manner with the non-scaling design, but the scaling design, as is, still has at least technical holes in it, but from my understanding it seems there are conceptual holes as well.
If you have solid answers for all this, the scaling design does seem like it could have some late-game benefits to it (no longer having to manage the minutia), but if not, it seems like the whole scaling scheme is incomplete at best, or completely broken at worst.
What happens The Insurgent's new 'B' scale territory is in the middle of an area all owned by The Overlord? 
Have you considered negotiating equity? If you're confident that this design decision will impact the sales of the game, and that there is no other way to convince this person that the group should go in your direction, maybe you could give him some equity in exchange for more control. If he gets an extra 5 or 10% of the cut, this might be enough to sway him to go your way - and then in the end both parties get more of what they want. And then in the end if the design decision ended up helping the game by significantly more than 5-10%, then you'll come out ahead. 
Based on your descriptions, it sounds like the con listed for the scaling territory design is technical in nature, and the cons listed for the non-scaling territory design are more a matter of personal opinion. 
I can see that both modes growing with different rules could be enjoyable for different reasons. As a player, I would like to play both of them, and to form my own opinion. But over time, your players will stay with the most enjoyable mode. 
What happens to the long standing 'A' scale border dispute between The Rival and The Insurgent after the promotion? 
Go with your approach first, as it has already been implemented, let's for call it Arj mode for now.
The Overlord -- 'B' scale player controlling the 'B' scale territory The Insurgent will be promoted into.
There is a lot of things that could make Arj mode or Partner mode dead-ends, like powerful players being unable to find opponents, or new players unable to expand. Both modes can fail, so there is still more design decisions to be made. This is why I believe both should be tried.
I think, the multi-tiered territory feature is an over-engineered solution to a "solved" problem.  That is, when I (as a player) think about games with territories, I think about static regions like squares, hexes, or polygons (Risk).  This is an indicator that multi-tier territories won't meet expectations.  I'm not suggesting you and your partner shouldn't have creative liberties in the game—but seeing what other similar games(products) do is a good way to reduce complexity—as someone else has solved it for you!
Why not both? What I mean by that is start off with small squared, and expand them, however make each bigger square contain smaller ones. This might add to diversity in the form of having "small" players attack "big" players, and thus being big doesnt mean you can not lose. As a big one attacked on multiple fronts you will not be able to defend each attacked small square. So even though you win 10 battles, you will lose 1, and this might help for a weirder shapes formed. At least this is how I imagine it.
