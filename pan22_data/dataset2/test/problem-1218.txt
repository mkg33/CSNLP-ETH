I want to use this Wiki like a personal blog, i want to log my life (probably cringy to you) and things I've done, programmed etc.
The most charming aspect: it is only a single executable of about 1 MB that includes everything you need (webserver, SQLite database, wiki-server). There is no need to install anything, just run the executable. Period.
Zim Desktop Wiki deserves your consideration, I have used it for almost one year, and find it simple, flexible and reliable.
One feature I like the look of is that it claims to support AES 256 encryption of pages so while it is stored on a memory stick your individual posts could be well protected.  Potentially a plus if you are keeping personal data in there.
Although is is primarily a version control systems it also includes a simple Wiki. You can keep the files external as plain html files (with simple wiki-markup) or store the files within a single (data)file.
I've been looking around and I have found Wiki On A Stick which appears to be a simple downloadable browser-based Wiki that modifies it's own files.
I have searched under the similar situation and tested TiddlyWiki.  However, it doesn't my needs so that I develop Juli.  While Juli is still evolving, I found http://ikiwiki.info/ , this also may be a good for you.
