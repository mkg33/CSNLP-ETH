Untill you get it sorted maybe even after consider running a caching dns server on your ubuntu box it may help make it berable.
check the settings of your router there may be clever anti virus / malware software intercepting dns traffic.
I bought a new network card, which didn't help. Bought a new Wi-Fi adapter, didn't help. Installed Windows, didn't help. The only alternative is to change the motherboard.
Steps I would take run "strace dig google.co.uk" take a look at the system calls and ths time between them where is the time spent ?
Multiple computers inside the network run various OSes, and connect through Wi-Fi or Physical connection. My desktop runs Ubuntu 11.04 64 bit, and has consistently slow or failing NSLookups.
this combines the functionality of traceroute and ping. It may help you figure out where the packets are being dropped.
Ping reports 13% packet loss, and Nslookup times out constantly, and has a rough average of 13 seconds, while it also resolves instantly at times.
You could also try hping3 and test different types of traffic do you see the same delays on port 80 tcp as you do 53 udp ?
