Blacklist is actually harder but that's not such a bad thing imho. Blacklist I think is inherently less secure. In fact I can't really think of a way of doing it that doesn't treat is like a pseudo-whitelist ie everyone is a member of the relevant group and you just remove those you don't want.
Whitelist is actually fairly easy. Use the same approach that Ubuntu and many other distros use. Create a group for a particular program or group of programs, set the group of the executable to that and then add users to that group if you want them to be able to access it. This is how access to sudo, printers and a whole host of other things are done on Ubuntu (and other distros).
Is it possible to prevent users from running certain programs on their Linux computers? Is there a whitelist method? A blacklist?
If you want to give people limited shell access, take a look at rbash. It offers various limitations to the user. Also take a look at PAM's limits.conf (/etc/securit/limits.conf on Ubuntu). The third option is creating a jail/chroot environment for your users where you decide exactly what binaries and libraries they have access to.
Others have also pointed out using permissions, noexec and ACL to achieve this. Really depends on your needs, what solution is the best.
Probably not. It depends on what "certain programs" means. If a user has an interactive shell that is useful, they can install almost any software they want. But if you don't want them to be able to run a particular copy of software you have already installed, ordinary file permissions will work just fine. For example, create a group "xmmsblacklist", chmod 705 /usr/bin/xmms, chgrp xmmsblacklist /usr/bin/xmms, and add the users to that group.
