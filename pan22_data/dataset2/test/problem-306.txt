Having too many tables (200 for example) in a single Mysql database instance can reduce it performance?
In general, the more of anything you have will reduce performance. However, 200 seems like a fairly small number. 2,000 might be a real performance hit and definitely 20,000. In general, though, you should keep your number of tables small since MySQL can handle very large number of rows in the table.
For every table's index MySQL has its own index. Index takes memory to hold and use, and there's global limit for indexes. When there are many tables indexes can't all be in RAM, so they go to disk, which affects performance directly. Try raising this in my.cnf: key_buffer_size=256M: this is the amount of RAM put aside for holding index information.
No - I don't think the number of tables will be the performance bottleneck in your system.  After all, they are just files on your filesystem.  There's nothing unusual about having hundreds of tables in a database.
Can it?  Sure.  But how much depends a great deal on your app and its access patterns, and if you're using myisam or innodb, and if innodb is in file-per-table mode or not, and the size of the innodb logs.  You'll need to give us more detail than that.
Far more likely is that your queries aren't properly optimised.  I would advise turning on the log-slow-queries and log-queries-not-using-indexes.  When you identify slow queries, use the explain option to view the query plan for these queries to identify the places where indexes are missing.
