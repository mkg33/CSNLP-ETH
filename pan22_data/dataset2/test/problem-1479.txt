It could just be that your connection is getting extremely slow.  Perhaps something happened on O2s side, and they cut some bandwidth where you're located.  Do as techie007 and emb1995 said - do a speedtest and try waiting a really long time for it to load (20 minutes should work). Post back here with the results of your speedtest and we will let you know if those are good or bad.
It's possible you've got some crazy temp file, cookie, or other weird file that is hanging up when you try and load a map.  Don't be offended by this suggestion - I have to assume the worst - have you restarted your computer since September?  If not, do that.  If it still doesn't work, clear all of your cookies, history, etc. from your browser.  If it still doesn't work, you'll need some cleanup software.  I don't have a mac, so I don't have any great recommendations, but I've heard, onyx is good.
The next could be that there could be some sort of packets being sent from google maps that are getting lost in your O2 device, or in O2's network.  I know that Google has been making changes to their maps service to speed things up, and maybe one of these changes didn't work well with O2.  This is the least likely of the three, but because O2 is not a major internet service provider (they specialize in phones, right?) it is possible that they have shady service.  I would give them a call and see if they have any suggestions, or if they can look into the issue.  Perhaps try going to your local rep and asking for a replacement device to see if it is just an issue with your specific device.
There's a lot of different things that could be causing this.  I'll start with the main ones that come to my mind.
Try loading OpenCPN.  A brilliant free to use navigation software system. Next version should have a Google Maps interface.  Currently OpenCPN reads most raster and vector charts.
