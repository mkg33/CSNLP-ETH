"MorhpVOX Pro" has an option to transmit your desired audio files through microphone and others can hear you aswell, so it would seem as if the music is playing (quality of the transmitted audio doesn't depend on your microphone) in the background.
The stereo mix option doesn't do exactly that, rather it will play all sounds you hear, so it doesn't serve the purpose you're looking for, bec it will play all the damn sounds, even others voices when they speak, so yeah... not good. 
You can use the jack and then go into the settings of the microphone you use to talk and set it to hear yourself and voila! Everyone talking to you will hear the music and you talk at the same time! If you don't want to hear yourself then you may have to sacrifice that part.
I do recommend using the Jack too as stated before but it would be a problem to keep changing the sound settings of your recording and playback device and chat at the same time, but if you need any software kindly search for this one "Many Cam Virtual Webcam 3.1.43" which play a role as a virtual Mic and Virtual Cam, I hope that would help! 
If your sound card supports it, you can use the Stereo Mix audio input device to stream what comes out of your speakers to someone. You'd have to go into your application's settings (like Skype's settings) and change the audio input from "Integrated Microphone" (or something similar) to "Stereo Mix".
The most reliable way to accomplish this is to use the Windows Mixer to change your recording source.
