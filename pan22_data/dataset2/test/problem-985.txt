Anything which can perform a "silent" install. MSI's generally work well here, but lots of installer software is fine too.
I don't want to see any internet communication from the software aside from that which is absolutely required in order for it to work.  And it better be all documented.  By letting your software onto my network I am placing trust in you to neither screw up nor be evil, so I expect that you won't betray that trust.  If you do, I will be very disappointed.  Remember - you are a guest in my house, so treat my house with respect.
I want a single license key for my entire site.  Having to enter a separate license key on each PC breaks the "must have central admin/management" rule.  Price yourself sensibly too, so that if I only need to install your software on 200 of my PCs I'm not paying the same as if I needed to install it on 1500.
For licensing the first thing I will look for is a free trial version that I can download without having to register.  If I don't see this I will probably suspect that you have something to hide.  I'm fine with time-limited, but I don't like reduced functionality; after all, this is the stage at which I'm deciding if your software is going to be an acceptable guest in my house, so I want to be able to see everything.
GAThrawn's answer covers most of what I was going to say.  I want to expand a bit on the licensing aspect of things.
If we have to configure it in some way then it's good to be able to script that too, either by xcopy-ing files or registry merging.
We're quite a small organization, but moved to standard desktops and approved software to reduce our admin hassle.
If the software requires any kind of updates, it better be something akin to an AV definition file or similar, it better be possible to maintain your own central updates server if you want, and it better be fully and obviously centrally configurable.  I don't mind software that comes with program updates so long as I can switch them off.
No. Too much risk of the new version causing issues. Also, users don't have Administrator rights so updates usually don't work anyway.
The first thing I generally look at is - have you got the basics right?  If you can't do that, then I will be incredibly reluctant to go any further.  So I want to see an MSI installer with a standard customization tool to allow me to build a transform.  I don't want to see any requirement for admin rights to install or use the software.  I don't want to see any requirement to reconfigure PCs.  I don't want to see per-user data written to per-computer locations.  I don't want to see manual visits to desktops, I want to see proper remote management and configuration available via GPOs.  In other words, do you understand the requirements of a managed corporate deployment?
Licensing is something that depends on what you do. As an IT guy. When you select a software solution for procurement, the licensing model needs to be part of that process. We cost license administration into our procurements, so if you're a company like Symantec that wants to nickel and dime us with 6 different license metrics, our compliance cost will count against you. If you're a company like Microsoft and your outrageous licensing process is awful, but I don't have a choice... then that just becomes part of the cost of doing business.
NO JAVA.  Java has in my experience caused utter havoc when it comes to deployment, every single time, mainly by getting all of the above wrong.  I'm happy to accept .NET as it at least seems to be more sensibly designed from a central management perspective (plus a .NET app has a better chance of getting the basics right owing to constraints in the framework).
If there's a pressing business need, as quickly as possible - as little as a few hours. For more awkward software, maybe a week or more.
And of course you have to make software worth using in the first place - if the user really loves it, they're going to shout louder to get it approved!
Finally, ongoing support and maintenance is important.  Getting the software in and on painlessly is only a small thing, after all, but how it behaves over time in regular day to day use is utterly critical.  If I need to get in contact with you to resolve a problem, I don't expect any obstacles, and I don't expect you to start pushing the blame elsewhere without at least an investigation to establish the facts.  I don't take kindly to any obvious attempt to rip me off in a maintenance contract either.
The cheaper the better! We can deal with most reasonable options, but it gets hard if the software does any kind of automated checking or requires activation. These don't tend to deal well with dead PCs, failed activations etc., and generally make extra work for us.
It can be problematic because of the different version requirements. If you need .NET 3.5 and we're using 3.0 then we have to manage that upgrade and ensure it doesn't break anything else.
