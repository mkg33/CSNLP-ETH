Let me start with mention that I don't know shit about electronics. I bought UBEC to power my RPI but it had output voltage of 5.3V so I decided to use 24kohm resistor to lower it down. Now voltage on my meter it's around 5.16V which  I consider safe but RPI won't boot. I'm sure I didn't burun it sice it works from microUSB and when I tried booting it from different UBEC which has acctualy 5V output (I used it in another project).
With any electronic circuit, which by definition is non-linear, you cannot control voltage with a series resistor.
You are unlikely to damage the Pi with 5.3v, even though this is out of spec, and not to be recommended.
It is obvious from your post that you have little understanding of electronics (as you apparently admitted - if a little colloquially).
I'm wondering what might have caused that. Is 24kohm an overkill and taking into consideration resistance of RPi itself it's not enough of power?
You cannot lower voltage with a 24kohm resistor. Please, use a proper 5V 2A+ power supply, unless you want to permanently damage your RPi and/or your current supply and successfully convert them into the puff of magic smoke.
There is absolutely no chance of it working with a 24kâ„¦ resistor in series, but if you are measuring 5.16V then you probably have not done this.
