Coming from a Linux background and now having to manage some Windows servers (2008R2 & 2012R2) I'm wondering which services are safe to run directly over the internet. The servers are all internet facing without additional hardware firewall or a internal VPN management network.
Then deploy a bastion host. This is an extremely hardened host which does have remote connectivity enabled (ssh, rdp, vpn), and will allow you to double-hop to your other hosts. I know a lot of people consider this unnecessary and overkill, but honestly, it's the safest way to roll.
Why would one run AD on internet side ? If you have to run it on the same server connected to the internet, you should thoroughly check the security policies before doing so.
My opinion in these cases is to port block every single port except those that are required for the server to perform it's primary purpose (http/s, ftp, sql server), and even then, restrict those ports to only certain IP blocks when possible. Don't configure any remote connectivity for these servers except for those necessary services.
WSUS is bugged and unsafe. WSUS can even report that everything is current while having long-time-ago-created patches not applied. It makes the system vulnerable and can affect security policies.
After some research I know that RDP atleast was unsafe in earlier Windows versions (2003) and AD seems generally to be considered unsafe. Is it still a wise idea to tunnel RDP over SSH (the servers all run cygwin)?
