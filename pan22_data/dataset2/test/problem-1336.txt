From there you can open your browser and install an antivirus, I recommend Microsoft Security Essentials, as it is free, lightweight on resources, and is thorough.
see coming to our point i installed AVG antivirus in my friend sys they are using dell laptop with high configuration...
2. if you don't need to keep the current OS, just format the drive and install a fresh OS on that drive, then again try running a full scan on all drives.
but i tried to open desktop icon of AVG its not coming and den i tried to uninstall dt but its not going..
that browser closed automatically i tried again nd again..... we can use browser for otherpurpose but if you type ANTIVIRUS in anywhere in browser that window automatically closed ..
Restart your computer and when its booting up keep pressing F8 and when you get to boot menu, choose boot in safe mode with networking.
You have a virus on your computer that would rather not be uninstalled. If it senses you doing something that could harm it, it will prevent you from doing so.
and i was trying to download setup file from net for that i just typed ANTIVIRUS in google browser den 
1. to install another OS on the system and try running a full scan on all drives. you should avoid opening any of the drives before the scan. also you should format the drive you are going to install your windows in.
