The typical sequence would be to boot from your install disc, run Disk Utility to reformat (and depending on how paranoid you are, do a 1- 7- or 23-time random-whole-disk-rewriteâ€”that's basically what @Nathan Adams' DBAN software does, except this is built into Disk Utility) and then reinstall 10.3 and whatever iLife software came with it from scratch. Then on the first boot, just shut down when it asks you to create your login account. To your buyer, your machine will behave like new.
Not sure if you have Disk Utility but I found it to work well. It should have come on your mac. Open it and click on your hard drive. Then click erase and then erase free space.
Now I know you're missing your 10.3 install disc, but to really do this properly, that's just what you need. More on that in a moment.
I would defiantly contact Apple to send you a new disk. I can even download Windows 3.11 from MSDN, so Apple should have a copy of the media somewhere.
Of course, this requires that you boot from something other than the iBook's internal HD. An attached external HD imaged with a 10.3 install system would work, as would the 10.3 install CD. Though technically it's legally questionable, I can't see anything wrong with torrenting and burning a 10.3 install CD seeing as how you do in fact own the license for that software as it came with your iBook. Though some may disagree with me, I know many a tech who would find this to be an entirely legitimate method of achieving a wipe-and-reinstall.
You could just format it, but there are pros and cons to that. Many people think that everyone is an IT person and could recreate the partition table but I tend to think that the probability of someone being that interested in your data is very slim (and having the technical knowledge to do it). I have heard people say it is easy, but I have not seen any proof. If the person you are selling to isn't to suspicious, then you would probably just be safe formatting, installing an OS over it and formatting it again as a good chunck of your data will be un-reoverable. 
I'm planning to sell my ancient G3 iBook running OS 10.3. Before I do, it seems prudent to create a new admin, purge the old users, and wipe the disk's free space. 
No there isn't a reset feature. So as you said delete all data on it then just create a generic admin user the new owner can then do what they like with it. 
I'd do a clean reinstall but the media hasn't survived many moves over the years (this thing is ancient).
