The bigger impact may actually be how responsive other devices are, such as USB drives or networking devices that may benefit more from increased availability.
*Keep in mind, however, that there are other factors that can impact peripheral performance, such as your operating system, and device drivers.
In many cases, all you need to worry about is the slowest link in the chain, also known as the bottleneck.  It doesn't matter how fast other pieces of the communication can happen if there is one point which slows things down.  If the mouse cursor feels instantly responsive and so the slowest point of the communication is the perception of the person interacting with technology that moves at the speed of computer circuitry, then there's no problem.
So, simply by plugging a USB 1.1 hub in, you might require more bandwidth/processing than some newer technology, using up more time with some motherboard resources.  Perhaps the biggest impact would be upon other devices that could be using similar resources on the motherboard, and the most likely culprit may be other USB devices.  It might place some circuitry into a slower-but-more-compatible mode, which might have side effects like slowing down transfer speed of a USB drive.
Keyboards really don't need tons of bandwidth.  Even the few people who can type over 100 words per minute (like me) are probably only utilizing a bit more than 600 bytes per minute so any version of USB can handle that with ease.  Gamepads that are similarly old will easily be satisfied with such old technology.  (I'm not quite so sure about some of the newest gamepads, like ones that might also be compatible with modern video game consoles.)  As for the mouse, you're likely fine but I could believe mouse movement might occasionally lag enough to be noticeable for some people.  Certainly it would be within the realm of being quite tolerable for most people, but some people might be slightly annoyed.
I found an old USB hub adapter/splitter which currently I dont know what USB version, I assume it's v1+ and I doubt if it's v2.0. If I plug it to laptop and plug my input devices to the splitter is there any noticeable speed difference (like input delay, etc)?
We know that USB v1 - v2 -v3 has different features and signal/transfer speed, I understand that storage devices will most likely benefit from the speed feature, but does the speed affect input devices such as mouse, keyboard and game controller?
Keyboards have a few different measurements for speed, but the difference is so negligible that these speeds are rarely even reported in technical specifications. Like mice, they have a polling rate, but again, differences are almost always negligible and having a high polling rate keyboard will consume more CPU resources. Keyboards also have a matrix scanning time (1ms - 10ms typically), which is how long it takes for the keyboard to scan all the keys (hardware dependent). If a key is pressed, it "stores" the key in a temporary buffer. Then an algorithm (.5ms to 10ms) determines if the event was "real", and if so, releases it from the temporary buffer and "hands it off" to await being sent to "the computer" (when is determined by the polling rate).
Some gaming mice are (or at least advertise to be) 1000+ Hz per second. Keep in mind that the higher, the Hz, the more CPU "power" is required to register the signal from the mouse.
Now, to actually answer your question, USB versions have a "minimum bus interval", which impacts the theoretical maximum polling rate a peripheral device can have. For example: USB 3.1 has a minimum bus interval of 125 Î¼s, so the theoretical maximum polling rate is 8000Hz. Here's what I could find:
The "polling rate" of the mouse measures how many times per second (in Hz) the mouse reports its relative position to "the computer". A higher rate means it reports more frequently. Most mice these days are around 250 Hz, older mice are usually 125 Hz. Is the human eye be able to register the difference between a rate of 125 "movements" per second vs 250 per second? Probably not.
An example of where that isn't the case is 802.11, also known as wireless.  If you have an 802.11ac device which is backwards compatible with 802.11n and 802.11g and 802.11b and perhaps 802.11a (the slowest of which is 802.11b), that 802.11b support actually really harms 802.11ac, even if it isn't being used much.  The reason is that when the wireless access point does a routine 802.11b check, that requires that the equipment is unavailable for the amount of time it takes to communicate an 802.11b frame.  And 802.11b frame takes a lot longer than an faster frame like an 802.11ac frame, so you could fit multiple 802.11ac communications in the time it takes for an 802.11b frame.
(That is a more extreme example.  Similarly, and 802.11g frame would be faster than 802.11b but slower than 802.11n, and an 802.11n frame would be faster than 802.11g but slower than 802.11ac)
But I don't know if that was more a way of saving costs for the controller chips than an actual limit of the USB-Bus ... though for mice it seems reasonable to suspect bus speed being a factor.
I expect the cost to be minimal.  USB 1.1 was fairly widely popular, and wasn't considered slow for such devices.  (It was just too slow for certain other types of devices.)
As to my knowledge there are some limitations on USB1 / 1.1 input devices (keyboards limiting simultaneous key-events to like 3 , mice limiting poll-speed like in above answers).
DPI or dots per inch, is how far your mouse moves across the screen with each movement of the mouse. These are usually options on the mouse (gaming mice typically have a button you can push to change the DPI and maybe the color so you know your current DPI). DPI is important if you have a high resolution monitor (4k) where pixels are so small that moving across 100 of them is a much shorter distance than a low resolution monitor. On lower resolution a high DPI can actually work against the user as one small movement of the mouse can send the cursor flying.
Related question: Why does Windows 10 assign different port numbers to the same USB port when plugging in 3.0 vs. 2.0 device? (grawity's answer shows that different USB controller circuitry gets involved for supporting older devices.  In my opinion, what I think is likely is that using such older circuitry is not likely to be "more efficient because it distributes the load between multiple controllers".  Rather, it is more likely that older communications standards will just slow things down overall, for reasons similar to the Wi-Fi example I described earlier.)
