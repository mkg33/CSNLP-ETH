Don't mix up your backups and your data file. even though backups are not done daily, when they occur they take a huge hit on your IO. based on your business and usage of your database, some people or a LOT of people might complain during backup time.
I'm thinking option 1 would give me better performance, since all DB activity would be striped across 3 drives (and mirrored across the other 3 in the array), although option 2 seems to mimic conventional wisdom (which appears to apply more to mechanical drives than SSDs). It seems like Stack Overflow has gone with option 1.
I'm guessing with SSD's it's OK to put every thing on a single logical drive since your server is probably more CPU constrained instead of I/O constrained at that point?
Another question I have is where should I place the nightly backups? We don't want backups slowing down the rest of SQL server, and I'm guessing writing the backups the same location as the logs is a good practice because the read/write behavior in both those cases is sequential writes.
I'm building a SQL Server with 48 GB RAM, 1 CPU, & 8 SATA III (6GB/s) SSD drives (128 GB Crucial m4) and an LSI MegaRAID controller (SAS 9265-8i). I expect the typical work load to be mostly reads. There will be some periods of heavier write activity (hourly data syncs w/ 3rd party data providers - nightly backups), but the I suspect the typical read/write ratio is about 90% reads/10% writes.
By separating your data and your indexes in 2 different data files which are then stored in 2 different physical logical drives, you would gain a huge increase in disk io simply because when you query, you would have one disk spinning for your table data and another spinning for your index at the same time.
To be honest, if the RPO was tight I'd keep SSDs for the data array and use a mirrored pair of expensive (enterprise) reliable spinners for the log.
The issue of separating logs from data where SSDs are used is a matter of RPO (recovery point objective) for the system, rather than performance. If the RPO is defined in minutes go with one shared array and take log backups every [RPO] minutes. If the RPO is defined in seconds go with separate arrays.
The standard approach of separating the random IO patterns for data from the sequential of logs simply doesn't apply on SSDs, so I'd choose your option 1 with caveats:
