I'm putting in employees' birthdays, but they come without years for sensitivity reasons. But when I put the month and day in, Excel automatically adds 2012 as the year! Obviously this is not right. I was able to format the cells to just show month and day, but I don't like that the year is in there because it is incorrect information.
As I am sorting this data and entered month and day but not year in 2013 and 2014 I changed all new entries to 2013 then added a column and subtracted 41000 from each # to make it 1900(year) then formatted as month year after pasting values only. I found this was the easiest solution based on the info here. Thanks. Now I can sort these by month with no bias for the year.
Create two columns.  In the first just put the month.  In the second put the day separated by a space, using a 0 for single digit days.  So, April 2 would read First Column: April, Second Column 0  2.  Then Excel does not read it as a date and does not format it. :)
In the next column, Paste Special, and select Values.  This will create new cells without the formulas, just the values in the end.
This will give you the month, a dash, the day.  You may want to pretty it up, or use multiple columns.
