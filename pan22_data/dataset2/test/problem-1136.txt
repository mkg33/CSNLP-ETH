The old Kickstart file must have been cached somewhere and associated with the MAC address of the host being provisioned. It doesn't appear to have been cached on the Cobbler server, but I don't know where else it could be cached.
TL; DR: I was able to solve a similar problem by changing the MAC address of the primary NIC used for PXE boot on the virtual host being provisioned. The virtual host being provisioned is running as a guest of KVM/QEMU and I was installing CentOS 7.5.
Full story: I had an erroneous ignoredisk command in my Kickstart file on line 22, which caused the provisioning process to halt with an appropriate error message on the console of the VM. I deleted that line from the Kickstart, saved it, ran cobbler sync, and started the VM again. Anaconda reported the same exact error, even though the kickstart file had clearly changed. First, I verified that the Cobbler server was providing the correct, updated kickstart file:
I know this is a basic thing, but did you cobbler sync after making your changes? You can do this via GUI or CLI.
