We have a large Amazon Web Services RDS for SQL Server instance and we would like to do incremental data transfers from RDS to On-Premesis SQL Server on a regular basis.
However reading through the docs and searching on google, forums etc, we have not found a seamless way to do off-AWS data transfers using RDS for SQL Server.
Built-in SQL Server functions such as Change Data Capture (CDC) are turned off as well as Replication and off-site Backup/Restore services.
Import / Export Wizard can do the initial export and import and then you can customize anything you need to in SSIS.
Q. In addition to one-time data migration, can I use AWS Database Migration Service for continuous data replication?
Yes, you can use AWS Database Migration Service for both one-time data migration into RDS and EC2-based databases as well as for continuous data replication. AWS Database Migration Service will capture changes on the source database and apply them in a transactionally-consistent way to the target. Continuous replication can be done from your data center to the databases in AWS or in the reverse, replicating to a database in your datacenter from a database in AWS. Ongoing continuous replication can also be done between homogenous or heterogeneous databases. For ongoing replication it would be preferable to use Multi-AZ for high-availability.
Even though it is for Azure to onpremise sql server and vice versa, it will work for Amazon RDS as well.
Best is to load the data into a staging database on premise and then incrementally load the data to the main database.
The On-prem server will be used to feed information into other systems on an acceptable 1-day delay.
