Why do you want free RAM?  free ram is wasted RAM.  Either you are miscalculating the amount of ram free by not counting cache memory as free ram (see linuxatemyram.com) or you should be tuning your apache for fewer MaxClients so that apache will us less memory.
You can find out this path with the command which service, which should print something like  /usr/sbin/service. 
I think you're going about this the wrong way. Look into tuning Apache first of all. Then, research Linux memory management. You WANT your server using the ram, otherwise why do you have it?
The primary problem is that there is no proper $PATH defined in the run environment of cron, so you need to use the full path to service for this to work. 
The secondary problem: I wouldn't do that, just blindly restarting services on a production system is never a good idea. Do you have an actual memory/performance problem or might it be that your RAM is just used up by buffers and the like (see http://www.linuxatemyram.com/)?
