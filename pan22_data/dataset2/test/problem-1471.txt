My best solution as a not-so-superuser would be to install Revo Uninstaller and CCleaner, then go to town on uninstalling and registry scrubbing. Of course this misses a lot of the miscellaneous files sitting in little nooks on the HD, like sample videos/pictures, old drivers, etc.
Get a utility such as PCDecrapifier and after doing your restore from the OEM disks run it.  After running PCDecrapifier, use one of the many HDD imaging tools available to snap an image of your system in pristine condition and burn that image to a disk.  When you next need to restore your system, pop in your image and away you go.
So I wouldn't go to such lengths as reinstalling the system just to save up to the last tiny megabyte. Hard disks are really cheap today, no reason to break a working system.
My best solution so far has been to get the thing setup the way I want it (remove the pre-installed garbage as best I can), then boot Linux off of a CD and take a full HD image to an external drive. That way, I can return to the 'clean' image any time I need to, AND I can safely delete the recovery partition (because I have a good image of my own). 
My last couple computers have been name brand laptops with OEM installations of Windows. Of course those installations come with each manufacturer's system utilities, help files, and recovery tools, and this annoys me. Is there any way to clear everything except the vanilla OS off the HD after installing from these OEM discs?
This is also helpful in cases of full drive failure or upgrade (cases often hard to deal with using the manufacturer's existing recovery solution) - restore image to new HD, expand the filesystem to fill the new disk, and go. 
The only problem with this method is occasionally the keys are tied to a specific install media so there is a slim chance it would not work.
You could try to use a key finder utility (there are lots) to get the install key out of your windows installation then use a non-oem (read store bought/borrowed) real Windows install CD. If you look your product key may even be attached to a tag on the computer.
