I would guess one of your extensions was doing something poorly. Then, when it updated itself and fixed the problem, your issue went away.
type "chrome://flags/#enable-npapi" on the site bar and press enable on npapi. then reboot. Then in the same place type chrome:plugins. Enable Adobe Shockwave player and click the box "Always allowed to run".
If your windows is not up to date then the extensions will not function properly as before. I had re installed windows on my laptop, when i used google chrome, none of the extensions were operational, but after windows update, I was able to use the services of extensions.

Does your browser update automatically? If your browser updates and your extensions are incompatible for some reason, they won't work correctly.
Next time try disabling and re-enabling one by one until you find the culprit (or a combination of extensions that don't play nice with each other).
