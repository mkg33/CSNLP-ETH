Here are three posts from Karine Bosch, an employee of U2U which cover some operations with PowerShell and SharePoint.
Stsadm is still alive and well, but judging by the developments in Exchange and SQL server powershell skills might soon (2-3 years) be nessisary in the SharePoint world.
I believe that STSADM will be the main administration tool for quite some time. Nothing prevents you from using STSADM from PowerShell environment.
Depending on the level of coding skills known you can do anything with PowerShell and SharePoint since PowerShell can use and .NET assembly so the object model is completely usable.
PowerShell skills makes updates to existing sites soooo easy especially once the tools catch up with visual studio intellisense-wise :-)
I am the ashamed author of the aforementioned SharePoint Provider - the current source will build a 2007 compatible provider that can even be used from a non-sharepoint box but it is a bit primitive still. I hope to get back onto this soon.
Given how pervasive PowerShell has been for the Exchange servers, it's probably a good assumption that the other Office servers won't be too far behind.  So, while you're probably better off just calling stsadm from PowerShell for now, knowing how it's used and taking advantage of Gary LaPointe's extensions during your learning will probably be a worthwhile use of your time.
