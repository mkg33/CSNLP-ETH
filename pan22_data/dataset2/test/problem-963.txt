Deploystudio manages imaging very well and has the capability to do multicast and differentials.  You can integrate scripts and other installations into your package workflows as well.
We still use NetRestore, because it works and I haven't had time to look at the alternatives (I have plenty of things that aren't working right before I have time to worry about things that are working!). When I get time, I suspect we'll go for deploystudio.
It's not without it's flaws and quirks, but it's free and you can do almost anything you want with it.
Our extremely legacy solution uses a single monolithic disk image that is pushed down to workstations via Netboot and NetRestore (which has been discontinued).  Software updates are done in batches which obviously necessitates creating a new image and a whole lot of network bandwidth to update the clients.  It's slow, clunky, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  We've definitely been looking into pkg based deployments using tools like DeployStudio.  But we're still just in the research phase.
Carbon Copy Cloner is a simpler imaging tool that we use to do backups of entire systems etc.  Nice thing is it will image the system while it's running.
Our whole company is Macs on the desktop. We have primarily iMacs and MacBook pros. For the last few years we've been using RadMind to manage their system image but the software has a number of drawbacks:
I know that most other solutions out there use a .pkg style system of managing updates. What I'd like to know is what people are using, and what kind of limitations you've run in to. In particular, how easy is it to add/remove software, software updates, firmware updates? How easy is it to change system configuration files?
Apple Remote Desktop is excellent for responding to support requests from users.  It also allows you to push packages and even run scripts/command line applications remotely.
