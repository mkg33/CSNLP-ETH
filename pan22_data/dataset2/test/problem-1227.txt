And well, there's no reason you can't keep this client happy with an A name assuming your record keeping is good enough, and keeping other clients on a cname. Just tack on a service charge, and adjust your SLA. 
An A record would be more secure than a CNAME record in case company.com's DNS servers are compromised. Also, to be very nitpicking, a CNAME record would require slightly more time because of the additional name resolution. Apart from this, there's no much difference and in fact many Internet cloud services - such as Amazon Web Services - have the habit of setting CNAMEs for clients' domains. 
Now, none of that makes sense to me. First and foremost, CNAME is not a URL redirect... Can someone shine a light how or in what situation an A record would be a better or more secure approach than CNAME and if that is applicable in this case.
I have a client which uses our white label web application. Their url is portal.client.com. When I asked them to point the url to CNAME app.company.com, they said that it has to be an A record.
Makes no sense, technically speaking. I'd consider losing control of an A name ... somewhat only less terrible and careless than losing control of the ip address your application is running on.
One might argue that since the alias spans over a zone (client.com -> company.com), it's not safe since the endpoint is not in client.com's administrative control. However the client supposedly trusts you enough to use your application, so why not trust that you don't mess up with the app.company.com record.
It should also be mentioned that a CNAME is not really a URL redirect. DNS queries happen before any connection to the server is made and simple give your client an IP address to use for its session. The client still knows what URL was originally requested.
In theory assuming your application is designed to be multi tenanted with different domains. ... there's no real difference. 
cnames arn't 'redirects', they're aliases. They're simply an alternate name for a resource. Past the DNS lookup your application isn't going to care. 
Also, a URL is something like http://portal.client.com/myapp/foobar.html. A CNAME cannot point to a URL, only to a hostname. Given their response, it seems that your client doesn't know what they're talking about. You might want not to fight against their cluelessness and, as suggested by @Joe, indulge them in setting an A record. 
I argued that CNAME would be ideal because if we ever have ever need to change the ip address, we can just do it in one place rather than contacting each of our clients to update their DNS record, saving time and hassle for both parties.
From a sysadmin point of view i'd rather have a CNAME as you've suggested, but you might just suck it and keep your customer happy :).
