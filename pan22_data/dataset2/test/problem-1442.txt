Well, funny story. I got a virus and when trying to remove it, my anti-virus software deleted something vital in windows vista, now nothing on my computer operates, it can't even boot up properly. 
The main messege i've been seeing is "Disable Floppy Disk in BIOS". So I started BIOS and noticed there's no floppy disk options, so I don't have floppy disk feature on my laptop. So instead, I disabled any other things which may be causes this error, everything apart from the CD Rom/DVD Rom. Yet, it still didn't work. So this is really starting to irritate me, I wouldn't like to take it to a PC shop and be ripped off for something which I could find on the internet.
Ensure first that you can reinstall any software you need (serials and installation files), including drivers for all devices that are not automatically recognized by Windows 7, and that you have backups of any data you may need from the system partition.
So I thought, "I'll go buy Windows 7, the operating system installation still works." I bought Windows 7, inserted the disk, selected the language options. I went to the next step and it said "Setup is Starting" I waited 15 minutes before looking again and it was still there, another two hours went by and I thought, "This ain't going to work, i'll look it up in google"
