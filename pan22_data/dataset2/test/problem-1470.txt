I'm familiar with the T430 and I know it's fairly common to disable the dedicated GPU in the BIOS to extend the battery life.  Check the BIOS and NVidia settings to make sure Optimus is enabled and turned on.
I am not sure if there is any way to even know if my computer does not support 3 extra screens. If it is not going to support 4 monitors(1 laptop itslef + 2 Digital + 1 HDMI) then I at least need the laptop monitor disabled which is small in comparison to extra screens.
I though to order more screens that I can have total 4 monitors. I order 2 extra screens and attached them to Digital port.
I have a Lenovo T430 and it is attached to a docking station. I was already using it with one monitor(HDMI) and extending it to the laptop screen it self.
Now, It extends to the new two attached screens but somehow it does not even see the already attached HDMi screen. it seems like it is disabled.
According to the Lenovo documentation, 3 monitors can be connected simultaneously if you are using the dedicated GPU in the laptop.  If you are using the Integrated GPU only two monitors will work.
