The portable version of Chrome is not upgradeable because its directory structure is different to that of the regular, installed Chrome. The application can detect the difference and halts the update process - this would fit with the error code of 1.
@Wollen Muts: The reason for not using the Google Standalone version will be that it will not install without at least local admin rights. Not everyone has this capability on corporate PC's.
If you are using the version from PortableApps, you can simply download the latest version and install it to the PARENT of the folder that contains it, this will upgrade. Doing this will keep all settings including add-ins, history, etc.
Can be more specific about the error number that you are seeing  ? Google Chrome help lists  different variations of "Update server not available"
Why not download the latest standalone version of Google Chrome here? If you're worried about settings and bookmarks; Google Chrome can sync between versions of GC you use.
With regard to paubbessley's answer - it appears then that Google Chrome Portable can't be updated with the About Google Chrome update feature.  I have also noticed this and I consider this a bug in Google Chrome Portable.  Google Chrome should be able to detect the difference between a "regular full install" and a the "portable" version and allow the user to properly update the Portable version as well straight into the same directory that they are running Google Chrome Portable from.  Right now I have to manually download and install the latest version of Google Chrome Portable Beta from SourceForge.  This is a nuisance and is a bug in my book.  I have suggested that the developers fix this issue in the Google Forum.
