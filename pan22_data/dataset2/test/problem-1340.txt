SID = identifies the database instance (database name + instance number). So if your database name is somedb and your instance number is 3, then your SID is somedb3.
Service Alias = An alias to the service name (just like a CNAME, etc). Say you make your service name something meaningful to the dba, but perhaps it's a bit esoteric. Create a service alias and name it something that will be meaningful to the user.
Can someone explain to me what's the difference of SID, DB Name, DB Domain, Global Database Name, Service Name, Service Alias and Instance Name in Oracle ?
"DB Domain = Usually the same as your company domain" should be avoided. I experienced problem using domain, and the problems disappear when not using the domain.
"Global Database Name = Database name + database domain" is also wrong. Global Database Name is Service Name. It's that simple.
"An Instance, is an Instance of the RDBMS software" is wrong. An uninstalled or an installed DBMS is just DBMS.
Service Name = A "connector" to one or more instances. It is often useful to create additional service names in a RAC environment since the service can be modified to use particular SIDs as primary or secondary connections, or to not use certain SIDs at all.
Then, the db_unique_names I make up, are generally like db_name + 1-letter-suffix (MYDBa MYDBb etc.)
My personal practice is to name the INSTANCE like the db_unique_name in a DataGuard setup, and stick with the RAC-names (db_name+Instance_Number) in a RAC setup.
Now imagine you're replicating (DataGuard) your database. You'd like to keep the DB_name the same, right? (I mean: data-wise, it's the SAME database)
A database has a name, the db_name, and (optionally) a domain (db_domain) --> together global_db_name.
"SID = identifies the database instance (database name + instance number). So if your database name is somedb and your instance number is 3, then your SID is somedb3." is wrong. There is no such catenation of identity or name.
