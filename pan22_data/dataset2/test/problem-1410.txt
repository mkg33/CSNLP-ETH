To tell you the truth I have not used Unison in a Windows environment, only in Linux. It wouldn't hurt to give it a try. 
You need that - get a real time replicated SAN, possibly a LOT more expensive than your IT budget for this decade.
Your best option is DFS-R and that basically means not using web server for the data storage on the server side.
It's perfectly achievable but not using anything that comes standard with Windows. I don't know of a ready made program to do this but Windows has an API function to monitor files and folders - the same one that allows Windows Explorer to show changes occurring in a file or folder as you watch. If you find nothing suitable I have something I wrote that should be pretty close to what you're after but I'll need to write some docs for it. 
As Clint mentioned in his comment, Robocopy might do the job for you if you need near real time file synching. Here's a snippet of some of the options available:
The currently equivalent of FolderShare would still work for you if you were running Vista/2008 or newer.  It's currently known as Live Sync in the Live Essentials Beta, but it will be renamed to Live Mesh once the new Live Essentials is released.  This shouldn't be confused with the older Live Mesh that never made it out of beta.  Though technically, this new Live Sync/Mesh is using most of the old Live Mesh code.
The file/folder limits you read about only apply when you're syncing to the cloud.  Peer to Peer connections don't have those limits.
You might still be able to use the older Live Mesh Beta that is compatible with XP/2003.  But no one knows how much longer they'll keep the service active.
