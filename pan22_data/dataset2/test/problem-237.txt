Your number one biggest problem comes when the RAID controller fails, and you simply can't get a replacement because the model is too old and the manufacturer either won't support an upgrade or has been acquired or gone out of business.  Or the system that the card is in fails, and all newer systems won't support your old RAID card because technology has marched on (ISA/PCI/PCIe/etc).
Since then, I've only used 2 brands: HP and 3Ware.  Both have been extremely reliable.  In about 10 years of using Compaq/HP Smartarray controllers, we've never had one fail.  We've only used a couple of 3ware controllers, but neither of those has failed.
The very first RAID card I used was a DEC Storageworks unit.  It failed once, but we had no problem restoring the configuration to a replacement card.
One of the main advantages of proper hardware raid is that the cache memory has a battery backup.  If you run software RAID on a machine without a UPS you are very susceptible to corruption with power outages.
I think most of the myth is from people trying to use onboard raid which is provided on their motherboards although this is not a true hardware solution.
I'm using 3Ware (9650), Areca (1230, 1680) and Adaptec (52445) RAID adapters. All work fine, though the Adaptec firmware may not be yet perfect. Areca and 3Ware are sure choice. Areca is supposedly better at small IOs, so should be better for a database server (though in my latest tests there wasn't any meaningful difference).
This has happened to me way too many times - it's software RAID for me from now on.  The slowdown is completely insignificant with today's CPUs.
I know and trust HP's mid-to-top-end controllers but that's when used in HP servers with HP disks, if I had to build from off-the-shelf parts I'd have no hesitation using Adaptec controllers.
As a sysadmin I have many raid setups using 3ware, LSI and adaptec and they've been fast and reliable.  I have had many drive failures and only 1 problem with a controller card ever.  If you stick to the flagship models of these proven brands then you can't go wrong.
