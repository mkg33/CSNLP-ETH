Whilst you have not said which model your Belkin device is I would agree with others here about changing the name, however I would strongly recommend you select to HIDE YOUR SSID which mean that they will not know your new network name. YOu can get more information from Belkin here http://www.belkin.com/us/support-article?rnId=6902
On most routers (also called a wireless) changing both the SSID and the MAC address is possible. This would also make your access point completely different than the "Shadow" access point (also called wireless). Consult your wireless documentation on how to do this. 
Also adding a WPA2 key (encrypting your wireless) will also prevent your computer from connecting to the "Shadow" access point. This is a built in security feature of WPA2. Changing/adding a WPA2 key will prevent the "Shadow" wireless from shadowing YOUR wireless. 
We have had our Internet taken over by a P.I. It appears that there are two of our Belkin networks. One is real, and one is a shadow of the other. When we unplug our wireless, another with the exact same name accepts us in. Please help.
IMHO a more critial issue should be WHAT where there intentions in doing this ? Was it to just use your internet ? Or was it to capature your wireless clients data ? At the very least I would take this time to change all your systems and website passwords ( remember to warn your users as weel ).
(I recommend this also because changing your SSID will prevent a couple of known security flaws from compromising your network)
