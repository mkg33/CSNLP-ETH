The Windows 7 backup tools were better than I expected, but they have some limitations I wish I had known about ahead of time!
If either drive is a Western Digital model, you can download a version of Acronis True Image software through Western Digital.  It has worked flawlessly for me, cloning XP, Vista, and Windows 7 32- and 64-bit versions.  It will only install and/or launch when a Western Digital drive is connected to the system, either as an internal or external drive (USB, Firewire, eSATA).
Use GNU Parted (or its GUI GParted) to shrink the original partition and copy it. The easiest way to run it is from a live CD (or live USB) such as SystemRescueCD (the standard tool to repair Linux and Windows installations) or Parted Magic (a Linux and Windows repair tool specialized in disk issues).
I have used CloneZilla with great success many many times. Not newbie friendly but very powerful and very useful, either copies from one drive to another, or image one disk then restore to another.
I had to abandon using Windows 7 backup for my needs, it was close but no cigar. Documenting it here for others to find. It might work OK for you as long as you're installing on a laptop with an optical drive, and you are installing a LARGER hard drive.
Windows activation may give you trouble. If doing the copy with Parted results in a Windows you can't use, try shrinking the existing partition with Parted, then cloning with the Microsoft tools.
