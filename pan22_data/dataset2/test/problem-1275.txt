Reseachers found that before the release of the original Angry Birds, only 20% of all games were rated with the 3-star score system. After the release of it, nearly 80% of all games were rated with the same or similar scoring system. (Similars are the likes of Asphalt 6, which placing was rated with 3, and achivements were 2, meaning that this is a 5-star score system.) 
Should I use the same type of rating or use something else? Is it better to be original or use something the players are used to?
Many other physics-based iOS games, such as Cut the Rope and Save Toshi use the same, or simliar 3-star system. However, the former allows the player to end the level with a zero-star ranking, and the latter allows players to get a three-star-plus ranking.
If three stars, should I avoid 0 star rating? (i.e. give player at least a star for finishing the level).
