Sounds like a memory or connection leak perhaps (perhaps extensive gc occuring), is the site database driven and what or-mapper if any is used? Basically, developers need to debug it if it's not obviously a system issue. Using a DataContext for instance has many coding gotchas that can generate this kind of behaviour.
Not to ask the blatantly obvious but are you sure it's not the app pool building?  Does it only happen right after a rollout of code?  Do you see app pool resets right around the time you are seeing this?
If i could reproduce it i could run firebug/fiddler to give more info. As it is, it's a little too infrequent to simply leave both those running hoping for the condition to fire - unless/until that's the only option to get better info.
Most page accesses are lightening quick. Sometimes the browser reports 'page loading' for an exceptionally long time. We are still in the development/testing mode so it's not a network/bandwidth issue. Happens in both IE and FF. No explicit error conditions in the server logs.
Maybe you can see a pattern. I know that this helped us once to identify a tricky issue, we found a 12h pattern and could then match it with our code.
I have a hunch this is client-side jquery/ajax related but only a hunch - don't have enough background in either jQuery or MVC to really know what can go wrong.
Since you can not reproduce yet, consider monitoring it periodically with iMacros or Selenium (or hosted at AlertFox).
