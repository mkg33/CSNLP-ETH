I have a 32-bit app that I need to install and test on a Windows 2008 R2 server. This app has some dependencies on 3rd party 32-bit software (Oracle 10g client and TCL runtime -- a large portion of the app is TCL scripts). This app also creates Windows services to run.
The current version of the product requires that its binaries (.exes and .dlls) and scripts be installed to D:\App. This path is hard-coded in the scripts and config files. It also requires that the TCL runtime be installed to D:\TCL.
I have an app which makes use of Oracle Client and .net framework, in addition to few custom dll files, which I've installed on d:\app folder for a good 3 weeks now, and I've been monitoring it daily (it's an in-house app) - haven't noticed any weirdness. My app also creates few services, and it's been running fine without any hiccups. 
I'm concerned that if I try to install 32-bit binaries outside of %windir%\Program Files (x86), then weird things will happen; are my concerns warranted? Are there any side effects or issues with running 32-bit apps outside of %windir%\Program Files (x86) on Windows 2008 R2? Does our app have to do anything special with the binaries if they're running outside the %windir%\Program Files (x86) folder?
So many bad things in this app - installing to a hard-coded location, multiple services, hard-coded config paths, requiring a dependency to use a non-standard install.  Time to do some re-design, I think.
