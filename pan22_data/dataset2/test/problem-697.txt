In my real production environment, I am running Ubuntu Server 10.04 64bit, Apache2, PHP5, MySQL and am using Virtualmin to manage the setup on these sites, therefore I want it to imitate the real production web server as it will be deployed to that when the app is ready.
What software should be installed and what is the common software/packages installed when hosting a Rails app?
I'm not sure I understand your question correctly, but I would try to mimic the actual production environment you're targeting.
I have installed Passenger on my real production web server. I am just looking for software that I should install in my clean Ubuntu Server.
I am currently installing Ubuntu Server 10.04 in a virtual machine and I am going to run my web app in it so I can see how it runs, etc in a 'production' environment.
As to RVM, yes. I think it's worth to add it to your setup now. It may seem as an unnecessary burden at first, but in the long run you will save yourself a lot of hassle, especially if you begin to host other Rails apps later on.
