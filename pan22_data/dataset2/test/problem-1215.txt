This may not be a solution for the exact problem, but on my RPI3 after rebooting, the WIFI does not work, tried so many solutions from here. None work for me.
It will work, but remember, is by no means secure, so after configuring it the better you can do is:
I just had this problem with my new RPi3 and I was able to overcome this by disabling and enabling the WIFI interface from the Pixel desktop. After re-enabling the WIFI interface everything popped into life and I could see the WIFI symbol in the top panel and the wireless networks around me.
Also, if you check the file you will notice that it has no group, you could make it permanetly accesible by adding a group the user pi has, maybe adm, I'm not sure in this point.
It urged to download the latest firmware in order to enable WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. This update took about half an hour, but it kept its promise!
I also had this problem. Do the set-ups as mentioned above first. However be aware that US and America are NOT the same in the pull downs for preferences. Always use US when available. Took me awhile to figure this one out.
instantly fixes the WIFI. So just putting this answer here as yet another solution for anyone having issues with RPI WIFI. My Pi is fully updated as of June 2019, but still has this issue.
