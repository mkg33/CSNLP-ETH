we have upgraded our DNS server as Slave in 2003 Domain server environment. I know you mentioned about not being in domain environment but I don't think that would be an issue as long as you have access/admin rights to Master DNS server. Once the new 2012 server is configured with DNS role, you will get an option at one stage to replicate from Master DNS server. As stuart mentioned, it would be mainly zone transfer and should not cause any issues having both running at the same time but you ideally want to demote/stop using 2003 server. 
Plan: Stand up Windows Server 2012 R2 server, do not join to our domain. Give IP and install DNS role on server.  Mark server as slave to our master DNS server which is Windows Server 2003.  Once replication is complete, mark 2012 R2 DNS server as master.  Build secondary DNS server on 2012 R2 platform, join as slave to 2012 R2 master.  Then decommission 2003 DNS servers.
My question is, are there any "gotchas" or issue with this plan?  Will there be compatibility issues between the 2003 server and the 2012 R2 server?  Is our plan viable?  I have been searching around and have not found anything about doing this either from Microsoft or from one of their partners. 
Current environment: Two Windows Server 2003 servers, not joined to our domain (These are here to handle our outside DNS requests).
