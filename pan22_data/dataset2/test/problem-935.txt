But your case is about radius where missiles explode, you probably should handle case when they are not on circle border, but inside, so simply change = to <.
You're changing the size of the container over which you're iterating. Even if you replace the item at index with the last one, you'll be skipping that item because you increase i at the end of each loop.
Comparison is ==, not =. = is assignment and it will rewrite your variable and because it's inside if it will be implicitly cast to boolean.
Also you should not compare two floats with == or !=. Floating point operations are not perfectly accurate because of limited precision of the floating point number type. You remember old calculators: when you divide 1 by 3 and then multiply 0.333... by 3 the result will be 0.999..., not 1. They are not equal. The same rule applies there.
I cannot guess what language do you use so I answer about generic c-like language. Also since you didn't write explicitly what's wrong I can't be sure what's wrong so I will guess.
