I can't tell you specifically why route 53 might be better. But you might consider GoDaddy's weaknesses when you decide.
Yesterday, September 10, 2012, GoDaddy DNS went down for 4 hours. While they have not yet released a verifiable root cause analysis, they claim the failure was self-inflicted.
Besides what's already been said about the quality of Amazon's infrastructure, the API is the killer feature of Route 53 or competitors like Dynect. If your site does get large enough that you have a number of servers, you'll want to get into systems automation, and being able to automate your DNS changes can be quite nice.
From what I've seen, Route53 is supposed to be quite inexpensive, at least in line with Dynect's offering for globally available DNS.  
I personally have a separate DNS host to my domain registrar, because the DNS host provides a better service (more adjustable records, rather than just A and CNAME).
If you absolutely need 100% DNS availability, you will look for a DNS provider that can offer a 100% uptime SLA. This doesn't mean that they might be better than Route 53 or Godaddy, but it means they're willing to stand behind their product and offer some monetary compensation in case their service fails to provide 100% availability.
Most registrar DNS services are provided for free for a domain you purchased and do not usually come with an SLA. The problem in this case is that Route 53 does not come with an SLA either (as far as I am aware), which means they're not willing to put any guarantees on their service. 
If I was in your position, I sure as hell wouldn't be using any of GoDaddy's services.  They've proved to me on a number of occasions that they can't be trusted.  There's plenty of questions on here where the root of the problem was GoDaddy's incompetance.
