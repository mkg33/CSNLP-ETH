Problem is that, I have never seen these error myself from testing. I have never been able to replicate the errors, in any way. So it is obviously working.
I am not sure if I have totally missed something here so I am asking, to hopefully become a better person. So I already now, ask for forgiveness for my stupidity, if any.
Program defensively, check for error conditions on anything that can possibly fail, and produce informative error messages about what happened, and you'll have much better results.
I have a client that is hosted by company that now is blaming the website I've build for the client, for "crashing" (or at least making it run very slow) the server over and over again. And no this is not a huge website with any complex script. It is a blog, with comment functions.
You don't have any error handling at all in this, and that's a problem.  If your call to mysql_query() doesn't work for some reason, it will return FALSE.  That is then handed to mysql_fetch_assoc() and that will fail too.
Same script runs flawlessly on 10-15 other hosting services without any problems and I have never had any problems with them.
My question is, what could be wrong? The hosting company just tells me that I need to make sure my script can handle all the possible errors their server might give out.
