What measures did you take to rule out a clientside issue? The minimal server load and intermittent latency of random resource requests would make me want to rule out a real time file scanner as the culprit. This may be way off, but it should be trivial to rule out.
If it turns out that the issue is in user-mode application code rather than in something the system is doing, there's a companion program called ltrace that can be used to summarize the time spent in various shared library calls.
Let it run for awhile, bang on the site while it's running until you can trigger the slowdown a few times, then interrupt it. Analyze the results.
(strace does have a -p option to trace the pid of an existing process, but even with -f it doesn't trace child processes that were forked before strace was called.)
It probably goes without saying, but also check your server, system, and kernel logs to make sure you're not seeing any unexpected failures or hardware events.
Well, if the problem happens with static files, that's good, because at least you know to start looking at Apache. You're probably going to want to break out the debugging and profiling tools to see exactly what's wrong. Presuming you're talking about a Linux system, strace is probably the tool you want. With the -f and -c options, it will follow all forked child processes and summarize the amount of time spent in each syscall. This should hopefully help you figure out the problem.
