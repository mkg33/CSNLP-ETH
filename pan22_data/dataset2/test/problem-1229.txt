There is also the question of whether the receipients need the full size image immediately. Maybe you could send thumbnails which link to larger images on a web site? That way they only get what they want.
You won't find anything better than 7-Zip/WinRaR/WinZip for general purpose compression, and it won't help much (about 1%) on jpegs. You also won't find much better than jpeg for photo type images or png for logos/cartoony graphics. Many people have worked on compression algorithms and they are only going to make small improvements from now on, in the general case, rather than any huge breakthroughs. Even if you came across some advanced technique like fractal compression, the receipients wouldn't be able to decompress it.
If they are just going to be displayed on a screen then an 800 x 600 pixel image would probably be adequate.
However, most JPG or PNG files are already compressed.  if you sending raw or tiff images, you can convert them to a compressed image, but you will lose some picture quality.
You need to decide what picture quality and size is important. If you reduce the images to jpeg 20% quality and 800x600 size, it will make an enormous difference compared to jpeg 100% and 12 megapixel say. If you really need the best image quality and full size, then post a DVD to the receipient, use an upload site or otherwise share a folder.
I simply wouldn't use e-mail. I would suggest creating an encrypted file. For example with truecrypt (Works with win, linux, and mac os). Then i'd put all the pictures in the file and upload that at an freehoster. Afterwards i'd send the password and the link via e-mail.
