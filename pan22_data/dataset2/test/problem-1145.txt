You can however download an extension, that will give you access to an alternative download manager.
For example Download Manager (S3), it's licensed under MPL 2.0 and supports latest versions of Firefox.
You cannot see download URLs anymore in Firefox, and I'm not aware of any setting to change that. The displayed information was simplified somewhere between Firefox 50 and the current version.
The command opens that SQLite file. Then it searches for the moz_places table, selects only the url column, and shows the url which contains FileName. The percentage signs are wildcards. Change FileName with the file URL you want to know. The FileName sometimes matches with the tittle column.
To open that SQLite file, here I choose the sqlite tool which works with commands. But users may use SQlite Database browser which is a GUI program. Copy the places.sqlite file in same folder of sqlite3.exe program. Open a terminal in that folder and run this command (requires some SQL programming knowledge): 
Here is a raw style procedure. Firefox stores the download list in a SQLite database. Let assume that file as a mixture of a spreadsheet table and a dictionary. The name of that file is places.sqlite (or sometimes Places.sqlite). So, how to find that file? This depends on the Operating System. Here are the probable path of that file. The random_characters.default folder can be browsed through a file manager/file explorer.
