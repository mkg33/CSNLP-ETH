DR-DOS does not booting from partitions other than 1.  You can't create two primary partitions, and install drdos on the second one.  But PC-DOS and MS-DOS don't seem to mind.  You can't start dos from an extended partition either.  
DOS is pretty kind to unknown partitions, since there are proggies (like Novell Netware), that use DOS as a boot block, and then mount an unknown partition.  It certainly lives quite happily beside things like BOOTMGR, HPFS and NTFS.
It's best to install DOS on a partition less than 120 MB, because the way Win9x works, it will try to convert the partition into a fat32 partition.
Some versions of DOS will bork, if there are several primary partitions, and the first partition on the extended partition is not a fat16 one.  
Some of the more recent computer hardware uses different kinds of setup, which not only affects DOS, but even later operating systems like WinXP.  You might see if you can see your dos partition from a dos boot diskette, before doing drastic things.
