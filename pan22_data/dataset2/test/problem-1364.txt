On some Intel motherboards, you can change SATA Operation from "IntelÂ® Smart Response Technology" to AHCI, and then you can install W7 normally.
FYI: Other file systems like those used with Linux aren't usually even looked at by a BIOS. In fact, if you even have this BIOS feature then it will almost exclusively look for a NTFS or FAT file system only (and make sure it isn't messed with). That would explain why you can establish nearly any other filesystem and why you can't create a new Windows NTFS file system.
In my case, there was an SSD with an old Windows install (incl. System Reserved partition) on it connected whilst I was trying to install Windows on a HDD. Unplugging the SSD resolved this error.
Use a linux live cd that has parted magic, and make sure all partitions are removed. Make sure any hidden partitions are gone. Cleaning should have done it though.
Sometimes there is a section in your BIOS regarding something like "Boot Sector Virus protection." And it's usually a good idea to leave this setting enabled for normal use too. But you probably want to disable it when installing a new Windows operating system.
