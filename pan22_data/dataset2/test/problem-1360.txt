Speed tests do their best to minimise the impact of many of these factors, but you're not testing in a controlled environment. It's a bit like measuring your car's top speed on a busy road on your way to work. If the provider is not trustworthy, there's no way to tell for sure, but the best results from the list you provided appear to be fairly close to the advertised speeds, suggesting your ISP isn't cheating. 
Measuring the current throughput of a connection is trivial. I suspect none of the test would do this inaccurately. However, the maximum throughput as a limit imposed by your ISP is just one of the many factors affecting the actual speeds. Major other ones are server-side caps and the how much load your neighbours are putting on the network. ISPs generally don't reserve enough bandwith for each consumer level subscription in one area to be maxed out simultaneously. 
There are dozens of smaller factors. A variable connection overhead, intentional slow-downs caused by the network protocol or quality of service settings, overloaded routers or infrastructure, low signal-to-noise ratios causing limited bandwith or packet loss, WLAN interference...
