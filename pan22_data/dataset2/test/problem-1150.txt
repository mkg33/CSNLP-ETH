On a PC with a Phoenix BIOS, I've had this problem happen because I had a broken keyboard plugged in.  So it CAN be something simpler than a totally hosed computer.  I swapped out a different keyboard and it booted up just fine.
Sorry to bump a very old thread. If it is a very old computer and hasn’t been started in a long time, it’s probably got a dead CMOS battery. Usually, it is a large button cell CR2032 3 volt battery. I had the same problem with an old Micron PC a few minutes ago and this fixed it.
The beep code page William referenced is helpful - though it doesn't have anything on what I specifically experienced...
The buffer is overflowing. This is usually the result of the keyboard buffer overflowing. A stuck key, or a broken keyboard.
A motherboard may use the computer speaker to emit a number of beeps (long, short, or a combination of the two) to alert the user of some hardware problem.
Technical answer - If it continuously emits long beeps (repeatedly) it is usually down to a short / motherboard problem such as a card or module has become dislodged - down to inconsistent power.
You should try to find the exact model of your motherboard, and then search the Internet for its manual - in the "Troubleshooting" section there will probably be a list of "beep" combinations, together with their meaning.
