I don't think there's a way to statically improve HD performance in WEI. I had a 320GB 7200RPM in my laptop with a 5.7 rating. I switched to a 128GB SSD and the rating jumped to 7.1 (the total rate remained the same, since it's dictated by the lowest score). 
My Samsung F3s get 5.9 under AHCI, and 5.9 under RAID. Another machine with 15,000 rpm SAS drives only get 6.3.
The Windows Experience Index is a simple metric to indicate performance. Sure, you will have decent read performance under RAID 0, but write performance will be less than more high-end drive. Clearly you'd expect RAID 0 to measure slightly better, but this is only a crude metric.
While there is a slight performance increase in RAID-0 for home users, it is not as drastic as many would have you believe. RAID-0 was designed with a multi-user server scenario in mind with multiple random reads and writes at once. Many of the RAID benchmarks are using this scenario, and not a single-user scenario that accurately represents home users. This doesn't explain why they are identical in the Windows benchmark, but in reality, the performance is relatively close.
