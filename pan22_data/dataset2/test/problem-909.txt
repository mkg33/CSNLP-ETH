This will let you connect to your network, and dial in to see what pages you want as if you were connected in the LAN
If, like most people, your IP address may change, then a service like DynDNS will let you use a "proper" address rather than an IP address to get as far as your router.
As others have mentioned, you need to open a hole in your router to let you get through to the machine, to access the served web pages, you need to open port 80 and forward it to the machine with the server.
Then from an outside network, go to "http://youripaddress" and your web server's content should appear.
Go into your router and set up port forwarding for port 80 (or whatever port your server is set up to) so that requests from the Internet go to your computer's IP address internally.
To get access to the machine as a user, you first need to get hold of a server that will allow you to log into the machine. Professional versions of Windows allow one to log in remotely but using a VPN is probably much, much safer. Here is an article on setting one up in Windows XP using the built in stuff.
Also, to access your router remotely, enable the remote assistance on it on port 8080 by example and then, you'll be able to manage it.
Same goes for remote access, forward the TCP port to your software's monitoring port (depends on what you're using; you don't mention it. If you're using VNC for example you'd use 5900 or 5800, depending on the configuration, or you would forward 22 for secure shell, etc.
