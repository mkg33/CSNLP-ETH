This might be an area where you are better off sticking to 'reputable' manufacturers or getting your vendor to specify a disaster recovery strategy in their RFP submission.
The best outcome you are likely to get is to get the manufacturer to tell you which cards support compatible RAID metadata formats and get something secondhand of ebay as a backup to read the arrays if your primary card goes phut.
All hardware RAID cards are proprietary in some fashion.  If you decide to swap RAID controllers (to a different brand), you're generally not going to have a pleasant experience trying to get the array working again.  Generally, you will also not be able to just plug the drives into a machine and pull data off them without the RAID card (this will depend on the controller and the type of array obviously).
I prefer standard options for exactly the reason that you specified.  If the thing (in this case RAID controller) dies how to I recover my data if that card isn't available, or takes weeks to get back to me.
If you want to stick to hardware RAID, then do your research about this issue. The easier but more expensive solution is to buy 2 cards of the same type, so you have a coldspare in your drawer when things go south.
If you're looking for host-based RAID, there are a fairly small number of outfits that still manufacture RAID controller cards.  Within a given manufacturer, the format of the RAID metadata tends not to vary.  In some cases this even applies between SAN and host-based RAID solutions sold by the same manufacturer.  A couple of examples of this are:
However, I've never found an instance where I could get documentation about the RAID metadata format from the manufacturer.
The possibility of reading back your data (assuming a RAID1 array) depends on where the RAID controller puts its metadata. For example, years and versions ago 3Ware controllers used to put it at the beginning of the disk, so you saw nothing when you hooked the disk up on a motherboard controller. However, with some tricks and the usage of the loopback driver in Linux kernel (specifying block offset) it could be read just like a normal disk and partitions.
There's no simple answer, as it's going to depend on just what controller is fitted as standard. Some standard cards will be harder to replace than some non-standard. Either way, the most important thing is to ensure the controller is good quality and readily available.
