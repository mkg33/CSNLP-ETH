On my CentOS 6 servers, I made this change anywhere I saw pam_krb5.so being referenced in these two files:
To disable keytab validation and hence suppress these log messages, add the no_validate option to your PAM settings.  For example:
This might be an old one, but I had the same problem and wanted to get rid of the message. I followed these instructions from ArchLinux and solved it.
The reason the message isn't seen for root is because that user is local (does not need Kerberos for authentication). When using SSH authorized-keys, you also circumvent Kerberos, so there will be no error regaring missing keytab there either.
As @ryan-fisher mentioned in his reply, the host needs a keytab file in order for it to be able to retrieve a TGT for preauth.
You can disable validation to avoid the message in the log as suggested by Banjer, but the purpose of the validation step is to prevent an attack where a bad guy sets up their own bogus KDC.  In other words you need a host principal to validate the TGT given by the KDC is authentic.
Now, what you need to do is to make sure that /etc/krb5.keytab contains the keys for the principal host/domain.name.of.host for the machine. Assuming the reverse DNS is correctly set up, you will then be able to log in using ssh without typing a password assuming you have a valid TGT.
