I've had excellent luck with greylisting.  Personally, I'd never use it as my only anti-spam measure, but when included as part of a layered anti-spam system (including SpamAssassing, amavisd, clamav, RBLs, SPF/DKIM, etc), it provides a lot of benefit.
You should ensure that you use a good implementation (I'm not personally familiar with SQLGrey).  In particular, you can generally figure out ways to trust triplets without having seen the exact triplet before (e.g. if you've seen enough good triplets from an IP, then there's probably no point greylisting any further triplets from that IP).  After a small amount of time, very few legitimate messages are greylisted.
In my experience, the vast majority of e-mail that you get person-to-person (from a real person/user) flows through one of the major mail servers (postfix, qmail, exchange, sendmail), all of which handle greylisting properly.  Occasionally you might come across some mailing list software or automated e-mail program that doesn't handle it correctly, but my experience suggests this is very rare.
One possible problem with greylisting is that users will not get mails immediatly. This is most frustrating for password reset mails. These mails usually get caught in greylist because the sender/receipient/ip will be new.
Yes, greylisting can stop a reasonable amount of spam, very inexpensively.  Even when it doesn't stop spam, the added delay gives additional time for the message or sender to be listed on DNSBL or hash-based lists.
One important note, there are a few ISP's out there (major ones) that don't handle a greylisted destination gracefully (yahoo mailing lists have been a well known example).  I'd advise looking at some of the whitelists that people have put together to make sure that you don't end up blocking real e-mail.
