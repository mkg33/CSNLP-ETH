Alternatively, go to the site you want to search, right click in the search box and click "Add a keyword for this search".
A bit late to the party, but for those finding this thread now you can click the search icon in the search bar when on the site you want if it has a green + icon on it.
For an example Google Translate string: https://translate.google.com/m/translate#auto/en/%s so top answer here doesn't work. So I found a workaround with the plugin: add-custom-search-engine
Ready2Search is also an available free service that helps you do this for any site. It makes search plug-in for Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Google Toolbar with great customization options (icons, query parameters, etc.).
You can do this with Firefox! Add a bookmark with that URL, where %s is the search query, then simply set a keyword for the bookmark. You can then search using <key> <search term> in the address bar. For example, the bookmark http://www.google.com/search?q=%s with keyword g means you can type g stack overflow in the address bar to search Google for "stack overflow".
In Firefox's address bar type about:config, then search for keyword.URL and replace its contents with "https://blahblah.com/search?q=", for example.
