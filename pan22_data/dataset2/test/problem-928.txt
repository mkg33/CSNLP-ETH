Next, start a VoIP call. After the call has started, physically pull the plug on your WAN connection, being sure to leave your LAN up and running. If the call is not dropped, the packets are isolated to your LAN. If the call is dropped, they're definitely being routed innefficienty. 
SIP is session based, so once a session is created between two points (by way of a SIP server), the actual RDP packets that carry the RTP audio stream travel only between the two points, so if this is on a LAN, once the SIP server (wherever that may be) initiates the connection between the two points, it backs out until it receives requests from either of the phones (such as a transfer or a bye). The voice packets at this point will never leave the LAN.
It may vary by protocol, but since you specified SIP and Skype in your tags, I will specify based on those particular terms.
As far as Skype is concerned, it is not SIP, it is a proprietary protocol that is closed source. I am honestly not sure how this protocol works, but I would surmise that it is similar (redirecting all voice traffic through a server puts HEAVY loads on that server and that connection which I would think would cost a company far more than it is worth to deal with as there are relatively few advantages to doing so).
First, do a traceroute from one client to the next to make surethe network is configured properly. If traceroute packets are leaving the LAN, somethig is seriously misconfigured.
