Yes there are, and the numbers may be on the rise. In the last 3 months of this year, I have been contacted by 3 local companies looking for full time PostgreSQL professionals, in an area typically dominated by MSSQL and Oracle (SE United States). I took one of them, and now work mostly with PostgreSQL after working with SQL Server for 12+ years.
Judging from the activity on the PostgreSQL jobs mailing list I'd say it's not all that uncommon to find full-time PostgreSQL DBAs.
Sure there are.  Of course in many cases, you don't need a full time DBA for PostgreSQL, but on the other hand, places like Skype, myYearbook.com, and Afilias have teams of full-time PostgreSQL DBAs.
With a search engine and web portal of that size, we can only make rough estimates on the size of their PostgreSQL DBA teams..
There are dedicated database administrators for all major platforms; it is not a role exclusive to Oracle.
PG dbas are rare and hard to find. What does not make matters easier is that the going salaries can range from better than Oracle or SQL DBAs at companies that require PG for their most critical applications, and experienced difficulties finding the appropriate personnel. Others seem to try to hire on the cheap not making it worthwile for DBAs to stay or switch to PG. 
PG is believed to be easy to manage, and developers or sysadmins get stuck with the admin duties. It's usually only when these database suffer severe issues, or the need for HA, D/R, replication etc... comes in that a DBA is sought.
