However personally if i was only running a small number of machines in an office environment I would go with a something VERY simple like PC{Number} eg. PC001 or if you wish OS{Number} eg. XP001... and then to easily know which machine is where just maintain a small list/spreadsheet of which machine is allocated to who (and also for ease of network maintenance use the machine number as the last digit of the IP).
This generally leaves you with the even 'colder' alternative of naming the machine with in a more generic pattern, in which case take your pick of the suggestions by Kevin, Sam & JFV.
N.B: The more complex the environment the more you complexity you may want to introduce into the names (eg. if you have different sort of 'builds' for each machine eg. a dev machine with visual studio, vs a sales machine with just office then it would be worth sticking with Kevin suggestion of including machine purpose eg. XPDEV001, XPWRK001).
IMO that is a lot 'nicer' than having machine names that in the end won't match the users name/role/location anyway as small companies often move machines around, and if you don't have many machines the list/spreadsheet should be very small (1 page) and easily maintainable.
I would also go further and say that you shouldn't be naming the machines after 'staff roles' either as having once managed machines for a small company you would often end up with a situation where your newly hired accounts assistant would be running on the "SALES3" machine because one of your sales staff left and that's the only spare machine.
