Pinch each individual wire between your thumb and a screwdriver.  Starting closest to the sheath, using the thumb of the hand holding the screwdriver bend the wire over the screwdriver and start pulling the screwdriver up the wire.  It straightens the wire pretty well.  If you need to terminate more than a few conenctors you may want to wear a glove to protect your thumb.
Not really much of a trick, but I tend to get them in the correct order, and then massage them back and forth between my thumb and forefinger.  Alternate directions as you do it, switching from pulling towards your thumb and towards your forefinger.  With each pull, run your fingers from the sheath to the tips of the pairs, as though you're warming it up like putty.  Usually works to make them nice and straight, for me.
My Fluke punch-down tool has a fold out hook that's perfect for separating the pairs like the spudger above.  Then I use the ribbon trick.
I leave the individual conductors a little long, get them positioned in the correct order, then grab them between my thumb and forefinger and bend them back and forth, uh, horizontally.  I think the best way to describe the direction is if you had a flat piece of ribbon that you were holding in the same way, I'm talking about bending it the way the ribbon wouldn't want to bend.
