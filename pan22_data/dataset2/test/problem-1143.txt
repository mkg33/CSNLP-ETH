Impersonation is probably also a non-issue. This is most likely going to happen where there's a bad player that wants to use the name of a very good player. Nobody is going to believe that FruitDealer located in the bronze-league is actually the real FruitDealer. As soon as you're playing in the top levels, you're most likely opting for a unique name.
Most other answers have covered the impersonation concerns, but what I haven't seen mentioned and I think is most important is the capacity to specify a player if names can be duplicates. Which one receives /tell DuplicateName Private information.? All of them? What if you want to initiate some kind of remote trade? What about a friend's list? What about a mute list? What about impersonating someone just to grief/troll in chat, regardless of league/score/rank/team/whatever?
Having a unique secondary name works if you want to allow duplicates, but ultimately I think that's still rather user-unfriendly. Specifying a player with a long name is annoying to most. By adding a secondary name, the total length of each player's full name increases. If you use the unique secondary name only for player specification, it is still user-unfriendly in that you have to refer to players by names that you usually don't associate them with because it's not on display.
Another scenario where it would cause problems is in MMORPGs, because you would confuse the two, in the chat for example. Then again that might not be a problem if there is another property of the player that distinguishes them (like class, which is shown next to the players name or as a color of it)
If someone is bad and tries to impersonate someone better, others will see it, if he is similarly good he won't try to impersonate because he rather wants his score with his own name.
I think the non-unique display-name can work in every game where the name isn't an important part of the virtual identity. In the case of Starcraft 2 you have an character-code (ID) or your battle.net account e-mail that can be used to find friends. The display-name is just what is shown on screen and can even be changed (a limited amount of times).
You might have noticed, that the same is also true for the gamedev.SE site. You can have several users with the same name here.
As soon as you have several properties that can help distinguish players and the display-name isn't used as ID, non-unique display-names can work fine. It also has the big advantage that players don't have to search hours for a display-name, because all the "good" ones are already taken.
I guess it's because the display-name doesn't matter that much in Starcraft 2. Even if you were about to meet a player with the same name in an online-match it wouldn't be an issue, since there are several other "layers" that help you distinguish players in game. One is the color of the units on screen, another one is the team the player belongs to (in 2v2 or other team matches).
One problem with non-unique names is the personating as you described it. If there's a really popular player it is likely that someone will try to impersonate him. You could prevent this or make it obvious by always displaying some kind score next to the players name, so others know if it is the "real" popular player.
Since the ladder is segmented into leagues and the leagues are segmented into divisions, name-clashes are also very unlikely. Maybe Blizzard even makes sure that there aren't players with the same display-name in the same division.
