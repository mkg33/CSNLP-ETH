Soluto monitors all starting programs on boot and logs, how many seconds they delay your boot time. With Soluto, you should be able to resolve which app is slowing down your machine on boot.
Fire it up and watch what's running. Also, have a look in your Event Viewer to see if there are any services having a problem during start-up.
I have the same issues like you. Last year I had some strange behaviour where my Screen turned black for half a minute or so after logging in. I think, the problem might be Steam on my computer (it was last year - I still have to check if it is the problem again) and it could also be yours.
I use PC Magazine's "What's Going On" app to monitor my system. Whenever something is taking too long to respond, I open WGO to see what the status is. Sometimes, it's my AV tool doing an unexpected update, sometimes it's a runaway app is using way too many resources.
You can also try Little Registry Cleaner which also allows you to remove unneeded startup entries. I would also recommend doing a disk defrag.
On Windows 7 there's a great utility called "Resource Monitor", it will show what apps are using the disk/cpu/network/memory (sort by the different columns to zero in on a particular resource usage).
