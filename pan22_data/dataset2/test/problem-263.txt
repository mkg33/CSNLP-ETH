On the other hand, and from the sound of things, your in-house skills are primarily Windows.  Now, you can't be in a position where you're reliant on external support for basic day-to-day operational stuff.  Also, I'd be suspicious of your DBA advocating Linux; OS platforms should be somewhat outside of a DBAs remit.  Based on that alone I'd definitely be leaning towards Windows.
In my experience Oracle can be very high-maintenance, meaning that the quality of support is utterly crucial.  If you can do it all in-house, more power to you, but it's an utterly huge beast these days, requiring a lot of dedicated resources to get the best out of, so like as not you're going to be calling on external support a bit.  So which platform can you get the best external support on?  I think that would be Linux, but I also think you'll get decent support on Windows.
The primary reason for this was given as it was the most stable supported Host OS that Oracle ratified for use with their database. With the plethora of patches that Microsoft release, it was almost impossible to keep the host OS at a level that Oracle had tested and would support.
But anyway, for your developers, accessing Oracle on windows or linux is the same, totally transparent. They should be checking Oracle goodies for .NET either way.
Choose the OS on the basis of what OS those components run on (or you are most familiar with running on). It is likely you'll want to make some custom monitoring scripts / components; your developers will probably be more comfortable with one or the other, so allow them to make the decision on that basis.
If you pay Oracle's own consultancy group to come in and design a 'turnkey' system for you that involves a DB there's a 98%+ chance that they'll install it on 'Oracle Enterprise Linux', which is their own rebranded version of RHEL.
Some organisations have a "never break" rule of insisting that absolutely every Windows box runs on-access AV software; this is likely to make the Windows box perform absolutely terribly. This is however, not a good reason to use Linux :)
However, in case of mixed shop, I usually recommend Oracle on Linux for various reasons (some might be subjective):
Even if you don't plan to run any other actual applications on there, you'll want monitoring, backup / restore, server management software and hardware support software.
There used to be an overriding reason to go with Linux for 64bit support (and therefore better memory management) - this is now reduced with the more stable support of x64 WIntel platforms.
if your server admins knows only Windows (MS-only shop) - you should use Oracle on Windows... or do you want as a DBA to maintain O/S, install O/S patches, handle O/S security, do O/S backups etc etc?
I cannot give you a definitive answer for why, but I looked after the IT support for a smallish development house who wrote applications against Oracle 7i, 8i, 9i and 10i - all database hosts were done vs Linux - on RHEL 3, 4 and 5.
Having used Oracle on Windows 2003 x64 and RHEL 4 x64 - the same database performed a lot better on Linux than on Windows - the back end storage was a 300Gb fibre presented raid 10 partition on an EMC array.
It's down to a combination of which platform you'll get the best support from Oracle (or other external support providers) on, and which you're most comfortable with yourselves.
