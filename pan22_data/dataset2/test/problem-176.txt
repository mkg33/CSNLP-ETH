If the game is a puzzle, and its rules permit reverting a move without any loss (beyond time), the player should generally expect to detect dead ends and recover from them on their own. Giving them notice that they've entered an unwinnable situation is probably unnecessary unless it's limited to detecting situations which are immediately unwinnable. Games of this type might include "pen and paper" puzzles such as crosswords, sudoku, or mazes, as well as certain other fully reversible puzzles such as Rubik's Cube or sliding-block puzzles.
Finally, if the game is not intended as a puzzle at all — for instance, if it is actually a first-person shooter — the situation changes entirely. Games of this type will usually end immediately if the player has entered a completely unwinnable situation. For instance, in sections of Half-Life 2 which the player must use a vehicle to complete, the game ends immediately if the vehicle falls into an unrecoverable position. Another option is to automatically take action to restore the game to a winnable state. For instance, if a player has run out of a consumable item that is mandatory to proceed, the game could make more of that item available to the player.
On the other hand, if moves in a puzzle are not revertible, notifying players that they have entered an unwinnable situation may be appropriate. This is particularly important if the unrecoverability of the situation would not become apparent until much later. Games of that type might include block-pushing puzzles such as Sokoban, as well as many text-based adventure games. (Older text-based adventures often failed to follow this rule; this was a major factor in why they were considered so frustrating!)
