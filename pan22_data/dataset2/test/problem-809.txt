What I'm a little unclear on is how to actually view the inbox - I've tried adding a new mail profile (for myself - testing) which has the user in questions' email address but it prompts me for credentials when retrieving server settings (and mine don#t seem to be sufficient).
I'm a developer who's having to stand in as a sysadmin and I've been asked to make the contents of an inbox available to a users manager without informing the user.
You will now need to open an additional mailbox in Outlook you can do this by going into account properties in Outlook opening the existing users account, going into option and adding the additional mailbox in there.
You can grant access to a mailbox as described here. Basically you just assing mroe users to have logon permissions to the mailbox.
I haven't been able to find much information for doing this in Exchange 2007 through Google - I've tried going to the exchange server, finding the user in "exchange directory users and computers" and in the permissions tab, I can see that domain admins (ie me) have full control for the account.
