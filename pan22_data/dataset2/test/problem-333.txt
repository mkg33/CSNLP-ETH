However if you can afford it there's nothing like getting your hands on real kit and getting used to the different physical cables, especially if you don't currently work as an engineer.  As the CCNA requires you to know stuff about the kit like how it boots, flash, moving config & IOS files around from tftp etc, then if you have some real kit you can take a look inside and have a go at upgrading the flash for example, which really helps the theory click into place.
Wendell Odom's website has a lot of great info, including lab equipment recommendations for CCNA and CCNP.
If you're wanting to save a bit of money, you can use GNS3 for the routers and then just buy some switches. I have written a few blog posts about how you can connect virtual equipment to physical equipment. 
My suggestion is that you go ahead and practise a lot with Cisco packet tracer and Gns3 which is more than enough for CCNA level.
I have gone through whole Cisco 200-125 Books and then started practising scenarios and I have used cisco 2900, 3650, 3700 and 3560 switches.
One thing to bear in mind with the CCNA is that the vast majority of the things you need to play with are trivially done in Cisco Packet Tracer and GNS3 (especially since you can now get a switchport card working in GNS3 now). However, with that said, depending on how you learn, you might prefer to work with a physical setup, and if that's within your budget, go for it.
2500 series & 2950 Cat switches are probably the cheapest option that will do it but if you are serious about certification and want to go beyong CCNA level then you'll want to consider building your lab for the future.  So if you can afford it i'd recommend some 1841's for your routers as they are really reasonably priced nowadays on eBay and then (again if you can afford it) get some 3350 switches which you can then load IOS capable of L3 switching and routing protocols. 
In any case, I'd definitely recommend against foregoing any sort of usage of PT/GNS3, not least because something like GNS3 can actually be used to augment your lab setup - hook it up to your physical gear and run wild.
I also started a Whirlpool thread a few years ago for those studying for the CCNA and CCNP certs. There is a lot of great info in there. We also turned it in to a wiki as well.
Packet Tracer and GNS3 are highly recommended based on the fact that you can get them at no cost. When using Packet Tracer it is also quite useful in familiarising yourself with what the exams sims are like.
I prefer the virtual router + physical switch approach over the full physical lab as it saves money, energy and power points :) It's also good because you can take your virtual router topologies with you everywhere you go.
