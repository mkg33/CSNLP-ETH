Finally, I went to my "normal" user's %APPDATA%\Subversion and copied some files (mainly auth/svn.ssl.server) over to the %APPDATA%\Subversion-folder of the "LocalService" and "NetworkService" users. That did the trick for me.
Pretty easy solution ... see "3. Accept SSL exception for CruiseControl.Net local user account." in this link
I am trying to setup Continuous Integration in our office. Being a puny little developer I am facing this supposedly infamous problem:
" Source control operation failed: svn: OPTIONS of 'https://trunkURL': Server certificate verification failed: issuer is not trusted"
- Run CC.NET service (server running as win service) using a domain account (rather than default LOCAL SYSTEMS) and accept cert permanently using command prompt under that user by using svn log/list on the repo.
We are using VisualSVN Server and CC.NET for this adventure. Tips, suggestions will be highly appreciated. Thanks
Starting the cmd.exe as "SYSTEM" account and using any SVN command didn't work for me. At the first time, I was prompted to accept the certificate, did so (permanently) and hoped that CC.NET was cured by this. It wasn't.
