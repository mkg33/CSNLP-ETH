Some of what you describe with the packets seems normal; have you used the 'Expert Info' and 'Follow TCP Stream' features of Wireshark? Those will show higher-level views of the TCP connections. Also keep in mind that Wireshark might not be capturing all packets (especially if you're on gigabit ethernet).
Without details, my guess is that you had stock tcp profile enabled instead of a custom profile and it behaved badly with your application. I highly recommend utilizing custom profiles and engaging someone with knowledge of how TCP flow and congestion control algorithms work, and what settings in the TCP profile act poorly with certain applications. We wrote a 10-part series on the BIG-IP TCP profile several years ago (could use a refresh with all the changes since but it's still a good source of information) that I think will help: https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/investigating-the-ltm-tcp-profile-nagles-algorithm
As for the problem, it's possible you're seeing a bug in the LB, exposed by the fact that all your web services are on the same box, which means that your three IP addresses all have the same MAC address. If the LB tracks connections using the MAC address, it could be confusing your three server IP addresses and directing packets to the wrong place.
One thing that sticks out at me is that your web servers are on the same machine using different IP addresses. You're not really gaining anything with load balancing if you go and put all the servers on one box.
