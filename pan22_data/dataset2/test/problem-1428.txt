Second: use commercial tool for power management. I can recommend EMCO Remote Shutdown. It has nice UI and can operate with multiple PCs to run WOL, shutdown, reboot and other tasks on schedule.
However I recently wrote a program that might help you. It can sleep and wake-up your PC according to configurable rules.
Then you need an utility to send the magic packet. I use Depicus' Wake On Lan Command Line tool from my Windows machine.
First: use command-line tools for WOL and shutdown. Windows includes shutdown.exe utility. You can find a lot of free WOL command-line implementations.
Wake-on-LAN allows you only to power up remote PC, in case if it’s configured properly. But it can’t shut down PC remotely. Shut down is a task for another tool. If you need to make wake up and shut down you have two options:
I have found though the best way is power management option with a low timeout and hibernation included as this saves even more power than just sleeping.
so putting it to sleep really is not that big an issue as you can set the power option to sleep in 1 minute if you like.
Some program might have it's own custom client (that must be installed on each machine you wish to control) that can perform sleep action. However, i am not aware whether such program currently exists.
I have a pc upstairs I remotely use for testing etc I set my power options to 5 minutes sleep and then after 30 minutes it hibernates.
Regarding waking the computer up you first need to configure you computer to wake-on-lan. Note that you don't install special software that allows the computer to wake-on-lan but rather enable the option in you computer's network card (NIC), given that it supports WOL. This is normally done either through your BIOS settings or through some software tool (maybe included in the OS). I use the program ethtool on Linux to set the g flag for my NIC which tells the card to accept a so called "magic packet". The magic packet needs to contain that cards MAC address and is the signal that flips the "on" switch inside the NIC making the computer starts up.
Programs that offer shutdown of remote machine usually do that through shutdown command (that does not support sleep).
