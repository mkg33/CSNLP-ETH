Um... if you can't find Safe Mode... I'd really like to see what happens if you reboot and try just kinda tapping F8 as the system boots.  Don't hold it down or go crazy on it but literlly just tap, tap, tap as it boots.  THAT should get you to the safe mode screen aka the Advanced Boot Options and the first three choices I think are Choices 1 2 and 3, you would probably want to start with basic Safe Mode unless you need your network support.  If you can get into Safe Mode then you should be able to use msconfig.exe to enter the start up configuration area and remove anything you've added recently or, if you can start experimenting with what you do find
As soon as it got past the "loading your personal settings" page, I opened Task Manager and saw that the cpu was going at 100%. I flicked to the processes tab, noticed a program I installed a couple months ago was going nuts, so I killed the process. Immediately the computer was at its normal speed and everything else loaded properly, and I facepalmed hard at such a large corporation's program nearly killing my computer.
I've seen instances where the PC is running but explorer is at the wrong (high) priority. It was actually running, but took about 5 minutes to respond to Ctl+Alt+delete. You could then kill the explorer process and it would be OK after restarting.
Long story short, someone somewhere needs to fix this program, and I will uninstall it until they do.
