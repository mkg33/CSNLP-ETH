You should be able to handle this by making the server that handles the unlisted items the first server block in your config.
I have a wildcard SSL certificate and several subdomains on the same ip. Now I want my nginx to handle only mentioned server names and drop connection for others so that it'd look like  nginx is not running for unlisted server names (not responding, rejecting, dead, not a single byte in response). I do the following
I implemented the above solution today, and it worked swimmingly. All URL's not specified are dropped, now. Placing this server code before the actual virtual server entry was key - all mal-formed URL's now go to this 'default' server. 
I've tried almost everything in the last server block, but no success. I get either valid response from known virtual server or error code. Please help.
It doesn't work that way: the SSL handshake happens before HTTP, so the name on the certificate will get evaluated in the browser before you can redirect or do anything else inside the nginx configuration.
