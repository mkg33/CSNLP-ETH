It's always within a half minute of midnight.  There are no login attempts before it.  Right after it (in the same second) there's a success audit entry:
You might have installed a program or service with your user ID. Most probably these are backup softwares or any similar service/task. You can not find all scheulded tasks from "Scheduled tasks", review your automated services, IIS, Backup Exec etc.
It's likely an automated event, like a service running under your credentials.  Hop on the server and sort services.msc by the Logon As field and see if you're in there.
Account lockouts can be a pain to troubleshoot. My first reccomendation would be to get the Account Lockout Tools from Microsoft. 
The process ID was the same on all three of them, so I looked it up, and right now at least it maps to TCP/IP Services (Microsoft).
Using these tools you can figure out which of your DC's are actually locking out the account. From there you'll need to do some snooping in the security log to figure out which server is causing the lockout to happen, then you can figure out what on that server is locking your account.
