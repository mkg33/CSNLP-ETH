To gain absolute control of your computer and be done with all the restrictions Microsoft imposes on you do the following. Run Explorer as administrator, go to Windows/system32 and find lusrmgr.exe, right click and choose to create a shortcut, Windows will tell you it cannot create a shortcut in the directory and ask you whether you want it on your desktop. Say YES. Once on your desktop right click on it and choose run as administrator. 
I think you're talking about the computer asking for admin credentials before allowing you to do certain things? in which case this should help:
Previously on 8.1 I found something for the console that changed my user account to a full admin account and removed the horrible restrictions on the standard admin accounts.
I've always hated this about Windows, it's ridiculous admin antics. If I'm an admin user I want to edit things like my host file without needing to hack around. 
Find your user name, go to its properties, make sure you are in the administrator group and remove yourself from the user group, restart your pc
To edit the host file, first, place a shortcut of your Notepad on the desktop. Right click on the notepad and choose RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR. Go to Windows/System32/drivers/etc and open the host file, do whatever you please with it and save. The key is to open NOTEPAD as administrator.
Using lusrmgr.exe delete all users and groups leaving yourself as the Administrator. Give that administrator all the privileges (Full control etc.)Retain your password and make sure it never expires. You have now made yourself a Super Administrator with absolute control of your Windows 10 computer, you can open any file regardless of whether it is hidden or read-only, whether it is a system file etc. and you can do all the mischief you want. Before this can take effect you must restart your computer - cross your fingers or byte your nails praying you did everything right. :)
Is there anything I can do on Windows 10 to make my admin account a fully blown admin account free from restrictions?
