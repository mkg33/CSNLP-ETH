When I log onto my MSDN to download an update the only SQL Server R2 options I have are for Express edition or Enterprise evaluation (I am logged in to subscriber downloads). Is there no standard R2 edition or am I missing something?
Checkout the requirements for installing SQL Server 2008 Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2008. As per the link, you cannot install Enterprise edition on Win7. You can try Express or Standard edition.
We have a test server running Windows Server 2008 R2 that I want to put SQL Server 2008 onto. I have an MSDN subscription and thought I could install (x64 version) SQL2008 but the installation warned me this wasn't compatible with this version of windows (reporting that I am running Windows 7).
To run SQL Server 2008 on Windows Server 2008 R2, you need to install SQL Server 2008 SP1.  You can either install this after the fact, or create a slipstreamed installation point. 
Just open an elevated command prompt and run this command to install SQL, Analysis Services, Reporting Services, SQL Management Studio and BIDS in about 15 minutes:
I use a slipstreamed installation point and run setup.exe from the command line - this is much faster, since you don't have to click through the setup wizard or wait for the 'Setup Support files' to install.
