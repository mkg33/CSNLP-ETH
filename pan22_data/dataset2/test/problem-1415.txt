On top of the minimum 4 GB everybody is recommending, I suggest you leave a little bit more, just in case (about 1GB should be enough); it never hurts to have a bit of breathing room :)
make sure you watch size constraints of event logs, registry, etc etc.  Windows likes to spread itself out.
Personally I'd do a normal install to a relatively larger drive (10GB or more), get everything set up, remove everything I don't need, then image that drive over to the smallest one there is one bump up from the image size. So if it's a 790MB image put it on a 1GB drive.
I'd use about 6-8 gigs for a minimum size myself.  This will give you 2 gigs for the install, another 2 gigs for the swap file (if on the same disk), and about 2-4 gigs for patches/temp files/miscelaneous needs.
Just a warning : If you run out of space on the system disk you might find that you can't boot any more. So I wouldn't advice you to economize too much on the system disk - take some of the higher numbers mentioned in the answers.
Note : everything is in another partition so my documents and another Program files is maded in that second partition, that include also various downloads folders and a backup folder ...
A lot of stuff is done on the partition that Windows is on (think temporary files from all types of files). I once ran out of space while trying to extract a large set of files from an archive, even though I wasn't extracting to the partition Windows was on (but the unarchiver was saving some temporary files there). Also, a few programs, although installed on a different partition, copy some files to C:\Program Files\Common Files (that folder is taking up nearly 650 MB on my PC).
