RDP will not work for this by default, as it only allows one RDP session at a time (so you can either use your account locally, or via RDP) - Concurrent Remote Desktop Sessions in Windows XP SP2 explains how to get around this, but you would be just as well using VNC (TightVNC for example)
If you can set the screen resolution on the projector-machine to the same as the tablet, simply fullscreen the VNC viewer application and it will micmic the tablet display exactly. If you cannot do this, most VNC viewer applications can scale the image to fit the screen.
First thought I could think of is to use another computer to VNC/Remote Desktop into the tablet PC. That way you can perform actions on the tablet from the other computer, which will then be hooked to the display.
Also, you can get away with a USB Video card if the display has a USB port. I would be very surprised if this tablet didn't have USB.
I would connect a regular desktop machine or laptop to the projector, install a VNC server on the tablet and connect to this from the projector-machine.
Could use Microsoft SharedView - I believe it's the successor to NetMeeting for Vista and up: http://connect.microsoft.com/site/sitehome.aspx?SiteID=94
Wifi Projectors are great, so long as you're not working with video. The projector broadcasts it's own Wifi network, and your tablet connects to it.
