You didn't say what version of Exchange you had, but it looks like it will be possible to set the message via a powershell script in Exchange 2010 and Exchange 2007 if you install EWS Managed API.  Right now it appears this is only available as a release candidate though.
Note that you will need to have Outlook installed on the web server you run this on, as it uses MAPI to connect to the mailserver (you also need a reference at the project level to Microsoft CDO Library, which is MAPI).  As long as you are all one Exchange Organisation, it doesn't matter which mailserver - Exchange will redirect the app to the right server.
We're thinking there has to be a better way...and that we can't possibly be the first organization to have this problem.
You can use the  section of your web.config to restrict access to the app to your helpdesk and sysadmins so ordinary users can't access the application themselves.
You just described the SOP where I work, with the exception that is typically just done for the owner of the company, and I know his pswd so it doesn't get changed.
I then wrote a little program that runs with these permissions, but set up in such a way that the user accessing the program does not need the password.  This is done by running the program on a web server using impersonation.
What we've done in the past is just reset that user's password, give it to their manager, and have the manager set the Out of Office message. At other times, managers have kept spreadsheets containing users' passwords (without IT's knowledge!) so that they don't have to involve us at all.
On occasion, a member of our team calls in sick and is either unwilling, or unable, to set their Out of Office message in Exchange.
I created a user account that has full mailbox access to every mailbox (you can grant this at the level of the server).
