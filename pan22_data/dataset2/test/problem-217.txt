That doesn't seem possible because of licensing restrictions.  A program will generally make it difficult to copy itself onto another system. Of course with free applications this is different.  If you have both application already installed and licensed on both systems, and you would like to synchronize the preferences that a different story.
Windows 7 does not provide any native support for this, and because of the Windows registry this will be very complicated.
If your apps are portable, you can use Windows Live Mesh to do this.  Mesh allows you to sync a folder tree between multiple PCs.  I use this to run the same set of programs on my home PC and two work PCs - the sync happens automatically and in the background.  
All Mesh files are also synced to SkyDrive, so both of your machines don't have to be on at the same time to allow the sync to occur.
Windows 8 will have an application store, and should provide this for you.  But in windows 7 this doesn't seem doable.
Dropbox + http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html is great for keeping settings in sync between computers. Move the settings files to a Dropbox Folder an drop a Symlink in where they came from.
