We have several servers with huge databases (on average 100-200GB per DB up to ~500GB for the biggest ones). All of them have a slave that is used for backups.
My main concern is, that this will only work for the first database. I can't do that for a second one and add that to a running slave as this would conflict with already existing data. Am I missing something or is it only possible to setup a slave for ALL databases of an existing MySQL server at once?
The servers are a mix of MySQL 5.1 and 5.5 and the new hosts should start with 5.7. Does the multi-source replication feature help with my approach?
Now I need to migrate those with minimal or no downtime and preferably one DB at a time. First thing that came to my mind is doing a backup including master-data and setup replication. With the size of these databases dumping and reimporting takes quite a while, so I was looking into using innobackupex. That works and I can filter for one DB. However I still get all directories for all databases (even though they're empty) and an ibdata1 file of close to 2GB.
