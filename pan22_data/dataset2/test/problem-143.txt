You want to make sure you have removed everything, it may be you just need to remove the virus/malicious code and restore Firewall.
You should probably run Malware Bytes or SpyBot S&D to make sure there isn't anything else (malware/spyware/adware) messing with your system. A free online scan at eSet just to make sure its all gone might be a good idea.
