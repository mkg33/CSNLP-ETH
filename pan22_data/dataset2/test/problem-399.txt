The traditional answer would be macosxhints.com. Though it isnâ€™t perfect, it seems to be the best all-around Mac knowledgebase. It is geared towards end-users but there are a number of tips that apply to sysadmins as well.
Did you succeed in finding the appropriate place to house your stuff is did this thread die? I'd be very interested in your findings. Maybe a new platform for the kind of things you'd like to post is needed after all. I've found myself quite often in the position that I'd like to share some information that I've gathered together that would be relevant to lots of other people doing the same things but I've never felt the urge to start a blog (which IMHO isn't the right form). This is really calling for an serverfault add-on or something.  
It sounds like something that might be useful at AFP548 as an article or something similar. I'd recommend that as a good starting point for where to put the information past putting it on your own website for Google to at least start indexing.
