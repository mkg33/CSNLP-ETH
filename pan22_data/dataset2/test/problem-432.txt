I once heard from another installer in my area that technically you're supposed to have a permit, but the only time it really matters is in new buildings where a building inspector is coming. I mostly deal with installations after the house is built. I've heard some guys in the states encounter similar legislation and get around it by installing PVC conduit with pull strings and running the actual wiring after final inspection.
From my experience -- no license is needed and no one pays attention to it (unless you're wiring a new building).  I've done professional wiring in Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois.  I make sure to use quality products, avoid wiring through ducting at all costs, and never attach to anything electrical or hot.
FWIW I was asking someone else about this and got the impression that in Washington the situation is much different (worse?).
A friend just talked to the local building inspector and this is what he was told: In Idaho, you don't need a low voltage license for communication wires but you do need a contractors license (~$30) and to get that you need insurance (>>$30).
I have a company in Utah that provides low voltage cabling, networking, telephone systems and paging.  Utah does not require any licensing to provide this service to our customers.  
Obviously, I'm not a professional inspector nor do I have specific legal information for your area, so take my advice with a grain of salt.
You might want to call a bunch of companies/independents that do low-voltage wiring and ask them for a copy of their license (you want to make sure they are licensed before you get a quote---wink, wink).
The best and easiest thing to do for your area is talk to a local building inspector for the proper information.
If the majority of them won't fax one to you, it probably isn't a requirement (or at least one that isn't observed).
As to how accurate that is, both of those are the information I was given from people who should know. But that's all I will say.
Currently, I am investigating Oregon and have found that several licenses are needed to provide the same service.  First, each individual must have a LEB license.  Second, one person must have a LEC license.  Third, a CBC license is also required.
