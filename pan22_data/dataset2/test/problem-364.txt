It depends on what operating system you are installing from. Either way, there is no way to preserve your current application installs though. Using Windows Easy Transfer (Vista) will make a list for you of applications you previously had installed to make this process easier though, they even suggest other programs you may want to download.
As Clifford the Red said, as long as you can prove you bought it the company will help you get registered if online registration fails.
Most software packages can either recognize the computer again or give you some leeway in reinstalling.  Sometimes they may ask you to call in to verify or reset your install.  Fear not if you are a legit user.
As far as keys go, it depends on how the developer implemented the registration. If it's a single install license, and you've already registered online, you're out of luck. If it's a device based license, it will scan your hardware and you can reinstall, since the hardware configuration hasn't changed with the new OS the registration can confirm you are still using the same computer. For extracting keys such as Office, take a look at Magic Jellybean Keyfinder.
If you are coming from XP, easy transfer isn't available, you'll want to make note (or print screen) applications you currently have installed in the Start menu and Add/Remove programs.
