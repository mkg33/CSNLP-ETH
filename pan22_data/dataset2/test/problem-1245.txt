It is not normal from technical standpoint, but it is quite common. The reason is that these drives are mechanical drives, and usually have high current consumption when spinning-up on initial plug-in. If you open your drive enclosure, you will likely see something like this, 
How to avoid these hot plug issues with bus-powered HDD enclosures? Use a self-powered USB-certified hub (good luck in finding one), with a solid external AC-DC adapter. Or use bus-powered SSD drives instead of classic mechanical spinners.
And don't listen to urban legends about classic power negotiations - standard USB system has no means to limit supply to 100 mA. See this post for more details.
Notebooks in general don't have much luxury to supply plenty of power to external USB ports, especially if more than one heavy load is plugged in. As result the port power usually has a short dip when an extra drive gets plugged in, which disrupts USB interface on the running link and causes the abrupt port disconnect. And yes, "surprise disconnect" during some critical data transfer to HDD might cause drive corruption and severe data loss.
As one can see, the drive itself uses 750 mA, which already exceeds nameplate capability of a USB 2.0 port. It is unclear what does it that exactly mean, sustained average consumption or absolute max peak, but experience shows that peak currents can be much higher, up to 1.5 A and above.
