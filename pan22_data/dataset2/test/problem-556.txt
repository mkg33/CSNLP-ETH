It goes without saying that you should have a firewall between your Exchange server and the internet with only the necessary holes poked into it, with default deny rules and such. As with any internet facing server, deploy Microsoft Updates as soon as is practically possible to mitigate any risks using that attack vector.
Sure you can. You just need to follow Configure Internet Mail Flow Directly Through a Hub Transport Server on TechNet to get this running, but it's simply a matter of creating a send connector to the internet and tweaking the default receive connector.
Depending on your paranoia and needs, you might also want to disable some mailbox features such as ActiveSync or OWA for everybody (Get-Mailbox | Set-CASMailbox -ActiveSyncEnabled $False -OWAEnabled $False). POP and IMAP are disabled out of the box, but if you choose to enable those features, consider only enabling the users that need it.
Microsoft have this to say in the same article I linked above, but provided you take sensible precautions and don't do something stupid I don't agree with it 100%. Sure, in an ideal world everyone would have an Edge transport server, but the internet facing Hub Transport server works very well in my personal experience.
