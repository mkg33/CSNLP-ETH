You need a network adapter that support ARP offload and TCP SYN wake pattern as stated in http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee617165%28v=ws.10%29.aspx
You can generate sleep.exe by saving the source below as sleep.cs, and compliling it using the C# compiler that comes with the .NET framework: 
So running connect.bat, wakes up my computer, waits 10 seconds, and then opens a remote desktop connection to it.
If those features are supported and enabled, then whindos won't warn you about sleep/hibernate policy when you turn on remote desktop.
Using the information from the other answers, I ended up creating a folder containing the following files:
You may be able to configure your network card to wake up on any packet. However, this will probably not work like you intended - as it won't discriminate between your remote desktop connection attempt and someone just scanning your network or a latent packet from a service you were using.
For now, you will probably have to settle with a two-step process: 1) wake the computer with one application, 2) Connect via remote desktop.
