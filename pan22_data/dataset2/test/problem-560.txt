I finally figured out what the issue was.  Some HP program called "Bang & Olufsen Audio" or listed under Startup as "SmartAudio CPL (32bit)".
On my HP ProBook 430 G4, with Windows 10, I had the same issue (D key would mute the audio.) None of the above fixes worked, I suspect some of the executable names have changed with this latest driver version. But I found that finding and renaming mictray64.exe, and then rebooting, fixed the issue. The only side effect I can see is that the microphone muting function (Fn-F10) isn't working anymore. But I can live with that. Also, the annoying B&O audio control panel is gone, which makes me very happy! It was buggy, there was no way to make it disappear at times.
This started happening to me on my HP 15" Zbook in the last week or two.  Just this week, I figured out it was the 'd' key that was muting my audio out.  Like AlexK mentioned, I rolled back the audio driver update from 2 weeks ago and now it is thankfully gone.
Zbook 15u G3 Studio Workstation had the same problem.  "D" key mutes audio.  Opened Task Manager, and Disabled the Conexant / Bang & Olufsen SmartAudio CPL.  Mute button functions normally, "D" key no longer mutes, but LED status of mute function stuck in the Muted indication.
