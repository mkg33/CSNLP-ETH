When a new profile is being created on a computer for a domain user, there's a lot that happens inside the registry as well as on the filesystem. Be mindful of that -- it's not sufficient to simply copy the user profile.
I'm going to assume that, in this case, you aren't doing centrally managed profiles, in other words, every user has their own local home directory on every machine they log into? 
Is there a way I can get a Windows XP computer that is a domain client to create certain user profiles without having to get the user to log in?
In that case, maybe it would save you some time to create a "skeleton" directory that you can insert for that user? A while back, I learned how to setup the default profile for my users (http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/2009/07/changing-the-windows-xp-default-user-profile/), so maybe the instructions in there could be modified for what you want? 
There is always option to tweak "Default User" profile for that purpose. If you copy stuff from desktop/ my documents to default user\desktop and default user\my documents it will be copied over when person will login for the first time. After that you have to however make sure to delete those files, otherwise each person login to that machine for the first time will get it. We used this technique for few years now while migrating users from pc to pc (in fact we copy whole profile, so that user feels like he haven't moved at all).
By far the easiest way to accomplish what you are trying to do, is to have an administrator reset the user's domain password. Then log on to the new desktop with that password, which creates the account. Then log off, reset the password again, and make sure somebody informs the user before they try to log in.
