If you have had much dealing with non-blade hardware in the past then 2/3 of your decision should derive from that. Other people will be able to provide you weighted anecdotal opinion but it is no substitute for experience. If you have previous experience of a vendor, then providing they aren't new to the blade market, chances are it will be largely transferable to their other hardware within the same CPU architecture.
I'm not sure if this helps you with for-pay bladeserver use, but if you go with an IBM BladeCenter, I'd be happy to answer any questions.
I recently bought a used BladeCenter E chassis, and the seller UPS-shipped it to me with only one inch(!) of foam padding around it. Along the way, someone dropped the 130 pound package and bent part of the case, and one of the blade handles. Surprisingly, everything still works fine!
I swear by HP C-Class blades for 98% of what I do, I'm sure the Dell are cheaper, the IBM as fast and reliable but the HP blades are fast, very reliable (and I find their service very good), HUGELY configuarable (as far as I know there are far more options available than even for the very configurable IBM blades) and the price is very good in the quantity we buy (2000-5000 per year).
I've had no problem finding and installing firmware updates, finding tutorials on configuring the networking module, and many other tasks a bladeserver newbie needs to accomplish.
On the 'easy to find information' axis of support, I've been equally impressed with IBM's BladeCenter support resources. Since I got my chassis used, support involves me reading lots of documentation. Almost every question I've had has been easy to answer, and the questions I couldn't answer involved hardware that IBM hasn't sold in a few years (old QS20 blades).
So, at least on the 'survives physical abuse' axis of reliability, I'm impressed with the IBM BladeCenter.
In our reasonable turnover of blades we have had to raise tickets on a couple of machines. One of which came to us as second hand stock. Both cases non-critical, but they had an engineer with replacement parts onsite the next day to resolve it.
...Dell I haven't tried but they seem to market their solutions on "less packaging, more hardware" which - if you don't have a good unboxing deal, is worth a lot ;) (I hate packaging, hardware I order should arrive on a cart, unpacked, charged and with all waste already removed ;)
I like IBM because their chassis are completely backwards-compatible with blades, while HP seems to have a plethora of different form factors and series. Also, IBM provides PowerPC blades (for VIOS and AIX) and I think possibly cell-processorbased blades as well? Could be fun, who knows... 
In particular the combination of the BL460c/490c with Flex-10 Virtual Connect and VMWare 3.5U4 is very hard to beat - theoretically you could support 80 servers (with 640 cores, 11.5TB ram) in a single rack with six Cat5 cables and two 10GigE fibres! 
Seems a lot of our customers at my old datacenter swore by IBM for Blade servers.  I haven't dug into them myself, so I can't give my own opinion on them.
With all of that said, I would enter my â‚¬2 for IBM. We used xSeries equipment a long time before blades came along and it always proved to be reliable, well made and well serviced, which made our choice of blade vendor easy. The same has held true of their blade hardware and it just keeps improving. Plus the new management software is a nice touch :)
As there's hardly many vendors to choose from (IBM, Dell and HP basically with good penetration and many options) I'd say pick whoever you feel more comfortable with today - your local partner is probably more important than which vendor it is.
