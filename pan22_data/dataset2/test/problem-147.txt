Nothing, absolutely nothing, beats real on-the-job experience under the supervision of someone who knows his/her trade. It's really unfortunate that system administration can't be learned under an apprenticeship because that both the industry and those working in it would benefit enormously.
Think of it a bit like driving a car. Driving an old bomb on a farm paddock may allow you to learn the controls but it really doesn't prepare you for what you will face on a busy city street or the open highway.
During an interview, setting up a personal network may be relevant during discussion but is unlikely to have much weight in your fit for the job.
Any work you do in a test lab without the supervision of an experienced person may get what appears to be the desired results but may very well be done using incorrect and/or inappropriate methods. With that in mind I think few would consider such practice as experience in an employment context. Further, I would be wary of taking a job offered by anyone who thinks differently, as their standard may be questionable.
Experience in the context of a job posting is where you are providing professional services typically involving remuneration.  Nevertheless, remuneration is not always involved and an area where you might consider to develop experience.
Fixing problems on production systems - it's the only experience I care about, anything else is just practice.
Others have mentioned it, but it can't be stressed enough - it's unlikely that you'll be able to get a job as a system administrator straight out of school.  It's generally a senior-level position and requires a great deal of trust because of the access the position requires.  That's why experience is almost always required.
A good way to look at it is whether or not the average person would consider it a job if you described it to them.
Start smaller and work toward that goal.  Help desk or desktop support is generally a good starting point for someone aspiring to be a sysadmin.  Yeah, it can be pretty menial work at times, but it shows you exactly what the work is like, lets you learn slowly, and shows your employer you can be trusted to do it right.  Once you're in the door, you can volunteer for higher-level projects that will help you stretch your skills.  In no time, you'll have the experience needed to be a successful administrator.
If you do not have an existing knowledge base and understand technology, you are unlikely to have much luck even with the aforementioned opportunities.  Understanding would be developed by configuring things at home, reading, or even school.  Universities often create opportunities where experience can be developed during your education.
