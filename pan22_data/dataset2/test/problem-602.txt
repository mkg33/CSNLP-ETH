Wrong, after identifying the failing component, I tried to hook up the R9 video card again, but same symptoms as when I restarted he first time. No display, no keyboard, no boot.
I took care of some other things and when I tried to restart -- nothing doing. The PC would power on but no boot, tested on two monitors with two different connector types.
What kind of stuttering noise did you hear when the system first failed? Can you describe it a bit more? This may be a key element in figuring out what failed.  However, if I go with the assumption that you were overclocking, it could have overheated the RAM, the motherboard and even the CPU if your cooling was insufficient.  Did you ever monitor the CPU cores' temps, and the GPU temp while playing your 3D games?
This is my media PC, and is hooked up to a large TV. So I even tried setting the resolution to 1280 x 1024.
It sounds a lot more like a RAM issue or a CPU issue, relating to that overclocking failing message you got. Were you overclocking your PC? If so, how long was it since you first started to run it overclocked - a day, week, months?  It does not boot up with the onboard video chip neither, so this is why it sounds like a system issue, and not a graphics card issue.  
I reseated the CPU and video card power connectors. But, I cant get the computer to boot with either the R9 380 connected to the PSU or the RAM stick in.
I was playing the new Skyrim remastered, when the game crashed with the screen going crazy and a loud stuttering noise. I had to cycle the power off.
The final thing I would like to know is: What power was your Power supply in watts AND even more importantly, what BRAND was it? A well-known brand like Coolermaster or a no-name? This would indicate it's quality. Did you calculate how much power your system would draw at full load from the PSU when playing an intense game?  The maximum SUSTAINED power that a PSU should be asked to give out is, I've realized, no more than 70-80% of its rated maximum. Otherwise, it will wear out a lot faster.
I removed a RAM stick. It boots and the bios message was that the overclock wa failing. I did several tests with the RAM and only on would allow the PC to boot up. OK, we're fine right?
