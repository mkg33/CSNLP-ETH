Check the cable and make sure it's Dual Link as the behavior your seeing suggests it is not. The graphics card is listed as having two Dual Link DVI ports so either port should work. 
I have a u2713hm and had the same problem.  I am using a DVI-D cable but it was a cheap one so have ordered something more premium, i'll try that when it arrives.  In the meantime I managed to get a decent picture by going into the Nvidia control panel > change resolution > customise and dropped the refresh rate 1Hz at a time and testing the new setting.  Eventually got a good picture at 40Hz, not perfect for gaming but fine for everything else.  
I had this problem myself, and it was indeed due to not using a DVI dual link cable. And on top of that, the first videocard I tried on didn't support the resolution 2560x1440, but that was at work just to test. At home, I thought to make it quick and just replaced my monitor, and kept the cable I was using for years.
I had  the same problem with my u2711, i just bought used u2711 and find the very same problem, since i dont have any display port, i use hdmi and it can reach the highest resolution (with create new custom resolution) but it appears with blurry and un-crisp display, and i tried with cheap dvi-d dual link cable and again it can reach the highest resolution (native) but not even better, blurry just like pics above. But since i got a new hi-quality-premium dvi-d dual link cable and it makes the display can reach highest 2560 x 1440 native resolution with very amazing sharp, crisp and lovely display. 
The bandwith can be a problem. Because the crt monitors died out, the refresh rate isn't a real important thing. I suggest try to reduce it so low as it is possible (if you use windows, it is in the advanced properties of your display settings). If it works, you can set higher refresh rate, if the very realtime graphics is to you important.
