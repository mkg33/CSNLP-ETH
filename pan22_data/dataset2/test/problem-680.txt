You can also run apt-cache policy without specifying a package name, which will list any pinned packages at the end of output:
The confusion stems from the fact that pinning all packages with a catch-all glob pattern changes the priority listed next to the archive, which is easier to spot than the one next to the package version:
This config does the same thing. If first row has package name it not works, but if I specify asterisk instead of package name, it works but for all packaes of these repos. What I'm doing wrong? How to set priority for one package of one repository?
I want to set priority for package "libtidy-dev" of "ppa:ondrey/php" repository to 400. So I created /etc/apt/preferences.d/libtidy-dev.pref with this content:
For example, taking a Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial system with the default configuration and illustrating with appstream, as different versions of this package are available in the xenial and xenial-backports archives (which have different default priorities):
it will works but for all packages from this repo. I dont't need to reduce priority for all packages, I want to do this only for "libtidy-dev". So I tried another way. I wrote to pref file this:
Based on the output of apt-cache policy libtidy-dev, your configuration for pinning the priority of libtidy-dev did apply: 400 is listed next to the version number.
