An easy fix. When blade is posting, click into the “F9” bios screen, a blue box will open, click down about 11 rows to “SERVER ASSET TEXT” & click. A gray box will open & click on “SERVER INFO TEXT”, there you will see the “wrong name” you want to change in a blue box, click on that and you can EDIT that name out & type in the name of what you like, ie: “BL460C-G8”. Hit ENTER key to exit then hit the “ESCAPE” key 3 times to exit, hit F10 to save changes. 
You will not see changes in the O/A until you click out of that blade & onto another column (I click on “POWER & THERMAL” tab and then click back to “Device Bay” & click back on that particular blade & you should see a name change. This will also change if you do a reboot on that blade. If you still don’t see a name change, go back to the same procedures in the F9 bios tab again & see if it did indeed change, if not, edit again but that is your fix.  
After replacing the system board in a HP BL460c Gen8 Server blade,the Product name had changed from "Proliant BL460c Gen8" to "StoreEasy3830 Gtwy Blade". This is some thing that you can not change in BIOS settings. I believe both products use the same system board spare P/N 738239-001. Could someone please let me know how to change this. Thank you.
