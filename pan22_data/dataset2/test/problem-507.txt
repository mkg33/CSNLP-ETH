They can never be sure if the person requesting access to the account is the same person that created the account since the only link is your Email and Password.
Getting a new account, maybe with the old rate will be the only way, since then Dropbox can be sure that you only have access to data that is yours because its on your computer. 
No, the password is not stored on the PC. Dropbox access is tokenised. What methods have you tried to contact them? Have you submitted a ticket through their support portal? Also, I have seen people with a similar problem to yours get help through their forums, it might be worth posting there.
If you are able to log into dropbox.com, your password is also stored in your browser. Every browser has a "view saved passwords" option.
You should email Dropbox support in detail and explain in detail of how you lost access. They are the only people who can help you here to get it back. 
There is and there should be no way to recover your password, since this would mean it could be hacked. At least it should be this way if Dropbox is taking security serious. 
Even if it were stored it would be in an encrypted form which will be pretty difficult to decrypt and recover your password in plain text.
For me, this page offers a "change email" link (after login). I did not test it, beacuse I do not want to change my email right now. Does this not work for you?
