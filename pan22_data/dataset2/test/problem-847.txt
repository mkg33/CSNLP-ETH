Different routers have different functions. However, generally speaking, the following applies to all routers:
Channels come under the responsibility of a physical transceiver which can only transmit on one channel at a time. Dual radio WAPs are not usually within the realm of consumer grade equipment, unless it's dual band A/B or G/N units.
I set mine up with two separate routers and the same SSID and separate channels. http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ConfiguringTwoWirelessRoutersWithOneSSIDNetworkNameAtHomeForFreeRoaming.aspx
To sum up, getting a router that can work on two same-technology channels independently is not possible unless you're paying a premium to get an enterprise-level equipment, in which case buying 2 consumer-level routers will be cheaper. However, getting two SSIDs is possible, but depends on firmware a specific router has, you need to research a specific model you wish to buy to know for sure.
Most of the other users have answered if you can or your can't, and the technical backgrounds into why. So I'll answer with something else equally useful, how to do it. I haven't found a stock firmware that allows this, so I'll point you to DDWRT (http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index), if you're able to load DDWRT onto your router, it's super easy to create two "networks" with two different SSID's.
