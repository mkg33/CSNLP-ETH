The monit process reads from a ~monit/.monitrc file, and monit insists that the file is only readable by the the user it runs as - i.e. the monit user.
However, that's where it all falls down - the source control directory is written to by Mercurial when I pull the latest scripts, but the pull command isn't running as monit, so the monitrc file is writable by another user... which monit doesn't like, and won't run.
I can constantly chowning and chmodding the monitrc file before and after each pull, but that is fraught with oversights.
I'm being good by having process monitoring: I have monit watching some key processes, and restarting them if they fail. 
I'm being good by not running as root: Monit runs a web-server, and I don't want it to run as root in case there is a security issue. So, I have a special 'monit' user, that has the permissions required to start and stop some key processes, and that is about it.
I'm being good by storing all my operational scripts and configurations in source-control (mercurial), so I can rebuild machines with the same specs. I, or other devs, check-in changes to the scripts to source control, and then I pull the results onto the production machine. Symbolic links point from ~monit/.monitrc into the source control directory.
