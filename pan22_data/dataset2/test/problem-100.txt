I've been in rooms with smartboards that aren't dry erase marker safe which means if the smartboard goes down the board space is lost.
Although, I do sort of miss the smart board when kids present projects. It was great for demoing game projects.
I had a smart board at previous school. I used it when we did scratch, and it worked fairly well for that. Not as useful when teaching typed languages. But the screen was pretty small relative to the size of my room so it was tough to see from the back of the room.
I've never used a smartboard but think I get the most bang for the buck with a projector onto a whiteboard. We can project sites, code, etc and also annotate by writing on the board directly (although the annotations can't easily be saved other than by taking a picture).
My room now doesn't have a smart board, but has a very large projector screen and it's way better because it's way bigger. 
Although you may think mine is a less than serious answer, the best example I have seen for the use of a smart-board in computer science is in a video from De Pauw University, when they implement a time machine to explain program code debugging.
