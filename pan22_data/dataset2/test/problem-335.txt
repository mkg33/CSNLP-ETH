I went to setting> manage Passwords and apparently it was being managed by some intel password app which I had turned off. So i just turned it back on. 
Go to Settings > Find there Managed passwords >> Turn it on... Let's provide you the screenshot, it may helps..enter image description here
I was having this problem and was so frustrated that I deleted Chrome all together.  I reloaded it days later and had the same issue, but here's what I did to solve it for good.
A password manager sounds like your friend here. LastPass will integrate with Chrome (and any other browsers you have installed), copy over the passwords you have saved to their cloud-based storage, and allow it to be updated if you change it.
Go to Chrome Settings, scroll down to Show Advanced Settings, scroll down again to the section Passwords and Forms. There should be an option - "Offer to save your web passwords". Ensure that the box next to it is checked.
I deleted Chrome (again).  Then did a search on my hard drive using the word "Chrome".  I then deleted everything related to Chrome (accept photos).... everything that looked like a text file, program file, etc.
I was having the same problem for quite a long time now, until today, when I finally decided to do something about it. Most of the solutions/answers I came across recommended installing external software, or other complicated things. Then I decided to look under the hood itself.
For some reason, this box was unchecked in my settings. I'm not quite sure how it happened, but once I checked this box, for every password update I made, I would see the pop-up box "Do you want to save this password...."
One note:  I had synched all of my favorites, passwords, etc with another device ahead of time (through Chrome / Google), so they were all available when I logged into the new version of Chrome.
