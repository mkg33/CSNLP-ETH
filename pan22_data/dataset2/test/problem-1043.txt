When I boot the laptop from shutdown state (not resuming or awakening), it quickly goes to the login screen as normal but the mouse and keyboard seem unresponsive, but not completely:
If I reboot resetting the PRAM, the problem doesn't appear until the next shutdown reboot. So what I usually do is reset the PRAM every time I boot.
I have the exact same issue happening right now. Thanks for the resetting PRAM suggestion! I would add the following as a comment, but not enough reputation yet. 
I had the same issue with macbook pro 2017 (touch bar). keyboard not working after restart and I'm stuck in login screen. I just noticed that it's related to an accesibility option "slow key", try type and hold the keys while typing like a long press.!!
I was just having problems with logging into my MacBook Pro, the cursor was moving but the password field wasn’t showing and I couldn’t seem to select anything on the screen. The tab key didn’t work, but the arrow keys did! I just hit the down arrow and the password field appeared enabling me to enter my password....phew! Thought I would share in case it helps others....
Every like 5-7 seconds I'm able to enter a keystroke or move the mouse. Using those time windows I'm able to enter the password and successful login.
I found that unplugging the keyboard from the USB port, and plugging it into a different USB port seemed to fix the issue for me!  
If anyone else runs into this, here are the instructions for resetting PRAM - https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-mac-pram-or-nvram-2260839.
It happens every time I fully reboot or shutdown the laptop, don't have any problems with suspension and awakening.
Took the laptop the the official service and it was a faulty I/O board. They changed it and now it's working fine. Notice that I didn't get a full motherboard replace, just something called "I/O Board".
