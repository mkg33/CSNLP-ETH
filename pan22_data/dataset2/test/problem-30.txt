Using Windows 10 here. I right clicked the Atom icon on the desktop and picked properties. After that i copied the "Start in" location path. I looked over there with the windows explorer and found atom.exe so i typed this in the git bash:
i just installed Atom a few hours ago, this worked for me when I browsed through the computer to select a program to open associated files (html,php...)
Note: I changed all \ for / . I do not know if \ works in git bash, i just created a .bashrc at my home directory and used / there and it worked, so i assumed / will be the way to go.
Instead of associating your extensions to the atom.cmd file (which doesn't show the beautiful green Atom icon), I associated them with atom.exe, on C:\Users\\AppData\Local\atom\app-\ folder. After first association, Atom app showed on the apps list for subsequent extensions.
I think the title says it all. I downloaded Atom, which comes over as a zip file containing an executable, etc. When I right-click on a text file, source code file, etc, in Windows Explorer and select Open With > Choose default program... I don't see Atom in the list of "Recommended Programs" or "Other Programs" (when I use the arrow to expand that list). If I select "Browse" and use the file explorer to navigate to the Atom executable file and select that, when I return to the "Open with" dialog, I still do not see Atom as an option. I'm pretty clueless when it comes to Windows, so if anyone has any suggestions I'd really appreciate them - thanks!
