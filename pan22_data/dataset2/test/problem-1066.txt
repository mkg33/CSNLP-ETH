Uncheck "Include inheritable permissions from this object's parent". If prompted to Copy or remove permissions select Copy. Then click on each entry in "Permission entries" list, click Edit and uncheck Traverse Folder / execute file item. Click OK on all pop-ups that have opened in this process to apply your changes.
