Is the information about the array written to the drives? Is that how a different controller can import the array? (I need to see how thats done)
Ive had excellent results with the 3ware 9650se. I have owned several of them: a few 2 port cards, a pair of 4 port cards, and one 12 port that I got used for a great price. I usually plug them into the PCI-e slot that is used for a video card, and they just work. 
You should be good, i haven't done it with that particular card, but with many other Hardware raid cards. The only thing i would suggest you do is to toss the card in another machine, make sure it works, and is at the same BIOS level as your old card - downgrade if you have to. 
I have swapped an 8 port card for a 12 port card  ( edit thinking about it was a 9500 not a 9650 ) and the other card has detected the array so I would have every expectation that it would work based on my experience.
I happened to do some repetitive booting in a machine that had a 9500S-8 and it appears to have suffered the same fate. I came across an article for the 9650 from 3ware saying how to fix it. I couldn't believe 3Ware's solution of the only option being to RMA the card.
Both Ubuntu and Fedora distros show all card info except one: BIOS string not found. I'm going to pull my data before I start screwing with firmware updates, in the meantime, antiduh, if you're still around and reading this, do you have any additional info about the Redhat version or drivers or other procedure I can try? I'm not convinced a firmware update will solve this..
Anyway, I'm about to upgrade one array to 5 x 2TB drives and I'll have to swap controllers, so your answers have given me hope.
Although, I have found a bios setting that causes them to crash. Its called the PCI Latency Timer. I use a lot of AMD mainboards, and those that have this bios option will default to 64. Unless I set it to 32, nothing is stable. 
Anyway, I haven't been successful in applying any of the said magic to revive the BIOS. Thankfully after a couple of reboots in a different machine, it's detected properly after booting (BIOS still not coming up), detected the raid array and I'm able to mount it and pull my data.
