Unless you are overtaxing the processor, or you schedule a routine to "update" less often, the game "loop" is going to execute 60 times per second.  Assuming the routine that moves your sprite is being executed with each loop, then the number of pixels you move the sprite multiplied by 60 is the speed that your sprite moves in a second.  
Now if you are using Cocos2d actions, such as "move to", where you must indicate a duration for the action, then the number of points between the starting and ending position divided by the duration is the speed that your sprite will move each second.  
In any event, have your game loop execute 60 times per second, or at whatever interval works for you, and move your sprite the number of pixels per iteration as desired.  
Based on your code, you appear to want your background sprite to move 2 pixels every .004 seconds.  That is extremely fast, as it equates to 15,000 pixels per second.  I can only assume this is not what you are intending.  
There are a number of things to ask, but if you understand the basics you should be able to not just determine the speed your sprite is moving but dictate it.
