It is possible to auto-login into windows using a predefined username and password, even on domains. If this fails it will present the normal login. But this could cause the user to get locked in the first place.
First, i would suggest that you take a look in the event log for event code 4740, it should have the computer name or IP that caused the lock.
If the lock caused by random computers, then check them for a stored credentials in the services, or scheduled tasks, or any other application that the password stored inside it.
Additional, Event ID 529 which is a failed logon attempt should list everywhere that has the wrong credentials saved.
It sounds like a service or a mapped drive is using the admin account with the old password.  The error log should show the IP or name of the computer that has the issue.
You will be able to see the events in the Event Viewer why your account is being locked out. It is Event ID 644. Make sure that your Security Audit is set to Success/Failure though to see these errors inside the DC's event log.
there is a utility netwrix account Examiner. you can download it from netwrix.com. Download, configure it and it will tell where your account are getting locked out.
