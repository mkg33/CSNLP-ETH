You can make the symbol for, "therefore" (3dots) by holding down the Alt key then typing 8756 then releasing the Alt key. This works on Windows anyway. I don't know if it works on other operating systems.  
I discovered by accident that if you precede the paragraph where you don't want red spell checking marks to show up with the symbol for, "therefore" then that paragraph will not show words that contain spelling errors underlined.
The trick works for me is to set page language to something you don't have language support in your computer. For example I changed page language to "Afrikaans". Then OneNote does not make spelling checking for this page because Afrikaans -dictionary is missing.
Note: this will only get rid of the red spell check marks; it will not turn spell check as you type off. So words that are normally corrected as you type such as: recieve will still be corrected to: receive as you type.
If you don't want the symbol to show up you can just select the symbol and make it white or the same color as the background if you are using a colored background. You could also reduce it's font size to 1.
The set language form does not have a checkbox (like the one for Word 2010 has). There are over 100 languages to choose from, but all of then will perform some sort of proofing.
