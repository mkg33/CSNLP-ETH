If the player tries zone B and it is too difficult, allow the player to leave zone B and try zone A instead.
Finally the last thing to remember, there is no "best balance". If you want to make your game incredibly difficult, then feel free to increase the average monster strength, if you want it to be easier smooth out the player leveling curve. The exact balance of your games difficulty is not nearly as important as it's consistency, nothing is more frustrating than a game with a difficulty curve that flies all over the landscape. 
The absolute best balance is to combine the two standard methods used in most games for determining monster strength. That is essentially a level range is selected for perhaps a region, or a monster type, and then the system attempts to auto balance using the relative strength of the player. 
E.g.: Level 10-12 monsters go in zone A, level 12-15 monsters go in zone B, level 15-18 monsters go in zone C.
The only other thing that is very important when using a system like this, that generates monster difficulty on the fly, is that you save those difficulty settings once they are generated. This is very important, or otherwise you end up with a situation like Bethesda ran into with Oblivion. That game used an almost entirely systematic approach to monster difficulty, and as a result a number of players expressed concerns that they did not feel like they were leveling up at all, since every time they visited a new area (or even returned to an old area previously explored in which they knew how difficult the monsters were when they were there the first time) they found that the encounters were of very similar if not identical difficulty.
Your percentage idea looks great to me, let your player choose if 40% or 180%. This way more people will like your game, casual player and pro, everyone will find his 'ideal' difficulty.
Player strength and player skill both affect how difficult the monsters are for the player to kill. By allowing the player to implicitly choose which monsters to fight, you take both into account.
The benefit to this is that it allows you or your designers in the future to retain some form of control over where the player should find the best rewards for the difficulty put in, while still not being as easily gamed by simple grinding, though obviously it should be mentioned that setting the possible level ranges should be refined through playtesting to find an appropriate range. 
If your game is linear (the player cannot choose a path or physical region), then spawn weaker monsters up to some lower bound if the player is killing the monsters more slowly than you expect.
Experience curve balance is a game design choice. Only you know the way you want your combat system to work, the amount of time you want someone to spend on one level, the number of combats you expect a player to take between levels, the proportion of battles a player is expected to win, the magnitude of the numbers you want to display to a player, whether you want the experience-per-level to go up each time or not, whether any or all of these factors should change over the course of play (and in which direction), etc. Choose the experience you want, then do the mathematics to work out how to get that.
