When I hover over the link, I see that there is no "/home/username" in the link, so somehow Notes must add it after clicking on it.
The default application for links is set to google chrome and it works from within other apps but not from Notes. I always get a popup complaining about a link that can't be opened.
If you've typed this accurately, it looks to me like the links are mal-formed. I.e., you're showing "http:/hostname/path/site.html", but there should be a double slash after "http:", and you've only got one. The client is noticing that there is not a valid prefix ending in "//", so it assumes it is a file link and is adding a valid prefix - plus it thinks it is a relative path since there is no leading "/" before "http", so it adds the user's home directory as specifice in the environment.
I have Lotus Notes 9.0.1 running on Xubuntu 15.10 and I can't find a way to open links by just clicking on them.
When I define that Notes should use the internal browser it works, but it is not my desired behavior.
