Its a bit late, but I'll post anyway. There was a forum post somewhere I was just reading that says to add a line in at /etc/services, called pptp. just specify the port you want after that and you should be good. 
Clien is easy: edit /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf add port 7654 if it's not already there (but it should be). The server is also easy because you can't (unless you edit the source code).
I khow that PPTP uses more then just tcp/1723. It also uses GRE. it's not a problem. just how to change default PPTP TCP port.
Is there a requirement to only use PPTP as if other VPN solutions are acceptable you may find openvpn lends its self to your needs better
My understanding of poptop (the pptpd server) is that you are unable to specify a port number for the server without patching the source and recompiling.
As you can see it is defined in pptpdefs.h - and as such in order to change this port - you would have to recompile.
It may be possible on the server side to preform an IPTables src-nat to accept connections on another port and redirect this - however I would suspect that the client would still need to be updated.
