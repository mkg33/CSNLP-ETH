I have written many level editors for commercial mobile games with Java, and I can strongly recommend using Java2D, which is part of Java. If you don't need 3D graphics and the editor is not performance critical, you can get things done easily with Java2D. It is a strong 2D graphics library with features such as arbitrary shapes, Constructive Area Geometry, antialiasing, strokes, affine transformations, text rendering, arbitrary clipping and alpha blending. I have found these very useful when creating user interfaces for level editors. E.g. good looking marching ants is easy to implement for arbitrary selection shape. Images can be zoomed and rotated with filtering and there is no need to allocate textures, instead Java2D automatically uses hardware acceleration where possible.
You can also use Swing for creating some of the UI. Menus, toolbars, object choosers, dialogs can be implemented with Swing components with little effort and you can use Java2D inside them wherever you want.
These choices are good when making Java applets, since they don't require any native libraries outside JRE or additional downloadables.
Since your game is written in objective-c and you have decided to use Java for the level editor, I assume that the level editor doesn't need to render the levels exactly as the game engine.
