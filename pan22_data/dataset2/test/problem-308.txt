Firefox:  The page is loaded correctly, then a continuous stream of data is sent from the server.  It continues until Firefox is killed.  The internet connection into my office is maxed out until I kill the browser.
This happens no matter what kind of page is loaded.  Even something as simple as the following will cause it:
IE9/10, Chrome: The page is loaded correctly.  Everything is fine unless I reload the page.  At that point the page loads correctly but the continuous data stream starts and continues until the browser is killed.
I saved the huge favicon file in another location, now I have to figure out where it came from or what happened to cause it to be so large.
The same thing happens with a fresh install of Firefox on a different machine so I don't think any of the browsers are at fault.  Both of the machines I've tested on are running Win8.  The only thing these two client boxes have in common is an ADSL router.  Later today I'll check with an XP client to eliminate the possibility of a Win8 related issue.
An apache2 server on an EC2 instance running Ubuntu 12.1 (all updates installed) has a major problem, I've pulled so much hair out that I don't have much left.
Using a copy of Microsoft Network analyzer, I found that there were huge bursts of packets loading favicon.ico
I've compared apache2.conf with another server that does not exhibit this behaviour.  Nothing is different.  There are a number of apache2 modules running on the affected server.  I haven't yet compared the module config files but will begin to do so now.
Any time a page is loaded into a browser from the server, one of two things happens, depending on what browser is used to connect:
I'm not inclined to suspect this is a hacked server symptom.  More likely that I did something to cause it.  I don't know if I can trace the cause back but I'll try.
