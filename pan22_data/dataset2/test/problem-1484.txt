I'd recommend looking at virtualization software such as VirtualBox. That will let you install other OS without totally leaving your familiar windows environment behind. You will loose a bit of performance, but on modern systems that's not a big concern, and certainly not for what you're saying you have.
If you could point me to a link of simple tutorial / book that'd be great so I could study on my own.
Disclaimer: I'm not trying to sound like a Mac fanboy; in fact, I actually prefer Windows. However, for your situation, I think it's the only real way to go.
For MacOS, the only legal way for you to do it is to buy a Mac, though there have been reports of success in installing MacOS under virtualization software.
I hate to say this, but if money isn't a concern for you (it doesn't sound like it), I'd recommend buying a Mac and running Windows and Linux inside virtual machines (such as VirtualBox). There is no legal or reliable way of running Mac OS X on a PC, especially if you plan on doing development for it. On the other hand, a Mac can run all three operating systems simultaneously.
I'm a Windows user/developer itching to start diving into the *NIX world and Mac OS software development. What software (both paid and free) would allow me to install/easily run other OS (Linux, Mac OS X, Unix, whatever) all on the same machine.
