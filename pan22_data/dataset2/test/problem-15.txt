Routers are predominantly designed to run routing protocols that regularly alter the path of traffic. They also handle numerous high-touch features such as NAT, QoS, security, VRF, etc. Outside the high-end market, routers are partially or totally software platforms.
Generally speaking you would say that a Router, has more power in case of hardware, because it is designated to make routing decisions, but this still depends on the device.
In general, layer-3 switches move packets faster (near line rate) because everything they do is in hardware. They tend to be cheaper and cheaper to operate (power, personnel, etc.) vs. a comparable router.
Chances are that a "layer-3 switch" has more front-panel ports for cheaper than a "router", with less support for protocols and table size, while both do all forwarding at line rate, but that's highly dependent on the specific hardware in question.
Both "layer-3 switch" and "router" are essentially marketing terms - they have no definitive technical meaning.
You can't say that there is a "advantage" of a L3 switch, because it depends on the hardware and software of the device.
For example, it's easy to take a commodity PC with a few NICs, load linux on it, and *poof* it's a router. No matter how much you hit it with the spice-weasel, it'll never be a switch.
It's all about the business requirement. To put an example, the Cisco Catalyst 3850 has a more rapid backplane than a Cisco ISR 2900 series router. Nevertheless, Cisco ISR's support way more media types than most other switches (Cisco). Some tangible hardware design of switches may actually be valuable (or not) for their use in particular conditions.
