How do I capture the traffic between the Android device and the AC unit in Wireshark? I do not understand why the traffic (which is certainly being sent and received) is not being picked up by Wireshark (or possibly the MacBook's network interface).
If I create a new capture configuration in Wireshark on the MacBook and use default settings, including promiscuous mode, set the filter to "host 192.168.100.100" (i.e. the AC unit IP address), start capturing, then send a command from the Android device over the wifi to the AC unit, the AC unit responds to the network command, but no traffic is captured by Wireshark.
The scenario involves an Android mobile device, a networked air conditioner unit, and Wireshark running on a MacBook Pro.
My goal is to capture these packets in order to build an Android Things client to replicate those network commands to control the AC unit in different scenarios.
All three devices are on the same wifi network. The wifi router is a Google Wifi and its management interface shows all three devices connected to it. The router displays the AC unit IP address. I can use the Android device to control the AC unit over the wifi network.
