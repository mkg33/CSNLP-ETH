I'm not expecting a complete solution (but that would be nice!) but any guidance as to whether I'm on the right lines would be greatly appreciated.
I'm working with a SharePoint 2013 installation on a SQL Server 2012 cluster of two DB servers. It's only been up for a week or so and my transaction logs have already filled the 25GB allocated for them on each box. This is only a test environment, so I don't really need to keep the transaction logs (normally I just set the logging to "Simple" and let nature take its course) but obviously the logs are needed to ensure everything is replicated properly. What I'd like is for the logs to be dumped as soon as they are no longer needed, but I'm not sure how to accomplish this (or if it's even possible).
Based on my current (limited) understanding, I've set up a Maintenance Plan using the wizard that runs every day to backup the transaction log (so SQL Server will allow it to be deleted). I've set the backups to expire after a couple of days so that hopefully they don't grow too large. Do I then need steps to shrink the databases and cleanup after the plan to get rid of the logs?
Disclaimer: I'm a dev, not a DBA. I've gleaned what I can from MSDN, but could do with some expert guidance!
