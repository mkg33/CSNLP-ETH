No layer gets bypassed. Here is a good visualization from https://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/OSI_Layers.asp:
Every explanation about the OSI Model (or other Models) always gives me the impression that the data (PDU) from the top layer (Application Layer, L7) always go through all of the layers until the bottom layer (Physical Layer, L1).
So, you might have Ethernet, containing IP UDP, containing an encapsulation header, containing IP TCP, containing data.  
That's just enough layers to get the job done. Note how the VPN routes without caring about the higher layers of the application. It does not matter that the data happens to be HTTPS protocol, with its own added features like TLS encryption. It could just as easily be the archaic Daytime Protocol, very simple and probably just one packet.
Capture some actual packets on a physical interface with some VPN traffic. Dissect the capture with Wireshark.  You will see encapsulation, the data contents of the lower layer containing the necessary upper layers.
