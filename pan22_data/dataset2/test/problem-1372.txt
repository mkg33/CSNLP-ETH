Is the publisher of pdf have encode their text? Or my computer Window 7 don't have fonts needed to read. If this is the case, how can I find the fonts being used?
Take the text, save it through PSpad (download it), as through notepad, as a file with htm extension and look at it through internet browser. There you can change the font/code table by hand. 
I have a pdf file written in Vietnamese language. I open it with Foxit Reader and able to read it in Vietnamese. 
If I copy the text to Word I can't read the text in Vietnamese any more. Also, when I change mode to Text Viewer Mode in Foxit Reader, I can't read as well.
Third possibility: Mostly languages have several code tables. You can be looking at text in one code table, while it is written in another one. This possibility could be caused by font, too, but thus we return to the first case). 
"my computer Window 7 don't have fonts needed to read" - it could be. Check if you have appropriate fonts, found as Randolph West says, in the pdf properties.
If you can choose a coding to see it there, the problem is in Word. Simple font changing in Word change will help to see the text. Beware! You can see it, but you can have problems with printing or with giving it to somebody else (rather HE/SHE will have these problems). It depends on how rare the used coding table is. So, maybe, you need recoding even in this case, but you will already know from what to what the text should be translated. 
If you can't see the text there anyway, the problem is in windows/pdf compatibility. Look out for recoding software.
