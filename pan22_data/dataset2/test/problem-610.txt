To pull this off the black-hats would either have to gain control, or spoof the MS update servers, or convince your copy of Windows to go to another server.
Obviously MS should use some signing/encrypting of the stuff they send, but I cannot find any references on the net on how exactly they do this...
If they could hack your Windows machine and change those things, then they've already got all the access to you they need.
They would also have to correctly encrypt and sign the fake updates they are sending you to convince your Windows they are legit, or hack your Windows to accept their incorrect encryption.
They use (at least) public key certification and TLS/SSL.  Beyond that, there's probably a few proprietary secrets involved.   
Windows update sends software that gets installed on your system. Amongst other things, they might send you root certificates. It is clear in any way that if anyone could tamper with the stuff microsoft sends you, we would be in big trouble.

If they wanted to hit a broad audience via Windows Updates without hacking each machine, they'd have to do it via the fake/spoofed server method, which would be exceedingly difficult.
Incidentally, you just have to talk nicely to Google: http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&q=%22windows+update%22+%22root+certificate%22+%22certificate+authority%22 :)
Here in the MS privacy statement (as referenced by Windows Help when searching info about updates) was the closest 'direct', plain-English reference I could find showing they use SSL to transfer information.
