If you have a position of your character and position he's aiming at, to calculate angle between those two points, you need to do the following:
By subtracting character coordinates from aim coordinates we get a vector from character to the aim. Then we use this vector coordinates as an argument for the Math.Atan2(y, x) function;
Math.atan2(y, x) returns radians, so if you need to degrees, you need to multiply the result by 180 and divide by the Pi.
If you are very new to game development, I would suggest you to pick up a Math book for game development, I would suggest you:
Let say that your character is pointing to the right of your screen, that would mean that your "normalized" vector would be in JavaScript as var playerPointingDirection = {x:1,y:0}. 
Well if it's a web 2D game then you character direction can be represented as a vector, let's call it playerPointingDirection.
To move a projectile coming from the player position, you would instantiate the projectile in the player position and add this vector to the current projectile position multiplied by the projectile velocity the result value would be the position of the projectile in the next frame.
