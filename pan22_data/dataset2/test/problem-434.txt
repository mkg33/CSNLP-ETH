I am planning on installing Windows Server 2008, but was needing to know whether it would be more efficient to install multiple independent virtual servers on the same box; one for the web server, one for the database server, etc, or to just install Windows Server and SQL Server on the same OS instance.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, and at what point would I need to consider moving to a multi-server architecture.
One of the main advantages you get from virtualisation is that your 3 components are now independant, your developers can mess with the staging server, break it, without affecting the SQL or web server. If you find you need to reboot one server, you can do so without affecting the others.
I understand that the performance has a lot to do with it, so for the sake of discussion, lets say the server will have Dual-QC Xeon (approx. 2.66 GHz) and 16-32 GB (memory is just too cheap).  Thanks.
Hey all...Forgive me, as I am not up to speed on my server administration abilities.  I'm currently looking at specifications for a new server that I need to build.  The server will need to serve multiple duties such as: 
There are however some downsides, resource use will be more, your running 3 OS's instead of 1 (or 4 if you count the host), that's 3 extra kernels needing memory and CPU power, and disk space. There's also the extra cost of licensing, both in terms of windows licence as and CALs.
Not unless you have backup hardware handy and ready to be deployed on a moment's notice.  Single points of failure are what in the industry call "Bad Things".  
It also means you can split resources, if your web server uses alot of memory you can give it some extra and take some away from the development server, without worrying that teh developers will run some memory intensive app that will stop your web applications running.
It also makes backups easier, you can take an image of a whole machine, and easily restore it if a problem occurs, even to new hardware.
