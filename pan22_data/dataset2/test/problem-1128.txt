I recently bought a Western Digital Black 6 TB 256 MB hard drive. It works and has fast read and write speeds. The problem is that makes a slight “bump” sound every 5 – 6 seconds while at idle. If it’s quiet in the room and I’m just browsing the web I can hear it. If I’m watching videos or playing games I don’t really notice it. It’s also pretty loud during reads and writes. I have never seen a hard drive that makes noises like that (I’m assuming it has something to do with all of those platters for 6 TB of storage right?) I ran Western Digital’s Data Lifeguard Diagnostic software and did a quick test and an extended test (which took 8 hours). It passed both tests which is good, but the noise still kind of bothers me. I was on Amazon and saw the Western Digital Gold Drives.

Do any of you guys have any experience with the Gold ones (or both)? Would the 6 TB Gold drive make less noise than my Black one? One thing to note is that I am using it inside my PC for regular use. This is not a server or anything. So the noise is kind of important here. The sounds my Black one make are extremely distracting to me.
