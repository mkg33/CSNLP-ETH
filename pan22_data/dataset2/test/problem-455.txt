The third option I thought of, is working with an USB sniffer. I know that most sniffers are simply pieces of software running on a computer, although there are (very expensive) hardware solutions. 
My first thought was to connect the controller with the Xbox and the computer simply using a USB splitter (2x male to 1x female). However, from others I learned that the USB protocol is bi-directional, meaning that the computer and the xbox would start to fight over control over the controller. 
I think a software-based USB sniffer won't work unless I find a way to connect the controller to both the Xbox and the PC at the same time without the PC trying to gain control over the controller. 
I have an Xbox 360 and a wired USB 2.0 controller. I would like to be able to play a game on the console with the controller whilst a Windows computer registers what my input on the controller is. I want to run a program, showing me exactly what input I am pressing at a specific time.
To summarize: in the most optimal case, I would have the Windows computer recognize the controller as a gamepad, while still being able to play on the Xbox at the same time. Is there any way to accomplish this? Should I build something myself? 
My second thought was to buy a switch. But that wouldn't allow me to have the controller send data to both devices at the same time.
