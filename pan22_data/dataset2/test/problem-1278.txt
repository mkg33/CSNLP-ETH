If the unit is still under support, the replacement drives are free.  Call Dell and they will send out someone with a new drive (time will depend on your support agreement).  I've done this a few times with our SAN that we bought from Dell.
My own experience with other vendors has been that they will swear up and down that other drives won't work...then, of course, I tried it, and it worked fine. 
Of course, if this is for enterprise usage, you should not use your own. The reason is that the drives that they sell (with the high markup) have specific firmwares that disable disk caching, and probably other things that I'm not aware of. 
Might work, but not supported. If you run into trouble, the dell tech will demand you remove everything non-Dell provided from the MD. And without those disks a disk array is not usable, and troubleshooting is not possible. 
David, the text provided on Dell's website only indicates that you can mix SAS and SATA drives that are purchased from Dell within a given PowerVault chassis.  It does not mean that you can use non-Dell drives in this unit.  The License Agreement that accompanies the hardware details this limitation.
MD3000i only accepts DELL certified disks. There is not secure way to add thirf party physical disks even with same model because the firmware is owned by DELL (both SAN and disk).
