That being said I would probably combine full import with creating new by creating a new AD forest and import the users only after adding the computers to the new domain.  You will have to re-permission.  Depending on the number of accounts and servers ignoring the old domain and rebuilding might be simpler.
If the sites have no way to talk to each other it'll be very tough to do.  You'll be better off just building up a new domain and creating new accounts.
what is the best way to move my existing domain controller (Windows Server 2008 Standard SP1) to the new server (Windows Server 2008 R2)?
Alternatively, moving a domain controller between sites could work (although will probably mean ntdsutil cleanup). Virtual machines can be useful for copying/splitting off a copy of a domain, although there are good reasons why Microsoft says to not use snapshots and it's best not to ignore that advice unless you completely understand the implications.
Can you just pick up the old servers and move them to the new facility?  Then build a new 2008 R2 server, made it a DC, move the FIZMO roles to it, and remove the old machine.
Can the systems not communicate at all, or is it just that between hosting providers the normal Windows/AD ports are not open? If the latter, depending on exactly what is allowed it may be possible to set up a IPSec policy between them using a pre-shared key to allow secure full communication and promoting the new machine and then demoting the old after all services are moved. This would have the advantage of being a real-time sync throughout the migration.
You can move the user accounts using a numnber of import and export tools ( see Step-by-Step Guide to Bulk Import and Export to Active Directory, Import or export directory objects using csvde, and  Using LDIFDE to export users from Active Directory ) 
I want to move my old hosting setup (multiple servers in a domain) to a new more robust environment.
