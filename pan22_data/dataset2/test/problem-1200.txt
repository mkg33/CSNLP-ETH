For example, mail.company.com was accessible both inside and outside the network, as were the hosts vpn and www.  I needed to make sure both DNS servers were changed when any of those hosts changed (which they did a few times).
Is there any reason why I shouldn't use example.com as my AD domain versus example.local or some other non-existant variant?
Bottom line - this is not a best practice.  But if you only have a few Internet-accessible hosts, it's not that big a deal.  You should really, really host your AD DNS on your local domain controllers.  You probably shouldn't expose your local DNS to the Internet.  
I inherited a network where the internal and external DNS names were the same.  This was a relatively small business, with only a few external hosts so the problems I had were minor.  The internal DNS was hosted locally, and I would strongly recommend you do the same.  The external DNS was hosted at an ISP and only included records for hosts that needed to be accessible from the Internet.  The (minor) problems I had were primarily in making sure I duplicated any Internet-accessible hosts on both the internal and external DNS.
