The biggest difference is that you can reattach to your screen or tmux sessions from other terminals (be they terminal emulators, VT's, SSH sessions, or even real serial terminals), but cannot do so with tabs in a terminal emulator.  This may sound simple, but it brings up one of the biggest advantages to using screen or tmux, especially if you're dealing with a remote system: It can stick around beyond the duration of your current login session, which is immensely useful for a number of reasons.
Neither option is really all that much more efficient in terms of system resources, and which is more efficient in terms of UX is largely dependent on the user themself (for example, screen is more efficient for me, because I'm used to all the default key bindings).
In both cases, each window/tab ultimately has one associated pseudoterminal (usually abbreviated PTY).  The real difference here is just what's actually controlling which pseudoterminal your input is going to and output is displayed from.  The exact mechanics of how a pseudoterminal works are a bit complicated, but well documented multiple places online.  The basic idea is that it gives a process a way to pretend to be an actual hardware terminal so that it can run another process that expects to talk to a terminal.
