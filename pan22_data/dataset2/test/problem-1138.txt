When I've had similar problems installing the WHS connector software, it's been because the client has had trouble finding the server.  What's your network setup like?  Wired/wireless?  Are these other PCs connected the same way your main PC is?
I would copy the entire Home Server Connector software to your local drive and run it from there. In a few cases I've had failures where running directly from the home server failed but running the exe from the local machine worked fine.
I have tried getting the Connector working of a variety of machines now, so I don't believe that the error exists on the client end.
Check the time zones on your home server and your client machines. I once had that problem and I resolved it using the same time zones on all machines.
I'll bet you're using non-ANSI characters in your system password. For some reason, they boogered the handling of the password in the web-service protocol that the Connector uses to talk to the server. I've got an open issue on the Microsoft Connect about this (as well as one they shouldn't have closed.
I'm having some difficulty getting the Windows Home Server Connector to work on multiple machines. My Home Server server is up and running and working perfectly with my main PC (which has the Connector installed). Now I'm trying to install the Connector on subsequent PCs with no luck.
On the client PCs, I run the Connector installer. An error occurs after being prompted to enter my WHS password:
