use Xampp, for php, its work in port 80, so you can test your codes by url http://localhost, and If you want use asp.net you can stop Apache from xampp control panel and run your asp.net code
I want to use http://localhost/ for either for XAMPP for PHP testing, and something like http://localhost:32465/ default locations for Visual Studio for .NET C# and ASP.NET.
You just need to configure Apache on port 80, which is the default. And you need IIS to bind to port 8080 (or whatever port you want). By default IIS will bind to port 80 but you can edit the port number in the properties for each site. This article deals with changing the port that IIS listens on - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/149605. That way you can have both running instead of having to stop one before starting the other.
I added a new IP to my LAN machine, like Apache uses 192.168.2.21 and localhost uses 192.168.2.20 and then defined a new Virtual host at the apache IP and named it http://apachehost/ and then changed all localhost's to apachehost in httpd.conf, also updated the settings for mysql, they're both running fine now.
