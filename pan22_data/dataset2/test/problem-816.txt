Go to your new routers page, then Setup -> Manual Internet Connection Setup -> Access Point Mode -> chek the "Enable Access Point Mode"
I'm have a D-Link DIR-615 Wireless N 300 Router. I didn't use the CD it comes with to set up the network. Instead I configured it manually through the router's settings that are accessed via a web browser.
I have the same router you have, and basically the same setup (it was installed in a network that already had another router)
I can connect to the router just fine and I'm able to access the internet. The only problem is that I don't see any of the other computers in my LAN. When I try connecting to another Wi-Fi router that I have (which is connected to the same network), I can see all of the computer's on my LAN just fine. Therefore, I'm guessing that the reason I can't connect to the LAN is not a problem with my computer and is a problem with the router instead.
I tried contacting D-Link technical support, but they only try to help you if you have problems connecting to the internet. They aren't really concerned with problems that have to do with the accessing PC's on the same network.
For your MAcBook see the other computers, they must all be on the same network (ie, share the same IP range, usually 198.168.0.xxx)
