Oh, one more thing - even though I'd prefer the bulk of it to be done by Sunday morning, I'll have remote access via VPN + VNC and FTP, plus if your solution requires it I can install other stuff like a remote shell or something. Just throwing that out there.
I have a very specific and strange situation - I need to remove as much secure information as possible from a shared computer as quickly as possible without removing almost any of the core functionality. I have 3 days to finish my thesis, clear out my desk and workspaces, pack everything and get on a plane to move 3000 miles away permanently. Needless to say, I'm aware that the timing is not ideal.
Note that your 'most secure' requirements conflicts with "without removing..." You can't have it both ways ;-) Only wiping the entire disk with software like DBAN is secure.
I'm aware that this is actually 3 questions plus the vague and ill-defined implied 4th question "What am I missing?", so if more experienced people think I should split this up into 3 separate questions, I'll edit appropriately. I think they're probably related enough that there's a non-zero chance that there's a single solution or strategy that solves all 3(4).
This list is not exhaustive, I'm just adding what I come up with in addition to what you suggested yourself.
Remove all users but one administrator on the machine. Change the ownership of the folder C:\Users\ to this administrator: Right click on the folder, go to the Security tab, click on Advanced button. Go to the Owner tab, click on Edit, select the remaining administrator under 'Change owner to' and mark 'Replace owner on sub...'. Press OK. Close every window with OK. Then you can shift-delete (permanently and quickly) the directory.
The problem is that I've been the sole exclusive user of this shared console computer for the past few years and I've been more wreckless about leaving personal information on here than I had hoped. Normally in this situation I'd try to back up the data and do a secure delete, but that's problematic for a number of reason, but the biggest one is that I'm the only person in the lab who knows how to manage some of the complicated webs of dependencies upon which some of the essential programs rely - even if I started now, there wouldn't be enough time to securely delete everything and re-install everything, and that could put everyone else a month or more behind schedule. (Not to mention some of the equipment this computer runs is out of date and new drivers break it, so I'd be relying on the ability to get archived drivers).
