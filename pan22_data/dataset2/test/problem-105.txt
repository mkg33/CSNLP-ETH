You could also port the job's output to a file i.e. cat /etc/passwd > somefile and then open it with your favorite text editor when its finished. Nano (nano -w somefile) is my favorite as it wraps (with -w) and is quite functional. May not be what you are looking for though.
I like to use tee for big output.  Use "big_output_cmd | tee log.txt" which will still show the output on the terminal and also dump the output to the file log.txt.
Note that you can also scroll up and down in PuTTY's scrollback buffer using the scrollbar on the right or Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn.
Whenever performing big tasks with lots of "text", the text gets cropped or something from above. I want to be able to read ALL that has happened.
The script command will save all output from that shell session to a log file ISO just one command at a time.  Just start it with "script log.txt" and you get a shell that has all stdout/stderr getting dup'd to log.txt.
In addition to the other normal solutions here (less/more/pg), you can use the "script" command to save all the output from an interactive session for later use.
