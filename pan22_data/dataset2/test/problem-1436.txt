I suspect the answer to (a) is simply performance. Full volumetric path tracing / photon mapping based on the RTE can certainly be done (and I'm sure it sometimes is), but it's very expensive and requires enormous numbers of samples to converge to a noise-free result.
As for how the coefficients are measured, one technique I've read about is to shine a narrow, bright beam of light (like a laser pointer) onto the material, then measure the light scattered back out using photosensors placed at different distances from the incident point. By processing this data you can then get an estimate of the scattering coefficients. This paper shows a sensor based on this idea being applied to human skin, and this one has more details about setting up a sophisticated (multi-layer) BSSRDF based on empirical data.
This is especially true when the scattering medium is very dense, like in human skin and hair, or materials like milk, plastic, marble, or jade. In such materials, the light scatters so quickly that it's essentially isotropic after a couple of millimeters, so a BSSRDF is a very good approximation to the true volumetric scattering, and far cheaper to evaluate. (Performance matters even for offline rendering!) A mixture of volumetric simulations and empirical data might be used to derive and validate the BSSRDF.
