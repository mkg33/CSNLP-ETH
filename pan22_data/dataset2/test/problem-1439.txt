This is analogous to saying "I do want a front door, but I'll keep it locked at all times, unless I need to use it, at which time I'll open it up temporarily".
At least, change the default folder... My logs are just filled with hundreds of attempts to find a variant of the 'phpmyadmin' folder. I prefer to use something random, at least it will keep the bots away.
I have it installed on my webserver. I have permissions on the directory d--------- unless I need to access it, then I:
I would say - don't have it available on a production server if you can get away with it - i.e., if the business does not explicitly request it.  One way you can at least improve security would be to have it "switched off" at all times, unless an administrator switches it on, and even then, either via policy or a inactive-timeout, it should switch back off.
Finally, remember that giving users/staff convenience is always easy, taking it away is much harder, so again, don't add it unless you really have to.
We install it on production machine AND expose it directly to the internet. We are a webhost though so have little choice in the matter.
Also, restrict access to trusted IP's, or use a password-protected directory, and be sure not to have easily hacked users in Mysql (or to create very restricted and specialized users for phpmyadmin to use).
The main thing is to stay up to date on new versions and follow the security mailing list. We can upgrade our phpMyAdmin installs in one click too with our upgrade scripts.
Changing the port it runs on is "security-through-obscurity" at best, don't rely on any security gain from that; You may wave off a few script-kiddies, but you'll also be putting yourself up for managing a non-standard setup.
