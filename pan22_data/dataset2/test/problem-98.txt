Beyond just "It's really a good idea", there's certain industry specific SAP's, laws, or regulations that might be involved. In an educational or government institution, I have specific laws I need to be sure are enforced in regards to access to student information. Similar requirements exist for companies who are publicly traded; they must comply with SOX. The medical industry, or any industry that handles associated identity information along with medical history, must follow HIPPA. Any company that stores credit card transactions must comply with their merchant agreements, which are usually VERY explicit about what the machines are allowed to store and who has access to the machines. Your industry's mileage may indeed vary. 
The best practice in my mind is to either prevent access entirely to non-admins, to provide a security escort while someone's in the server room who is not authorized for global access (i.e. vendors), or to keep key-locked hardware in place and restrict keys to subsets of authorized users/admins. The last part is the best-practice for most colocation spaces where you as a customer will rent space. 
In my experience 75% of service/system outage is down to a 'layer 8'/wetware problem - people spilling drinks, pressing buttons they shouldn't, tripping over cables, even 'testing' RAID failover for no damn reason!
Physical access to a machine is always the most critical part of security, and the one most often overlooked.  Having escorted access should be fine, especially if you have logged access to the area.  In a virtualized environment, physical access would not be an issue.
Keep people out, one way of doing this is to have a manual entry log with a 'reason for entry' field that they have to write themselves - that'll stop people without a good reason.
Security has already been mentioned as a reason not to. Another is health and safety. DC's can be dangerous environments for the untrained. These can both be mitigated of course by policies such as "You must be accompanied by a trained member of staff for example. Our data center requires that staff are not given access unless they have done the appropriate course. And customers certainly are not allowed access unless accompanied.
There are other data centers where customers absolutely must be allowed physical access. e.g. To restore from a tape using a local drive. This kind of access will be required if for example the facility offers disaster recovery/business continuity facilities. The customer's own premises may have been destroyed, so all functions are temporarily performed in the data center.
To a very large extent it depends on just what sort of hosting you are providing. Some data centers will never need to allow visitors in, although it can be helpful to have windows through which the customers can see the hardware.
Do not allow anyone into the server room who you do not want to give access to the equipment on the machine. Or, have physical access (along with KVM or other local/console means) to the controls of the machine restricted if you are going to allow others physical access to the machine room. 
Also: If you have the opportunity, make sure you have an "airlock" system that requires two forms of access, which prevents "tailgating". In our case, these are punch and card-scan locks. The entry into the foyer requires that you punch a code into a lock. Once you're in the foyer, you need to scan an ID card to enter the actual server room.
