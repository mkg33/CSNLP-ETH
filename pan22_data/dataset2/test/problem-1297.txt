If yes, this is maybe just the controller of the enclosure itself spinning the disk up differently. I also had an external enclosure controller die on me recently and it all began with weird noises. The disk however ran fine in other PCs even after the enclosure died. This however doesn't mean your enclosure is faulty. Could be some power issues.
I used my older laptop for a little more than three years. When I replaced it with a newer one about a year ago, I removed the old hard drive and dropped it into a 2.5" enclosure. The drive is starting to click once when connecting it to a USB port, and I'm afraid it'll soon shuffle off the mortal coil.
If no, run some tests on your drive (SMART, other tools) and see if your old drive makes the same noise in your laptop when you put it back in. Then you will likely have a hard disk problem and the enclosure should be fine.
But is it rational for me to suspect the enclosure of killing off the hard drive, or was it just the hard drive's expected time to die? I'd like to continue using the enclosure, but not if there's a larger-than-remote chance of it killing another drive.
