TeamViewer and similar remote assistance programs aren't the best option for this because you connect to the other computer through their servers (mainly to avoid firewall and NAT issues), so your gaming session is send from your gaming computer to internet and then send back to your other computer.
Note that even with direct connections you may not get an acceptable performance since that tools are not designed for video or gaming.
* Although the Remote Desktop client is included in all versions of Windows the server is only available in professional/business/server editions, although there are some dubious hacks to workaround this (dubious in the legal sense, the hack itself seems safe).
I want to play on my non-gaming computer (ground floor of my house) by connecting it to my gaming computer (2nd floor). I tried the teamviewer but there's a significant lag with this setup. So is there a way to eliminate the lag? Maybe connecting both of them with Ethernet or something?
In order to minimize lag and use the full bandwidth of your local network you need to use a remote program that use direct connections, like the integrated Remote Desktop (only for professional* versions of Windows) or some VNC variant like TightVNC.
