Some games and apps have me holding down the left mouse button for a long time and I would like to reduce the stress on my mouse hand. Also, I would like to do a similar thing but have it repeatedly click the left mouse button automatically if possible.
Does anyone know a way to configure Windows 7 or use third party software to do this? I would like to click my middle mouse button and have it tell Windows to left click and hold until I click the middle mouse button again. A keyboard key would be fine as well. 
There is a brilliant free open source successor of project fastclicker resides at sourceforge too. It is called "The Windows Intel Fastest Mouse Clicker" (google it). That application uses modern SendInput() system call instead of obsolete mouse_event() in fastclicker. Also "The Windows Intel Fastest Mouse Clicker" is heavily optimized with Intel C/C++ compiler 15.0.
I use The Windows Intel Fastest Mouse Clicker too. A week ago they fixed a bug, and this app is 100 times faster now than FastClicker by xytor mentioned above by Michael (with the bug it was 10 times faster).
If none of that is possible, how about temporalily setting a keyboard key to achieve a left mouse button emulation?
Also I watched at source code of The Windows Intel Fastest Mouse Clicker and adopt it for Java in my current projects. Hint:
1) Seach for "Mouse" for where you search for program and files. Then click on the result which should open "Mouse Properties".
