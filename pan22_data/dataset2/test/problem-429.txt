I have a second idea, but I am not sure its possible. Let me preface this by saying I know very little about networking. very little. At home I develop on my linux box. My landlord, a very old non-technical person, shares free and fast wireless internet over an unsecured wireless network. I understand that this is itself a security risk.... but I would only like to bother this old man if absolutely necessary.
I have a wireless router. Is it possible to set up my router such that I can have my own secured wireless network, but have that network use the internet access from the unsecured connection of my elderly landlord? This would potentially solve two problems for me. Close up a rather large security hole, and allow me to configure my router for port forwarding and be able to ssh into my home machine. This way Ill be able to code through emacs or vim through a putty window.
Sorry if this is a complete bone head question, and thanks for an answer. Any other ideas for letting me code remotely from work?
I am a student working a library job. Its a great job for a student, since I have lots of downtime to study and get other work done. So naturally, i want to work on my java projects. I spoke with our IT person and he said that installing the JDK was a security risk... damn. It would have been so nice to check out a fresh copy of the project every time i went to work and commit the changes and see them at home. anyway...
