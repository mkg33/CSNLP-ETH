I had the same problem on Windows 10 and it happened when I resumed the notebook from sleep by using USB wireless mouse. It seems that sometimes Windows doesn't know why it resumed from sleep and assumes it was a remote wakeup.
I have got the same problem with my Lenovo T530 notebook with Windows 7 Professional 64 bit. The reason was the driver of the Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000. The problem has been solved after switching off the checkbox "Allow this device to wake up the computer" at the "Power management" tab of the keyboard driver settings.
