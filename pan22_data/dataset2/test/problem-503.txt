Some flash drives OTOH do use the password as part of the on disk AES encryption that they use to implement the 'Secure Erase' functionality properly.
Assuming it's a proper harddisk password it's not usually secure for spinning hard disks. The password you enter is stored in some non-volatile ram/flash on the drive and the drive rejects data access commands until you send one that matches.
Instead of thinking about encrypting your full disk, I would recommend you instead look at specific data in a secure way. Meaning—for example—I am using Mac OS X. My main hard drive is not encrypted. I use GPG/PGP for some mail interactions, but it is mostly in the clear.  What I do care about and secure I keep stored on encrypted disk images I can create within Mac OS X’s built-in “Disk Utility.”
Now let’s say someone stole my system. Maybe they could glean some info from my mail, but not anything worth anything… They would not know my keychain password. And as for encrypted disks go, even less so… They wouldn’t be able to mount those disks and do anything.
If I need to decrypt that data, I just mount the disk, enter my password and access it. And when I am done, I just unmount it and there that is.
For a spinner you'd probably be better using "Bit-locker" (if available) or Truecrypt (if you're not completely paranoid). Possibly even for a flash.
So my advice to you is even if you are not using Mac OS X, maybe you should reassess your overall security mindset and footing. Remember: Security is a mindset more than it is simply one “mega” tool you install or setup. Encrypting your whole boot disk—which can be at least 50GB for most people—is a bit overkill. But carefully maintaining and securing the data you feel is most sensitive is a more practical way to go.
