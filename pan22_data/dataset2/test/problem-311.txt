Have you considered that perhaps one of your index creation scripts has failed to run which could then be resulting in a table scan for data?  Or perhaps you tested on a small data set which would up being pinned in cache but in prod you don't have that luxury and an index is called for.
Start looking at the changes between the two environments in terms of configuration, communication and load.   One or a combination of these is likely the key to a difference.
On your production box you likely have to compete with other queries that you do not have to compete for resources with on your development instance.  Also, if your development instance is running on your localhost, which also generates the query, versus the introduction of a network link (Busy, slow, error prone, WAN distant) then you will have an issue of the amount of bytes having a zero time travel path across your local bus versus a complex network path.    There are other items which can come into play, such as running on physical OS/Hardware on your dev instance verus running in a VM with hypervisor arbitrated access to CPU/DISK/RAM/Network which can cause deviations as well.
