I'll just put this here in case someone else needs it cause I literally just stumbled upon the answer now through trial and error, after an entire day of troubleshooting this issue. I read so many posts and blogs and none of them recommended adding the max_connections directive to my.cnf. 
I have an Azure VM with CentOS 7.1, Apache 2.4.6, and MariaDB 5.5. The VM has 2 cores and 3.5 GB RAM. The server is only hosting a small WordPress site with almost no traffic.
I've tried with the default settings too and it makes no difference. Here is a sampling of the errors from the MariaDB log:
For the past two days, MariaDB constantly crashes with an OOM error. I've tried so many different things for tweaking performance and so far absolutely nothing has helped. This is the current config from the my.cnf file:
What can I do? I have other VM's in Azure with the same specs and running many more, and more complex, sites, and they have zero crashes.
After adding the following lines, all my issues cleared up and MariaDB/MySQL stopped hogging all the memory. Your values may need to be adjusted for your specific scenario.
