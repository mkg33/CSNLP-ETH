Regarding the 4" "void", that would be referring to the height of the raised floor. 4" is really in the realm of "low profile floor" which are usually 6" and less. They are for power and data cables, not for air.
Regarding the OP's question about woodcore panels, there are still a couple suppliers out there but trust me, woodcore access floor panels are NOT used hardly ever. Yes, they have worked in the past but most people are shocked you would introduce a combustible material into your data center.
Not ALL of their server space has raised floor. A lot of it doesn't. They do overhead cabling and duct in the cold air, so no need for the floor. But when they do have floor, it's plenty tall to allow for cables, piping and unrestricted airflow.
First of all, I know this is an old thread. But I've always been of the mindset to reply to threads despite their age, because they are always a good source of information for future visitors!
If you want underfloor airflow, the minimum height is really 24". I've seen far too many 12" floors with huge airflow problems. It's just not doable. Please don't try to pump any air into such a short floor! The cables will not give off enough heat to require cooling!
Bottom line though, I would steer away from wood core panels. They are hard to find and are a smoke and flammability issue. Also, I've found they do tend to chip more.
 floors. Once you get above 6"-8", you are talking regular access floors and your brand choices open up considerably. With either of those floors, though, you can put lots of different floor coverings on top (carpet, tile, etc.) or just leave the panels bare.
Also, regarding optimum floor height, everyone will have their own opinions. But I can tell you from first hand experience, that the big boys who are using raised floor in some of their data centers are building 4'-6' floors. I'm talking Google, Apple, etc. 
Ask any HVAC engineer about underfloor airflow, and you will get a lot of opinions, but no one would recommend pumping cold air into a 4" floor. It just won't work, and it will cause far too many problems (hot spots, etc.) than it's worth.
