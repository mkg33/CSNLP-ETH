compute_fractorial_value doesn't actually do anything specific to fractorials. Perhaps compose_factorization or multiply_powers?
I would expect the name fractorial to be either the final integer or the function which computes it. Perhaps fractorial_factorization would be a clearer name.
The algorithm used to compute the prime factorisation of the fractorial is correct, but overkill. If \$p\$ is a prime and \$a\$ is a positive integer, under what condition is \$p^a\$ a factor of the \$n\$th fractorial?
Apart from the previous comment about the name, the only thing I'd say here is that if you really want to scale this up, multiplying lots of small numbers is best done on a tree-like basis. I.e. you pair up the numbers, multiply each pair, pair up again, multiply again, ... But that's overkill for this problem.
Apart from the hard-coded primes, this is a standard implementation. I would suggest that p is more conventionally used to denote primes[i], so perhaps power would be a less surprising name.
This is half-way between the na√Øve approach of not defining main() at all and just dumping its contents at the end, and the "best practice" approach of
