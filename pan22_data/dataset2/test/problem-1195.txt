This is automated to run every time the counter reaches X seconds, and it will start the next object on the order of the children of SceneControl, (make sure to declare SceneControl in Start()).
Currently, I've made a script that can move a series of clouds from left to right, or right to left across a background sprite given a speed (note: I'm not using any of the animation tools, simple C# scripting to move the objects on a loop).
I once needed to do this, to have several "animations" play off one after the other, here's my approach :
I've been using Unity3D for about 2 weeks now, so I'm certainly at the (pre?)-beginner level, I do however have over a decade of C# experience, so I'm comfortable with the scripting aspect.
Just revisiting this after a while, I've found that the Fungus Framework on the Asset Store was just what I needed.
For example, some trees (sprites) move down the page, which starts some text moving in and cloud sprites to appear and start to move across the page, then some text begins to scroll from the bottom to the top of the page, while some audio beings to play.
As part of an interactive book I'm developing in Unity3D, I'm attempting to make an introductory scene that consists of moving lots of objects at different times - usually when another animation has completed.
You can otherwise choose whatever to do with the objects, and whenever to control them according to your needs, the basic idea is to make them all inactive, and set them to become active, after X second passes, after animation ends, after (insert condition here).
3- Make a script that you will then attach to SceneControl. In this script, you can choose whatever you like to do with the children : 
1- Create an empty gameObject, let's call it SceneControl that will be the parent of everything you need animated in your scene, for example Trees, which will contain all the trees, Clouds, that will contain all the clouds, Text, etc..
