A good way to get the player involved simply would be a nicely drawn background of a scene in the game, or some storyline reference; a loading bar with/without percentage, as long as it isn't a static 'Loading'; and then maybe some information.
It's worth noting that the platforms with quality control requirements (e.g. X360, PS3, DS, etc.) will all require you to have some form of animation in your loading screen (or in fact any screen which remains static for more than a few seconds).
Common things to do during a loading screen is a static background image, a very simple level, some tips and tricks on how to play, quick animations, etc.
For the loading screens in Conquest, I went with a little bit of mission description (what game type it was, as well as a little bit of storyline for the mission), and some basic help on the commands.
Remove any graphics specific to the last level - get rid of something that isn't going to reappear like a boss.
As others have said, if you can load all of a level's data before you start playing it, then you'll have much better performance. It's a common source of hitches in frame time to load assets during gameplay.
And when you're loading, make sure not to have a black screen. Or for that matter, a static screen. Many a time have I seen a static image for a while at the start of an app, and immediately thought it had crashed.
In the background, I was loading sounds.  The graphics were all loaded on demand, and that seemed to work pretty well for our game, but sounds were a bear, so I preloaded all of the sounds needed for the mission.  The Loading/Start button is disabled until everything's loaded, but I don't have any type of animation (which would be a good thing to add).
Any form of animation is fine, but a simple progress bar may not be the best, as any large steps in the loading may result in the progress bar not moving at all for a while, meaning the screen is just as static as if there were no bar at all. Better to show some continually moving image, like a rotating icon, in addition to a progress indicator.
This is because otherwise the user may think that your game has crashed, when in fact it is just taking a long time to load. Even where this is not a requirement, I'd certainly advise it.
On iphone and Android platforms, you must load all textures and sounds. Loading textures and sounds is really slow on old phones as iphone 2G, 3G or G1. You can't do it in the game.
