I'm not sure on an intelligent way (by that I'm assuming you mean you'd want an automatic solution), but you can manually used gparted (which has a GUI interface) to reduce the size of your main ext4 partition.  This would allow you to write it to other cards that are slightly smaller, or depending on how much you shrink your partition, to cards that are much smaller.
On the Raspberry Pi desktop (launched by using startx in hard terminal) you can click the menu button (commonly on top left), click accessories, and then SD Card copier. From there you can copy your ENTIRE SD CARD to a flash drive, hard drive, or another SD card if you have an adapter. I use this to backup both partitions of my SD card. 
My Raspis create a backup every week on my NAS space with raspiBackup. Use dd if you need to restore it from Windows or use tar or rsync otherwise. rsync uses hardlinks and the backup time and -space required is quite small. Give it a try.
deja-dup will allow you to selectively back up folders and files at scheduled times to a connected drive
