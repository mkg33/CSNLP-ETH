Right now im accessing a SAMPLE db which is in remote server. I found that its default instance db2inst1 with database name "SAMPLE". Since everybody using the same database for all their purposes, i want to create a new DB for my application. i tried connecting to the server through telnet. Since there are lot of data in SAMPLE db, cloning or duplicating same would help me save time. Please can someone post some set of commands or steps to duplicate SAMPLE db through telnet and sqldeveloper. If not commands or steps for creating a new db also is fine.
If you want an exact copy, you may need to ask an administrator to do a BACKUP and RESTORE into a new copy (or do it yourself if you have high enough permissions). Otherwise, if you do not need all the data (or structure) and just want a database to play around with, use the CREATE DATABASE command (pending you have high enough permissions) otherwise ask an administrator to do it for you.
The SAMPLE database is usually created with the db2sampl command (documented here for DB2 LUW 10.5). You can tell db2sampl to create another SAMPLE database under a different name with the -name option (note: this command must typically be run by someone with SYSADM privilege in the instance, e.g. by the db2inst1 user). For example, on a Linux box:
Do note, you cannot have more than one database with the same alias catalogued on the same server. (So while there could be two copies of SAMPLE, perhaps one remote and one local, they both cannot be named SAMPLE on that server.)
