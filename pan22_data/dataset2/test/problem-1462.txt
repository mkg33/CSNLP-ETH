I had the exact same issue while trying to restore a backup created with Windows 7. I was using a usb stick with an official Windows recovery disk on it. It correctly finds my backup image and I can start the restore process, but shortly after I get the error mentioned in the first post.
I also changed the volume label of the partition where the backup is placed from "C" to "G" (or something other high) using diskpart. Doing this without unplugging the usb is not sufficient, the error still occurs. If both are necessary I cannot say as I never tried it without changing the label.
Never ever use any windows tool when your data or time is at stakes. It does not even work when you are doing it completely the windows way (create and restore windows system with windows utilities). There are great (bootable) system backup tools out there, the time needed for choosing and getting to know one is well invested.
At the screen where you can exclude partition, pull out the usb stick (or remove the CD/DVD). The process is loaded into ram, so everything will continue to work - and miraculously, the error does not come up.
