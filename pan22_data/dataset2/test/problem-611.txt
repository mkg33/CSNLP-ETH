This is a tool to test Authentication on websites. It will show what authentication type is used: Kerberos, NTLM, basic, none. But it also shows other information like: SPN used, HTTP headers, decrypted NTLM and Kerberos authorization headers. And it can also show and delete your Kerberos Tickets.
I will give you example, accessing file share by name like \server1\share would invoke Kerberos and should succeed given proper permision. But accessing same file share using IP address would invoke Kerberos first and fail (as there is no SPN for IP Address) and then fail over to NTLM.
So determine how your program is trying to authenticate against AD and should tell you which protocol is being used.
Assuming you're auditing logon events, check your security event log and look for 540 events.  They will tell you whether a specific authentication was done with Kerberos or NTLM.
You should really be auditing logon events, whether the computer is a server or workstation. It's helpful to figure out which users are accessing your system, and to troubleshoot security related issues.
I think question should be twisted on its head. Active Directory supports both Kerberos and NTLM. Windows will first try Kerberos and if all requirements are not met it will fallback to NTLM. 
You can modify your Audit Policy with Group Policy: Start...Run...gpedit.msc...Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Local Policies, Audit Policy, "Audit logon events". Check the "Success" and "Failure" check boxes. Try logging out and logging in to see some typical 540 events in your Windows Security Event Log.
Depends on the client/server that is involved.  For example, there is a web page (sorry, don't have time to search for it now) you can put on a web site that will tell you if kerberos or NTLM was used.  However I know of no way to tell what authentication method SQL server has used.  Although as has been sugegsted before, the security log may tell you.
