The blue numbers are the indices in either direction. In your specific case, with z going up and x to the right, where z fills up first, the idea would: be
Don't forget though to make sure you are using the correct values, since as mentioned before these grids can be different and thus examples may not always apply to your situation directly.
Where the Z and X axis are potentially infinite in either direction how can i get the number of the tile, based on the Z and X coordinates.
So to be more specific here a small, very artistic paint illustration of the situation you have above :)
Using this method you can for example also treat a "normal" one dimensional array as a 2 dimensional one, since you can always calculate which cell in the one dimensional array you need to access via the x and y indices (useful for i.e. graphics programming in some areas)
Not sure if this will answer your question to your satisfaction, since I do not know if the prerequisites apply in your case.
Now I have defined this very very general in sorts, since it is very dependant on the orientation of your grid and in which direction the rid grows.
