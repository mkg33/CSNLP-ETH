Note: the ampersand means the process runs in the background. To track the state of the running process, simply tail the nohup.out file that gets created:
Using Percona Xtrabackup for quite a long time on different flawors of Linux. Unfortunately, it's in alpha for Windows.
The reason you got a "Server went away" is because your terminal session timed out. Use nohup to prevent the process from being interrupted, like so:
There is no way to have a progress indicator, by the very (non-linear) nature of the SQL dump. And there is almost no correlation between the dump size and the actual disk utilization by the MySQL server.
Note that using compressed SQL dumps is faster, since it requires less I/O for reading the actual dump. Eg:
use LOAD DATA INFILE is the complement of SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE. this should be much faster as there is no sql parsing involved.
The 'server went away' seems to indicate that something is dropping the connection between your mysql client and server. Either the MySQL server crashed (or ran into unbereable slowness), or check your network if yor server is remote (some firewalls are painfull with long lived TCP connections).
