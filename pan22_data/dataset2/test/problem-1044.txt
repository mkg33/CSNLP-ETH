You may have had a head strike.  This means that there has been physical contact between the head and hard drive platter.  If that's what's happened, it'll never recover.  The HD is done.    To recover from this you could investigate a data recovery service.  They typically dismantle the HD, move the platter to a known good system, and force a read off every sector.  It only runs about $1K in U.S. dollars.
If it was running, then Everett is right, the HDD is probably done. If it was off, there is a chance a connection has been knocked loose and causing the computer to freeze. Here are some things you can try.
I dropped my hp laptop (I have windows 7). There was a blue screen with the cursor. It took about an hour or two for the startup repair screen to appear. Then it says to wait at least an hour. I've been charging my laptop for around a day now and the same screen, with a bar with blue moving, is still there. It says it's fixing disc errors. What can I do to get to the windows screen with usernames and pictures/fix it? thanks.
