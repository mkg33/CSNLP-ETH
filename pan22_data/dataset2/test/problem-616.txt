When everyone is happy with the VOIP system's performance you can re-do the telephone lines as an additional ethernet jack for each office (or at least the offices that need it - IT folks.)
Generally the switches in VoIP phones are exceedingly crappy, especially if you're using bargain phones (Grandstreams, low end Aastras, etc.).  I've seen them be as low as 10mbps switches.  If you can afford it, I'd run separate cable drops for the PCs.  It will save you headaches later.
For long-term use I favor multiple cat5 drops - especially if you've invested in gigabit infrastructure (all the phones I've ever used have been 100Mbps switches).  As an added bonus, if one jack goes bad (wonky cable, construction gone wrong, etc.) you still have a chance that the other jack is working, so you can move the user over to the "spare" jack until you can repair the cable problem.
I'm working on setting up a small business with IP Phones to connect to the Asterisk Server. Now, for simplicity we just ran 2 CAT5e lines to each room, and 1 was hooked to a phone jack, before my VOIP plan was approved. The VOIP phones we got have a port to connect to the computer as a switch. Are there any downsides to using the built in switch on the phones or should we patch in the second lines to each office for the phone as dedicated cat5?
