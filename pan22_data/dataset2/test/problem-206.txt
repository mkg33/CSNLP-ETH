This should tell you a bit more about what is causing the BSOD.  Failing that, an indication of what the bugcheck code was (and which parameters it had) will also help point you in the right direction.  You can look up bugcheck codes at:
I got it too. When you disable VT in the BIOS, the crash does not happen (but of course the emulator will run without acceleration).
I would be looking to get the memory dump from the BSOD, and analyse it using WinDBG (which is installed as part of the Debugging Tools For Windows in the SDK).
Disabling VT-x (Virtualization) does not give this error but the Emulator runs on a lower performance as acceleration is not present. For running emulator with VT-x, deleting all app preferences and emulator images then re-installing the Emulator helped solve the problem.
If you don't remember the bugcheck details, and don't want to reproduce the issue again, take a look in the eventlog (eventvwr), in the system log.  There will probably be an event from the source 'BugCheck' in there with the details.
