Of course if you are interested in a particular programming language or library also include that in the search terms.
E.g. if you are interested in temperature sensors search for "raspberry pi temperature sensors".  That should give you a short list of potential sensors.
Your specific mention of wireless adapter is confusing since the Pi 3 has wifi built-in, but for other models, every USB wifi adapter that I've tried has worked since the most common wifi chipsets are supported. I've also never had an issue using keyboards or mice, including wireless ones from Logitech.
E.g.if you are interested in the DHT22 temperature sensor search for "raspberry pi DHT22".  That should give you a list of implementations on the Pi.
As for sensors, it would help to know what you're trying to sense. Most sensors output an analog value-- a variable voltage-- which you cannot read directly with a digital input on the Pi. You will need to interface through an ADC (analog-to-digital converter) via the SPI or I2C protocol, or you may find sensors that do that already, so you won't need a separate ADC. Sensors might use SPI, I2C, or 1-wire. I'd start with a simple example using I2C, since I2C is a fine way to communicate with many devices, both input and output.
