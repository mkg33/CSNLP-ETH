so, tailor the resume to the prospective employer's needs, e.g. do some research, find out what equipment/systems they have, and emphasize the relevant parts of your experience
a resume is a sales brochure; you are the product. There are no magic certifications just as there are no sure-fire features for selling any other kind of products: it's all about matching needs and abilities
for example, if the prospective employer uses a web-server farm for asp.net and a failover cluster for ms sql and other critical servers, experience with such systems should figure prominently (and hopefully recently) on your resume
At the risk of quoting myself... I have a lot of suggestions on format and content on this blog post:
if you don't have experience with MS farms and clusters but with some other kind of farms and clusters, emphasize those and bone up on the differences for the interview
If you put it on your resume without qualifications you'd better have supported it in production and know it inside and out:
Be specific on the technologies you're familiar with. Tailor your knows to the company - for example, if they have alot of webservices, capitalize on your IIS/Clustering/Web farm experience.
Lastly be interested in computers generally, and be able to demonstrate some sort of commitment to customer service and support. Sysadmin who don't understand their role as technical support and value it are a waste of time.
Certs are optional if you can prove you have experience.  Same goes for degrees, unless you plan to move into a job where you wear a tie and make pie charts all day.
