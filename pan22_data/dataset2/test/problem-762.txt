I wonder if there even is a way to use a gui in this setup. Excuse the long description but I need some advice here. If there is any other way to implement a GUI in this setup, I'm all ears! Thanks.
I've got a Windows machine with my Git checkout e.g. C:\MyProject that I'm using TortoiseGit with. I've shared this folder in Windows: right click/properties/sharing. I'm running a Ubuntu VM that is accessing my share for building/debugging my project. 
I am using Vagrant,Windows environment and running Ubuntu inside the virtual box for my development work. I have setup an instance of Samba server and I run the I access the virtual machine through vagrant and Git Bash and run the command 
in windows cmd. This creates a virtual drive in Windows and I can access all the linux files from windows. Git related operations run fine with the Bash CLI. I want to try and setup a Git GUI like TortoiseGit.
This is allowing me to access all my files on Windows while still be able to natively build and debug my application from within my Linux VM. I'm sure you could do something similar with your vagrant setup.
You then need to create the file /root/.smbcredentials to store your Windows username and password. Adding the following to the file:
I have already tried to change the folder options to show hidden folders, show archives, remove the readonly on the drive, but still the .git folder remains hidden. The .git folder is visible when I run the ll command on the CLI. However it remains hidden when I access the virtual drive from windows.
