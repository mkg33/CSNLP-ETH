There are limitations to running the mounted GCS bucket as a traditional file system. For one, latency is an issue and you'd be missing traditional filesystem features like renaming or permission modifications. George covers some details here: Anyone using “Google Cloud Storage Fuse” in production?
I cp -R the directory contents from /wordpress/wp-content/uploads to the /mnt/google-drive/wordpress/wp-content/uploads, and then mv the original uploads/ folder to uploads.original/, so I can make a symbolic link:
My objective is to use Google Drive to store media files for a Wordpress multisite using Fuse, and so far I am able to mount Google Drive with google-drive-ocamlfuse as root.  I can mount the Google Drive as /mnt/google-drive and do cp, rm, mkdir, edit files as root, etc but am not able to change file suid/guid.
Unable to create directory wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2013/10. Is its parent directory writable by the server?"
I have tried using -o allow_other but to no avail.  The suid/guid of the files on Google Drive are all root:root and I'm guessing that is why Wordpress is unable to write to it.  I have also tried using -o uid and gid flags but it doesn't change the resulting file or directory permissions on Google Drive.
