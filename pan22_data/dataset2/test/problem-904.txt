As far as Linux based distributions go, RedHat is extremely prevalent in corporate environments. So other distributions may be personally preferred, having RedHat experience is likely to be more helpful in a "gaining a job" capacity, until you've worked with enough different distributions that you can quickly ramp up on any of them.
Whichever *nix you go with, I recommend trying to get away from the GUI and doing as much as you can at the command line. Servers are frequently headless and/or GUI-less, so it's useful to know how to modify configurations, run diags or otherwise troubleshoot your install without having a GUI to rely on.
If you really need to go beyond that, IMHO the BSD's and Solaris are about equal in penetration. But that's just my opinion.
Depending on the environment that you're looking to work in, you may find that Solaris is a useful skill to have on your CV too.
There are two flavors of Linux package management. For maximum compatibility with the market place you need to know both flavors:
You might also want to look at Solaris 11 Express from Oracle. It's free for personal development and non-production use, and is a good place to gain experience with a real Solaris OS. To my knowledge it's the only one of the UNIX solutions that you are likely to find in a corporate environment (e.g. AIX, HP-UX, etc) that has a free version that you can play with.
RedHat-something is what's dominant. If you have time, learning OpenSUSE/SLES will earn you extra credit. 
You also might want to make sure you focus on more than just installation and turning things on and off. Try to build some custom packages on the platforms you choose to experiment with, and other types of tasks that typically don't make sense for a home setup due to the extra headache involved, but are run of the mill in a large environment.
It also runs well within VirtualBox, if you don't want to dedicate a machine to it, which is also true for the other UNIX and Linux distributions. 
They all have a pretty unique approach to how the system is laid out and particularly the way services are managed. If you can get your head around each and understand how to add to and modify the systems (in a way that not only works, but is congruent to the rest of the system) you will be able to work on anything.
...If you want me to make it easier on you, then here you go:  RedHat or its derivatives (CentOS, which is basically RedHat but without the RedHat brand, and Fedora, which you might think of as the bleeding edge of RedHat).  There are definitely other distros out there, so if you learn CentOS and a really hot SuSE position opens up you could get passed over.  But if you want to play the odds, I'd say go CentOS.
What's critical is what's needed at your next job. However, there are some trends in the marketplace that'll help guide you.
Do a Dice.com search in the major metropolitan areas for "Linux Administrator" and you'll have your answer.  IMHO.
