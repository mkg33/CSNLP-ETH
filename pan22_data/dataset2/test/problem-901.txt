Now seeing this I guess chrome from its side not able to provide proxy authentication, and somehow its using IE sessions only.
I suggest you install Fiddler, which will provide you valuable insight into what is happening with http (and https) connections from your Windows client. 
Chrome ask for proxy authentication and I supply the same, infact saved them(with my domain/user and password, I have tried without domain as well). But I believe supplying those details to chrome doesn't matter atall as when that authentication window appears it never goes, irrespective of supplying the user and password and at times no authentication windows but I can access the net.
If I refresh the proxy session in IE i.e. opening new tab and visiting some website, and then I try connected some site through chrome it gets connected, never ask for any proxy authentication.
How can I make it work, because I don't want to open IE every time to use chrome, and worst thing is chrome ask for authentication every 5 min, if i do not refresh in IE I just cannot use chrome.
You would need to tell us what authentication mechanism is in use, and which proxy server is being used.
