To answer this, review all the other answers. Also check if you're utilizing your upstream bandwidth or not. You say you have 3 DSL lines at 8 Mbits each... OK, that's nice, but what's the upload rate on those? If you're running 8Mb down but only 384kb up, that's 24 Mb downstream but barely over 1Mb upstream. While most users download more than they upload, every TCP connection sends SOMEthing upstream... and some, eg Skype calls, VOIP, BitTorrent, etc, send a HECK of a lot upstream! If you're utilizing all your upstream bandwidth, then even if you have plenty of downstream to spare your users aren't going to be able to use it til they can send their ACK packets, their requests, their half of the video call, etc.
Once you can identify your upstream and downstream bandwidth and utilization thereof, you can begin to tell what up/down bandwidth you'll need.
If they send you more information (for instance, they have to upload backups or reports on a frequent basis) than they typically download at a particular time, you might be tying one hand behind your back with DSL technology, even when bonded. There are so many speeds of DSL it doesn't help to ask here- just determine what your full upload capability is from the client location and compare that to 1.544 Mbps. If it's less, and they need to send you gobs of info versus receiving it, then you need a T1 at their location.
A leased line isn't shared (1:1 contention ratio) so you get all the bandwidth all the time so can be quite a bit quicker than the numbers would suggest. 
As fibre is not available in the areas of our estate at the moment, we are looking into installing Leased Lines. 
Selling points like SLA are great but in the past we did not have downtime issues so it is hard to justify the costs.
first of all this is my first post on this forum however I got quite a lot of very helpful information from here in the past.
You're either being quoted T1 (1.544 Mbps) or E1 (2 Mbps) lines. Those speeds are symmetrical, so you get 1.544 in each direction of a T1 simultaneously. The "A" in ADSL means it's asymmetric, and regardless of your ADSL speeds today, the upload of the circuit termination is a fraction of the download rate.
If your problem is 1 or 2 then moving to a leased-line at the same headline speed is likely to help. A leased line gives you an uncontended path to your ISP and typically gives symmetric up/down.
OTOH if you don't need too much upload and your DSL lines are managing to deliver their headline speeds then I don't think moving to a leased line at the same headline speed will help much.
I don't know where you are based, but I'm in the UK. Here ADSL is "contended" in other words you are potentially sharing your connection with a number of other users this can hammer performance at peak times http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contention_ratio
If the bandwidth is greater, then it is going to improve the speed of the connection... however, that's not your real question, is it? It seems you really want to know if it will improve the perceived speed for your clients.
My company is operating in travel business and the at the moment we really struggle to meet our guests internet demands. We upgraded our connections to bonded DSL to gain more bandwidth however it is still not enough.
Also keep in mind that T1 lines can be bonded as well (in a former life I bonded 4 of them for roughly 6Mbps of bidirectional access).
Our current supplier was unable to provide us with impartial info if it is going to take major improvement on the speed( they just want to sale more...). Since there is a massive hike in pricing costs I need to understand if it is going to improve speed of connection.
Any input or experience in difference of speed between bonded DSL and Leased Lines greatly appreciated.
The problem to determine is- where do you need the speed? If the clients you service are needing to pull/download information to them to be happy, then bonding DSL is cheaper and can get you more than 1.544 Mbps of a T1. That's why ADSL technology is so popular in the residential Internet Access market- people send small amounts of internet requests that are fullfilled by webservers that send many multiples of data back (like video or web pages). 
"With the advent of ADSL2+ ("up to" 20Mbit/s service), FTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet) offering 40Mbit/s services and even FTTP (Fibre to the Premises) offering 100Mbit/s, BT no longer work on "contention ratio" as a planning rule."
If you are in a region of the world that has E1's, substitute 2Mbps for the 1.544 you see in this post.
