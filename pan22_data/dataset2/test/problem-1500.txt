They all work and unfortunately break sporadically and silently every so often. And you will never know until you try them or test them. Be warned!
You will have to "experiment" with the level of pain you are willing to take and the results you want i.e. which tool you like after a test drive or two. unfortunately, like most of life this isn't simple or easy, especially the first few times.
Wikipedia has a good definition.  The short answer is an ISO is a way to send a CD or DVD as a single file that can then be burnt to a disk as a complete file system.  The most common use of an OS ISO is to distribute a Linux OS.
But if you are willing to dare greatly, the reward is worth it. Like, late some Friday night when your PC goes belly up and you are on deadline. With this method, system? You just get something to drink, install from your DVDs and in about an hour or so you will be good to go.
Yes, it is not easy initially, yes it is a pain, yes you should read all the "how to" and help files you can get. I had to luxury to grow along with the technology, but if I was going to start doing this now from scratch I would use an older computer to "practice" with first.
If that works I save this as my final "when all fails" go to. I also go to the manufacturer's site and save off all the drivers etc. to CD.
2 So right out of the box (brand new computer) I pick one of the afore mentioned products and create an image to disk and test install it to a secondary or portable hard drive.
When you would like to copy your OS disk into another disk / HDD you can create an .iso format image.You can run it by using virtual cd tools like Daemon Tools / Power ISO or write your ISO file to an other cd/dvd to use it later.
When I get a fall back customized setup I like I make another image and test it. IF everything is a go, I setup a backup plan for saving any new drivers, programs etc. and other changes so I can re-install my customized image and add the ongoing "stuff" until it becomes a hassle and then create a new customized image. Repeating as needed.
1. Yes, I do backups frequently of my files. But, when I got a new PC it came with a disk image on a CD. then the CD was removed and I had to cast around for another solution. Yes, MS has backup utilities in the OS, but I found it lacking. Gizmo's site has a list of utilities.
This may take awhile. I won't get into "the weeds" since this is a process you have to feel you way through.
3.Next came ghost a wonderful imaging program to save my 95-NT 4 systems. I even created a way to use it with XP.
Recently, I have been using Linux tools, so far they are a pain in the "you know what", but they are more reliable and give me the option of saving dual boot machines with a little more work, but better results. This is one of the many junctures that makes setting up a step by step "how to" problematic.
3.Then I take my system and remove all the crapware, add my "stuff" i.e. customized boot screen, desktop manager, software etc.
