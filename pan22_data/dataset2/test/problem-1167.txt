If you were to set up Samba, this would allow you to share parts of your linux filesystem with your windows systems. The samba share acts just like a windows share so only the portions of a file in use get pulled across the network. There are lots of HowTos available on setting up Samba but as you don't say which linux distribution you're using I can't point you at one. 
The problem is that if i connect for example with winscp to get the log files to textpad it first fetches the full log and user needs to wait and it bloats etc.  I would rather the textpad to somehow access the unix machine and get only the relevant segment of the log file (large log files could be GB) anyone knows how can this be achieved?
I'm interested to access large log files on a unix server with textpad.  (textpad for history reasons, i personally prefer ofcourse less awk grep etc) but I have many personal who rather be using textpad they have years of experience with it and can tweak it to do whatever they want.
