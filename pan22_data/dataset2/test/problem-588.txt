I did similar by moving printers one at a time. Removing it from the directory on the old server and adding it to the new, leaving the printer on the old server for a little while. Then eventually removed it from the old servers and the users were told ahead of time that if they had issues with printing, to simply re-add their printers. Worked super smoothly.
As a note, you may not get to experience this issue, but my print server VM was causing a lots of slow. We created a second virtual drive and moved the spooler directory onto it. That solved a lot of problems.
Looking for other's experience with something similar, holes in my proposed plans, any input is welcomed.
My manager is concerned of the ability to roll back.  Many of the printers have been on the print server for longer than anyone can remember so we might not know of any special drivers, ports, etc. 
I have suggested just migrating the printers using the Print Management tool, unpublishing the printers, renaming the clustered server, renaming the new VM to that original name and joining to the domain, importing the printers, and then publishing the printers again to AD.
We have two physical servers being used as a clustered print server.  The physical servers are EOL and we want to migrate the print services to a single VM.  Does anyone have any suggestions on the best way to do this?  This would be from Windows 2008 R2 to Windows 2012.
