In any case when computer a sends something to b and they are both on the same wire, the addresses contained within the datagram differentiate who the recipient and senders are. The hardware just passes the info along, that's all.  
To prevent the network from degrading too much due to collisions (more than 1 station sending at the same time), Ethernet uses CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access with collision detection) which in laymen's terms means "if no one's using the wire, try to send. If you detect a collision while sending, stop and wait a random amount of time before trying again".
Otherwise, devices from different manufacturers could not talk together and adapt their speeds/frequency to a common value if they also had to agree on a common frequency.
TV cables are "broadband" cables and implement frequency multiplexing. The frequencies don't disturb each other since their sinus waves don't touch each other.
Ethernet over twisted pair has no frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) or other frequency shifting modulation in use; each signal has full control of wire, on a single frequency. The transmission of data is carried out by voltage changes. A packet rolling down the Ethernet cable is represented as a series of voltage changes, each with a corresponding change in current. When a signal is impressed on a line (when a host sends a packet on the Ethernet), the voltage at the end of the wire must go from 0 to -2.5 volts.
Assuming you're asking about how the Ethernet PHY layer handles multiplexing, here's a simplified answer.
There are also other types, such as CDMA/CA. This is called Collision Avoidance, used iN WLAN. Hosts are not sending randomly but rather waiting until the line is free (thus never colliding in the first place)
They don't. The differentiation is done in higher up level of the OSI model. (Your TCP/IP stack) takes care of addressing... Simple answer -> Each data gram (or chunk of binary data that comes out/in to your nic) has 2 MAC addresses and 2 IP address. One pair for the sender and one for the recipient. (I am a bit rusty on this as i studied it over 12 years ago)... 
The cables used for Ethernet (and other networking protocols) don't implemend multiplexing in that way. They just use CDMA/CD, the CDMA stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access. This means that NICs have to acquire the "right" to send. This is solved in different ways:
Frequency on the network has to do with to the number of cycles per second, and relates more to the speed or bandwidth of the transmission.
Each network consists of at least 2 stations sharing the same medium (wire). More than 2 stations sharing the wire is pretty common with Ethernet. Because they're sharing a medium, only one station can "communicate" at a time. First-come-first-served is how they decide who gets to use the medium.
The CD means "Collision detection". This means that collisions are not prevented, they are only detected. If the NICs detect a collision, they stop sending data for a random amount of time, and continue sending afterwards. The "right" to send is acquired by detecting if the line is free (
First of all you have to know what multiplexing means. Multiplexing is transferring different date at the same time over the same wire.
