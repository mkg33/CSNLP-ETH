A good VM emulates a system bus, including USB. The trick real trick is how and when you do pass through. I know I've seen vmware on linux offer an option to connect USB through to the VM. I think it requires some kernel magic on the client kernel but definately doable.
Whether this detection is done automatically or not depends on how you have your virtual host machine configured.  I have configured a vmware machine to autodetect when USB devices are plugged and un-plugged, and it works just fine.
Yes, Virtual machines can use hardware on the host machine.  Some can even use hardware connected to the machine that the client is running on (if that is different), so that you can insert a CD in your local machine, for instance, and have it appear on the virtual machine running on a server somewhere else.  Or for speakers at least, via Remote Desktop or VNC.
Basically, the answer to this is yes. But, it depends on the VM you are using, and how you have it configured. If you have a specific VM in mind, that could help us answer more specifically, but I know that VMWare and Virtual PC definitely do just that. Most that I know of do.
There is one caveat: if you are using any programs that are video accelerated they will generally not work, but more basic things will.
