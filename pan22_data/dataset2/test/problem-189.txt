You would want to look into whether to use those other cache-control headers, in terms of whether they will produce the result you are looking for - you may only need max-age. What you probably want is for Cloudfront to check S3 to see if the HTML file has changed. If it has, Cloudfront can fetch and return the new file. If not, it can serve the client from its existing cache (conserving S3 bandwidth, and serving the client faster, and more locally).
I believe the answers so far, while correct at the time, are now out of date, as Cloudfront now supports a minimum TTL of 0, and the OP's original attempt to use cache-age=0 should now work.
The point of Cloudfront is to serve cached content, yes, but now this includes content that sometimes changes, but can be cached if it has not changed.
P.s. query strings also work with Cloudfront now (if you configure a 'behaviour' for the relevant origin - another new feature), however some proxies may still fail to cache any files with query strings.
