The reason a webhost could be unavailable (even though they shouldn't) during a RAID rebuild, is because they took the whole storage area offline while it is being rebuilt.
Redundant array of Independent Disks (RAID) storage technologies provide a way to secure information using one logical unit composed by distinct physical disk drives, allowing continued online status.
On consumer based RAID 1 gear you'd probably need to shut-down while you replace the drive but even then it should allow the system to function while the RAID 1 is being re-built.
Since drive capacities has grown at a much faster rate than transfer speed, the larger capacity drives may take hours, if not days, to rebuild. If the web host keeps the unit online, this operation gets increased. Putting the entire RAID unit offline to allow all the resources to be available to the rebuild process may be the best way to have everything back and running faster.
Yes, if a RAID 1 HDD drive fails (most) RAID controllers will continue functioning with the remaining good drive, while posting some sort of alert.
Since RAID 1 operates as a mirror, replicating everything from HDD 1 to HHD 2, a RAID rebuild on one of this HDDs shouldn't cause the entire service to stop (controller dependent). If it does, is because the web host is intentionally stopping the entire storage or the RAID controller is unable to operate with only one drive.
With RAID 1, data is written identically to two drives, and the array continues to operate as long as at least one drive is functioning.
On high-end equipment I've seen a technician simply pull-out a bad drive, put in a new good drive, all with the system running live. The performance was slightly degraded while the new drive was rebuilt but an end-user wouldn't be able to tell. 
If they didn't do that, you could still happily write to that storage. That wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, but it would reduce rebuild performance (as some of the possible throughput is used up by you).
