Change your band from b+g+n to strict N. Otherwise it will be in protective mode and you'll never see the full N / MIMO speed. This requires your clients to be N and support MIMO, but you knew that.
The higher the bit rate, the more bandwidth required for N speeds and the strong the signal must be.
Using say http://www.speedtest.net/ to verify speed  You can generally expect only 50% of the channel speed for DL and less for UL, as it is a half duplex link.
Also, by setting your channel width the 20MHz only, you've limited your N data rates to 144.4 mbps max. (Don't get me wrong, using 20MHz-wide channels is the right thing to do from a "good neighbor" perspective in the crowded 2.4GHz band. If you wanted to use Bluetooth on a client machine that was also doing 40MHz-wide 802.11n in the 2.4GHz band, it might not work out very well.)
I configured my new router and noticed that WiFi connection is way slower than Ethernet connection. 
You might try slowing down beacon rate to 1000mS. ensure no P2P services or Apps are running and verify your RSSI levels. Also try auto 20/40MHz
By the way, please tell me that these settings (TKIP only, WMM off, 20MHz-only) were not the factory defaults for this product. That would be really sad if they didn't know better and were accidentally effectively disabling their marquee feature by default.
The IEEE 802.11n spec requires that you do WPA2 (AES-CCMP) or no security, and it requires that you do QoS (WMM). You've blocked yourself from doing 802.11n by doing TKIP-only and disabling WMM.
RSSI levels are often shown on some Wifi drivers in -dBm for signal and noise. You can't rely on bars.
Those 15-20 megabit/sec throughputs you're seeing are fine for 802.11g, which is what (unbeknownst to you) you're actually configured to use here.
With 54Mbps Wifi you need around -70dBm for full speed and -80dBm just to connect. Noise floor is usually -95dBm to -100dBm.
Ethernet connection giving a download speed of ~60Mbps and upload speed of ~30Mbps while the Wifi only giving download speed of ~20Mbps and upload speed of ~15Mbps.
Also note that the rule of thumb for Wi-Fi TCP throughput—on an app that uses TCP in an optimal manner—is 50-60% of the signaling rate. So even if you made the 3 changes I suggested above, and you truly had a good 300mbps N client machine (2 spacial streams in both directions, support for 40MHz channels in 2.4GHz) within good range of the AP, you shouldn't expect to see performance much greater than 150 megabits/sec (about 18 MebiBytes/sec).
