I have a list of people with each row showing a person, and their usage of a platform in percentages. if a person uses more than 1 platform, they will appear in multiple rows, each for a different platform (and each row shows their percentage usage of that platform).
so a person uses platform A 61%, and platform B 39% will have "1" in significant in Platform A's row and "0" in platform B's row.
rows that show a person uses a platform more than 60% have another column called "significant use" and its content is 1. rows that show a person using a platform less than 60% have that column's content as 0. 
I've tried to subtotal, hoping to sum up the 0s and 1s in significance (so if one of the rows is more than 60%, the total will be 1, and if no row is more than 60% the total will be 0), but either I get messed up results or Excel just gets stuck.
I want a way to differentiate between people who have more than 60% in any platform and people who don't have any platform they use more than 60%.
Another person uses 3 platforms, each 33%. for that person, all 3 rows will show "0" in the "Significant" column.
Note that this is a volatile formula and may slow your sheet over 74k rows. Set calculation to manual if so.
This function turns (Mike, Mike, Bob, Charlie) into (1,1,0,0) and (0.4,0.7,0.8,0.2) into (0,1,1,0) and performs a sumproduct on the results.
