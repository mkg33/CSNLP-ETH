In any version, there are the standbys: unsharp masking and—more powerful and useful—a high-pass filter. Search the help file for the high-pass filter, and remember that it can be applied several times at a reduced opacity in different levels.
Theoretically, if you run the image through the "inverse" of the "filter" that caused the blurring, the blur will be corrected to a degree.  However, since information has been lost, noise replaces the blurring -- eg, lettering may be more legible, but the picture will be "grainy" and not as "attractive".
It is possible, even if there is not a "one-click" way to do it, meaning that you have to experiment a bit yourself to get a good result:
I can think of a few ways to minimize blur in Photoshop, but as more than one person has said, if the zeroes and ones aren't there, there's really no way to rebuild true sharpness in an image.  Blur can be minimized by using features in PS or PSE that "sharpen the edges," that, is, in areas with the greatest change in contrast in the smallest space. In newer versions of PS and PSE, there is generally a filter for sharpening edges: it may require some digging, depending on version and package. In newer versions of the Creative Suite, there is a feature called context-sensitive sharpening, and a sharpening brush. 
When you see the cop shows apply a filter to a street camera image to read a license plate, this is theoretically what they're doing.  Of course, it works much better on TV than it does in real life (but it does work surprisingly well in real life).
