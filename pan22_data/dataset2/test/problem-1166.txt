I can't vouch for Visual Studio, but in NetBeans at 1024x768, everything is fine. I don't find myself constrained or having to move a bunch of columns and rows to see the editing area. 
That resolution is not low, I programmed on a 17'' 1400x900 just fine, so you should even have a higher resolution/screen size ratio. I wouldn't worry about it too much, the screen size could more likely be a problem than the resolution... A handy trick: You can hold CTRL and scroll your mouse wheel to zoom!
You do know that your native resolution is not your maximum possible resolution, right? If I wanted I can go up to 1600x1200 on an ancient CRT monitor and have it still display.
As others have pointed out, using VS 2008 at that resolution (my craptop has 1280x800) is possible, but will be unpleasant.
My laptop has that resolution, and it works fine for writing code. I use Visual Studio, Dreamweaver, Word, Textpad, and they work fine. It helps if you are able to hide toolbars that you don't need so as to regain some vertical space.
Working in graphics software is a different matter. The small screen gets annoying in Photoshop and Fireworks, simply because there's more visible at the same time.
There's really quite a bit you can do to make the best of your situation. I've been using this resolution for a good year now and have had no problems, just minor annoyances before customizing things.
I use this resolution, and it's not too bothersome. It's a bit annoying and there are times when things scroll off-screen, but you can combat this with things like auto-hiding the task panes, using full screen (I don't, but it's an idea), or in Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts & Colors, you can change it to a smaller text size.
How often will you be using just the laptop?  It's OK if you have an external monitor, but if it's going to be your only display you should decide how much it's worth to get a higher resolution.
Time yourself, and see how often you need to switch contexts - switch windows, scroll a window, minimize or maximize, etc.  Figure that it's going to cost 10 to 15 seconds each time you have to grab the mouse and do something.  Figure out home many of these you could avoid with a larger display, and multiply the # of occurrences by the "penalty".  Use this to calculate the ROI of a larger monitor.
