You can only have one HAT board so there is no such issue. There are some boards where you can connect more than one but those are not HAT boards.
Notice on the near side the five connections in a box.  These correspond to pins on the other side.  They're labelled:
Computers use a system called busing to connect multiple peripheral devices to the CPU via the same set of wires.  I2C and SPI are examples of busing systems used with the pi GPIO pins, which enable multiple devices on the same physical pins (managed by the internal bus) but using different addresses. Addressing is an abstraction created by the bus system protocol.  It is a little bit like how you can have multiple networked applications using the same physical connection to the internet, all running simultaneously.
The real limit to stacking this way is going to be the amount of power that can be supplied vs. what is consumed, not the number of pins involved.  Maybe it would become a limitation if you included additional power supplies, but I think before that you'd have to move the stack outside and start using a ladder to work on it. ;)
In other words, most of the pins aren't used by this board at all.  They are just there to allow for stacking.  The ones that it does use are all (or mostly, still don't know about SQW) sharable simultaneously with other devices.
