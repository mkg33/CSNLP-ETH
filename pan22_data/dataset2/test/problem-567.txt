To work around this behavior, create the user profile folder ahead of time with the Roaming Profile Folders Do Not Allow Administrative Access
I have a laptop that I've setup with a separate admin and standard user account. When trying to access the standard users user folder from the administrators account to run a program from the downloads folder it says that I don't currently have permission. 
To workaround this behavior, you may consider creating the user profile folder with the Administrators full control permissions ahead of time that the user upload their roaming profile into the shared folder on server.
If this was initially created as a Roaming Profile the c:\Users\%username%\ folder will only be readable by the User of the profile. 
Under the Security tab of the folder it says I must have read permissions to view the properties of the folder. Under the advanced settings it's clear that the administrators user name doesn't have any permissions to the folder. Why would the administrator be missing permissions to this folder? Is this abnormal?
If we want to apply "Administrators" rights to the userâ€™s roaming folder after they have been initialized by the users, we may have to take the ownership of the roaming folder by administrator, and then grant the "Administrators" right on roaming profile folder.
