First check to always do whether you're sure of it, check if firewall let RDP go through ;) That's not stupid, It's just sometime happen out from nowhere ;)
I encountered the same issue trying to perform a remote reboot on a Windows XP machine. What I ended up doing was using the PsKill command, part of the SysInternals PsTools suite, to kill the Winlogon process, like so:
This is less an answer to your question and more an explanation to what might have caused it. I have seen RDP stop working several times on Windows Server 2003, and it's usually occurs in one of two scenarios; 
Well, this is kind of crazy but you can enable xp_cmdshell on SQL Server then execute commands as the user that is running SQL Server, so you can do a shutdown -r if it won't listen to remote commands. 
Also check that Terminal Service is on, and maybe try to reboot it if you have a chance to get physically on the server.
If you want to try and re-start RDP w/o rebooting the box, you may try (this is untested; I'm not going to do this on any of my boxes :D):
If you issued a shutdown/restart and the server just will not go down, you can kill the wininit.exe process with the pskill tool.
