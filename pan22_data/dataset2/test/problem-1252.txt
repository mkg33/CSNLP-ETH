Microsoft workstations and domain controllers have the ability to make certain that they go to the correct domain controllers for authentication and policies because of sites and services.
Unfortunately, its an intermittent issue, and I haven't found any reliable way to reproduce it.  My suspicion is that it has to do with the group policy preferences, but I don't really have any proof of that.  I have seen a microsoft KB article blaming certain types of item level targeting for slow logins, but it doesn't give any guidance to determining if that is actually the cause.
The problem seems to be mostly with laptops.  If they are used at home with a non-domain network connection, or moved to a different location (still on a domain network, but different AD site, and doesn't seem to matter wired or wireless) logins can take as long as 3 minutes from the time the user enters their password, until the time it actually starts showing the desktop.  Our terminal server also intermittently experiences slow logins.
We experienced extreme delays on logins for a few of our sub nets.  Turned out that those sub nets were missing reverse DNS zones in the AD server.  We added the reverse zones, AD added PTR entries automatically, and haven't experienced the delay since.  May be coincidence too.
I have experienced the symptoms you are describing at a few companies. In my experience, it usually happens when there is more than one site. One way to troubleshoot a potential issue with sites and services is the following. On a computer which just experienced a slow logon, go to command prompt, type echo %logonserver% If the response is not a server in the same site as the laptop or workstation, then my experience has been that subnets are not set up and assigned the correct site in active directory sites and services. 
For the most part, logins work fine and quickly for people who have used the machine before.  The first login to a new computer is always slow, but that's expected.
If this is the case and it leads to an adjustment of sites and services, please know that the replication of the changes to/from domain controllers can take some time. Also, it will take even more time for the endpoint workstations to see the new changes. The default replication time is set in sites and services for 1 hour between domain controllers. Depending on the distance in geography and size of your AD forest, I usually set it to 15 minutes or so. 
If you see entries such as this, the specific subnet needs to be entered into sites and services and assigned a site.
