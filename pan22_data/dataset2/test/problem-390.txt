It is almost guaranteed if you can find the streaming address of the IP camera. You can use Kodi to handle the stream receiving. OpenELEC, LibreELEC and OSMC are three examples of Kodi-centric distributions for Raspberry Pi.
Kodi has proven its worth over the years (beeing the old XBMC). It's meant for video play back and supports CEC (so you can move around in the menus with your tv's remote if your TV supports CEC). But there is also a rest API. 
Actually you can and it's working pretty good. I own an ip camera with a raspi 2 also and i'm using this motioneyeos. 
It's pretty good and you can turn your raspi into a cam recorder. You can set it to record videos when it detects motion, you can be warned by mail if motion is detected etc. or you can just view your cam on your tv like you wanted. 
I suggest you to use ZoneMinder to monitor your videos. It is really flexible and can be installed on a RPI2. You can manages your cameras, make recordings, motion detection, and you can generate webpage / streams with multiple cameras. 
Just keep in mind that the Pi 1 may have trouble decoding anything other than H.264 (plus VC-1 and MPEG-2 if you bought the CODECs) at 1080p, as the above three formats are decoded using the GPU, and the CPU may have trouble keeping up with the task alone.
Most IP Cameras encode video and stream using web service. RaspberryPI constraints are its cpu's ability to receive, decode and display a particular video in real-time. Consider looking up camera encoding specifications to determine video compression (H.264 or MJPEG) and application layer transport protocol (i.e. HTTP and RTSP) and matching that with the Pi's decoding capabilities. Please post solution. I have similar needs also. :)
By the way, Raspberry Pi themselves makes excellent IP cameras too, using its camera module to capture the action. You may even run some OpenCV on it to identify and help capture critical moments of a crime scene.
The rest API allows for preexisting apps in the appstores of both android and apple (don't know about windows) to offer you TV remote-apps (look for apps like yatsee, kore, ...)
Depending on the output of the IP cam, if it's streaming it's video over the network anyways; the easiest and most user friendly way of doing this would probably be to set up Kodi. (flash OpenElec or OSMC to your SD card)
