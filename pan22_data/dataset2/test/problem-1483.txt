How can I fix this? Also, user profiles (even recreated ones) seem to be behaving very slowly on logins or logouts...
I have four Windows 7 clients that are connecting to a Server 2012 domain controller EC2 isntance. There was also a file server (also Server 2012), but I decided to merge the two together because the Amazon advising tool said we were wasting money with our setup. So, I moved the EBS volumes to the domain controller and they're all working fine, but I had to recreate the software installation policy to point to the new shares.
I simply removed and re-added the same software with the same settings except for the file path. Now, the clients are constantly spending time when booting up in "Applying Software Installation policy" mode. It takes a good 20-30 minutes to get past that step. Before the move it was taking 10 seconds or so (when the software is installed).
I tested a PC by uninstalling all of the managed software and then disjointing and rejoining to the domain. There was no effect...
