Try --host=127.0.0.1 because the mysql client is trying to connect using the standard mysql socket (/tmp/mysql.sock). Specifying an IP address won't use this socket connection. I had to change this in every program to be able to connect to the MAMP database, including Sequel Pro.
You should leave off the --host part or add --port=8889 but don't use just --host. By including --host without --port you might be trying to connect to another MySQL installation running at the default 3306. 
It is possible that you changed the mysql root password during installation. Typing it this way will prompt you for your password, or you could enter the changed password as needed:
I was trying to access MAMP's MySQL through the terminal on Mountain Lion, and getting the same ERROR 1045 (28000).
Also, Sequel Pro is one of the nicest free solutions for the Mac. I use it all the time. To connect to MAMP with Sequel Pro, use the following settings:
Just posted on Stack Overflow a solution for a similar problem. Thought it might help someone to post it here as well.
This is an old thread, but I was trying to answer the same question.  I have MAMP pro, Open MAMP and then the mysql tab.  Uncheck the "allow local access only" checkbox that is about 1/2 way down the page.  Restart your servers and voila!
Good luck, I tried to get MAMP to work and gave up on it.  Nothing worked trying to get MySQL up and running on my machine until I installed XAMPP, which was surprisingly painless and trouble free.  No additional configuration required once you have it set up, except for using its control panel application to start and stop the components you want to run at the moment.
