Have you made any changes to group policy, recently? It's possible a mistaken change is blocking interactive logins on domain member computers or by users in a certain group or OU. GPO is the most likely explanation, since it's seems to have affected all users at the same time, but not Domain Admins.

One of the reason is maybe  you have  second DHCP server on some ruters or gateway . Stop all DHCP server   on another  machines or gateways 
Also check the settings on the individual user accounts; examine the 'Logon Hours' and 'Log On To' settings. Perhaps some script has placed the wrong restrictions on the accounts.  
There are lots of results coming back.  Most seem to point to group policy.  One indicates that the users might have been removed from a group or the policy doesn't allow log on locally.
I had a problem on a server 2008 machine that wasn't the DC that wouldn't let any non-local users login. That problem was updated broadcom drivers. Not exactly the same thing but maybe it'll spark something.
When it works for Administrator and noone else, check the event logs.  If they fill up they don't allow local logins.  Haven't seen this happen at the domain level, but is worth checking.
