Physical Disk - Current Disk Queue length - Drive number (for each hardware controlled RAID array or physical drive if you are doing software RAID)
From your experience as person who ever dealt with high traffic tubes how much machines must be set to run 1000 connected at once users and growing each day.
If your logical drive holds an amount that makes the SSD option seem too expensive but you aren't short on space with the existing array you may want to consider getting higher RPM drives. Beware this may be false economy as a couple of good SSDs might handle the load of dozens of rotating disks. 
my client got Dell PowerEdge 1950 server with 6GB ram and quadcore cpu installed. There is Flash Media Server 3.52 running on the server on Win2008. External storage Dell MD1000 connected to this server and it has 6 1TB 7200 SATA harddrives running RAID 10. Client got about 1200 connection to streaming at once. We did ask our hosting to set unlimited bandwidth for some time because we had delays during streaming playback at high traffic hours ( evenings ).
Heck maybe you should do that no matter which of the three types of drives you add but only add them if the performance counter(s) show the need.
If your % Processor Time is above %50 or if the Queue length stays above 0 on a regular basis you should pay attention to the CPU situation as well.
Logical Disk - Current Disk Queue length - Drive letter (for each logical drive if there is more than one you care about)
If your logical drive doesn't hold a large amount of data but the Current Disk Queue Length is high you should move that data to a SSD or a RAID comprised of SSDs. This may only be the boot drive on the server or it may even include your content. For good SSDs think Intel controller (Intel and Kingston) or Indilinx Controller (plenty of brands to choose from). Further if you go this route you need to look at your reads to writes ratio. If your Writes are high you want SLC based SSDs which cost at least twice as much if not more. If your writes are low or especially if the content doesn't change on a regular basis you want MLC based SSDs to save on the cost per GB.
If your drive holds an amount of data that makes you worry about space with the existing number of drives then you can just add more 7200 RPM SATA drives to keep the capacity increasing. Beware this may be counter to the performance issue as it may allow people to add more data and increase the load more than the extra spindles help. If you follow this route you should:
