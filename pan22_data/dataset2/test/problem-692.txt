You haven't specified if the SSO software uses Active Directory credentials, so a  solution would be to make use of Active Directory's "Logon Hours" function. It's at a per-user level, but can easily be scripted in Powershell (this being an example). Basically, set the logon hours to "deny" logon at your SCCM update window and the users will be unable to log into the clients while SCCM does its thing. You'll need to have that first forced reboot which will log them out (the logon hours function doesn't work on logged-in users), but it would otherwise be painless to implement.
It sounds like you already have a script to do what you need done, so you should be able to put that into a TS with minimal debugging and get going.
It seems no one touched on the possibility of using a task sequence to handle this, so allow me to list the benefits (assuming you're not really familiar with them in general, but please read even if you are):
You can provide a splash screen that says maintenance is being performed, or whatever you want it to say really. 
A TS executes before winlogon.exe runs, so there is no possibility of a user inadvertently logging on, as there is no log on window. Which brings me to my second point:
If everything you install and configured is handled w/ SCCM, you should be able to use a task sequence to accomplish this. Primarily for OSD, using a TS is not only for OSD and can provide the following benefits:
A TS is really just a glorified script, but it has a lot of functionality and is put together in a way as to decrease development time, and I've found use cases beyond OSD.
Something a bit more trailer-parky, the beginning of the SCCM activity could copy a shortcut to logoff.exe to the All Users Start Menu\Startup folder (typically C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp).  This would have the effect of logging off a session as soon as they logon.  To be safe, you may want to have a startup/shutdown script to delete that shortcut.  (I believe that Startup shortcuts may be bypassed by holding the shift key during logon).
