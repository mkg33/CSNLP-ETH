it to the card, that way it becomes thick enough to stay put and not run out of the groove.  in 18C temperature that took about 10 minutes to go opaque and get thick enough to paste it into the groove.
The notch forces the read-only to work with camera's, PDA's, MP3 players, etc, however they are not guaranteed to work on all SD readers (apparently it works on your reader). It's simply a physical thing, therefore the tape will trick the SD card reader into thinking the SD card is unlocked.
as the switch in my camera requires a lot of pressure to activate it. its not working in my camera because the tape gives a little under pressure and doesnt push the switch closed.   it needs something in the slot to be taped there.  
if you are unsure of this method or unsure of the bond between the glue and the card, DON'T DO IT this way as i won't be responsible for the loss of your equipment - do it at your own risk.    (but gorilla glue is good stuff.  if the card is not greasy it should stick well). 
I'm fairly certain that the lock is a physical mechanism, and therefore all you need to do is put a piece of scotch tape over the SD card. Be very precise in placing the tape over the notch, but not over the brass connector on the opposite side.
The best solution well what I have used was to erase everything like I use micro sd with adapter to connect to computer to upload stuff and for some reason it was saying its locked and I cant upload anything so I just uploaded everything from sd to my computer and then put the sd card into my phone erased everything and poped it back into the computer and I works fine now ! 
If I'm not mistaken - its the same kind of thing as the old floppy disk.  The lock blocks a lightbeam if it is in the correct position.  There's no electrical component to it - just that if the switch is in a certain spot, the lightbeam gets broken and you can read and write.  Otherwise it is write only.  I'd try and tape over the switch area with something like scotch tape and darkening it with a sharpie.  Really, though, they're so cheap it would be better to just replace the card.  I'd worry about the tape pealing off inside the SD card slot and then you might end up really screwed.
leave the glue for a while to become mostly hard, perhaps an hour or more, and then using a sharp hobby knife ensure its
