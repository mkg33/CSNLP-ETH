I am trying to optimize apache on my virtual server on Digital Cloud hosting. I am following a tutorial that tells me to make sure the following values are set in my apache2.conf
Also think about whether this is really something you want to do something yourself.  My guess is you've got enough to learn already with writing your application, and you'd be better off working with an experienced sysadmin to set up your system, and occasionally look over it and tweak the configuration, and discuss with you how to make your application work well with the system.
However, the only thing I can find in this file is "KeepAlive Off". There is no sign of any of the other properties or the
Apache is not unreasonably configured by default given that the writers of that configuration can't know what you're going to run on top of it, or much about the server you're going to run it on.  It leans towards the requirements of serving static content though.  As soon as you start dynamically producing content, things change.
For a given application and hardware, you can certainly do better than the default, and very likely people here can advise you on that, but you do need to provide more information on your setup.
There are a lot of knobs to tweak, and the way they should each be configured is very interdependent.  There's no simple recipe that will substitute for a good understanding of what's involved, and hands on investigation of what bottlenecks you're actually running into.  You need to come up with a general strategy and configure accordingly rather than just think about various settings in isolation, and then you need to review what's actually going on, and improve, under load conditions appropriate to your expected use.
So, if you really want to work this out yourself, rewrite your question, with a lot more information, and I give a general gist of what that means below.  Then think about whether this is really appropriate for a serverfault question.  You probably can't answer it all at once.  
The location of my file is /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and I am using Ubuntu 14.04 x64 with apache 2.4.7. Can anyone tell me why this is not present in my file? Is it safe to simply just add it in?
