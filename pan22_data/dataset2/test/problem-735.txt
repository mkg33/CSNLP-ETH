Ideally I'd like to be able to configure this so that I can do something like - have results display vertically, have facets display to the side of the results allowing the user to say "Oh, I just want to see apps that were released in the last year…" - or whatever.
Having tried Solr, and WPSolr (wouldn't display facets), OpenSemantic Search -doesn't work at all, Solr with LucidWorks Fusion (to confusing for me - I'm not a developer), and now using ElasticSearch having pretty much have tried everything else.
But it seem to just bypass WP-Query yet still displays results as if it were WP's search - no facets, no filters, etc..I've tried installing another WP seach plugin - search and filter for instance - thinking it would just hitch a ride on the ElasticPress WP-Query - but no joy. Any other plugin for WP searching seemed to just bypass EP.
90K posts - each post is an app from iTunes or Android Play. Each post has custom fields - pricing, free, release date, etc… - and the Wordpress default search just can't handle it fast enough.
I have plenty of infrastructure, servers, etc…and WP and EP and ES are all running on an Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty, MariaDB 10.x, PHP5.9? (the latest) with a plenty of ram&disk…and this is the last piece of my puzzle…of course it's the piece I can't find!
ElasticPress Plugin works great - it indexes VERY fast - and so far it's as close to a solution as I've found.
I'm trying to put a search in place that will allow the end user to do a "normal" keyword search but I'd like them to also be able to select or, at the least, have in the results, the ability to filter via category, tag, and some custom fields.
