Check out the word from Microsoft for the proper steps: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/vssetup/thread/6a569376-4207-4184-a8a7-73d5168c787e  Just follow the directions there and you should have no problem getting it to install.
But SQL Server 2008 RTM with slipstreamed SP1 will. So you need to create a slipstreamed install, this is not hard (with a little care and attention). See here, here and here for details (the first is to the official instructions, but I found the latter two links helpful in clarifying things).
I am running Windows 7 Ultimate on a virtual machine on my MacBook and have SQL EXPRESS 2008 installed along with SQL Management Studio without any problems. I downloaded SQL Management Studio from the link above. 
This is more oriented for VS with SQL, but just replace the related steps with doing the steps within the SQL installer basically.

You could try installing through the Web Platform Installer. I just used the tool to install SQL 2008 and Management Studio, without any issues.
