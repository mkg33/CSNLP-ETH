The current workflow is to convert the non power of tho textures to dds with 'texconv', then use the vendors compression tools in a batch.
I'm currently porting a game to a new platform, the problem being that the old platform accepted non power of two textures and this new platform doesn't.
I guess that maybe ImageMagick would have been a better solution, it's just a shame that TheGimp proposes a batching process that really isn't powerful enough.
So the next problem was to iterate through the folders to call the gimp script on all of them, after a bit of testing, I found this PowerShell script :
To add to the headache, the new platform has much less memory so we want to use the tools provided by the vendor to compress them; which of course only takes power of two textures.
Of course the big problem with this is that the Script-Fu command file-glob only allows you to cycle through one folder, and you have to use a very ugly batch call for it to work :
So I checked out ImageMagick, it wasn't really for me, so I ended up using TheGimp's Script-Fu to first off write a batch procedure to convert all files in a folder to the nearest (bigger) power of two, and optionally scale the image down afterwards if it is too big. This is a simplified version (I can give anyone the batch if needed).
