The only way to be sure that it will not reset every time you need to go to the TV/Monitor and  disable the sounds device (ie) LG399502 (model number only an example) if needed again you need to re-enable this device.
My laptop has an HDMI out port and my new TV has HDMI in ports.  Hooking them up so that I can use the laptop to play movies with sound on the TV works fine.  However, I haven't been able to find a way to send out just video without sound.  Sometimes I want to keep the audio coming through my laptop speakers so I can put headphones on and not have everyone around me tell me to turn the sound down... is there a way to do that?
The answers that are given thus far might not work. If you are using a laptop, when it is plugged into an external device through HDMI it will always default to the new device you have plugged in, again even if you set the default device to your laptop, it will again reset when unplugged. 
Going to the control panel and disabling the audio playback for the extended monitor (after plugging it into the HDMI) worked great for me. I'm using Windows 8.1 and have an HDMI to VGA converter for some old PC monitors to do karaoke. Thanks for your help, everyone!
You haven't said which operating system you're using, but on Windows I believe you can just change the default playback device in via the Sound control panel applet. It will probably change to HDMI automatically when you plug the cable in, but then you should be able to just go into control panel and switch it back to your laptop.
