you can nullify the browser's TLS system completely by using a TLS proxy that signs all TLS connection opening with its own TLS root CA. Obviously, that has annoying consequences like the inability to view the real certificate of a website with the Chrome interface. Also, client TLS certificates are by design not compatible with that TLS proxying.
For Chrome on OSX, here's a relatively easy way to add the self-signed certificate to the system's Keychain, which is used by Chrome: Google Chrome, Mac OS X and Self-Signed SSL Certificates. No more annoying red warning screen! (I do wish Chromium would simplify adding the exception though.)
Many Google Chrome extensions allow you to select proxies based on domain, so you could only proxy those domains that are known to cause TLS issues in Chrome.
In order for me to get this to work, I had to copy to file using the "Cryptographic Message Syntax Standard - PKCS #7 Certificates (.P7B)" option and check the "Include all certificates in the certification path if possible" box.
