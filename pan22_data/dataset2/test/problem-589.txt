As I said in my case this solved my problem but also be sure that you uninstalled programs like Dell Backup Recovery Tool too.
In my case the problem was offline files. I work for a large corporation and we had several multiuser windows 7 clients. The problem was the synchronization of "MyDocuments". When 10 users synchronized these folders we ended up with 50+ Gb in C:\windows\CSC and his space does not show easily. You have to take ownership of many folders but if you do the numbers make sense. I am trying to reinitialize the cache but it seems we have GPOs which determine this behaviour. Again makes sense for single user clients but not for multi user.
Let me explain why unchecking indexing solved my problem.I know indexing is a good thing but if you have 40gb Outlook PST file indexing is not helping you but just eating your free space.
The first thing to check in this situation is just to make sure you're running your space usage scanner with admin privileges (right-click, Run as administrator).
Otherwise there's a good chance there will be system files that you can't access, and this unaccounted space will show up as Unknown.
From a command prompt, run chkdsk /f repeatedly until there are no errors (you may need to reboot if it's a system drive).
Next, many applications don't see space used in hidden and/or system folders, and many programs (antivirus, for example) store stuff in those folders, so you may need to run dir /ash to get a list of system and hidden folders followed by dir <foldername> /ash /s to find out how much space the folder using (you may need to drill down into it to find the offending files).
I had the same problem and read millions of pages explaning delete this that and those but none of them help me to find UNKNOWN files eating space in my disk. 
Have you looked at your indexing, Windows.edb, file?  A co-worker of mine had an issue similar to this where a large amount of disk space was being taken up why the Windows indexing service.  We only found out about the issue after the user complained about running out of disk space.
