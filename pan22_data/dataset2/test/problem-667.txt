Have a look at Directory Studio from the Apache Foundation.  It's built on the eclipse platform and I've found it to be a pretty good LDAP client.
If you want access LDAP data with combination of e-directory & LDAP, Open LDAP Client is the best one. It's very easy to use and it will provide features such as like import & export data, modifying data directly using this client, removing objects(if at all you have permissions to remove)
When I am on a windows machine I normally use LDAP Admin , Another option is to install phpLDAPAdmin It's web based, so technically it work in windows.
What is the best, free LDAP client for windows? It should be easy navigate through the directory and edit values. Ideally, bulk update of whole directory trees would be nice...
It depends on your LDAP server.  If you're using Active Directory, then the default Active Directory Users and Computers is good for a user-friendly view, whereas ADSIEdit is great for getting at the nitty gritty.  There are also good built-in command-line tools available for bulk updates/etc.
