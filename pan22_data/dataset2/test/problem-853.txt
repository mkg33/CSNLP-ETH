Also, once you've done that (added to quick menu) if you press ALT it should display what number the command is. You can then press ALT+Number and use the keyboard shortcut. I did what Westcoast recommended, and then when I press ALT it shows as number 4, so I press ALT+4 and it saves as PDF. Marvellous!
Hm... What seems to be the problem? I have added "PDF or XPS" command to my Ribbon here at home computer (with Word 2007) and I did exactly the same at my office computer (with Word 2010; though I don't remember, if command was named the same there).
Now, I have an extra button on my Ribbon, showing "PDF or XPS" in tooltip, when I hover mouse over it and when I click it, it opens a Save as dialog, where I can specify file name for a PDF file, that will be created in next step, basing on my currently open DOCX (or other) document.
You now have a single button which will bring up the file save dialog (so you can name it) which will safe it to a PDF.
Now you have your one button in the QAT. Hit that button and you get a Save-As window with PDF ready to go as the default file type (And XPS being another choice, if anyone ever cared about that.)
I don't see this answer, so you should know it's very simple to add a CREATE PDF button to the Quick Access Toolbar (no Macros needed). 
Now select the drop down arrow of your Quick Access Toolbar and choose More Commands.... Now select Macros from the Choose commands from, select the macro, then add it to the right pane. You can modify the name and icon using the Modify Button at the bottom.
