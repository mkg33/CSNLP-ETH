Are you sure that your 100mbit/s pipe isn't being maxed out at peak times, or when mutiple clients are downloading/streaming something new and cool off your site?
Older network devices that do 10/100 tend to be a bit unreliable in negotiating link speed and duplex, while if you've got pure gig everywhere the auto-negotiation is pretty much 100% reliable.  
The other issue that may be useful is that gigabit devices are more reliable in negotiating link speed.  
1M dynamic pages a day and "CPU occasionally quite high" sounds to me like you might benefit from further optimizing your page generation.
This all depends on your traffic pattern, but let's say that you're using 80% bandwith average per day; then a gigabit uplink would (with no doubt) increase the bandwith each client gets at peak times.
I'd say that you would probably not notice any page response time increase. Most people cannot access your site that fast in the first place. The only reason, I can see for needing GbE, is when you are responding to so many page requests, that your aggraget bandwidth usage is maxing out your connection.
You're a prime candidate for a vps or cloud-based solution.  If you can't saturate a 100Mb pipe, you'd get much more value out of moving to Amazon and letting other people worry about these things.  
Gravyface makes a very useful point in the comments about local gig being useful for things like reverse proxy servers, or if you had a local database server.
Undocumented hard-coded ports or servers tend to cause problems in the distant future when you need to move a system from here to there in a hurry and then can't figure out why you're getting terrible network performance (duplex mismatch).
