You might want to look at rsync or its varients - ubuntu comes with rsync built in and there's a windows port called 'deltacopy' (with its own GUI) and you can back up a chosen set of files incrementally, and restore it. Since rsync is a command line app you can schedule it or design your own gui for it if you're so inclined. Just set up accounts, and you're food.
It doesn't sound like you need or want the file sharing stuff, but if you do its cool too... if you place data in a share, WHS makes sure that the data is always duplicated on at least 2 spindles (2 drives... kind of a software RAID 0). That way if you lose a drive you don't lose the data.
Recovery is a snap, I tell the server what backup to mount for recovery... it thinks about it for a bit (it's having to build a "virtual" filesystem from the cluster database) and then you have access to the complete backup image for recovery.
If all your clients are Windows (XP or newer) I would recommend you with Microsoft Home Server... yeah I know it says "home". Ignore that bit.
There probably isn't any off the shelf product like that, as if there was everyone would be running backup services for customers.  The client and server software that those guys use was all custom written to handle the identification and upload of information to the servers.
You might look at CrashPlan, the free version provides unlimited backup by using storage attached to the Internet-connected computers of "friends and family".
You could run the software on your server to provide the storage space (your server is the friend/family) and then also run the software on your "client" machines.
I just finished setting up a custom build at home and I am really impressed. It really makes backups easy... and disk friendly too. It does some kind of changed-cluster recognition on the client and only stores changed clusters. And it recognizes if clusters are the same across multiple PCs (like files in the Windows or Program Files folder for example) and only stores them once on the server... really saving space on the server. For example, I've got 3 Windows 7 machines. Two are basic installs (~40GB) and the last is ~300GB for my laptop. After 3 complete backup cycles its only taking about about 180GB of server storage total.
This is a dedicated backup and file-sharing server based on Windows 2003. Its not free, but if you've got hardware to throw at it already, you can pick up the OS for around $100 (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VWW8QQ/?tag=hashemian-20). Or you can buy a pre-built "appliance" and add drives as desired (http://www.amazon.com/EX490-Mediasmart-Home-Server-Black/dp/B002N8A0A2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1271861254&sr=8-2).
