It depends...  According to the official system requirements (http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/system-requirements.aspx) 32-bit installs of the OS need at least 20GB, while 64-bit installs require at least 32 GB.  The OS itself takes up about 10GB if I recall correctly, but you need to factor in:
As for WinSXS cleanup, you'll find a lot of people claiming you can do this and that, and Microsoft telling you to leave it alone apart from maybe one or two very specific issues. On a workstation I might be persuaded to experiment but on a server I'd be wary about betting against the vendor's suggestions.
However, with 2008 they've included the ability to expand and shrink partitions, including the C: drive. 
I used to go with 20GB system partition but that has bitten me on more than one occasion.  I now use 60GB as my "default" system partition unless there is a need to go bigger.
With hard drives being as cheap as they are these days, I would recommend not skimping on space for the OS partition.  Give yourself some extra room for things you forgot to factor in... it is much easier to allocate the space up front than it is to make space a year from now.
If you attempt to install 2008 on a partition less than 40GB, the setup process will spew a bunch of stuff onto some other larger partition, and it's a bitch to remove later on.
A real problem in previous versions of Windows was it was difficult to extend the size of the system partition, you needed to use third party tools which were a little dicey.
This means if you get it wrong to start with, you can probably rectify the issue reasonably easily. If you were using 2003, you'd be a right pickle.
To be honest, I can't imagine installing a Windows server with less than 40Gb as a bare minimum, ideally 60Gb or even 80Gb for the system partition.
