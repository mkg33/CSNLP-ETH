Something like http://www.pfsense.org/ as a transparent firewall in your network will do everything you need. Firstly it will be able to block the IM and external email sites that you wish. Secondly, there is a whole host of graphs that can be configured for watching bandwidth usage, and if you enable the ntop plugin, you will get graphs of protocol usage. Thirdly, the squid package that it has will be extremely useful and give all the weblogs, usage stats etc that you could possibly need.
To answer the part of your question about monitoring activity (as opposed to checking whether your servers are running) - any decent enterprise firewall should include a real-time view of flows passing through it, as well as retrospective reports on those flows.
We currently use SiteScope for monitoring & alerting, Cacti for graphing and trends, and Nagios as a backup system, although there's a lot of software out there depending on what functions and features you're looking for.
Since the mirroring port can mirror all your network traffic, with an internet monitoring program connected to this mirroring port, you will be able to monitor all computers network usage. 
Everyone seems to be talking about server and device monitoring instead of monitoring bandwidth usage / user actions etc.
I've tried various monitoring solutions and overall prefer nagios due to its flexibility.  There's also a massive selection of additional plugins that can be added should you need additional functionality.
At my last job we supplied Stonesoft firewalls to customers and the management interface for those provided both of those features.
Personally, I think Nagios, Zenoss, Zabbix, Hyperic, and Groundwork are all good solutions.  I was also impressed by PandoraFMS and OpenNMS last time I looked at them.
6. Websites, messengers and p2p file downloading can be blocked to save bandwidth and raise productivity.
