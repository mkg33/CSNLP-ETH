Or perhaps AMANDA (The Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver)? I've used this on a network of around 100 PCs with no problems at all.
This might be more than you want - this will back up the entire disk image, rather than just a few files. However, in my experience disk space is cheap (hell, LTO4 data tapes are coming down in price as well these days), so it's sometimes easier to back up the entire disk rather than just backup a few folders from each PC.
BackupPC is a really nice backup software supporting Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. It has a web interface, is easy to configure and just worksâ„¢.
Please try to setup something based on rsync and you'll be very happy to have live backups that are very fast.
On Linux I used rsnapshot tool that is based on rsync to backup the servers. You'll be able to create multiple full snapshots on the backup server without using much space on disk because rsnapshot is using hardlinks for unchanged files.
if you want to use rsync but prefer a gui, you can use http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp for windows or http://arrsync.sourceforge.net/ on osx
Or if you are willing to go down the paid route, CrashPlanPro (http://www.crashplan.com/). Your users can then manage restores on their own with a more familiar GUI.
