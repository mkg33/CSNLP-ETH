Above all else, when mounting your servers make sure you use hinged cable trays. Few things annoy me more than the need to unplug or re-route cables so that I can slide the server out.
All racks I've used, even that oddball with the round holes, can take any number of accessories, such as shelves and fan trays, so don't make such items too high a priority. If the rack manufacturer doesn't have them you can always get them elsewhere.
I've used a number of different racks and while they all did the job, some are distinctly better than others.
I want to strongly emphasize that you avoid server racks with round holes, which you probably see with your telecom equipment.
Use racks with square holes. SQUARE! Square holes can accept labor-saving "quickrails" sold by Dell & Supermicro, and rack-nuts can accept just about anything which uses screws. I've racked and re-racked over 400 pieces of equipment in 50 different racks, and I have yet to find any equipment which cannot be racked into a square hole rack. Square holes save labor.
Bottom line, the servers and cables need to fit and still move air.  You also need to remember that you will end up moving servers, due to maintenance or just upgrades.  So room to move inside is a big plus.  I am a fan of the Panduit racks, you can get them extra wide, so all cable management is on the sides of the servers not right behind them like the photos above.  A lot of colo's or datacenters don't have very nice racks, as they are maximizing their square footage.  When you don't need to worry about that you can end up with a much nicer rack to work in.  Round holes are a disaster, as mentioned by the others.  Something else to keep in mind, if you put your network patch or switches in the middle of the rack, you will only need 3 & 5 foot cables in the rack - helps with cable management and standardizes what you need to buy.
Round holes don't work with a substantial number of rails, and round holes can strip when the wrong screws are used. This leaves you with a useless hole and you might be unable to use that valuable rack space. Rarely, a screw can get stuck in the hole and the equipment will be stuck in the rack. You'll have no choice but to remove the screw with a pair of bolt cutters. Usually you run into this when the equipment is 80% of out the rack and your poor coworker is holding the weight. Sometimes it's 11PM and you're in the server room. Yes, this is are rare. But believe me it happens.
I strongly recommend staying clear of any rack that uses round mounting holes (I inherited, so it wasn't my choice). Two things stand out for me as really important.
