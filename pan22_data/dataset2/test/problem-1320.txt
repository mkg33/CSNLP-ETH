I am in the process of doing the same thing (and almost finished).  I started with Ubuntu server 9.10, got subversion over apache working.  With dyndns configured so it's accessible outside of my home network.  Although subversion was working fine i ran into some issues trying to setup bugzilla, something to do with the perl datetime modules.  So I opted to reinstall with Debian 5 after reading a bit about the long term support benefits and in general the higher stability of Debian over Ubuntu.  In general Ubuntu is ideal for desktop installs and Debian for server installs (just as Fedora and RHEL are, respectively).  However Ubuntu server IS backed by Canonical and I've read about several good things about server installs, but for what it sounds like you are trying to do I'd go with Debian. 
I'm a fairly experienced developer, but when it comes to servers and network related stuff, I'm pretty green.
So what do i need to accomplish this? I have an old computer that can be used. Can I run this on any OS? It currently has Win 7 installed, but I was thinking about going for Ubuntu instead. Any reason to go for one or the other?
For both Windows and Ubuntu you will have some configuration to do.  For Ubuntu this will mostly be setting up access and security related stuff.
I guess I need a web server, and I guess Apache will do fine. Do I need something else to let my computer be available from all over the web, or is a web server and a standard internet connection all it takes?
We are developing a web site, and I would like to set up a server that can host my SubVersion repository, and also host Bugzilla for when we release a testversion on some users.
I still haven't completely figured out Bugzilla setup yet and welcome any links folks can share about setting it up on Debian 5. 
A link some good online tutorials would be much appreciated. And then I mean for real dummies ;). I usually find pages that try to explain setting up servers going way over my head.
You should firewall your server, and this is easy to do with the internal network stack on linux.  I prefer shorewall, but the preinstalled firewall package on Ubuntu may easier for you to setup.
Ubuntu server is easy to setup and has install packages for all the features you require.  Documentation is included in the /usr/share/doc directory.  You can resize windows and install it to dual boot with Windows in case you decide you can't live with Linux
