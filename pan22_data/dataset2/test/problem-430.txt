With this approach, eventual data remanence in swap file may be overwritten by the system, so if he purpose is to inspect the swap content, you should avoid this and see the content with an hex editor or other forensic tools.
I have several dd images from a single drive. One of them is the swap. I mounted all of the images in Ubuntu just fine except for the image of the swap. This is how the dd images break down: hda8 is /, hda1 is /boot, hda6 is /home, hda5 is /usr, hda7 is /var, and hda9 is swap. 
When I try to mount the swap image it fails with the error: dev/loop5 looks like swap space - not mounted. You must specify the file system type.
Swap space does not contain a filesystem, therefore it is not mounted. Mounting a filesystem means making visible the file and directory structure so that you can navigate and manipulate files. But swap space does not contain files, its data is organized more like pages in memory, in other words raw data that the operating system/ memory management system knows about but the "mount" command does not.
For linux swap forensic you can work on the device itself and not mount it. You should have a look at swap_digger  which will dump all swap strings and attempt to find cleartext passwords and other data in there.
