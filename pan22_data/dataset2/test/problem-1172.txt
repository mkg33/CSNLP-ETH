I don't think you can.  The IP interface is dependant on the physical interface (or bgroup) because of the routing table.  So if the physical interface is down, the router assumes that the entire network, including itself, is unreachable.
Ensuring that a tunnel remains "up" is an entirely different concern. In ScreenOS, this can be accomplished with the "monitor rekey" option (and "optimized" for good measure if you want to, with a specific destination IP and source port if the outside isn't pingable, and possibly with an interval of 5 instead of 1 if the lines you go over are residential ISPs). That has nothing to do with being able to manage, however. It can give you good indication and advance warning of VPN failure, if you configure a server that receives logs and sends out notifications to staff on "VPN Down".
Well, without knowing much about your setup (it would be good to know if it is route vs. policy based, etc) you need to keep in mind that ScreenOS usually requires traffic routed or forwarded by policy into the tunnel to initiate the tunnel or keep the tunnel up. So, if you have no traffic going into the tunnel the tunnel will not stay up. This sounds like your issue. However, there are several command line options to tweak the way your tunnels behave. Try Chapter 10 in the Oreilly ScreenOS Cookbook or downloading the ScreenOS "Concepts & Examples Guide". This is a pretty hefty PDF available from the Juniper website, but it is also broken up into multiple volumes. Try looking at volume 5: Virtual Private Networks, Advanced Virtual Private Network Features. Pay specific attention to an option called "VPN Monitoring", using "set vpn  monitor rekey" should help to keep the tunnel active in different cases, but be sure to read up. Also, if you want to go a little farther you could examine DPD (Dead-peer Detection) on newer versions of code.
Now you can manage the unit using that loopback IP address, which will always remain reachable; and you did not have to carve out additional address space to do that.
The correct answer is to create a loopback interface. When nothing is plugged into the LAN bgroup, the interface goes "down", and all routes associated with it are removed from the routing table. That's a behavior you want, actually, as it helps when using route-based redundant VPNs - it's the only way for a device to know "that tunnel is down and I should now route to over here".
Anyone know what command I skipped on CLI for setting this up?  Or if there is a checkbox on the web interface I should go hit?
It also has the risk of making your VPNs "flap" if you misconfigure - that is, if the address that Monitor is pinging cannot, actually, be pinged, or if the interval is too aggressive for the quality / latency of your ISP connection(s). That can be handled by, for example, pinging said loopback address through the tunnel: You won't be relying on the external address being reachable to ping.
I have a VPN connection to a remote site and whenever nothing is plugged into the remote sites LAN bgroup the interface IP isn't managable or pingable.
