I want to do this so they will be able to customize their computer, but I don't want to allow them to change to any image they download off the internet.
I logged in as a test student and was able to change the theme, but the desktop image does not change and there is a message at the bottom of the settings screen saying that one or more of the options have been disabled by the administrator.
I have also found a lot of the Windows 10 configurations can be added using Windows 10 RSAT tools on a Windows 10 computer without even adding the Windows 10 Administrative tools. They will appear on the server GP side as registry keys I believe.
If I enable the setting allowing students to change their desktop background, changing the theme changes the background image.
I am trying to allow students to change their theme, but not their desktop background. In GP, I had it set to allow students to change their theme, but allowing them to change their desktop image was disabled.
Another note, I have disabled users from changing their lock screen image, but the option is still available. Is this setting not available in Windows 10 yet?
