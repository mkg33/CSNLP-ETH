Native replication not help, and in this case better to leave both database on same server and just install trigger for INSER/UPDATE/DELETE on Master database, which will check conditions and make direct changes on second database.
That wouldn't be a normal situation at all! You can't alter the database during replication, and the master / slave cannot have the same server ids. I'd recommend if you must do this, then set up some triggers on the first DB, to replicate the insert / update commands against the second one.
If you just wanna replicate data you can add a triger on update or on insert or both whatever you need. This way you can use your condition easily. Master/Slave replication would be better for different servers.
If i did understand correctly your need, You can have 2 MySQL instances on one single server (OS) then you could configure one of them as Master and another as Slave. You must create different my.conf,we named it my1.conf and my2.conf that each one should be different on port number and socket path and log error path and some other parameters. With this approach, you will run 2 MySQL daemon with different configurations. For complete doc please go to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/multiple-servers.html .
