HÃ¥kan is right; you need those in-zone records, and they really ought to match the out-zone (glue) copies.  Generally, don't violate RFCs unless you're really sure you know what you're doing.
Much as I hate to disagree with my esteemed colleague, the NS records within the zone do serve some purposes.  For example, the 1ary NS needs to know who all the other NSes are so that in the event of a zone update it can send them all DNS NOTIFYs, so they know to perform zone transfers.  This information it gets from those in-zone NS records.
since in the parent zone .com. there is already NS record for the example.com. child zone and A glue record for the ns1.example.com. for what purpose do we state NS records again in the child zone?
As for DS records having no in-zone counterpart, the DS is a simple digest of the in-zone KSK DNSKEY record.  That record, just like the NS records, would have been mirrored in- and out-zone were it not for the considerable length of KSK records, and the performance implications for domains with tens of millions of child entries, such as .com, of maintaining a similar number of records of arbitrary length.  Thus the decision to keep only a digest in the parent zone - but they are still the same record, and the in- and out-zone copies must match, just as with NS records.
