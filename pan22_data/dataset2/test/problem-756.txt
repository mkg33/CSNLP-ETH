https://www.google.com/#q=%s - This disables autocompletion while still using google as a search engine. You must clear search history before using this, otherwise it will still autocomplete to old searches.
(The history-editing function is still not that great in Chrome, so it may be easier if you use a history-enhancing extension like History 2, History2, or Recent History.)
Failing that, you can resort to some hacking. You can use an SQLITE3 tool/editor/browser/manager to edit the history files Archived History and History to remove the URL. This method is not pleasant, but technically, you don’t have to do it correctly, you can simply edit the URL to be something else, and that will still have the desired effect.
Only downside to this, it does disable suggestions, which are helpful sometimes. It is, however, a simple fix to a huge annoyance.
According to this bug report, google will never allow this to be turned off. At all. The hate is palpable. 
Check out chrome://predictors to see which URLs Chrome is going to complete based on what you type. As a bonus, this page also offers insight into what you have previously typed in the Omnibox to navigate to a certain address. Pretty cool, in my opinion.
This has long since been an annoyance for me, and just recently figured out a slight workaround. The problem resides in using google as a search engine, changing this fixes the problem OR using an alternate google search url:
The reason that’s happening is because you visited that page enough times to convince Chrome that you frequent it (at least more than other reddit pages), and so when you type the beginning of the URL, it automatically fills in the rest, assuming that you want to go there again.
As other have pointed out, I don't think it's possible to turn off address completion from your history. The only way to stop Chrome from completing URLs is to remove the specific URLs from your history. You can do this at chrome://history or in the Omnibox by typing the beginning of the address and then highlighting the one you want to delete and pressing shift+delete.
Another option is to open your History, click **Edit items…*, select the URL in question (perhaps more than one instance), then click Remove selected items. This way, it is removed from your history and so Chrome won’t make assumptions.
Theoretically, if you just type reddit.com and press Enter (erasing any additional autocompletion), it should start autocompleting to that.  In practice, however, you might have to clear your history to make it go away.
