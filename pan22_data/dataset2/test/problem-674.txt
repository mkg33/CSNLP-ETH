You could write an event procedure in VBA (of type Worksheet_SelectionChange), check if column A in your table is the target area, and conditionally fill the cells with 'N/A' text. But this would discard all values previously entered.  
This will break if you have column breaks in the middle. Not sure how well it handles with merged cells as well (Haven't tested it yet) For issues like that, try something like this: (Example given with 5 blank rows for spacing reasons)
To add onto your conditional formatting question: Your range can be an equation, instead of a fixed range. This will make the OFFSET function particularly useful, as you can have the conditional formatting automatically expand to include your selection. For example:
for cells in row 4, and the format if True would be an identical text color and pattern color. This way, all content is hidden from view while the values are not touched. After all, this is for guiding a person on data input, visually.
Will automatically expand to include everything in column A, up to row 1000. If you want it to expand horizontally
