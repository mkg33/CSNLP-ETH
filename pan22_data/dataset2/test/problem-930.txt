Google searches tell me its a connection between the Sharepoint server and the SQL server however, this is a production SQL Server which has several databases on it that do not experience any problems.  These databases also include the Central Admin and Web Application databases for Sharepoint which are all working fine.
I have also found a few folks with the 7888 error that indicated an update of the NIC driver eliminated the error.
Turns out that the problem was a firewall IPS between the SQL Server and the Sharepoint server.  Evidently it was killing the packets returning to the Sharepoint server.
This is a brand new installation I am trying to provision the first SSP for MOSS and I keep getting the following error:
Wireshark pointed out the "Malformed Packets" coming from the SQL server and I showed this to the network team who found the problem right away.  Once they put in the exception the SSP provisioned as it should have.
I have seen thuis error in a virtualized scenario where the host was overloaded and the traffic timed out.  Moving to an ESX 4 system from VMware Server resolved the issue. Are the systems in your farm physical or virtual machines?  Any other possible network issues between the systems if physical?
(Provisioning failed: A transport-level error has occurred when receiving results from the server. (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 - The semaphore timeout period has expired.))
