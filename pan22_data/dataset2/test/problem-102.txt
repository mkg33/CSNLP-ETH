I have worked with dozens of consumer grade WiFi routers, and they have been really hit-or-miss with this, though it seems to be getting better.
It's usually due to bugs in the Wi-Fi home gateway routers (APs), or sometimes in the wireless client chipsets/drivers/software.
Short answer? I don;t think they always "block" so much as they just "don't do it ot begin with" due to engineer laziness creating any particular device. Some don't have it as a high priority, and some just don't have the time to make it work. 
If you want a device that supports it, do the due diligence on your research and you'll get a device that supports it, or if you can find a new or used device that supports something like OpenWrt or Tomato from Polarcloud, you can be assured of getting what you need.
On Wi-Fi, sending multicasts from the AP to the wireless clients (this is known in the standard as "From the Distribution System" or "FromDS") is tricky, so there are lots of ways it can fail, and it's easy to introduce bugs.
@Spiff made some awesome points in his answer and I won't reiterate here. But there are some other answers and alternatives to get around this issue.
The crazy thing is, "ToDS" multicasts are done just like ToDS unicasts, and so they rarely break. And since ToDS multicasts (not FromDS multicasts) are all that are needed when a wireless client gets a DHCP lease and ARPs to find its default gateway, most clients are able to get connected and surf the web, check email, etc. even when FromDS multicasts are broken. So a lot of people don't realize they have multicast problems on their network until they try to do things like mDNS (a.k.a. IETF ZeroConf, Apple Bonjour, Avahi, etc.).
It's not high on the priority list compared to all the new "features" marketing is using to sell these consumer grade devices and it's a feature most non-tech savvy people have no clue about, so down the priority list it goes until the point that unless a large pool of owners complain about it, it gets left out of any revision updates. 
tl;dr: Bugs. Lots of opportunities for bugs. And occasional poorly-designed features and configuration errors. Your best defense is to buy high-quality APs from companies that care about making sure multicasts work. Since Apple loves Bonjour (mDNS) so much, Apple's APs are probably the most consistently excellent at passing multicasts reliably, and Apple's Wi-Fi client devices are probably the most consistently excellent at receiving multicasts reliably.
