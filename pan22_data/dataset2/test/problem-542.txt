Your routers are also performing a function called NAT.  This is necessary because most consumer grade Internet connections will only get a single IP from their ISP.  NAT actually rewrites traffic back and forth on the fly, allowing multiple machines behind the router to share and appear from the outside as though they are all from a single IP address.  Since you are using two routers, you are going to be "double-NATed."  This is only an issue if you want run server-type software that accepts incoming connections without initiating outgoing connections.
So, let's say Router A gets its WAN IP from your ISP, and hands out addresses on its LAN ports in 10.0.0.0/24 (that's 10.0.0.1 through 10.0.0.254).  You have a server connected to the LAN ports of Router A.  It has address 10.0.0.3 and the server software is listening on port 2000.  You need to configure port forwarding in Router A to forward incoming traffic on port 2000 to 10.0.0.3.  This is where DHCP sucks, because what if your DHCP lease expires and your router gives a different IP.  But it won't change the port forwarding configuration.  So I would configure Router A DHCP to give out addresses in the range 10.0.0.1 through 10.0.0.127, and manually assign 10.0.0.129 to the server.  That way it will always be accessible no matter what DHCP does.
Almost all consumer grade routers support getting their "WAN" address via DHCP.  And, almost all consumer grade routers have built-in DHCP servers, and will hand out a range of addresses of your choosing on your LAN ports.  If you want to chain multiple routers in this fashion, by having one router get an address via DHCP from another, it will work.
Now, throw Router B in the mix.  Router B gets its WAN IP from router A, and is set to hand out addresses on its LAN ports in 192.168.0.0/24 (that's 192.168.0.1 through 192.168.0.254).  You have a server connected to the LAN ports of Router B.  The port forwarding of Router B must match with Router A otherwise your traffic will get to the 10.0.0.0/24 LAN but never your 192.168.0.0/24 LAN.  And you can see why it'd be better to give Router B an IP manually instead of relying on DHCP, because if DHCP suddenly decides to give Router B a different IP you'd have to reconfigure your port forwarding.
The Internet functions with multiple layers of routers as a matter of course.  For example, when your traffic leaves your house and travels over the DSL, it hits a carrier router, and likely several others before getting to its final destination.  The Windows tracert command can show you all the intermediate hops that your traffic takes between your PC and the final destination.  Your main issue will be NAT, however.
