Here's a link to a diagram of (what I believe to be) the layout of the RB750's AR7240/AR9330 switch.
For this.. Best practice is to assign the Native VLAN or PortVlan ID on that specific port to VLAN for the NanoStation.  Than TAG all your other VLANs if you want them passed on that port.   Not all devices can pass tagged frames.  Also you do not have to assign all members to those ports.  Only assign the vlan members to ports that you want the traffic passed on.  (Saves Bandwidth).
The solution is to setup the VLAN IDs on the AP first, then test them by temporarily changing the managed switch port to a trunk port with the tagged VLANs, to test if the VLANs actually work and are setup correctly in the router.  
Accordingly, port 3 on the router has an untagged vlan configured for the 192.168.100.0/24 network and a tagged vlan for the 192.168.20.0/24 management network (with vid=3).
After rebooting the router, swconfig shows the following switch configuration. Note the missing '3t' from VLAN 3. 
I think the common point of confusion (in this situation, and for users who are somewhat new to VLANs) is that access points by default do not tag the management interface on the AP itself to any VLAN id, so you can lose the ability to configure the AP from a web interface if the managed switch port that the AP is connected to is changed to tagged with a few VLANs (trunk).
Generally speaking, even untagged ports need to be assigned a NATIVE VLAN id AND only if this is different from the default id of 1. This is to help the switch understand how to forward packets. If you do not provide a vlan and it is bridged, it's considered a routed interface. You should not generally specify subinterfaces (ie tags) on interfaces unless you expect it to be bound on that system with an IP on that interface.
I think what you need here is a trunk on your interface with your admin and data vlan configured on. Keep in mind the port configured on the other equipement must accept tagged frame on the specific id vehiculate by the trunk
I have successfully configured non-tagged vlans and tagged vlans independently, but not for the same port. The reason why I want to do this is because I have a Ubiquiti NanoStation loco M2 plugged into a port providing a wireless lan (which requires untagged frames), but I also want to configure a tagged vlan for managing the loco (i.e. accessing its management ip via tagged van).
I've also tried manually configuring the vlan/port assignment and tags using swconfig, but in each permutation, it either leaves port 3 out of one of the vlans, or it forces port 3 to be tagged in both vlans.
I have installed OpenWrt on a MikroTik Routerboard RB750UP (AR7240 CPU with AR9330 built in switch). I have included additional details below, but my question is:
Another point. Generally speaking, tagging only occurs when a L2 packet moves from one vlan to the core switch engine and only if it needs to be carried over another trunk. When a packet flows out of the switch engine it is stripped of the tag and forwarded via standard Ethernet frames.
If the VLANs seem to be working ok (connect to the SSIDs one at a time), then temporarily change the trunk port back to untagged (regular port) and find the setting in the Access Point web interface that ties the management interface on the AP itself to whatever VLAN you want. If you are sure the VLAN actually works ok (you should have just tested it), you can set the AP management interface to this VLAN.  Finally, change the switch port back to a trunk port, tagging each VLAN you want, one for each SSID, and/or the management VLAN if that's not on Wifi.  Now, you should have VLANs working and access to the AP web interface at the same time.
Your other ports can be see to there appropriate PVID / Physical Vlan and be tagged.  If you only need to pass one vlan then set it as untagged for a device that only needs that vlan.
As the image shows, the NanoStation loco is plugged into port 3 and has a management IP of 192.168.20.10/24 configured on a vlan with vid=3. It also acts as a wireless bridge/access point for the 192.168.100.0/24 network.
