No, you can't just take an IP from one ISP and use it with another. And you can't have ISPs share them.
Amazon route53 will allow you to failover a hostname to a backup IP address should the health checks on the primary fail. Can also load balance
The only viable way I can think of: Use your current Server as a gateway that just routes packets to your local server. That way the IP doesn't change and switching ISPs won't matter.
Without going down the route of setting up your own ISP and using BGP, no. Why can't you use a DNS record instead?
I own a GPS vehicle tracking device company. The GPS devices are installed on the vehicles and it can be tracked anywhere in the world. All the GPS device has one server IP in them for tracking the vehicle. The server is hosted in Amazon cloud. I'm planning to host the server locally in my office.  I have a query in hosting it locally,
For the future, you need to set up your devices to look for a DNS domain name, and send their requests there. IPs can not be redirected from ISP to ISP. However, DNS records can.
