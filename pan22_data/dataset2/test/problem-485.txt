You can try the -h (hibernate) option, but it is deprecated, as MS seems to have found it unreliable since Windows 8.
Try editing the Power options; also try shutting down using the shutdown command in the Run dialog Win-R:
Starting with Windows 8, Microsoft changed the way how Windows boots to make it faster. This is called HybridBoot and is a logoff + hibernation. Next time Windows starts it resumes the kernel from hibernation and after login it starts your startup tools as in all older versions. To do a full shutdown you have to press the SHIFT key and press the Shutdown button.
If that works, copy it to a batch (text) file named myshutdown.bat (or any filename with .bat extension); create a shortcut in the start menu for convenience and to make a keyboard shortcut.
If you are using Internet on your PC, then it might happen that OS get update as windows 10 is having alot of issues with Update, so shutdown take some time sometimes it happen that pc don't shutdown and after 2-3 minutes it automatically update your system. Might be that is the reason. 
To make the shutdown buttons shutdown the PC you have to change some settings in the power options.
