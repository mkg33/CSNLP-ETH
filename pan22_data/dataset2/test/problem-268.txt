Different games behave differently in Full-Screen mode. If you can run the game in a Window or a Full-Screen-Window you should not have this issue. If you must run in Full-Screen then do not ALT-TAB out if you know there is an issue. The way the graphics sub-system behaves with Full-Screen (non-Windowed) games is completely different to a Windowed app. 
Are you saying it use to work correctly before your re-install and now does not (you are not clear on this matter).
Recently I re-installed a fresh copy of Windows 7 with all available updates downloaded for both Windows and Drivers and with no problems at all.
I had figured only two ways to switch back; the first by Bring to Front from the task manager (Doesn't work with all) and by Restore by right-clicking the taskbar icon preview.
Everything was good but when last night I started Steam in full-screen mode then started a video game and switched to desktop, then I couldn't switch back to either both of them from the taskbar or even with Alt-Tab.
