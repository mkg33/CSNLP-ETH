You can use a lot of free software, but my recommendation would be to launch it with PaintShop Pro, like this: http://www.paintshoppro.com/en/pages/ai-file/ because it is very simple with editing, and since it is an Illustrator file, some software can mess with the quality and PaintShop Pro.
You will need to use a program which can edit vector graphics to work with this file. The obvious choice is Illustrator, but I believe Inkscape can also open Illustrator documents.
I installed Ghostscript using Chocolatey, but I had to install the 32 bit version with --forcex86, and I had to use ghostscript.app package as ghostscript package would not install anything with --forcex86. Then I used XnView which was already installed with Chocolatey. XnView only supports 32 bit Ghostview. I open the .ai file with XnView and it was able to open. I could change the raster DPI with Tools > Options > Read/Write > Read > EPS > DPI and I set it to 300. Then when I open the file, I could resize and save as PNG. 
I tried to convert from .ai to .png with FFMPEG, but it gave an error ".\AdobeStock_35571058_WM.ai: Invalid data found when processing input".
