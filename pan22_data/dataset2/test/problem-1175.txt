Honestly... my true opinion on the subject is that you let router appliances do the routing... and let servers be servers.  I.e. do not put OSPF/BGP on "servers" ... let the edge-routers handle BGP to route properly.  If you're trying to cluster two (or more) servers using the same IP... you should look at the many clustering strategies on a shared IP.  Having OSPF on the servers themselves will not guarantee a faster "fail-over" ... in fact... it may be even slower.
Generally, having servers participate in routing protocols is problematic; you're likely better off having them point at a floating virtual IP from your pair of BSD routers. It may also be possible to have your routers use a virtual IP as the origin for the BGP sessions, if your handoff is Ethernet or similar (where it's possible to do IP failover) and not an actual point-to-point interface (T1,etc).
Typically you want to have your BGP speakers all speaking to each other (or a route reflector, if your topology is big enough) as well as your upstreams, so everyone's on the same page, particularly when you're taking full tables from everyone. (Obviously you need to do some filtering, so as not to re-advertize routes from one provider to the other.)
