If all this fails and you're feeling adventurous, you can use wireshark (on Linux, it's easier) to "sniff" the traffic from a ping to an external IP. You should see where it's trying to go. If the packet leaves with 192.168.1.1 as destination, the problem is on the router's side. Otherwise, it's a clue.
Try manually setting up his DNS server. Go into the network and sharing center. Then open up the properties of his wireless router. Select IPv4 and type in your own DNS servers.
Try connecting your internet connection direct to your PC through ethernet.    If that works, you are most likely looking at a router problem.    I have had routers connect to the wireless and give IP addresses and all and still not deliver any internet.
If I understood correctly, the wired network works correctly on praveen-laptop but over Wifi, only local addresses can be reached ?
I suggest you verify on your SOHO router's administration interface that there is no security rules forbidding external traffic on his Wireless NIC's IP or MAC.
