My problem revolved around the "php53-common conflicts with php-common" issue. The box is an old server and I was going to test some code before putting it on the production machine. It's running Centos 5 and used to be production but is now relegated to testing. It's too old to upgrade to Centos 6x without new guts so I'm stuck with it for now.
The first line gives me the list of packages that I put after erase inside of yum shell.  The second line gives me the list of packages to put after install.  Note that you may have to handle some ancillary packages (e.g. ones from PECL) manually.  Use some variant on rpm -qa | grep php | grep -vE '^php53.*5\.3' to track those down.  They should be rare, though.
In order to make sure I really get everything, I've been known to write up a quick bit of bash.  Something like:
The problem here is that "yum erase php" is also going to pull dependencies out.  This means that you'll lose any packages you installed that depend on PHP.  There exists a yum command called replace. but it is not always present and sometimes... surprises.  And not in a good way.
