Having an old speed of 512k would probably deter other residents from Youtubing because of constant pauses in the video makes it annoying to watch. The 1.5Mb/s jump would fix that, and I would assume a lot more streaming video is being watched.
Get your facts and figures, do a little poking around on your network. Heck, unplug the computers and other devices, and see if you're still getting usage for a period. (Some ISP's will let you drill down on a per hour basis).
All the ISP's I worked with while I was living in Australia attempt to foist the buck off you. "Oh, it's not our fault, but if you want us to check it, we will. But it will cost $$$ if you're wrong!". The seed of doubt goes into the customer's mind, then the problem is dropped, everyone is happy - except the customer.
How about running something like FreeMeter on each PC?  Is it possible bit torrent is running one one of your PCs?  Leaving websites open in your web browser can use up some bandwidth, but not the amount you describe.  I'd try seeing what your individual PC usage is and how their totals compare to those being give by your ISP.
As previously suggested, installing monitoring software would greatly help track the source of this problem. Although I have a feeling a lot of your problem is Youtube and other streaming video sites, my siblings are horrible for this as well. It doesn't seem like a lot, but 1 hour of viewing can easily rack up 150mb+ bandwidth on regular videos, not counting if someone is viewing HD videos. HD videos are much worse, more than likely 2 to 3 times the bandwidth per video. 
I would be inclined to generate your own usage reports for a month. If your usage reports do not match theres, have their technicians look into it. Dare them to hit you with the fee.
Bottom line: If you're sure the ISP is getting it wrong, and it's not being caused by you, don't be afraid to call them on their crap. Nine times out of ten, when the user says "You've got a problem, here's the evidence to back it up" the problem magically fixes itself, and you hear nothing about it - until it happens again.
As an extra precaution I'd do some serious spyware/virus/etc scanning.  It's possible one or more of your PCs can be infected by something that is using a lot of bandwidth without your knowledge.
If the Macbook was used, you may want to look into the applications installed, make sure no malicious software is running in the background gobbling up bandwidth as well.
