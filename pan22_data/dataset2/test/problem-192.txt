I'm surprised no one has even mentioned any of the hacking scenes within Hackers or Sneakers... loads of laughs in any of them... 
How about the Live Free or Die Hard scene in the NSA datawarehouse where the bad guy is jacking into this super secure mainframe using fiber optics, copper ethernet AND BNC coax!
In one episode of NCIS some cop-hacker-guy (I don't watch the show because of its stupidity that often so I don't know who he is) needs to prevent a worm that tries to access his HDD, so he will install a mirror on a firewall, so that warm would see itself and not the drive's content when it tries to infiltrate his system... I mean, its MEGA stupid. =D
The Matrix also has a load of BS for hacking; with the exception of the scene in Reloaded where you see Trinity using nmap, and then an SSH exploit to hack into the powerplant.
Someone at work showed me a clip from The Wire where they were using Windows Search to locate a suspect in the police database...
I've always thought of the CSI series as being the worst offenders when it comes to unrealistic use of technology. I think this episode where they zoom in a surveillance video to get the reflection from a person's retina (!!!) really takes the cake.
GLaDOS-like computer controlling EVERYTHING that is connected to electricity around the world in a matter of nano-seconds.
There's the scene in Firewall where Ford is talking about putting in a Cisco firewall ACL to block a hack attempt and the words coming out of his mouth sound realistic but if you watch what he's actually doing it is totally useless...
The super secure mainframe in Mission: Impossible that has an easy to use GUI to make it easy for Cruise to access while suspended from the ceiling...
Or as others have mentioned how MacOS integrates perfectly with alien technology in Independence Day...
