I think bounce is a regional term.  I work with DBA of a few select customers in the midwest.  We typically use the term bounce for bringing a database down and back up.  Sometimes the term bounce slides over to restarting the server, but it's much more rare than when talking about the database.
The explanation I was originally given for the terminology is that a service is stopped and restarted pretty quickly. i.e. Throw it down and let it come back up, like bouncing a ball. A server reboot (an historical term) takes a significantly longer time (normally), so can't really be called a bounce. Applications don't get bounced or rebooted, so they are restarted.
In my part of the world the term "bounce" is generally used when talking about services, whereas you "reboot" a server or "restart" an application or process.
I am from the East Coast and have not heard this terminology "bounce" a server in my 10 years of IT career. However, I just learned this word from a fellow IT Admin after working in the Silicon Valley and it has been used quite often. I guess it is a regional IT slang and it means to restart.
