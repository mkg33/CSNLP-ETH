When I know I'm coming up on an IP address change, several days ahead of time, I typically lower my TTL value to something less than I would normally use. That way, the change propagates faster when I do make it. Then, I kick the TTL back up again.
If I'm going to make a DNS change to an A record for my domain (changing from one IP to another), how long can I expect until people are moved over to the new info?  Is it simply <= the TTL?  I know it used to take a while, but in 2009 how long should I expect?
Besides the TTL (something that you control, see Brian Clapper's excellent advice), and possible longer caching times inside some applications, there is also the synchronization time between the authoritative name servers. It can be near zero if every name server receives the NOTIFY and it can be several hours (depending on the settings of the SOA record) if a NOTIFY was missed (something which happens sometimes).
Most clients will work with the TTL that you set.  However there are some DNS servers which are configured to ignore the TTL.  I recently changed the IP addresses of our web sites.  We had to leave servers up and running on the old IP addresses for weeks in order to respond to requests.  We finely had to figure out the remaining customers and request that they clean there DNS cache and/or reboot in order to get them off the old IPs.
It depends on how long the clients are caching the DNS information which should be according to the TTL value. However, since the client determines how long to cache the information, you can't really be sure (after all clients can do manual resolution and thus ignore TTL completely).
