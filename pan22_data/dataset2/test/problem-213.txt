When playing mkv file in mplayer or vlc, sometimes (especially when some other process starts working), the play looses its quality. Audio plays ok but video pauses and hangs. 
What can I do to make the play smooth. I don't care much about video quality but the play should be smooth. Is there any player, which automatically adjusts depending on the amount of cpu and memory available.
If you go this route, you'll need to load the CoreAVC .ax files (codec files) in the External Filters section of MPC, and you'll need to set it to "prefer". Here is a seudo-example I found on the web: 
Further to Crazy Buddy's answer, have a look at using CoreAVC in conjunction with MPC-HC (or even MPC-BE, a fork of the project). CoreAVC, while a commercial solution, includes a rendering engine that is unmatched by VLC or codecs included with the CCCP.
PS : I usually convert mkv to avi using ffmpeg. I was wondering if there is a player (or some settings in mplayer and vlc) which I can set to make play fast). Also conversion often results in very bad sync in audio and video stream.
