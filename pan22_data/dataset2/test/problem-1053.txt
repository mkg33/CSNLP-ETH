Does your battery overheat? (if so, then this is your core problem) try to avoid battery usage while plugged in.(i'd better suggest you to take out battery)
Avoid prolonged High Perfomance usage (since it's battery killer) especially for corei7-based laptops. CPU trottles (CPU temp goes up-> perfomance down)-> Cooling system goes up -> extra battery usage.
Also check out battery integrity. (Each battery has certain amount of charge and discharge cycle. Mostly is 200 cycles(approx. 2-3 years of normal usage). Consider cycle as fully charged battery and fully discharge) Once you done full cycle - your battery power capacity might go down for a little amount. So you'd better check battery integrity % (at 20%-35% and higher you will suffer such problems as decreased perfomance, frequent fps drops and etc.)
For example:Your battery has 35% integrity. You charged battery for 100% (according to windows). Well, this doesn't mean that you charged fully battery. Your real fully charged battery will be at 100%-35%, while windows shows 100. With that being said, your battery lasts lesser than it used to be before.
either you have a soft that activates the Nvidia dGPU on background (GPU-Z does that for instance). OR the configuration of Nvidia drivers is wrong and dGPU is always ON or activated with wrong programs (Chrome, Word etc...).
High GPU temps cannot double (or triple) the discharge rate like we are seeing here (even if it can be a symptom that the gpu is at full speed 24/7).
The solution was to reinstall Intel/Nvidia drivers from scratch (Nvidia's installer offer an "perform a new install" option, I don't know about Intel).
My specs are Core i7-3630QM and i literally killed 3 batteries for 1,5 years, just because i didn't follow these simple suggestions.
So the real issue here is that the dGPU is probably always ON (which would explain why the drain is higher than your dad's laptop).
