What I tried already is just putting an entire application in DropBox or similar. This gets extremely messy when working on multiple systems simultaneously, especially for software like Sublime Text which uses cache files etc. So I'd need something smarter. Maybe I can get away with making sym/hard links to just the actual settings files/directories and then syncing a dir containing those links. But then I have to figure out for each application exactly what to sync.
I use unison to synchronize files and configuration settings for a number of applications etc. For example for firefox I have set up symlinks to only synchronize my bookmarks, preferences and a few other files. It does require some additional pre- and postscripting, though, to "normalize" these files, e.g. remove last access time stamps to prevent updates every time.
I work on different systems using different OS. What I have ben wanting for a long, long time, is an easy way to sync application settings. Just like syncing files, but with some extra logic. For instance, here are some applications I use daily and how ideally they would bevahe:
Questions: is there an application that does something like this already? Surely I am not the first one with this idea. If not, any tips on how I could create something that does this?
