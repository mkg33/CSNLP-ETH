Also, creating shared credentials is a terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad idea. Making their password to never expire makes it even worse. I don't know what your background or experience is, but from the context of your question I'm guessing you're not in a position of authority in your organization, and you should really talk to those who are about the best way to go about balancing security and convenience.
Commonly, the users who can add a machine to an Active Directory Domain are members of the Domain Admins Active Directory user group.
There are many ways to solve this, some of them good and properly security-minded, and some of them not. For that reason, this question really deserves more of an open-ended discussion format to fully flesh out. However, here's two methods I'm familiar with: 
In order for it to work properly (aside from the first 10 workstations joined), you can refer back to this article: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/932455/error-message-when-non-administrator-users-who-have-been-delegated-con (an oldie but a goodie).  In short the steps are 
The trust relationship between the domain and its member computers is NOT predicated or dependent on the administrator accounts used to authenticate the various systems together.
Once a computer has been joined to a domain it does not have to re-join the domain. Once an administrator account has confirmed the system is to be added to the domain, you could delete that admin account and it would have no impact on the computer added using that account.
The trick is that the workstation admin account should be a member of a group of "workstation admins" from there all access and permissions should be granted to the workstation admin group.
However, non-Domain Admins can add machines as well, if given the proper permission.  Some companies might not want Help Desk technicians to have Domain Admin privileges, but do want them to able to join machines to the domain.  With the proper permissions, this can be accomplished.  See this Microsoft article for more information.
Accordingly, the technician's Workstation Admin account should be used to join the computer to the domain.  Shared accounts - should be used only in situations where no other option is available.  Alternatively, I could see an option where an automated deploiyment tool (like SCCM or something) could leverage a dedicated account with no access other than that of joining computers to the domain in a dedicated OU.
There are situations where each of these may be appropriate. The easiest method though is to have two sets of credentials for technical staff and they are then each responsible for using them appropriately.
