I'm wondering whether there is any option/control to disable the automatic hiding (fade-out effect) of vertical scrollbar that happens after few seconds of mouse inactivity in Microsoft Word 2013?
There is a hack that stops the scrollbar from disappearing, though I'm not sure whether Microsoft considers it a bug or a feature:
I disabled the animations (smooth movements) in all the Office 2013 and I have the same auto-hiding of the scrollbar you're refering.
NOTE: I also have the option 'Show vertical scroll bar' checked under File > Options > Advanced > Display.
This is a partial solution, but it's the solution I prefer because my vertical scrollbar now stays where I can see it at all times.  Go to the "View" tab at the top of the screen.  Go to the "Views" section on the left.  On the right side of that box, click "Draft".  It resizes your window to "text width" basically and disallows the scrollbar from vanishing while pausing / typing.
