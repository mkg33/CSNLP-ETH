Create an admin acct on the client and also the same acct on the Hyper-V server with same passwords. On the client, launch Hyper-V manager by holding shift and right click, then, use different credentials (the one you made earlier).
I've been checking anything I (and google ;)) can think of, all accounts seem to be in order via cmdkey, via mmc I can connect, but not to the Disk Management (Unable to connect to Virtual Disk Service), Device Manager. The Firewall isn't accessible anymore, but the Task Scheduler, Performance, Users, etc... are still accessible...
So in short, to me it seems to be a firewall issue, but I'm not well versed in the windows firewall and all it's possibilities, if anyone has any idea/suggestions?
Everything used to be running well, all the mmc snap-ins were available on the client, etc, etc... The last time I used the Hyper-V Manager on the Client has been more then a month ago. Today I fired it up, wanting to add a new VM for a postgresql DB, and I'm unable to connect to the Hyper-V server with the know error "An error occurred while attempting to connect.... Check that the Virtual Machine.... authorized to connect to ...."

I would try running HVRemote on the server using the appropriate command line for your scenario and see whether it resolves your issue.
