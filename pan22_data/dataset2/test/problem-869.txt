So the question is simple, how can I apply the settings that are already configured in a domain GPO to a local GPO?
You should be able to use the Group Policy Management Console to export the GPO as an inf and then move it to the target machine(s)
The proposed solution for the original problem was trying to export GPO from a domain and import it to the Local Group Policy. Instead, it was correct that these settings are domain specific, which means it wouldn't help to export/import them under these circumstances.
The Wireless Network (802.11) Policies and Wired Network (802.3) Policies from the question are both under System services from the list above.
While it is possible to export domain specific settings from one domain and import them to another domain using Migration Tables to reference users, groups, computers, and UNC paths in the source GPO to new values in the destination GPO, it is not possible to import such settings to Local GP.
I need to know how I can create and deploy a local group policy with settings that exist in my domain GPO. I know local GPO only supports a subset of what domain GP does and I think that's where the problem exists. The settings I need to apply are contained within the Computer Config -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> security Settings -> system services, Wireless Network (802.11) Policies, and Wired Network (802.3) Policies. These three options do not exist in either XP or 7 local GPO. I have investigated using secedit and security templates from the SCA snap-in but it doesn't appear that they contain these settings either.
