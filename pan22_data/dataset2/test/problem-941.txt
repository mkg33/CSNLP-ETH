Adding bookmarks to a PDF that stays with the file requires software capable of editing a PDF, such as the full version of Acrobat (not Reader).  There are any number of other software apps for editing PDF files.  There is one freeware piece of software that I've heard of, but never used, called JPdfBookmarks, that is specifically designed to allow you to add bookmarks to a PDF file.
In Acrobat Reader, you can use a comment(sticky note) or text highlight as an alternative to bookmarks.
I am not aware of any PDF viewer that will allow you to create bookmarks stored externally of the pdf file itself that will remain the next time you open the pdf file in that viewer.  What you would need to do is edit the PDF
Preview will allow such things on the Mac.  FoxIt Reader supposedly does as well, but I haven't used it in years so I can't comment for sure.
Good luck getting anything accomplished with Reader. I did find this on eHow, but I gave up using such crap from Adobe long ago.
It is free, fast and reads everything. The bookmarks work as you describe plus every time you open the program you are greeted with a custom page of pinned and frequent documents for easy access.
If you're the creator of a document, or the author has granted permission to modify it, you can then create bookmarks.
Acrobat Reader doesn't permit users to create bookmarks.  You'll need Acrobat Professional or some other PDF editor for that task, not a PDF reader.
