The HP ProCurve 3500yl-24G-PoE+ (J9310A) is more than decent and I believe suits your needs, though it isn't exactly cheap.
I'm running 4 Cisco 2960 48TC-L all crossed over together to connect a number of gigabit web,db and file servers and have had a flawless experience for a couple of years. They expose stats over SNMP like bandwidth per port / cpu and memory usage too which you can graph with munin to make sure it's not overloaded. So I can recommend them. Depends what your budget is though!
I'm building a small virtual datacentre right now, and I've found Dell PowerConnect switches to be 30%-40% of the price for Cisco switches, with the same characteristics. 
I highly recommend getting a managed switch if you're running iSCSI over it. We just upgraded our rack on the cheap and got a pair of ProCurve 2510G-24 switches ($800 each). They allow us to limit vlan traffic on certain ports. So ports 1-8 are for iSCSI, no other traffic gets to those ports; similarly iSCSI traffic doesn't leave those ports and doesn't interfere with other traffic.
None of them is likely to disappoint (or surprise) you a lot. They are cheap, simple, switches. We have several of the D-Link DGS-1224T.
I know switches very much limit domain broadcasts, but it still happens, and having a managed switch where you can set hard barriers helps ensure performance.
