I'm not sure what information is vital and useful here, so I will update this with information if it gets requested.  This is a production server, so I don't want to do anything like drop caches.
My understanding of this command and the results is that all of the memory is being used, none of it is in buffers, which strikes me as very bad.   I do notice that our mysql potion is using about 22% of the memory, but I don't want to mess with that since databases are important (not that I think it would break the database, but it would definitely make it inaccessible which is bad).  I'm thinking a server restart is what is best here, but my boss is not wanting the site down for even a second, so that's out for now.  What else can I do to improve the situation?
We have a linux virtual server hosted through GoDaddy, and our site has been running slow recently.  I poked around the server a bit (I am not a sysadmin and have very limited experience with linux, mostly from C programming classes).
