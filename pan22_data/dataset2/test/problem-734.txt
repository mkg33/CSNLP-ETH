Safari does this somewhat better; swiping two fingers to go back reveals the previous page as it was - Safari then reloads the images (maybe the text too, but it is not so obvious.
So even though the page reloads, it will not reload the cached content as long as it detects no updates. Even so, if you want to stop this, then try editing browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers or browser.cache.check_doc_frequency by going to about:config.
I imagine this has to do with cache control and whether components of the page or the page itself have expired. I'd like to be able to override that.
By default Firefox does store cache for all parts of a webpage that it can, although on a lot of secure https sites, like paypal, it is blocked from doing so for security reasons. If you search something in google though, go to a website, then disconnect from the internet and go back to the google search, you will notice the page will load all the content that was stored as cache.
When I visit a site such as NYtimes.com and then click on an article, returning to the main page (using a two-finger swipe, the back button or backspace) causes Firefox to reload the page however short the time since it was last loaded. How can I stop this behaviour and get a copy of what was visible before?
