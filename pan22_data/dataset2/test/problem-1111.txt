As for hiring only on abilities goes - ha. Some fantasy world. People are not so objective as that even at the best tech companies. Not to mention they are only able to judge that within their own abilities. And not the abilities of the best programmer there but of the upper management who are usually a whole different ball of wax compared to their top tech guys.
There isn't a "it depends" on company. You don't get hired based on what you wear, so wear the standard interview gear (e.g. dress shirt, tie and dress shoes). This is universally accepted by all companies and dressing otherwise is running the risk of "it depends" on company.
That said, it's just an interview and what you wear (as long as you're clean and presentable) doesn't matter as much as your skills, plus good interviewers understand when candidates overdress because they're worried about making a good impression.
In my admittedly limited experience (my previous job was at a game studio and I have a bunch of friends who work at different studios), game studios tend to be pretty casual. Personally, I wouldn't dress up past an ironed button-down and solid-colour, non-embellished jeans or dress pants for an interview at a game studio. They're generally places where people wear jeans and t-shirts to work, you're likely to look out of place and like you don't understand the culture if you dress up too much.
I never wear a tie for a software or tech company and no one ever shows up with them for interviews in the places I work unless they are from China or something like that. I just wear a nice dress shirt with a solid color, nice pants and dress shoes. Pretty close to how I show up to work. And that is how everyone else seems to show up as well.
There's probably some places that won't care if you are less formal than option A) but I would not push my luck. You don't want to be seen as too eccentric.
Easy answer: when you are offered the interview in the first place, ask how they prefer applicants to dress! If you forget, you can always call/email your contact at that company and ask in advance. It's a reasonable question and you don't lose points for asking.
The good news is that the game industry is mostly a meritocracy. I personally like to wear a suit and tie for the interview (it was just drilled into me when I was young to always always always do this), I usually get some gentle ribbing about how I'd better not show up to work looking like that, and then we get down to actually figuring out whether I'm a good fit for the position. I have plenty of colleagues who "dress down" and get hired that way, too. 
Ultimately, a hire / don't hire decision is going to come down to your skills, abilities, and fit. I have never, NEVER heard of anyone in the game industry getting (or not getting) a job solely because they did or didn't wear a suit. (I suppose if you showed up wearing a t-shirt with an offensive image on it that would count against you, or if you showed up wearing nothing but a Speedo or something, but accounting for basic common sense you should stress about showing why you're an awesome developer, not a snazzy dresser :)
For government work or trying to get a contract with a fortune 500 company you need to wear a dark, conservatively cut suit. You will look and feel horribly out of place in anything else. And be sure to act very polite and formal as well and don't be opinionated at all, which you can usually get away with a little at a software company so long as you are somewhat inline with the opinions of the locals - and if you are not, then maybe you should avoid working their anyway.
