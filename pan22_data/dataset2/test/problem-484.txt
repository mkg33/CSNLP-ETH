Lastly, you don't need 'always on' VPN to push anything out. This entirely depends on what you're using to push out updates. There are a lot of ways to do this, many of which don't require always on. Depending on the size of your updates you might want to store these on the remote file server and write your script to install from there instead of everyone downloading via the WAN.
It sounds like you need to research the difference between Site-to-Site VPN and just running the VPN client.  With a site-to-site they'll be just like on your network and any startup actions (GP initiated installs, etc) will work, albeit they'll run slower over the WAN. You should look at if your bandwidth in your central office is sufficient for this first. For remote offices site-to-site is best. Buy compatible routers that have VPN features.
You'll have a piece of equipment you are going to have to depend on to get internet access, so why not make it something you can setup a P2P vpn on?
As a side story, we managed to recover a lost laptop via logmein.com because the unsuspecting theif left it connected to the internet. 
I use logmein.com. And if you are going to be in my case where many of the sales pesonnel carry desktops all over the world, then VPN is not going to cut it. In the long run, logmein.com still took over the VPN infrastruture we have.
This company is expanding, and will have 4-5 more offices across the US by year's end. My boss thinks the proper solution would be having all of the offices on a VPN for internet access, with the server hosted remotely. My concern is that I wouldn't be able to push out needed software/OS updates with a VPN since it's not an always on connection. His concern is that he doesn't want to have to have anything in-house, like a firewall or a network connection for all of the satellite offices to depend on.
VPN is really for external users to connect to the internal network. For the converse situation, remote desktop and services like logmein.com could be viable. They are simple and free.
I work for a small insurance company that only has 2 offices. Right now, if something goes wrong in another office, it's just a short road trip. But...
I don't understand your boss's requirements. If you guys are doing any kind of file sharing with the main office then they'll need to be dependent on the central office.  A hybrid approach is a small file server at each local with network mappings to your central office. Its faster and they still would have access to the central office. Of course you need to backup this server to something, like a local NAS or tape drive.
Well, you are going to have to have SOMETHING for some sort of network connectivity. Depending on the size of the offices i would suggest something like the ASA5505 if they are smaller <10 people. Or larger models for more people. Then your best bet is to setup a point to point vpn between all the offices.
