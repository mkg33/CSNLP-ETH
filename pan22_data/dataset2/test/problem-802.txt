but the reverse is very slow! "ping windowshostname" or ping "anylinuxname" from linux host results in a 2..3 seconds waiting time followed by very slow response times. Maybe I ask as another question here ..
I seriously doubt that the D-LINK 2640-T has a built-in DDNS server.  According to the Datasheet on that product it has DNS Relay support, and DDNS.  The DDNS functionality is implemented as a DDNS client to update public DDNS sites so that your External IP of the DSL Router can automatically update DNS records on the Internet.  I doubt they include a DDNS server that allows your "internal" clients to self-register with teh DSL modem/router device.  
Your clients DNS settings should be pointing to the Dlink router's IP address, so that the client asks your router for names. The router should reply all internal names to your client, and should use your ISP's DNS servers for external lookups. 
Using a DLink 2640-T (ADSL2+Router). It cant resolve the internal hostnames. The manual is pointing to the firewall settings of the router to switch off the DNS-Blocking from external (which doesnt make sense to me). But even with that in place it just does not work. And all I got from  DLink support: Please reset and try again... What I did, no change.
The DNS relay portion is to permit your "internal" clinets to point to the DSL router/modem and have it forward queries recursively to the Internet for resolution. 
Answering my question (after continue the hard way learning about networking, which I am not expert in)
This is straight forward for Windows clients. But Ubuntu, or better Linux, doesnt really now about the workgroup concept (I guess) until you install/activate samba.
In your case I'd strongly suggest running a real internal DNS server, rather than rely on the forwarder built into your router.
It looks like the d-link router will move the ip of the dns to it's outside interface and therefore not respond to it anymore on the inside.  This is so counter productive...
when I point the router dns (client) to the pi-hole. it stops communicating with it and the pi-hole loses internet access.
