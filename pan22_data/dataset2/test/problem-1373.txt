Some spells could come at a physical cost as well as a magical/mental one. For example, a fireball could burn the casters hands incurring slight physical damage which is offset by strength/toughness.
Some spells may require a steady hand and firm stance to cast. For example, a spell which can push back an enemy may also push the caster as well or the accuracy of a thrown fireball might be affected by strength.
You could have some spells be an extension of the strength of the caster and thus strength would provide an effectiveness modifier. For example, the strength of a spell with a knock back effect or even the effectiveness of a jump spell.
Crossposting seems to be discouraged, but you may get other perspectives if you ask at the rpg stackexchange site.
If strength affects hp, then you could have a fail cost to casting. If the caster fails at casting then maybe they take damage. Thus discouraging weaker casters from even attempting the really big spells.
Strength could affect the total amount of power the caster can wield at a given time. i.e. a stronger caster can allow more energy to flow through them at one time. Intelligence would allow you control it to cast the spell, but the strength would allow you to cast bigger spells that require more mana to cast. This way spells can have an intelligence and strength requirement to cast.
A simple approach might be to allow access to certain thematic (and powerful) spells only if the character reaches certain secondary stat values.
Each (reasonable) build needs to be able to make it through the game.  The player can't be suddenly stymied by a magically resistant foe or physically impenetrable barrier because he chose to spend his stat points poorly.  Even more difficult for you, a balance must be struck between showing the player what they could have done had they chosen differently and beating them over the head because they chose badly.
For instance, for Strength, you could decide that thematically applies to the ability to magically absorb physical energy, and grant better defensive spells for the mage, such as telekinetic shields, defence against dragon breath etc. Or you could tie it to apply it to travel magic, and only strong mages could levitate and fly. The thematic best fit will depend on which magics are available in your game world, and which might already be taken by the other already-good matches amongst the stats. 
You could have strength/endurance affect the tiring/recovery rate of the caster which could reduce casting chance / effectiveness of cast as fatigue increases. Allowing them to cast more spells, quicker over a period of time.
There are a lot of good responses in here but I'd like to throw something in that is less an answer and more a different way to get at the question.
That way, if you want to cast lots of spells, you have to spend some attribute points in strength to carry all the stuff you need.
One way I can think of to make strength important to a mage, would be to have strength decide the maximum weight a player can carry, and have some (or all?) Spells require reagents that take space and consume weight.
From the player's perspective character building is about sacrifice. They have a limited pool of resources they have to choose how to divide up.  Your job as the designer is two-fold:
If we take strength as being a measurement of physical prowess, then you may want to consider how casting and magic wielding impact the caster physically.
Or make a heavy staff necessary to cast the more powerful spells, which you can only wield if you're strong enough.
Just make sure the player understands the options they are presented with. Don't put the rewards on such a high shelf that the player will be locked into one progression before they realize they have made a choice. Put a few spells in the early game with relatively high intelligence requirements for the expected level and a few items or barriers with high strength requirements so the player gets a flavor of the choice they are making.
At the heart of your question is "how I can I not punish my player who wants to play as a high strength wizard".  This is a good question that you have to consider for each class and stat you choose include in the game.  In this case you can reward them with heavy stat-boosting gear or the ability to do physical feats that give them other ways of solving problems (can't take on the guards? climb the trellis to a window). On the other hand punish them with an inability to cast the most complex spells (perhaps shadow-door could have also got them past those guards) either at all or with as much frequency or efficacy as they otherwise could.
Strength could also affect encumbrance which would allow the mage to carry better armor (which might be better for enchanting with magic buffs) and also allow them to carry more totems, items, staffs etc.
The player should know that by choosing stat A over stat B what they are gaining and what they are sacrificing.  Summarizing the suggestions in the other answers this means the player should know that by choosing intelligence over strength they are choosing something like spell slots, damage or complexity over something like carrying capacity which may be important for spell reagents, weapons or armor.  In particular this choice could manifest in the form of either being able to cast 7th-level room-clearing spells like cloud kill versus having the physical capacity to carry around those 10 kg solid-gold gauntlets of fire damage +40. 
You will also want a reasonable collection of "universal" magic which any wizard has access to, of course.
Casting requires mental discipline but also requires large amounts of energy to flow through the body. Holding the body in the right position and directing the flow with precision requires physical strength to hold the arms and the head and the fingers just "so" while huge energies are flowing through them. If your muscles are not strong you have to take it very slowly and carefully, the more physical strength you have, the more you can rely on your body to hold the necessary position while you channel the energies.
