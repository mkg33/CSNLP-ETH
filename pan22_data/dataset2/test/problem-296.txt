The OS X side of his machine seems to be running fine - he gets decent frame rates playing Starcraft II, System Profiler recognizes his card, and all is well.
My brother has a 15 inch Macbook Pro, of mid-2010, MacBookPro6,2 line, the generation immediately previous to the newest incarnation of the Macbook Pro. He got a model with switchable graphics, either the integrated Intel GPU or an Nvidia GeForce GT 330M.
Windows 7 appears to be struggling in Bootcamp. The first hint was the Sins of a Solar Empire refuses to launch, informing him that his Windows Experience Index score is a 1, and Sins needs at least a 2 to run. As his computer's profoundly not a "1", I had him run the WEI utility, and sure enough, it lists his GPU score as a 1.
First, my apologies for any lack of specific information - asking this question for someone else, based on a phone call I had with him playing "family tech support expert".
Similarly, when I have him bring up System Information, there's nothing in Display. Adapter RAM displays as 0, most things are "Unknown", "None" or "Missing", etc.
