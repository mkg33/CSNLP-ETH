Taking snapshots of any VM is not a backup solution and should only be used to provide safeguards during upgrades / patching etc.
It may be that the version of VMware wasn't the correct version to support safe snapshotting of DCs.
If possible I would always enable the AD Recycle bin in order to restore accidentally deleted objects.

We have a domain controller (windows server 2012 R2) and few replication servers. I had taken  a vmware snapshot of our DC few weeks back and today I had accidentally deleted few users and groups. So I reverted the DC to the last created snapshot. But now I am not able to login to the machine, even the administrator account doesn't seem to work. Any ideas how to fix it.
Do you have 2nd DC? can you login from there? if not then it might be a case of having to restore from backup.
This is an interesting conversation. As long as we are using a supported Hypervisor, and as long as the PDC Emulator is on a DC running Server 2012 or higher we can create snapshots of DCs and we can roll them back without running in to USN issues and having to perform USN rollback
