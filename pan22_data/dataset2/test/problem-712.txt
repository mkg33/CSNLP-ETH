This needs to be connected to either an RS232 port on your computer (which is getting rare now), or through a USB to RS232 converter.  You can then use a program like minicom (linux) or Hyperterminal (Windows) to view what's coming out over the serial port.  That'll let you see the kernel output as it boots, log into the console and go through the rest of the instructions.
However, what the board won't do is display a text console on a monitor connected via HDMI whilst it is booting.  If the Freedreno driver is properly installed on the Fedora root filesystem it would ultimately boot to X but I'm not sure it is with the default filesystem that is supplied at the moment.
If you are still having problems if you could post kernel traces then perhaps I could spot something.
The IFC6410 probably is booting - the message you're seeing after the fastboot command means that the board has successfully rebooted, the kernel has been downloaded to it and it'll be proceeding with the boot process.  
I'd definitely recommend getting a UART cable working.. makes it much easier to debug when you can see the kernel traces.  Do note that it is 5V levels, and some earlier board revisions reversed RX and TX (gnd is center pin).
I've never tried a usb stick.  But as long as the rootfs is still /dev/sda3 then it should work.  Otherwise you may need to edit bootargs (ie -c "..." arg to fastboot)
However, a text console is outputted over the serial link when booting - you can use this to log in as root and do the rest of the setup - that's what the 'login as root via serial terminal' means in step 8 in the instructions.  Therefore, you need to build a serial cable as per the 'making a serial cable' section here:
