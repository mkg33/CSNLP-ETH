try to encode the file in Notepad. Just open the CSV file in Notepad and click on "Save as" in the file top menu. Then in the Save as dialog box choose UTF-8 and save the file. Now you can open the file with Excel with UTF-8 encoding.
LibreOffice 4.1.3 imported the CSV file correctly, and I could save it in Excel 2010 xlsx format and thereafter open the xlsx file correctly in Excel.
To use the standard method of just opening the file (e.g. by double click) you should transcode it to whatever the default encoding is that Excel prefers. If you can control the creation of the file (or ask the creator to create it with the desired encoding), then it's easy. Otherwise a python solution is trivial, but again more work
Ultimately it depends on how often you are receiving / creating these files, the best workaround to deal with this issue would be to create the files in the default encoding Excel expects, so you can just double click to open.
Therefore I have to use import function (Data/Get External Data/From Text). However, when I use import text function in excel (where I can set file encoding explicitly) it interprets the newline as start of the new row instead of putting multiline text into a single cell and breaks the file layout.
I had exactly the same problem you described when trying to use Excel 2010 to read UTF-8 MySQL data with multi-line Japanese text in some fields exported as quoted CSV with \r\n used for end-of-record (tried \r and \n also with no difference in Excel's behaviour).
When csv file is opened directly from explorer excel correctly interprets the cells that are mutliline, but it messes up the character encoding (utf-8).
(HINT: you can find out which encoding Excel is expecting by opening the Text Import Wizard and seeing what the preselected option is)
To use the Text Import Wizard you would have to remove all the new line characters from your CSV file. If you created the file programatically you could edit it to omit the newline characters, if you received it from elsewhere it would be trivial to write a python script to strip the newlines characters out.
