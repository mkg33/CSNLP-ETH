I would say at a minimum you'd want some sort of small tape changer, software to run it, and a plan that includes thinking about your data retention policies, knowing your data and what you need to resume business after a disaster, and also what sort of things you do restores for regularly.  Also a reliable place off site to store your tapes.
Backups are like insurance.  When you don't need it, it's too expensive.  When you do need it, it's cheap at twice the price.

It might not be a practical solution for a large company, but you didn't provide any budget/size information for us to base our answers on.
SpiderOak was recommended to me when I asked about online backup services for my small company. It's a completely cross platform backup utility that costs something like $10/month for every 100GB of data. It boasts several neat features like archiving old versions of files and data encryption.
