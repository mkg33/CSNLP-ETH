You can create your own self-signed certificates or even your own private certificate authority using openssl (or easyrsa, a wrapper for openssl) and if your clients are such that you can update their trust stores, but the simplest solution is just get a domain, or create a subdomain from one you already have.  The domain doesn't technically even have to be hosted in Route 53.  Then get the cert from Amazon Certificate Manager, which is free.
This won't work.  A TLS certificate provides two things: keys for setting up encryption and an assurance that the server is not an impostor and is authorized to serve requests for the given domain.  Obtaining such a cert requires you to own or control the domain, but amazonaws.com isn't yours.  This is why all the examples involve a custom domain.  The hostname of an AWS load balancer is there to give you a DNS target that isn't an IP address, something to point your domain to in DNS, because the IP addressss of load balancers will change over time due ro scaling, failures, or upgrades.
