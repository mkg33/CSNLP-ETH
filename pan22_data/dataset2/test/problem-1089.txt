I'm trying to upload a file (which can be quite large) from the website of one server to the backend of another server using plupload. Lets say:
I found out that IIS 7.5 requires you to specify which domains are allowed to POST to the backend (see documentation). Basically I needed to add the following to the web.config file:
Does anyone know how to stop the browser from checking or how i can tell my server to just accept the POST?
The browser is probably not allowing cross site connections. Check this site for workaround on the destination server: http://enable-cors.org/
After doing some research I found out that a browser does this to check if the server will accept the intended message. It looks like my server doesn't feel like accepting a simple POST call even tho i use post all the time.
I see you are using IIS. It also seems the URL you're trying to access to consume your web service is http://www.backenddomain.com/uploadhandler according to Chrome console (although is confuses me a bit that in the request headers you are posting when you try to upload there is an OPTIONS /main/uploadnetwork.php HTTP/1.1 - probably because you edited the info to hide the real address).
I encountered the same problem and the answer may be simpler than those above if your case is calling an URL without a explicit "somewhat.php" document at the end. If you are sure the address of the service is www.backenddomain.com/uploadhandler (http and all removed due to not having "enough reputation") and there is a default document being served there (I assume it is index.php), you have to append a trailing slash at the end of your address to call it.
