I fixed the problem by removing the folder in the Terminal with rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/*  and the fixing the fonts with the Font Book App, preinstalled on OSX. In the Font Book App, went through all grey (disabled) font entries and selected from the context menu "validate font" and "enable font". The Preview started up without problems.
I reinstalled just Office's fonts and Preview started working again, even after once again removing the Office fonts.
I just had a similar problem and as mentioned in one of the comments deleting ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/ worked for me.
I had the same problem, after remove the font set of Microsoft Office from my mac. The problem might be caused by conflicting font files, inhibiting Preview from starting up.

In my particular case, I had previously installed and subsequently removed Microsoft Office and it's associated fonts.
Other similar threads around the web tipped me off that it may be related to fonts being missing or corrupted.
