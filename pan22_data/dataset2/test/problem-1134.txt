Deciding the existence of an "evolutionarily stable strategy" in a normal-form game. See http://www.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/ess.pdf .
See  David Defossez, Complexity of clique-coloring odd-hole-free graphs. J. Graph Theory 62, 2 (October 2009), 139-156, and some recent improvements (2013): Hélio B. Macêdo Filho, Raphael C. S. Machado, Celina M. H. de Figueiredo, Hierarchical complexity of 2-clique-colouring weakly chordal graphs and perfect graphs having cliques of size at least 3 (the problem is still $\Sigma_2^p$-complete for weakly chordal graphs, and for perfect graphs having cliques of size at least 3).
A rather recent result not included in the Schaefer and Umans paper is 2-CLIQUE COLOURING OF PERFECT GRAPHS.
The setup is a 2-player symmetric game. An evolutionarily stable strategy is a (randomized) strategy that is (a) a symmetric nash equilibrium, and (b) there are no good "symmetric deviations": in this equilibrium, if one player can deviate to some strategy and maintain equal utility, then the other player would do strictly worse to then also deviate to this strategy.
Marcus Schaefer and Chris Umans have a nice Garey-and-Johnson-esque survey of complete problems in the polynomial hierarchy.
