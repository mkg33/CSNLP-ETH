Every system as reported a different set of logs leading up to the Search Errors. Mind you, these errors show up in Event Viewer about every 15 minutes from the moment they first appear.
Any help would be very much appreciated! Apparently this has been going on for months for some users at the company and only just started to report it a couple of weeks ago.
I've done the rebuilding off the index, recreating Outlook profiles, updating Office to the latest build, taking Outlook of the deferred scheduled updates to current, and I've tried disabling indexing for Outlook -- it allows them to search from the exchange server - but it is very slow and definitely not as quick as it was before and will not work for remote users.
The only "solution" I have found that seems to work is recreating the Windows Profile and copying all their data/files back over. It is a time consuming task and since it is affecting most people in my company (through reasons I have still yet to find), I was wondering if anyone has found an actual working solution to this problem. Or even if anyone has experienced a company-wide Outlook searching issue.
I have looked through numerous systems on my network and am not able to find a trace leading up to these Search errors. They just sort of happen.
They are unable to search in Outlook past a certain date. I've verified when the errors start in the Event Viewer corresponding to when their search broke.
