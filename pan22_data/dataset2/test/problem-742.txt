So here 74.125.236.195 is the IP address of google.But for suppose I want to know the IP address of superuser.com and if I try using the same way then I get  198.252.206.16 IP address.But If I put this IP addess in browser url then my browser does not take me to superuser.com.
If you are trying to work around an issue with your DNS provider, then one option you have is to modify your hosts file so that you are resolving addresses yourself, rather than have an external party do it for you.
Here, superuser's site disallows user visit via IP address. Probably it is because the IP address is binding to other web sites (say stackoverflow.com).
The first part says "get the first page of the site", and the second says "for the website superuser.com"
If you wonder why you cannot visit superuser directly from IP address (198.252.206.16), it is because of the settings of web server. 
This is why a single webserver can host multiple websites using a single IP address.  In the case of the Stack Exchange sites, any or all of them can be on each of their servers, and you'll get the one you ask for.  If you just put in an IP address, you won't get any of them, because you are not telling the webserver which of the many websites you are after.  In these cases, it may have a "default" website defined, or just return an error.
I wanted to know the IP address of a website.One way is to ping the website.For example if I want to know the ip address of google.com then I can ping in command prompt.
This way, if you type superuser.com into your browser, it will look in the hosts file, and resolve the IP address, but then still pass through the name of the website to the server it connects to.
Firefox have a nice addon which shows the OP address of any website you visit which you can get from  here
Flagfox add-on for Firefox gives you the ip address of the current website, along with a wealth of other information about the website (including a geolocation map of the server location).  A menu selection within the add-on's pulldown allows you to copy the IP address to your clipboard if desired.
In many cases (I'd venture most cases) the website that is presented at an IP address is dependent on the website name you are requesting.  Ie, if you request superuser.com you will first resolve this to an IP address, then make a request to the IP address for a specific webpage.  It looks like this:
Your starting assumption is that all websites can be accessed via their IP address directly. This is not the case.
