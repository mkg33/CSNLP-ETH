I have been looking into various replication solutions (mySQL Cluster, PGCluster) but these all seem to require that I have each instance accessing the database through one location, whereas I want each instance to read /write to its own database and the databases to be kept consistent across all devices. Does anyone have any ideas of a solution that may work for this or somewhere else I could look?

have written a Django application that reads / writes data into a postgres database, at the moment I have been deploying one of these devices per client. I am faced with having to deploy multiple instances of this across a client site. I need to keep all databases consistent across the instances with each instance talking to its own database (essentially a multi-master setup)
