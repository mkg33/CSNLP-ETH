Further analysis of the log does seem to indicate that updates that required reboots were installed at 03.00 at 2017-01-11 as per the setting, but for some undetermined reason, the server was not rebooted at that time.
The actual result is that the server rebooted at 16:51:30 with the following message in WindowsUpdate.log:
By using the TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager log I have been able to determine that the last user of the terminal server logged off for the day at 16:41:29, so it would seem that after exactly 10 minutes of nobody being logged onto the computer, the machine did reboot. The full WindowsUpdate.log is available for review.
I had a bit of an unexpected event this afternoon. A Windows Server 2012 R2 terminal server rebooted itself unexpectedly after an update installation, contrary to the settings set in the Group Policy.
The expected result therefore should be that the server should install any updates with no impact immediately, and install any updates not requiring any reboot at 3 AM, after which it will reboot.
