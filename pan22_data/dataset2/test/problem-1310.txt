•iPhone, iTouch — Grab the EPUB or PDF and read in the Stanza App, Bookworm, or the reader of your choice.
(On the other hand, the ability to read O'Reilly's books is secondary for me; I went with the kindle for purely subjective reasons - it seems slicker, the page turning feels nicer, and I feel like Amazon have a bigger range of fiction. For me, the technical books are just a nice-to-have, albeit a nice-to-have that would be a dealbreaker if absent. If technical books are what you primarily intend to read, something that supports EPUB as well as PDF and has a bigger screen might be a better choice)
I just found this thread as I am looking to purchase an eReader. With the iPad now out it added to the quantry. I believe I have decided to not get an iPad because of it's size and weight. I do not want all the bells and whistles it will offer since I have a perfect Sony Vaio with a 13" screen that bows the iPod out of the water for true computer ability and what I need it for. No, I want an eReader for my tech books and personal reading and perhaps magazines and newspapers, and I wat it small, light, portable. I do not own an iPhone so I cannot comment on that idea, and I do not expect to be buying one any time soon. Not that I dislike them, but I am located in Montana where we have limited choices of providers and none offer it. Since most of my tech books are O'Reilly ones, I decided to check the O'Reilly site to see if they could help on the decision, and YES.
I'd been using my iPhone to read their books prior to getting the kindle, and overall I'm much happier with reading them on the kindle. Better searching, better annotating, bigger screen...
I also have a Safari Books Online subscription and was looking for the best device to read the content. I looked at many platforms including Sony eReader, Kindle, Kindle DX, Netbooks, etc ...
Because the Kindle is not a standard open format, I am leaning to the Soney Daily Edition, though I wish it were a bit larger like the Kindle DX. Since I will make up my mind and buy my eReader by the end of June, my hope is that Sony with either announce a new one that is a bit larger that I can wait for, or Amazon will get off it's stinking high horse and update the Kindle to handle PDFs better and EPUB format. Either of those will spark my purchase rapidly.
This was one of the big questions I had before getting my Kindle, and I didn't go ahead with getting the Kindle until I was able to check out how the books are handled.
