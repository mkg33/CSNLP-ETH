And since the layer 1 is a shared radio environment, it's packet loss probability may depend on the size of the frame. You could theoretically have a lossy environment where larger frame have a higher loss probability than short frames, but you could also have the opposite. This depends on the radio environment, the amount and type of noise or competing radio technologies in use. But if you use Wi-Fi in ESS/infrastructure mode, the association will be dropped well before you get to that point.
MTU is an interface setting.  It is not negotiated. It does not change over time.  Your MTU will be what you set it to (or some default (1500, 4470, etc.)) until you change it.
An ATM cell is 53 bytes.  Using AAL5, there's 48 bytes of payload.  With the minimum ethernet frame of 64 bytes, you are unlikely to ever find an MTU smaller than an ATM cell.  Even if you did, every protocol I know of with a fixed minimum includes padding to get to the minimum.
Bottom line no protocol ever changed sizes to reduce retransmissions it was said in the old days that you might want to manually adjust data sizes down when using bad links but we are talking at least 15 years ago.
The 802.11 specification does not suggest to shrink the MTU in case of bad links. But the layer 2 isn't independent of the frame size: The option to use RTS/CTS or layer2 fragmentation/aggregation depends on the frame size. The chosen modulation rates could also depends on the frame size.
The only dynamic adjustment of MTU size is to avoid IP fragmentation. That is changing the TCP segment size, to match the smallest IP packet size. IP packets can be divided up by say multilink PPP but that only lasts for the single MLPPP hop.
