Does anyone know what might be the problem here? One thing I'm sort of noticing is that I don't have my router's IP address (192.168.1.1) anywhere in that packet; not really sure whether I need that or not.
Using Wireshark to listen on wlan0, I expect to see an ARP reply giving me the MAC address of a Google server. However, I am not seeing any ARP replies containing Google's IP whatsoever.
You're _NOT_ getting an ARP-reply, 'cause within your broadcast domain [1] (aka: your local [W]LAN segment) there is _NOT_ an host whose IP address is the one you're ARPing for (173.194.46.72).
Unfortunately it's not clear, to me, which is exactly the problem you're trying to solve. Anyway you might find useful to briefly investigate:
One thing to note is that I am building this packet by intercepting an ARP request sent to a virtual network interface (the packet is generated when I use the ping command from within the virtual netspace), then rewriting the packet and injecting it on wlan0 using pcap, so that I can later get the ARP reply and forward it back to the virtual network. This is why I am relatively confident that the other fields in the packet are correct, since I really didn't modify them.
Using pcap_sendpacket in C, I'm manually sending the following packet on wlan0 (I've left out some fields, but I think they are correct):
"Ettercap" [6], "...a comprehensive suite for man in the middle attacks. It features sniffing of live connections, content filtering on the fly and many other interesting tricks. It supports active and passive dissection of many protocols and includes many features for network and host analysis..."
