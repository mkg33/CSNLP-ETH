We have a section of our wiki that has a page for every piece of third-party software we use.  This is where we list the licensing arrangement (whether it uses individual licenses, site license, license server, etc.), and how those licenses are allocated within the company.  We don't actually keep the license keys on this page... just the last few digits so that we can identify it.  We also use this page for software-specific documentation on how we've deployed the software, etc.
We also have a big locked filing cabinet where all the physical software licenses are actually kept.  Sometimes this is the printout of the email that contains the license keys.  Sometimes this is a cutout section of the software box that contains proof-of-purchase.  Sometimes it's the invoice.  We also keep physical install media and manuals here too.
We're a ~20 company that uses mostly open-source software.  However, we do have ~50 commercially licensed software packages though.  All workstations are centrally managed and imaged, so the burden of tracking installed software is quite small.
We use Zenoss for our monitoring solution, and it is able to report installed software by looking at standard SNMP mibs.  We can see what packages are installed on all mac, windows, and linux hosts.  This could solve part of your problem.  In addition, Zenoss will solve all sorts of other problems that you don't know you have yet.
