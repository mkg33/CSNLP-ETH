The problem I'm getting when sending an ehlo test is 5.7.1 relay access denied. I see there are hundreds of these questions but none have helped me understand how this actually works. 
That can't possibly be right since there is no /200 netmask. This causes your postfix to refuse mail from trusted hosts in the 192.168.1.0 network.
If I list yahoo.com as a 'relay_domain' in main.cf, I can send mail to a yahoo recepient. I am not really grasping what this means, do I list all domains I want to send mail to here (surely not). Sorry for the noob style question but most of the guides for this seem to be geared for people with a better understanding of how email works.
Using relay_domains the way you describe it is not how it's supposed to be. This statement is used for maildomains for which you're supposed to handle (backup) mail, not for domains to which you're sending mail.
I'm trying to setup a postfix server for testing our app which uses oracle mail library javax.mail to send mail. The app works fine as I'm able to use google, our own mail server, etc to send mail. 
Hope this helps. These things are explained clearly in Postfix Address Classes and Postfix SASL Readme
