because kvm is now a redhat project. and some other related projects also redhat/fedora hosted projects.
I don't currently run KVM in production but I do use it on my laptop under Ubuntu 9.10 as my test lab.  I haven't run into any stability issues in my dealings with it.  IBM also just announced their cloud services which is based on KVM.
So far no problems with any Linux guests (CentOS and Debian) and I've been really happy with the performance compared to VMware.
We've been using KVM for 6+ months and haven't had any problems. I've used other virtualization technologies such as OpenVZ, VMware, and Virtualbox. 
I haven't tried anything advanced such as migration and I'm using LVM volumes for my images, which may skew my perspective.
But having said that in production at work we currently run Xen on multiple CentOS boxes and haven't had any stability issues with it.  And I do believe that at some point we will migrate over to KVM for our virtualization needs but at the moment that would just be moving for the sake of moving and we are happy with Xen.  But I believe that KVM is the future for Linux based virtualization.
I've been testing KVM for a few months on three different machines (Ubuntu 9.10 and Debian 5 hosts) and haven't really come up against any issues except for dealing with Windows 64-bit drivers.
