Crazily enough, the best reference I can find for a plastic safe keyboard lubricant is .. on a Talky Tina doll fansite.
I had a similar problem with my IBM Model M, and I had excellent results with powdered graphite lubricant. It's completely safe on plastics and easier to control than most liquid or spray lubricants.
TL;DR version -- make sure you pick a lubricant that specifically says it is safe for plastics, and does not contain petroleum distillates that will damage plastic. These may be easier to find at hobbyist shops than general purpose hardware stores.
I would to remove the key, and then put it back. If you need to lube it, return it, and get a new one.
I will also note that I have used white lithium grease pencils without incident to lubricate plastics in the past, which works well because it has a non-runny "crayon" like consistency that makes it easy to apply. But maybe I just got lucky, per below.
If you find you really must lubricate the key in some way, I'd suggest avoiding oils - go for a light silicone grease, and apply very sparingly.  Be aware that you may need to reapply at intervals, and that you will need to clean your keyboard more frequently to prevent contamination buildup causing further problems.
It may simply be that the stabiliser is not properly fitted, so that would be the first thing to check.
