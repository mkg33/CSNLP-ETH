We haven't actually bitten the bullet...I've been trying to work out a way to push the updates as required, but that's got so many issues...Too many different software vendors, so it's turning into a huge headache. It's starting to look like we're going to have to give them local admin. I'm not happy.
Is there a way to allow these users to update their own applications (Adobe Flash & Reader, Java, etc.) on their workstations without being part of the local Administrator group?  Some setting in Local Security Policy (secpol.msc) perhaps?  In testing, adding one of these users to the local Power Users group did not help.
The first people to windows 7 are the last people I'd want to be able to install their own junk. It'll almost be less of a headache to wander by, log in, and update them myself.
We have migrated a number of ordinary domain users from Windows XP to Windows 7 workstations. UAC is turned off.
Our Desktop Management team fought for months with this very issue and the end all result was to make users local administrators (not the best option, I am aware).  However, from their findings, the best/only solution they could find was a nasty security and registry hack to give uses local admin type privileges to specific applications and their locations.  The problem was that any time a user needed to update an application that wanted to touch a location the user didn't have their special "hack" rights to, the upgrade would fail and sometimes even corrupt the application.
