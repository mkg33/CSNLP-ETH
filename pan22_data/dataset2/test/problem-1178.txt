Most modern routers that are in between the internet and a private network can convert the traffic from an private IP address (and vice versa) using Network Address Translation (NAT). Other methods for being able to access machines outside a private network include using a proxy server with an interface on both networks.
You are correct, one is your local IP address(assigned to you by your router) and one is your public Internet IP address (Actually the IP Address of your router). 
The 192.168.0.x is the internal IP assigned to a particular host in your own network, typically from your router. 
Lets say you have 5 computers all on one router. When they connect to the internet, they all look like 108.x.x.x. 
Private IP addresses are provided by network devices, such as routers, using network address translation. Private IP addresses can only be guaranteed unique to an internal network.
You internet service provider(ISP) assigns your router the 108.x.x.x IP address and that is how all computers connected (either wired or wirelessly) to your router connect to the internet. All of your traffic goes through your router before going to the internet and vice versa. Your router assigns all the devices connected to it an internal IP address(192.16.8.0.x) and handles routing all traffic to the computer it needs to go to (which is where it gets its name from). 
192.168.x.x is an IP address used on a private network. There are 3 reserved ranges of addresses for private networks, and this is one of them (there are other reserved ranges for other purposes). These IP addresses are meant not to be routed directly outside a local network (e.g. within the home/institution).
When the server responds, and returns the message to the router, the router determines which internal IP that the message was intended for. This is called Network address translation
