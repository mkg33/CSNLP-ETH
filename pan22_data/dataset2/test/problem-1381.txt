Though I can't directly answer your question on how to generalize without sysprep (my guess is that it is not realistically possible), you may not need to worry about generalization at all.  Are you assuming that you must use sysprep /generalize in order to generate new SIDs, as Microsoft dictates is a critically important security measure?  If that's the case, read this article by Mark Russinovich (of sysinternals fame).  There is no longer a need to generate new SIDs, from a security standpoint, though there are still other valid reasons to generalize an image.
I don't think this is really your problem, however. Getting sysprep to run on already deployed image would have been a better line of questioning. A few things that could be interfering with this are:
2. Your trying to run sysprep from non admin account. Put the system into audit mode (Audit mode runs under the Administrator account), then use sysprep to generalize the system.
I created a sysprep image and forgot to add a few things. So when I tried to redo it, I get the failed to initialize sysprep log error. I've googled my head off and nothing I've tried will get me around this. I'm tired of dealing with it and figured I'd look into alternatives. So...for FREE, what are my alternatives? 
In a nutshell, Mark's claim is that you only need to generate a new SID in cases where the image is for a Domain Controller (at which point it becomes very important).  In addition, there are other things that sysprep does during generalization that may be required... depending on your needs.
