i am VERY recommend you to find freshest instruction for antispam or your mail server became spam-botted within 2 days.
You could use ppolicy to add new policies. You will probably need to write your own module, but it should be do-able
Spamhaus and/or greylisting will drop most of the problem addresses.  Requiring FQDN in the helo/ehlo messages will catch a lot of the rest.  
Doing what you propose here will likely eventually result in you no longer receiving email from the biggest and most widely used domains in the world (gmail, hotmail, yahoo, etc.).
Bounce the message during the connection not afterwards or you will contribute to SPAM through backscatter.  
Does your customer know you're proposing/working on an approach that's going to result in them not getting inbound E-mail from their customers? I think the "bounce mail from people who discriminate against ADSL SMTP senders" policy is going to cause confusion for your customer (who will get phone calls asking about the bounces) and ultimately make their system(s) less useful, which is hard to justify. 
Can you set up your mailserver to pass all outbound mail to an upstream host (at the ISP, or a separate paid service) that's not blacklisted?
DNS and rDNS need to agree for your server.  If your address is listed as dynamic at Spamhaus, you will be refused by a large number of servers, mine included. 
But ultimately, and I know this answer sucks, I think the only thing you are going to be able to do to properly send to those domains that currently reject you is to get a new IP address for your mail host. I know, it isn't fair. And I strongly urge you to fight the good fight. But when you get tired of your mail getting lost sporadically, then I think you'll decide that getting a new IP is what you've gotta do (or bite the bullet and move to a different server/host that works).
The first thing I'd try is to make sure the PTR record for your IP matches your domain, and does not resolve to something like "user1235.big-isp-adsl-for-the-masses.com".
Dropping messages from servers which don't accept messages won't work if they also do the same.  There are a number of legitimate senders who don't accept bounce messages after the fact.
