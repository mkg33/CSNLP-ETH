Also, try to do the animation really well--watch a lot of reference material (or just find one or two really good examples of what you're doing) to see how bodies actually move when they're doing these things.  It can make a world of difference.
First figure out what specific actions you want to support (e.g. wall-jumping, wall-climbing, sliding, hanging from various parts of the environment, etc.).  Then for each of those actions figure out what its constraints should be (e.g. can they only hang from something for a certain amount of time?  Do they have to keep moving when they're climbing a wall or they'll fall?)  Work out whether they need to manually activate the maneuver or whether it'll happen automatically (e.g. do they have to push a button to grab a rope while they're jumping, or will they grab it automatically as they go by it?)  Figure out how close you want them to be to something to grab it or kick off of it.  Figure out whether you're going to include the rotation of the player as well as their position and velocity (it'll look better if you do, but it might be frustrating to the player if you make it too challenging to get the rotation right).
