The only argument I could see for running a server os as your desktop was when windows 2003 came out it was a more modern kernel compared to xp.
Also if you are having instability issues I would recommend getting to the root cause of that before doing anything. Swapping OS might make no difference if it is a hardware issue.
I use Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit on my main PC - a reasonably powerful machine. At the moment it is going through major instability and its time for a reformat. Being a student, I can use Windows Server 2008R2 for free under the Microsoft Dreamspark programme. 
Windows 2008 R2 on the other hand is really just the server version of windows 7. So you might as well just install windows 7.
Also the security model of a server OS is much stricter and can get annoying very fast.  It's not made for day-to-day use by a person; it's made for background services.
I'm trying to figure out if I should install as a desktop OS. I'm wondering if I'd get any benefits out of using it over Vista. I was thinking that:
I would not recommend this for your primary computer.  Many desktop applications will not function fully under a server OS (our own application which works heavily with audio/video will not).  Similar applications like Skype or other video chat software could have issues.
