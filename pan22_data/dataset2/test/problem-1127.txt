The manufacturers generally don't report detailed SKU info to the public (outside of when they sell them directly) as there are usually many of them, they don't mean much to an end-user, and they can/will change practically at random (parts shortages, new model variations, retired variations, etc.).  
There are no general rules (for this specific mark) and every manufacturer has their own way of marking models. So to a consumer they don't mean much and usually they don't make sense either, as in your example.
You seem to know that the extension on the model number represents various versions of that base model.  
The world of computer producers creates "trillion" of variants. If the producer will not give one subcode, the seller will create one SKU. Often they will add their one even if one subcode just exists, and for this you will never find in the producer web site.  
On a side in the seller's world it is needed to have one unique ID for each couple of model and price: you need to control how much you pay your item and which will be the selling price.
Most products have different versions, weather they are revisions, region specific, different colors, etc.
Generally those numbers are the SKU numbers, so that the different variations of the model (hardware, software, country of sale, etc.) will have different, identifiable #'s to go by when stocking for sale.  
Check with an authorized reseller of the product to get specifics on which SKU represents which variation.
The best way to identify the different configurations is by their specifications listed on the retailer/manufacturer site or in store. 
If they lack in detail, contacting a distributor or a big retailer and requesting a spread sheet for the specific model might be the way to go.
The marketing guys are worried that normal people will be scared if the model is too long and they press to have short names, easy to be remembered maybe with some fashion name (Zenbook) to inspire.  
On the other side some clients would like to have the possibility to do comparison and to identify quickly the model, maybe not for the internal components but for shape and general class (in your example UX303LA)...  
It's almost a general schema, for Asus is a not new problem, and from past you take hints when official documentation misses:
