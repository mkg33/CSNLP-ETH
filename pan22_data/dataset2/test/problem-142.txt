I am trying to calculate the cell formulas in the Column D (CONT%) to add up to and equal 2.66% as per the total of return in the Return column. The calculation has to include the weight % in column B as well as the negative returns must be a negative contribution.
What this table shows is Fund A has a portfolio weight of 4.4% and the return of this Fund was 2.96%. What is the contribution Fund A produced as part of the overall contribution return of 2.66% in cell D2. This is repeated all the way down column D until all the contribution values equal 2.66% NOTE the total in B19 equals 100% being the total of the portfolio weight
In columns F through H I ran a double check of how much was invested in each fund (if the total portfolio was $1M) and the returned dollars for the fund.  As you can see, when I total that up it also comes up to 2.62% so I'm not sure how you computed the 2.66%.  I noticed that the Fund letters skip H.  If that is missing, then that could skew the number.  If instead I've made a wrong assumption about what you mean by Weight then you need to define that.
Assuming that the weight is the percentage of the total portfolio invested in that fund, then here is how I figure it.
Hello I am trying to calculate a column of formulas involving 3 different calculations but am having difficulty in creating the formula to give me the correct answer.
