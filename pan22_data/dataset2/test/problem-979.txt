Open up your vpn connection and select the modify option.  Once in the modify dialog box click on the second tab.  At the top of the screen there is a check box "enable transparent tunneling"  Check this box and try it again.
If I remember correctly there is an option to allow local network traffic in the Advanced Settings of the Cisco VPN Client.
Latest versions of Cisco VPN Client don't allow you to override the routing if your network admin has disabled local lan access.
Even logging as admin on your local machine and modifying the routing table will not change anything as the VPN Client still blocks it.
This article mentions a method where in the Windows Networking you change the Networking Settings to not use the Remote Default Gateway. I am not sure if this will work for the Cisco VPN Client however.
If you go to the Cisco VPN client preferences. Uncheck "Enable local LAN access (if configured". For myself, I am using a remote desktop connection to a remote location and my local browser resolves to my local IP.
The cisco VPN software supports a "split" tunnel right out of the box.  The split tunnel will allow you to keep your internet traffic separate from the VPN traffic.  This is exactly what you want to do and should get your spotify program working.
