No, it's not possible. But most NICs allow you to administartively set the MAC, and you could set both NICs to the same MAC.
Your aim: to have constant-hostname-of-laptop always point to the (active IP address/interface of the) laptop? I would have thought that the combined DNS-and-DHCP service of dnsmasq would do that, i.e. when a client does a DHCPDISCOVER/DHCPREQUEST it reports its hostname, and dnsmasq associates the hostname with whichever IP address is assigned. That has been my experience, however I must admit I've not tried connecting with one network i/f, then disconnecting (without doing an explicit release) and connecting again with another.
First thing I learned is that it is possible to assign DHCP leases based on criteria other than a MAC address.
On most *nix boxen you can usually do this, then setup a failover LAGG interface to both (with preference for the wired) to allow your to hotplug the wired connection without disconnecting TCP sessions.
I opted for the multi-mac solution (because I didn't try to find out how I could specify the client id on the client side, which is something that has to be done for each separate client, and the multi-mac alternative is one solution for all the portables in the house.)
Then, although it is apparently not supported by the luci web interface on openWRT, dnsmasq itself supports client_id, and multiple MAC addresses (with the some cautioning).
Enjoy the seamless transition this setup provides, all existing session stay alive if you don't take too long with the switch.
(random semi-opinionated comment: it's rare to see this highish count of unconstructive and plain inaccurate answers and comments to a question)
In contrast to others here, I claim that your request is actually quite elementary and has been supported in dnsmasq since version 2.46, IIRC. This was the sole reason I switched from dd-wrt. After about a year of running OpenWRT, I now know there are actually plenty more reasons to switch, but that's beside the point.
Assuming a hostname of "laptop", what happens when you query the OpenWRT device for "laptop", after having switched from one interface to another?
You can manually configure a static IP address on both interfaces, and then use the one you prefer (while leaving the other one disconnected, of course).
