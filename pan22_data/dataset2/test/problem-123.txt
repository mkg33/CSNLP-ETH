This reduces CPU / bandwidth from the default 10 concurrent requests, 1000 queue size, and imposes a 50MB/sec bandwidth limit (400Mbps). Tweak those however you like - 10 threads might be fine. I tend to upload large data files 1GB or more so I use larger chunks and a smaller queue, but if your files are smaller delete the last three lines.
Like MLu said, 300GB is not much, and won't take long. I've copied 1TB from New Zealand to Sydney S3 on a connection with 35ms latency and about 350Mbps bandwidth available, from memory it took about 4-6. You likely have more bandwidth and less latency. Using about 80 threads it used from memory about 100% of a Xeon core, so not much.
On a busy production server I would tune the s3 config file something like this. It will reduce the bandwidth and CPU usage at the expense of speed. This goes into ~.aws\configure or c:\users\username.aws\config  . If you use a CLI profile this goes into that profile, not as default.
Yes it will show a progress, yes run it in screen and yes it will load up the server. On the other hand it’s only for an hour. 
300GB is not that much. The SSD disks can do ca 100MB/s read and if you are on 1Gbps network that’s roughly 100MB/s as well. So your 300GB should take around an hour to upload. 
You might consider the s3 sync command, as if you need to stop it you can restart again more easily, rather than restarting the copy.
