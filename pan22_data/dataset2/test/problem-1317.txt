Aside from that, you could re-implement/modify the ray tracing clip that the game already uses to find whatever object you are pointing at and make the range of the trace larger (currently looks to be the range in which you can touch/hit blocks) and also filter out all non-entities, however I do not know how much work this would require, and there are several layers of methods you may need to duplicate the effects of.
Also mc.objectMouseOver (an instance of MovingObjectPosition) may interest you. It is the variable set by using EntityRenderer.getMouseOver(). The MovingObjectPosition class has a field of type EnumMovingObjectType and also a field of type Entity. The former may be able to help you, but I'm pretty sure the latter is the field that you would be more interested in, seeing as if you are pointing at an entity, that would be the entity within range.
Since you are making a mod for Minecraft, and judging by the naming scheme of the methods you mentioned, I would suggest looking into the methods EntityRenderer.getMouseOver() and EntityLivingBase.rayTrace() (getMouseOver() uses it, and you can access the method by using mc.renderViewEntity.rayTrace()).
