If your limit is at least 1MByte/s then the SMB Bandwidth Limits feature introduced with Windows Server 2012 R2 is a built-in option.
Not Windows specific, but if you're running gigabit ethernet, you might want to consider increasing the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). From the default of 1492 to a maximum of 9000. This reduces the overhead required since less fragments would be required for transmitting the same file.
If you are using SMB3 protocol, you can improve the performance by a) adding multiple network cards on the server-side and enable SMB3 multi-channel feature b) If you add multiple network cards on the client side, receive-side scaling feature of SMB3 will improve the performance c) You can also use SMB Direct option if you have RDMA cards.
What is the OS of your client and server?  One thing that can make a difference is to update your servers to windows 2008 and your clients to Vista.  When you do this you get to take advantage of SMB2 which is less chatty, has larger buffers, and can do multiple things in a single request making it less sensitive to latency.
