2 - Scales well. I had a  setup with 6k monitored servers without one single item in queue for more than 30 seconds.
I've tried Zabbix but haven't tried BixData. I would recommend trying Zenoss as well, better than zabbix if you ask me.
2 IBM for Apache cluster and 4 IBM for MySQL NDB Cluster. The other two servers are for Load balancers.
Anyway, I use the zabbix frotend of Nagios for servers but I think Centreon (http://www.centreon.com/) is worth taking a look :)
I've been using Ganglia to monitor my single Mac OSX server which runs Apache and MySQL. I'm ok with it.
For Debian, there should be fairly up to date packages of Zabbix available - Debian maintainers are doing a good job.
Now I need to decide on which monitoring tool I should go for. I found that BixData and Zabbix does an excellent job than Ganglia, in terms of sensors and reporting.
Well, If you ask me, I will say: Use Zabbix.  I tried several network monitors in the paste, and choose Zabbix for 3 reasons:
Or, if you would like something even more simple, try the Zabbix virtual appliance which will allow you to play with latest version without risk of breaking something. Once you try out some monitoring options with it, continue with local setup.
