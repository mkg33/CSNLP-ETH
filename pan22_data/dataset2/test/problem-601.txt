If you cannot find the shortcut: the app's default path should be "C:\Program Files\HP\printer name\Bin\".
* This issue has nothing to do with the printers standby mode. The network interface of the printer always stays online to turn it on for printing.

This is for Windows 10.  Open task manager, go to Startup,  scroll down to "scan to pc activation app", right click on Status "enabled", choose "disable", reboot...worked for me.
I have a HP Officejet Pro 8600 and one can disable Scan to Computer in the accompanying app: just click on the printer shortcut that was created during installation, go to Manage Scan to Computer, and then disable the feature and uncheck the Automatically start Scan to Computer when I log on to Windows box (in the picture below, I've already disabled this feature).
My solution for this problem was to turn off my printer and turn it back on again. I had two computers that both said that the scan to computer was no longer activated. After I did that, the two different pages I tried to print were immediately printed from the printer. I think the address changed somehow on the printer and it needed to be rebooted back up for the computers to detect it properly. That is what worked for me.
This feature does not disable scanning from your computer - this works totally fine. It's only purpose is to to send a scanned document directly to the computer where this service is running when you scan at the printer - which is useless for me, personally.
Open Task Manager, go to Startup tab, scroll down to "ScanToPCActivationApp”, expand by double clicking on "ScanToPCActivationApp” or click expansion arrow on left.  Right click first entry, choose “Properties”, click on “Compatibility” tab, under “Compatibility Mode”…select “Run the program in compatibility mode for:”, then choose “Windows 7” in the drop-down menu.  Do this for each of the entries you see for “ScanToPCActivationApp”…even those as “HPNetworkCommunicator”.
