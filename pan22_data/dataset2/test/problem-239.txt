Network devices don't "fight" for their ip address. If your server were assigned a static ip address and another server in the same physical network were assigned the same ip address then there'd be an ip address confict on the network and traffic for that ip address would go to one or the other server, depending on which server answered the ARP query for that ip address, but the servers wouldn't "fight" for the ip address. There's no way for either server to tell the other server to stop using that ip address.
If my host were to ("accidentally") assign my IP to someone else, and that server came online and started fighting with mine for control of the IP, would it look like this?
If the servers were assigned their ip address dynamically (with DHCP) then the provider would be using static reservations in DHCP to make sure that the same ip address is assigned to the same server (based on MAC address) and this scenario wouldn't likely ever occur. If it did occur for some reason then one of the servers would be assigned the ip address and the other server would be assigned a different ip address. The server wanting to use the ip address that has been assigned to the other server would be denied it's request to use the ip address and would be assigned a different ip address or would be assigned no ip address and would assign itself an ip address in the APIPA range, assuming the OS on the server supports APIPA.
My "educated" guess is that the provider had a hardware/network outage, based on what you've said about their own website being down and your being unable to contact them. Don't over think this. The provider had an outage.
