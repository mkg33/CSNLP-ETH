These steps will work in XP and Vista as well (in XP or Windows 2000, just ignore where it says to use an elevated command prompt - as long as you're an administrator it will work)
as already mentioned, FAT32 does not support files bigger then 4GB. Convert your HDD to NTFS or split the file to smaller parts - you can use something like 7Zip or some file splitter. Other solution is to use some video conversion utility like Avidemux and create two separate parts of the video.
The filesystem of the external drive may be FAT32.  (Windows doesn't like to format drives as large as yours as FAT32, but it may have been formatted that way at the factory). The largest size file FAT32 supports is 4GB.  You will need to convert the filesystem to NTFS to support files larger than 4GB.
"The maximum possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GiB minus 1 byte or 4 294 967 295 (232âˆ’1) bytes. Video applications, large databases, and some other software easily exceed this limit. Larger files require another filesystem."
