For users of the Raspberry Pi and possibly certain other Debian-based platforms that experienced this issue in May-June 2019, the problem was that ghostscript and libgs9 were upgraded two or three weeks before the upgraded versions of  cups-browsed, cups-filters, cups-filters-core-drivers, libcupsfilters1, and libfontembed1 were made available in the Raspbian repos.  Running sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade again on or after June 14, 2019 should hopefully fix the problem.
