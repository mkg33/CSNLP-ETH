I am positive there is no power failure when these errors occurs. And since the system keeps working fine once it has been booted, I wouldn't suspect the power supply to be the problem.
After booting windows explorer repeatedly crashes on starting, but once it actually works everything keeps running fine. 
I've had some problems with random BSODs on booting the last couple of days, and i desided to check the error log for problems. I am seeing a massive ammount of errors, and i'd like to know whether they are related, and whether they are hard- or software problems. 
Well those error codes are unusual and possibly incorrect/corrupt. Looking at the errors in question, it looks like your network (wireless?) and video adapter drivers are conflicting. Your best bet is to try to update your network adapterâ€™s driver to the latest version, though your video adapter is more likely to have a newer version.
I was planning to reinstall Windows (7) next week anyway, but i'd like to be sure this is not a hardware related problem.
