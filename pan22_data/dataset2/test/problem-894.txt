is there a way of sharing an ext3/ext4 formatted partition on an external USB drive between different users (uids) on different Linux machines without creating a group for this purpose, setting the group ownership of the partition to this group and adding each respective user to the group on every machine?
And that doesn't solve your problem: security based in external drives permission and uid will be very easily circunvented. For example: I take your drive, mount it in my linux box, where I'm the root. I access everything, read, write...
This would mean that I need to have root privileges on every machine... which I may not have in some cases.
you can observe the groups on the clients machines (cat /etc/groups - no need for root access) and see the group with biggest membership base
I could use a vfat partition but then I have no control of the rw rights + I cannot develop directly in the dir: I would always have to tar.gz the directory, extract, work, tar.gz, copy to the external drive... and so on.
If I understood you right, you know that linux stores the permissions on a UID / GID identification. When you connect it to another computer (I imagine that not in a shared way, but like a Flashdrive that you remove from one computer and connects on another), the linux does the following:
I'm using the partition to store the code I'm developing on Linux and I would like the option to be safe... if possible.
So, as long as you have the same uid and gid in different computers, the ext. drive will be mount with the name = uid relation according to the local linux machine.
