Is HSTS bound to the specific certificate which was used when HSTS was activated or can I just create a new cert for the domain and activate HSTS again via .htaccess?
Whatever your wishes, you can update the header to set your own HSTS policy (use max-age=0 to remove HTTPS enforcement but note this must be set over HTTPS also) and then resubmit your site to the preload list for it to be updated.
Is removing HSTS a usable scenario? I read a lot of posts that removing HSTS isnt possible that easy.
So short answer is that it is possible to remove HSTS, but a) Why would you want to? and b) this will take a while and you will have to support HTTPS in the meantime.
If you remove HTTPS enforcement then unless your site is currently supporting HTTPS then nobody using a preload list supporting browser will be able to connect to it until your entry is updated and that browser version deployed.
I would recommend keeping HTTPS (see here). Therefore you should redirect HTTP to HTTPS and then continue setting the header for all HTTPS responses.
HSTS is tied to the domain (and usually subdomains), not the certificate. includeSubDomains is included in the header if subdomains are included. However, for submission to the preload list this is required, so this will be the case with your domain.
