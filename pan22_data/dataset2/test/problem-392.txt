YES. Just ONE key and ONE value. The value has several formats which address different purpose, such as alias, transport, access, etc. See postfix man pages, especially in Table-driven mechanisms section.
The inline maps will be introduced in postfix version 3.0. Currently there are no postfix stable release that support that table type. You can read it in postfix 3.0 RC1 release notes.
When table has duplicate key, then postfix will choose the value of the first match. In case of hash table, the top entry was chosen, the others value were ignored.
Now, the static maps was different. The table was like wildcard-key table. Postfix may lookup whatever key, but the answer would be static value. For postfix with version lower 3.0, the static table doesn't support value string with space. For postfix 3.0 and later, you may wrap the the value with bracket to add spaces in it. For example
Some table support that list-like string. For example alias table allows you to define multiple alias target for example.
Now, I'll try to answer your question about static and/or inline maps. Please note that these two table types were different of each other.
First, I'll try to clear some confusions here about postfix lookup table based on official documentation. In short, postfix table must be consisted of key-value pair. Both of key-value has string datatype.
