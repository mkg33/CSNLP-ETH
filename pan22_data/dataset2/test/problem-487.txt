If you can't do the copy+restore from backup method Oskar suggested ( and if you don't have backups, shame on you ), then the nature of development systems makes this pretty simple and straight forward.  Simply get your development work to the point where you publish it to the production server, and when development no longer has any delta from production, swap their roles, and then resume development on the other server.
Why don't you use these backups to accomplish this? Restore the two latest backups onto the desired storage array and you are done.
Are you sure you don't have a temporary storage? - I am sure you have backups of your systems. There you have plenty of temporary storage.
The only safe solution is to use additional hardware. Speak to your storage vendor about hiring something to help you get the job done. Trying to do it any other way will end in disaster and you'll be back here asking how to recover...
Without such a hardware device there must be some form of intermediate buffering because the system doing the copying must read from one device before writing it to the other. However, this can be done very fast because the bottleneck is normally the I/O interfaces, not the intermediate system.
Copy the dev data to the prod hardware and then restore the prod data to the dev hardware from backups. Am I missing something?
This really requires a hardware solution. I have a device that takes a pair of SATA drives and duplicates one to the other at the press of a button. No computer required.
