I'm guessing its a problem with Windows Installer. I've tried restarting the service but to no effect. I'm not able to install anything that ends with .msi. Sometimes I get such an error message:

As usual, error messages were only half-useful. In my case, the DLL wasn't missing--the installer didn't have permissions to access the folder. I didn't try running the installer as an administrator--this didn't make sense to me considering I was already using an admin account and would have expected UAC to handle privileges elevation. Anyway, like many things in Windows, this whole thing is a bit of a mystery to me.
I got a couple of links for Windows Installer but neither of them has Windows 7 on the list of supported operating systems.

What I wonder, now, is how this happened in the first place, and what the correct permissions on this directory are supposed to be.
None of these solutions worked for me, however when I went directly to the download folder, right clicked the icon of the install I wanted to perform, and clicked "run as administrator" it installed without any more error messages. 
I tried what Dimadima suggested but I still had a little access issue.  I dug up a tool for Win 7 / Vista called take ownership.  It adds a contextual menu to right click and you can 'Take Ownership'.  I thought to try that it it worked like a charm.

Nevertheless, after going to Properties > Security on the C:\Users\x\AppData\Local\Temp folder and giving that Everyone the Full control permission, installers that previous had been failing now worked! Hooray! Since Everyone already had Read and Write access, I suspect that Full control also added a necessary Execute permission.
I ran into this issue, too. Alexey Ivanov's response didn't quite help me, but it did, however, inspire me to investigate C:\Users\x\AppData\Local\Temp.
