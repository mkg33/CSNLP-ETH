I would place them on the large map background and include their initial movement path on that map. That way I could change the camera path later in a meaningful way instead of needing to change both path and the timing separately.
Then you can visualize the distance from bottom of screen as a vertical line pointing downward from the spawn node (which could be visualied as a greyed out version of the enemy or some such). When the bottom of the screen touches that line it will spawn. This allows you to do all of enemy editing completely in some sort of visual editor, and give you an overview of the entire flow of the game.
I would suggest placing the spawn positions actually ON the background map as nodes that are visible from some sort of map editor. You can represent a shmup spawn with two variables:
I'd go for camera position. Using time will make it rather hard if you want to have an enemy path match up with some graphics in your map file (like enemies following a curved path). Also it allows you to speed up the scroll without changing spawnpoints.
I am also working on a space shooter game. What i did is I used an empty gameobject called GameController. added a script component called GameController.cs which is controlling the spawning part like,
The flipside is that speeding up the scroll will make enemies come faster. Which could be considered a plus (speedup would be difficulty up) or a negative (scroll speed influences pacing).
