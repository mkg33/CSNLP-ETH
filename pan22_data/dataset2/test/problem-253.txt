pfSense can happily shuffle packets at GB speeds on that class of system and have enough power to do say IPSEC without breaking a sweat.  There are loads of add on packages for it as well but frankly the built in functionality is more than enough for most people.  No license fees.
pfSense supports clustering, so run two of them.  For rack mounting - get a cheap pizza box 1U thing from Dell or whoever.
The specific model of router would greatly depend on the throughput needs.  That is to say, if there is to be a large amount of traffic between these networks, you would require a higher end router to handle the traffic volume effectively.
1 router/firewall - that will be a PC class system with a quad port NIC in it to augment the built in NIC.  However if you don't need individual GB connectivity to the remote sites then a single NIC can be used with multiple VLANs (the cheapy switches will support this).  The PC will be running pfSense (free - Open Source - 
If all of these networks are already being brought to a central location via different circuits/cross connects, you could certainly connect them via one router with 5 different ethernet interfaces.
That gives a hefty amount of thoughput, functionality and redundancy.  Halve the price and hardware and still get the job done but without the redundancy.
Did your initial requirements include a cost limit? The device count might seem high, however $1200 is very cheap with regards to network equipment. You could use one device to solve the problem but you will need a device that supports different modules, higher port count, different licenses, etc. The more flexible the network device, the higher the cost. What model/brand of router is used in your solution?  
To get to the heart of your question, a single L3 (layer 3) switch could do what you want and be divided into logical networks via VLANs and the switch will handle the routing between the networks though this is far from an optimal solution.  Each VLAN interface will have an IP address configured which becomes the default gateway for all devices it serves.  Although not recommended for several reasons with security at the top, your Internet connection could even technically connect on the same switch and work, but that's asking for trouble; I'm sure this is why your consultant recommended at least 1 switch and and 1 router so the two are separated.  You really should have a firewall between the two or at least firewalling functionality on your router.
However, several of those networks you reference aren't publicly routable addresses.  You will need to do some form of NAT to reach the internet at least, and possibly your "Atrium (204.10.83.1)" network as well.
Long story short, it could be done with one switch and one router, but there is probably a need for more devices to create the optimal solution.  Without specifics about your business case, throughput needs, etc. it is hard to give a more detailed answer.
The web interface is pretty easy to get around and is no harder than a home router but there is rather more in the box!
3 routers sounds like overkill to me but it would be interesting to see the topology and hear him explain the reason behind it.
Ideally, you would hare pairs routers, firewalls, and switches for redundancy and separation of functions to provide security boundaries.
Two cheapish switches - ie ones that support LAG and STP.  Say a pair of 8 port Netgears GS110s.  They are around Â£65 each.
Something in Cisco's ASR1000 or 3900 product lines might be appropriate here, again depending on your throughput needs.
Depending on your requirements for redundancy and/or loadbalancing a 1921/1941 could be fine for your needs. That would be only one device because it has both routing and switching if you stick a HWIC Etherswitch card in it. 
You would also most likely want a firewall providing NATing/security between your internal networks and the Internet.
The high availability design would be to have two routers and two switches but then the servers should be dually connected as well.
