That's not a small amount of storage. You're talking about at least 10 disks (2 TB drives, RAID 5 + 1 hot spare) and probably 20, maybe more. And you say that it will double over the lifetime of the box. I wont say that you can't find a server to hold all those disks but you will have very few choices and will probably end up with a couple of external drive trays in any case. Rolling your own single server solution for this is certainly possible but you have to ask yourself if you are going to be comfortable with all of that data hanging off something with limited redundancy and minimal support. 
You are correct that iSCSI wont allow you to share between two Windows servers in an Active\Active sense but you could use iSCSI to present the storage to one of the servers and have that server share out the volume(s) so the second server could access them with SMB. You could also opt to just share out directly using SMB - pretty much all NAS boxes will do this too - and just connect both servers that way. 
In terms of your nic choices my answer would be that if the data availability is important you should be considering at least two on the storage server in any case, maybe more with that amount of storage. And at least two per target server, with redundant switches in the mix as well to ensure that you have no single points of failure regardless of the performance requirements. 
You should take a look at pricing for entry level iSCSI SAN\NAS storage systems to get an idea what they will cost and see if they can deliver what you need. At the very least you will get a ballpark number for what a shrink wrapped commercial solution costs.
If you find that you need more performance than single GigE links can provide (ie bandwidth over about 80-100Megabyte/sec or random IOPS (4K blocks) >~8000) be sure to check that whatever solution you do select does actually support some mechanism to make use of multiple nics per connection (multi-pathing/channel bonding/link aggregation etc) that Windows 2008 and your choice of network hardware also support.
