We want to be able to write an HTML email, with images, and send that out to our customers. There's two options for this: Either use a WYSIWYG editor on the website, or use a WYSIWYG editor on their computer, in this case Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word. Due to the complexities involved, we'd much prefer the Word/Acrobat route.
Is there some kind of container file that these programs can save in automatically such that they can save it as HTML, upload this one file, and then we handle it on the other side? Now that I'm writing it I realize the answer is "Zip it" but is there any automatic mechanism for this in either of those programs (or in Microsoft Publisher), or will we have to teach them to do it manually?
Which leaves, saving the document as HTML. And then they have to upload the HTML file and multiple image files.
The general method with HTML email is to include the bare minimum of image content, and link the rest from the web. You do not want to be sending huge multipart emails, especially not to customers. They won't appreciate it. The standard for HTML email is perfectly fine with loading pictures from the web.
So, the next question is, how do we get this online? They could upload a DOC file, which we then somehow convert to HTML; or they could export it to PDF, upload that, and somehow convert to HTML... which based on my research is very difficult.
