The h81 chipset allows the flexible display interface. I tested with the intel g1820 and the msi r5750 and I'm able to run up to 4 independent displays. 
In Asrock UEFI Bios of the h81m-vg4 motherboard there is an option to enable the onboard graphics while you have an additional video card connected:
I saw this done on YouTube.  The guy pressed 'delete' while his machine was booting.  When the bios came up he went to 'video controllers' and re-arranged the order of the bootable graphics He made IGP first then PCIe second instead of the default way of PCI being first.  He explained that by doing it this way the MOBO couldn't disable the IGP and that they both would play.  I tried to do it on my machine but I haven't been able to find the control in order to re-arrange it, so I just had to use two video cards for the four monitors.
If all of a sudden you lose a screen but all hardware tests ok then change your cmos battery and restore the settings. 
In the bios you set primary to pcie and enable onboard video. Also set 'surround view' or similar switch to enable.
Old thread, but I have a Dell Optiplex 390 w/Intel integrated 2000 and am able to select multiple displays in BIOS and run both integrated and graphics card. Always looking for other desktops that have this capability as I am a quad-monitor individual on a dual-monitor budget....
Unfortunately, there's no way around this limitation - using an external card automatically turns off the IGP.
I run 3 amd machines that have onboard and pcie video. All 3 machines have 3 monitors. 1 connected to onboard video (DVI) and 2 connected to the PCIE video card (DVI).
