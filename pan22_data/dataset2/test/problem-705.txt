Is there any good reason why we should be behind a hardware firewall, or is the supplier just trying to upsell us? 
Our application's database doesn't contain confidential personal information, and we're using good password security. We also have backups. 
No, not needed unless it has some sort of DDoS protection with it or your going to be pushing masses of traffic >100MB/s.
Also, while the most expensive such devices can provide the sort of protection afforded by snort, none provide the functionality you can implement in software using fail2ban.
The firewall within Linux should do a good enough job of the security side of things as long as configured correctly.
I'm not saying that your system is secure enough - that's a very different question, but, other than coping with higher traffic volumes and providing better isolation from zero-day packet level attacks (which are very infrequent) it does nothing you shouldn't be able to using iptables / tc / iproute2
Depending on which model your supplier is selling, there may be additional, sometimes proprietary, features you might like. Check the relevant vendor site.
It sounds like you're supplied has failed to provide any valid reason for you to buy such a device (otherwise you would have explained his reasoning?)
Most important perhaps is that it and your server will be dedicated rather than shared. This gives you more freedom to choose maintenance windows (although check with your hosting company as there may be additional charges for exercising that freedom) and from performance issues caused by your neighbours on shared platforms.
As per the title, my software supplier is trying to persuade me to upgrade to a dedicated server with a hardware firewall. (We're currently on a shared Rackspace virtual host, running Ubuntu.)
Assuming you've got a sensible set up for the server's firewall, then there's no justification for using a seperate firewall.
