All-in-all it's just an even better version of Windows Vista. Whether that sounds like something you'd want to spend money on is up to you.
The new taskbar really works quite well. It's easier to see what's running and to find recent documents.
It's basically Vista done right. Not only has the UI been cleaned up and polished in many areas, but it boots faster, is more responsive, and uses much less memory. (Oh, and it takes advantage of multi-core processors better, but I don't know if that applies to you.) On top of that, most drivers are now available through Windows Update, which is really convenient. Also, the media stuff was greatly improved; for example, Windows Media Player 12 supports many codecs such as DivX and AAC right off the bat, and the media sharing feature was improved.
But indeed if you know Vista, Windows 7 isn't a whole lot different, though there is more than meets the eye
The security management is more fine tuned. In Vista I have to use "run as administrator" to execute a batch file that just moves some files, but that's not needed in Windows 7.
The memory usage is smaller. I installed it on a Samsung NC10 mini laptop, I would not even try to install Vista on it.
You can group similar files in different locations into Libraries.  These libraries can also be shared with other computers in your Home Group (simplified file sharing / networking of computer).
Media Center does some basic Transcoding, so you can watch the above video formats on an extender (such as an Xbox 360).
Certain UI bits have been tweaked and fine-tuned making it feel more finished (like the taskbar and network settings)
Benchmarks are showing better performance (though marginal).  However the User Experience has improved in a way that the OS is perceived as being much more responsive than Vista.
I installed Windows 7 RC, but really I just didn't see much difference between it and Vista.  I was an early adopter of Vista and will admit that at first it stepped on a couple of devices due to missing drivers, however besides that it's always been as stable as XP for me.  So really, for those who have been cheering about Windows 7, what's it doing for you?  Why is it better and what do you think will tempt me to upgrade?
In terms of "what's fixed" I would say the user experience. It is a much more pleasant OS to use, it feels responsive.  In terms of what's new, here are some of my favorite features from the Beta/RC:
Aero Peek - mouse over the icon in the task bar and get a list of windows for that application.  Mouse over the application windows and you can peek at the open application (all other windows become transparent outlines)
