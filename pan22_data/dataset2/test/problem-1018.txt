It's probably the battery dying/dead, logic board dying, or it is overheating and shutting itself off to protect the hardware. I would recommend scheduling an appointment at the Genius Bar and having them do some diagnostic tests unless you have a boot disk like TechTool to do it yourself. Also, check the system messages in Console and see if you can find a pattern.
This was a common problem several years ago (see Apple Knowledge base: MacBook (13-inch): Shuts down intermittently and TUAW: An explanation for random MacBook shutdowns? as just two descriptions), but it's supposed to have been fixed. 
I was able to remedy this situation by taking out the battery, plugging in the power and following the instructions to reset the SMC on non-removable batteries (except that I took out my battery anyway). I also immediately reset the PRAM before completely booting again. I reset the SMC again for good measure thereafter. I plugged the battery back in and was able to boot without connecting to external power. I checked the battery condition in the system report and it changed status from "change now" to "good".
A 2008 MacBook will DEFINITELY need a new battery. Here's a link to a tool that will present the battery health information in System Profiler in a bit more of a friendly way (and then add some more info):
Even the best battery in the world will start performing badly after 3 or so odd years, so if it is an original battery it has done very well!!
Personally I'd probably go original Apple battery and enjoy the peace of mind on a machine that old!
Also, you may want to check out NuPower Batteries, which have 50% more capacity than a brand new Apply battery for minimal extra spend.
If you battery health is 'poor' it is a miracle it is running at all. Batteries for that model are designed to last 1000 cycles tops and were warrantied for less than that originally.
I recently bought a battery and the special screwdriver for Apple's stupid screws in the Macbook Air on Amazon. Shortly after changing the battery, my computer behaved strangely by shutting down at random times.
