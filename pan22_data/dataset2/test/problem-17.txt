I found this thread on TechNet and though the problem isn't exactly the same, it's similar and it looks like the clean boot helped fix the problem.
as a note simply disabling the av software did not correct the issue for those people removal was required
Can you still get to the page with another device? Also try looking in C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts. See if 192.168.2.1  links to anything unusual.
If you haven't found a solution for this yet, perhaps you could try out doing a clean boot.  At the very least, this will rule out any rogue services or programs that are starting up, and it's worth a shot.  Is the router's page accessible after running msconfig and disabling all services and startup items?
After some quick googling several people reported that the issue is created by the installed antivirus software blocking http access to local ip's.
I just had a similar issue, and solved it as I realised I had used the guest WPA key on my windows7 computer (as it was freshly in my mind after giving it to someone else) but the origional WPA key was on my windows XP machine. The router will not accept connections to the configuration pages from people on the guest WPA key.
It's unlikely that your config page is 192.168.1.254, but just to say that is what gets up my config page on my BT router.
