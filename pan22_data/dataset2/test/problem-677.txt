We use RackTables to manage where systems are, what their hardware specs are, warranty information, IP address space, and so on.  It's fairly extensible with regard to what kind of data you can stuff in it and track.  Reporting is a little light.
This is more of an internal-process than a process you should be asking a Q&A site. It's just not cut-and-dry. I speak from an accounting/auditing background, not an IT background. 
Inventory management should be integrated with the General Ledger system. Depending on what GL you're using, there should be a module for inventory. 
It's all about cost-benefit and how your computers are valued. We can give specific recommendations all day long, but what you need to know is 
Currently this company has around 70 computers, no general ledger, no list of equipment and half of the computers are field computers that are not part of the domain. For now there is little to no budget until I can stress the importance of it enough to earn it value in the eyes of management. 
If, however, you're saying that computer inventory is a non-asset, or expensed, then there should be a system for tracking computer/software issues, and there should be an inventory module from that. 
I wondering what programs or systems everyone is using to keep track of their computers at their company. Spiceworks seems like complete overkill for something as simple as saying Joe is using Laptop #45234
If you have a small company that doesn't need some complex system, then have an IT clerk keep an excel spreadsheet.
