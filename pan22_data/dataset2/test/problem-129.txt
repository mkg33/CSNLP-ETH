You can go for website monitoring Service. I recommend http://100pulse.com to monitoring your website. Because they provide instant alert through email, sms, rss feed, twitter, gadget. Also their summary reports helps our website or service's performance at all the time. I terms of cost they provide both free as well as paid...
there are also alternative open source solutions like zabbix. i used nagios in setup with 80 servers and with over 1000 monitored services, but there are people that successfully run it at much smaller and bigger scales [ eg at goldman sachs ].
nagios is first thing that comes into my mind. with tones of plugins you can monitor really a lot. depending on type of your service you might want to run nagios both externally [ just to check http responses - you can do it on some VPS ] and internally [ to monitor all the plumbing, databases, que sizes and whatever else you have up there ]. you can use some paid sms service to send alerts on your mobiles or if mails are enough - just send them.
