This may not be quite what you had in mind, but there are known restrictions on how many graphs on $n$ vertices there can be in a hereditary class of graphs. For example, there is no hereditary class of graphs that has between $2^{\Omega(n)}$ and $2^{o(n\log{n})}$ graphs on $n$ vertices.
Suresh's answer about the AKR conjecture got me thinking about the same conjecture for hereditary properties. I think (unless I've made a mistake) I can show that all non-trivial hereditary properties have (randomized and deterministic) decision tree complexity $\Theta(n^2)$, which settles the AKR conjecture for such properties (up to constants).
This is the "reverse" direction, but the well known Aanderaa-Rosenberg-Karp conjecture applies to graph properties that are monotone upwards (i.e if G satisfies the property, then so does any graph on the same nodes whose edge set contains E(G)). 
Classes of graphs that exclude a minor have nice properties that do not depend on the specific excluded minor.  Martin Grohe showed that for graph classes excluding a minor there is a polynomial algorithm for isomorphism, and fixed-point logic with counting captures polynomial time for these graph classes.  (Grohe,   Fixed-Point Definability and Polynomial Time on Graphs with Excluded Minors, LICS, 2010.)  These can be thought of as "global" properties.

I tried to search the literature to see if this has been shown somewhere, but I couldn't find a reference. So either I couldn't find it but it exists, or the theorem is uninteresting, or I've made an error.
A hereditary class of structures (e.g. graphs) is one that is closed under induced substructures, or equivalently, is closed under vertex removal.
According to the Erdős–Hajnal conjecture, every hereditary family has the property that the graphs in it either have cliques or independent sets of polynomial size (that is, $\Omega(n^c)$ for some $c>0$ that depends on the family but not on the graph). This is in contrast to random graphs, where the largest clique and the largest independent set are both logarithmic.
