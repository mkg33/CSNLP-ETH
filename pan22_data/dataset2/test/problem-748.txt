Normally I'd ssh into bravo, then sudo to delta, but I'm wondering if there's any way that I can do that when I've got charlie's home dir mounted via ssh.
For example: You can use this method to mount any other user directory to your, for example files from /var/www into ~/www and remap root into your user so you will have full access to it.
I don't understand sshfs very well, so you might be able to get something like that to work, but I couldn't say how, and I would be a little surprised.
Another possibility is to put the command 'sudo /bin/su bravo' in ~/.ssh/rc, but that would affect all of your fs mountings (assuming it worked, which I also doubt) as well as your normal use of ssh.
However, on host bravo there is another user, delta, that I want to sudo /bin/su as, so that I can do work in bravo:/home/delta. delta may not be logged into via ssh; for reasons which I cannot change, you can only sudo over to delta once you're on the machine.
If you need access to preserve uid or have access to multiple users then i would create a new user for example "rootfs" with uid=0 and /bin/false and do a normal sshfs.
