If you are making a commercial product, or want your design to be slightly better, you'll choose pull-ups with a grounding switch for the following practical reasons:
I don't think there is a reason to prefer one over the other on the RPi. Most people are probably just copying or porting circuits they have seen elsewhere.
When connecting up the circuit (with wires or PCB) it's fine to just pick whichever is more convenient and translate it to the right meaning in your software.
Connecting the pin to ground with an internal pullup resistor means you use less parts.  All you need is a button; don't need an external resistor to limit current.
However these reasons are not particularly relevant to the hobby use of the Raspberry Pi. Use whatever makes sense to you.
There are complex historical reasons why electrical engineers typically pulled inputs high with resistors, and used switches to ground them.
In the old days of TTL it took far more current to pull a pin low than to pull it high. So a pullup resistor could be higher resistance (and hence less power-wasting) than a pulldown resistor. It doesn't matter with modern CMOS but old habits die hard.
