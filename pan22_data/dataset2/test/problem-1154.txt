Don't be anal about this. Track your work, summarise the work and the results of that work in plain English. Whenever you save money (compared to some alternative) or provide support to a revenue-earning activity, give that activity special notice. Things like "saved $x by configuring BIND on Internet-facing server" and "provided Widget application transaction volumes and average transaction times to sales team who won the Acme account".
Track your time for a a few weeks in detail. I was in the same boat. There's a Adobe Air app called Klok that makes it a bit easier to track and report once its setup. Track everything in minute detail, if you spend 30 mins in the morning reading overnight email alerts track it, on the flip side if your spend 2 hours a day getting coffee you need to know for your own info. 
It ended up that I quit and started my own company, though, because (for a variety of reasons) my boss wasn't reasonable. That might not be for everybody, but it's suited me fine. >smile<
In the world of business doing a good job technically, is not enough. You need to learn how to communicate what you have done and relate it to the health of the business. If you can't do that, then you may find yourself out of a job. That hurts you, and it could hurt your former colleagues if your job really was important to the business.
To my mind, there's no simple answer. I think that employees should have a clear "value proposition", and while I don't think that an employee should spend a large fraction of their time describing that value, I don't think it's unreasonable for an employee (or their manager) to spend some time defining it.
First of all, do not swamp your boss in piles of details about every little thing that you do. It is a good idea to track all of that for your own personal information, but the boss should only be presented with summaries such as "resolved 18 logging issues".
I had a boss that was a bit this way. I kept a log of my activities (and the time associated) such that over 90% of my work day, each day, was accounted for. (I'm a combination of irritating jerk and overly literal, so I actually got that number over 95% for awhile.) I kept this up for a period of time, and met with him to discuss it. (Since I was a billable resource as well as being the in-house network administrator some large fraction of my time, which was billable, was already documented this way anyway.)
First find out what your boss thinks your job's responsibilities are and what the job  entails.  If those things are being done I'd ask him which part he's unsatisfied with.  If the answer is none it's time to start looking for a new gig.  Life's far too short, and if you are looking here, you're far too bright to waste any time trying to "prove" you're not wasting time.  No amount of effort will ever convince someone with their outlook that you are working, or there really isn't any business value in the things that you do.  It would be one thing if you are on a contract and, since you are paid by the hour, asked to justify each hour.  A regular employee is employed becaue someone thinks there is a regular task(s) that has to be completed.  If that doesn't provide enough value then it's pretty tough to justify no matter how good you are at it.
If your bosses are rational, I would think that the time and activity logs (which you really should be producing anyway and entering into whatever change control system you use) should be enough to justify your existence. 
You should try to have a face-to-face private meeting with your boss every month to review your job description, your planned activities (at a high level) and your personal development (training courses, reading books, reviewing serverfault postings for good ideas). If you do that, your boss will know what you do, your job description and planned activities will get his support. Also, if he decides that task X is not important, then when all hell breaks loose and you fix it, he will be happy, and probably praise your effort to senior management. You shouldn't tell anyone that the boss essentially created the issue in the first place, because this is common practice in office politics. In fact, the boss may have pushed down the priority of that task because he WANTED all hell to break loose, because he trusts you to fix it promptly, and because senior management is asking him why they should not fire him and his whole department.
I would say do nothing. This boss sounds like he's shirking the key management responsibility of knowing what's going on, so the effort isn't worth it. Be happy you're doing the right thing, that's the most important view.
Had my boss been reasonable, I think that would've probably been enough. I would've updated the documentation on a recurring basis so that he had some idea of what I spent my time doing. For items that were a direct response to an issue, I logged my times and activities as I always did. For more "soft" items like training, conversations with co-workers, etc, I probably would have only revisited that time accounting once a quarter and produced some kind of "at a glance" view of how I spent my average day.
