i checked and noticed that my bios is indeed old but i cant update it to latest version because the bios update application reports an error due to running in non-uefi mode.
If you use you laptop with a second monitor/docking station which only supports 1366x768 and is set as the primary monitor, this will most likely cause your problem. 
i dont wanna update my bios because that will require me to re-install the OS in uefi mode. whats worse is that even after reinstalling OS in uefi mode and updating the bios, the resolution still remains stuck at 1366x768.
I have updated my graphics drivers to latest version via windows update but i still get the lower resultion. i even tried installing latest and up-to-date drivers from vendors(intel) website but did not see any change.
so what i understand now is that either my correct product specs are not listed on the above link or i have an old bios.
