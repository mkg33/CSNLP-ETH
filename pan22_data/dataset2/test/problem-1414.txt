What is the proper way to do that? I feel like I am missing something about the work flow of attributes. As far as I see, using data bags will not solve the problem. Is there some way to assign "attribute" only to a specific node? Can I assign an attribute only to a given node?
And then I upload this to chef-server and run recipe on a node that is using this attributes. But if the other person wants to deploy the same software using this cookbook on some  other node, then he needs to wait until I finish because if he will replace those values in attributes.rb with values of second node and upload it to chef-server then it will overwrite values that I need right now.
I have a cookbook that is being used to deploy some software on a chef nodes. I use it when bootstraping a node and then remove it from the run_list since I need it only to run once. I don't know if it's proper to do thing like that in Chef or if it's an antipattern. But this cookbook needs to have some variables that change on every node. Let's say that it needs to know the name of the main network interface of that node and I need to provide to it some kind of license number. I do that by using attributes, I specify in attributes/default.rb:
