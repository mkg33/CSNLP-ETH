I am running a simulation study where I am using two-part hurdle modeling on different effect sizes. I tried to stream-line my code for the best optimization including foreach loops and parallelization. I attempted to post here prematurely a few weeks ago and am now posting my updated code.
A couple of style / minor performance improvement comments. I believe it will take someone with statistical knowledge of the model you are using to help you more:
Please tear me apart as I love to learn and am relying on your wisdom. Also, realize I am fairly new to R/Programming.
Any feedback on optimization would be ideal as I am running 1000 resamples and 1000 bootstraps. For 50 iterations and 50 bootstraps, it took 7 minutes. For 500 and 500, it took around 3.5 hours. 
I keep running into an error where the hessian matrix is singular that stopped the loops.  I continued the loops and logged the errors (any advice on this would be great). I recognize this is a statistical problem, but often others know more than I.
