Their service is very complete, missing only the feature of auto-expiring aliases, which I don't need.
I faced a similar problem and used Google Apps Script for Gmail to fix it. I augmented Pascal Richter's script. For the script to work, I made a new Gmail account, set up a filter called 'Pics' that grabs every email with an attachment. The script checks the Label every minute and forwards all of the messages to Tumblr. To get it to work for you, you'll have to:
I've figured out a way to do it via IFTTT & Gmail, visit the App at the following URL: https://ifttt.com/applets/JDHcT76p-automatically-forward-all-emails-from-a-specific-email-address-hide-original-sender-s-email . 
In case anyone is still looking for an answer to this I looked everywhere and couldn't find a solution that didn't involve running Microsoft Outlook & leaving your computer on 24/7.
You're good to go, it hides the original senders email address & shows your email, the same subject & body message. 
I used a free account for a couple of months, and was so satisfied that I paid the $10 yearly subscription. 
The advantage in that kind of service is that I'm less exposed to spam, and when I do receive an  unsolicited email I know exactly who is to blame.
I think you need to use something like procmail for this. I doubt you can do it with any free webmail client.
I use E4ward for that purpose. E4ward allocates aliases, which look like alias@username.e4ward.com. I give out these aliases, and E4ward forwards emails sent to them to my real email address, but with a tricked return address that I can use to respond such that my answer would seem to come from the alias.
