First of the 1000ft Cat5E is to long.. it's about 3times the Max lentgh(https://www.google.nl/?q=100m+%3D+ft). So place a bridge or repeater/another switch every 100M(328ft). Or you should take a look @ Fiber optics.
So next up are the Wireless Access points with clients. That could work if you have the capable hardware. This depends on what bitrate you are streaming the HD Video. looking at the AC specification i don't think that will become a problem(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac) unless the distance/interference is so big your transfer speed gets cut down. Sidenote: the AC specification say's it uses the 5Ghz band, that inturn has less problem's with interference but distance is more the factor here. So i would suggest a test with a simple client and access point to get some readouts on the bandwidth available at those distances.
So lets say you did all that and still haven't found a problem. Well where is the server ? A C75 need a server if i'm reading the website right.. It needs resources from a server to operate ? Is that also on the "HD Streaming Host" ? if so you need to find out how much bandwidth that requires..
So lets say you went with fiber. Its expensive but will give you the length needed without any issue.
