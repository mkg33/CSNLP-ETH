I've supported users with both CentOS and Ubuntu for x64 scientific workstations. CentOS was slightly easier to get working (some commercial software gives all documentation presuming it's running on Red Hat). Ubuntu was a much more pleasant desktop OS. Both were perfectly reliable/stable.
Overall answer: Each OS + Hardware platform has its strengths and weaknesses. Use the tool that works best for the task at hand.  Spend time evaluating each platform and give it a non-biased hit list of "must haves".  A clear winner will emerge.
I'm running windows server 2008 64, but all open-source stuff (mysql, ruby, python, R) is either not that well-tested or has problems. And of course, if you have to compile packages, you are on your own.
If you know Linux go with your Favorite distro; if you don't know Linux then Ubuntu is a nice easy starter distro but the hassles of learning a new OS may outweigh the benefits you gain.
I guess it's obvious that FOSS will run better on linux; maybe OSX too. But there are wide differences in terms of distros. Which one has the best reputation for x64? This is for a desktop use (doing scientific simulation, needs lots of ram).
