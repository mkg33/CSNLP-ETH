You should really run the same version of STP on all the switches. That means converting the Cisco switches to the same STP version as the other switches. Cisco has many documents about PVST and MST interactions if you search for them, and there is this one: Configuration example to migrate Spanning Tree from PVST+ to MST
Unless you are using VTP (assuming you are not since you have a mixed environment), multiple VLANS won't be propagated automatically across trunk links unless you have specifically manually created each vlan on each switch and allowed it to be propagated on each trunk interface (by default Cisco allows all vlans). I'm assuming you have already done this, but just wanted to mention it. In regards to the native vlan 1 connectivity between each switch, those should by default be carried across your dot1q interfaces. In regards to your ping not working from A to B,do you have any vrf's on switch A? If so you will need to make sure you source from the correct VRF when pinging. If there are spanning tree issues, loops, or native vlan mismatches etc, you'll be able to see evidence and clues of this by turning on terminal monitor from your telnet or ssh session on your Cisco switches. If you are already directly consoled to the Cisco switches you won't need to do this, and you should see live logging messages with any stp errors. You can also do show logging, to see past stp error logs. Ron's advice to have same version of STP on all switches is excellent, and will also help to simplify things removing chance of further possible STP complexities/anomalies.
So it's a common issue with Fiber, especially between switches. What it sounds like you need to do is what I've heard referred to as, "roll the fiber". Basically on one end of the Fiber cable, swap them around. Think of cross over cable regarding copper/Ethernet. 
If possible, connect/link the switches in a hub and spoke fashion rather than a ring fashion.  Each uplink should be configured as a trunk.  Be sure the trunk type (802.1q probably) is the same on both ends.
If you have multiple VLANs, which it sounds like you do, route between them on your core/hub device.
