I have a simple script on each of my servers that emails me when the server has rebooted. It's a batch file using blat on Windows, perl scripts on Mac and Linux. They are triggered by whatever means is appropriate to the OS. e.g. a Machine startup script on Window.
Doesn't time out, I'm afraid. But that could be easily added, along with a quick beep on successful response.
In the alternative, I strongly suggest you use choline daily as your mind is frying at a relatively young age.
OK, I don't know of anything that will call your cell phone, but if you open a command box, and do "ping -t" minus the quotes, it will keep pinging...not just the 4 times. It is hard to ignore that in the middle of your screen when you get back.
this is a quick way to see what users are connected to a server, this particular syntax would looks specifically for the RDP listen session on that server, once that visible it should be possible to logon, i use the command slightly differently in a script that actually crawls around 60 servers, and identifies where on the network a user is logged in.
The bit I'm more happy with (taken from a currently unremembered source on the internet) is that this won't try and connect when the server comes responds to ping - instead, only when the standard RDP port is accessible.
