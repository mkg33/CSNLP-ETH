I've never had this problem until now. I've always used internal storage and a 1TB NTFS external from ye olde days. Any links to more useful resources would be very appreciated.
NTFS is trustworthy and equally mature with XFS. I'm familiar with it, having been a Windows user up to and including 7. The main flaw with using NTFS is that there's much lower performance (~10-20M/s) on Linux (at least on my PC, I don't have Windows any more).
XFS looks good and I've taken it for a spin and it isn't quite as hyperactive as EXT4. This is good but I really don't know much about this FS other than NASA trusts it, it's 23 years of evolution and apparently very stable these days.
I have a partition >2TiB on an external HDD and run on Debian mainly, with a few experiments here and there (and the intent on joining the FreeBSD Master Race when I have enough time to actually dig into a whole new OS).
EXT4 is a great FS, but when I format my partition to EXT4 it never seems to stop with activity. Strange since my internal HDD is only EXT4 partitions and there is not constant activity.
Preamble: Most questions relating to this topic are outdated by 5 or more years. Much has changed since then so far as filesystems go.
