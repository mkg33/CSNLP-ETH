This seems to be a LibreOffice specific thing. I reinstalled LibreOffice and voila! all the applications were available in the "Open with" list and it is now easy to associate file extensions.
After installing LibreOffice and then unistalling OpenOffice, all the files for the many office document types (odt, ods, doc, xls, rtf and a dozen more) are unassociated with any application. When I try to associate the file with an application the short way (right click > open > select the program from a list), none of the LibreOffice applications show up in the list. If I click the Browse button and pick the executable in the LibreOffice 3 folder, the program is not added to the list so that I can select it.
You could try a utility like Default Programs Editor to do this. Go in to 'File Type Settings', then 'Change Open With Programs'. Select the file type to change, then add/remove the applications you want
Thanks for everyone who offered general help. If I suspected an incomplete installation of LireOffice in the first place I would not have asked the question so generally. Maybe this case can help someone else who have this kind of trouble after installing LibreOffice before uninstalling OpenOffice.
This leaves me to have to associate all the file types the long way (windows explorer > tools > folder options > file types etc.. )
On my system previously had uninstalled open office then install LibreOffice and got same problem, used regedit to search for swriter.exe, found open office uninstall did not delete all its registry entries leaving HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\swriter.exe\shell\open\command value as "C:\Program FilesOpenOffice\program\swriter.exe" replaced that with "C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 4\program\swriter.exe" and other LibreOffice exe's and file explorer open with browse works to associate "C:\Program Files\LibreOffice 4\program\swriter.exe" with documents
Is there a way to "register" an application so that it is available for selecting from the "Open with" application list in Windows XP?
