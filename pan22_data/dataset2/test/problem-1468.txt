However sometimes we must send out 200K+ newsletters- in this case, the IIS6 queue quickly fills up and we are unable to shift them quickly enough. Sending 200K emails may take many many hours, during which time the server is using roughly 2.7mb of the 3mb upload bandwidth we have access to.
I was hoping someone could offer some tips on optimizing IIS 6 for a situation like this, esspecially on some of the server properties such as "limit number of messages per connection" (currently set at 200), "limit number of connections to" (currently at 1000), and "limit number of connections per domain to" (currently set at 100).
Use a SMTP relay service for sending bulk email.  Port25.com is good.  Mailchimp offers mailing-list management software, and is even better.  There's a developer API, so you can tie it into your existing services and user databases.
Ok, here we go. That is quite ok. Seriously - what do you expect? You have 90% bandwidth utilization which I would say is already very good - there is always going to be some waiting going on. You could try sending more parllel messages (limit number of connections) but at the end I think you already are on a sturation point.
Im currently working on a system that sends out a large number of monthly newsletters to subscribed users and customers (please note, this is not spam). We send these emails using IIS 6 virtual SMTP server and for the most part, it works well. 
Sending newsletters from your primary mailserver can be a VERY bad idea.  Here's a few reasons why.
