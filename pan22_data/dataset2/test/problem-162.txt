I wrote a hook script for the letsencrypt.sh client that allows you to use Lets Encrypt DNS verification for DNS providers that don't provide an api to use (aka, manual entry and verification is required). 
You can follow the progress at this PR. Alternatively, there are some clients that already support it.
After trying different combinations, this is what worked for me using dehydrated and letsencrypt-manual-hook git repositories. If the below steps works for you, don't forget to star these repositories
You will get a hash (after running the above command), create a TXT record in your DNS. Make sure it works by either running the below command or GSuite Toolbox
Now, press enter at the prompt. This did not work for me although the TXT record was updated. I had to press Ctrl+C and run the command again.

Hugo Landau wrote an ACME client in Go (https://github.com/hlandau/acme) that supports DNS challenges (with BIND's nsupdate protocol). It's been working flawlessly for me for at least 18 months.
provided your dns server is properly configured to allow dynamic dns updates (RFC2136). Using a TSIG Key is strongly advisabe but if you choose to make no use of it just cut the -k $KEYFILE option when invoking nsupdate.
