I also wish to know if I go for Master-Slave replication will my Slave work as it is working currently or will there be limitations on operations that can be performed on Slave server. I read on some forum that Slave is able to perform only Read operations, so I wish to know if I go Master-Slave will I be able to use existing databases on Server 2(Slave).
There are lots of good articles on the internet and a few good books on the topic (although not much yet available on semi-synchronous replication). 
You seem a bit confused about MySQL replication modes. They are all Master/Master or Master/Slave. The first choice to make is whether you want to use asynchronous, semi-synchronous or synchronous replication. The former is available on all platforms out-of-the-box, but does have technical limitations. The latter needs additional components. How you then designate nodes within the cluster is a secondary question. A full discussion of these goes way beyond the scope of an answer here (but I suspect that you should probably try asynchronous master/master).
I have two servers consider server 1 and server 2. There are many databases on server 1 and few active databases on server 2 as well.
Can I setup MySQL replication of server 1 and server 2. If yes, what type of replication is suggested Master-Master or Master-Slave.
