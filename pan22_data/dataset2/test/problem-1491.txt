Under either connection, is the time between keystrike to character appearing long enough to be perceptible?
Do USB or PS/2 keyboards respond faster in terms of end-to-end input latency, keystrike to character appearing on the screen?
First,it will give you total freedom with no limit to the amount of simultaneous key presses. And, equally as important, using the PS/2 may just improve your overall gaming experience. The reason is that when you use a USB keyboard your computer is actually using CPU time polling your keyboard. The higher the polling rate the more CPU time is used to perform the polling. And because of the built-in debounce rate found on any quality keyboard, any polling rate above 200Hz is simply a waste of CPU time and really just a result of pointless marketing hype. Unlike USB keyboards a PS/2 keyboard isnâ€™t polled at all. The keyboard simply sends a signal to the computer as key presses are made, which causes a hardware interrupt, forcing the CPU to register the signal. 
I didn't see it mentioned anywhere on here, and although old, this post is still returned via a simple Google search -- so not only is the response time faster but PS/2 keyboards support unlimited roll-over, meaning you can press as many keys as you wish at once and they will all register. USB maxes out at 6, I believe. As a programmer, I don't often run into this issue, but for gamers, this means everything!
Under either connection, is it possible to strike two keys in succession faster than the single-key input lag?
Apparently, PS/2 is faster. If you buy a $150 keyboard like this one designed for professional gamers, the standard interface is PS/2. It has some super fancy, gold-plated, buffered PS/2 technology, although a USB-to-adapter is included.
