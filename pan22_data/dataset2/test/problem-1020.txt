I have created a Elastic Beanstalk environment and I have a rails app running which is great.  However I am unable to assign is to the default security group.

If you use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) with Elastic Beanstalk so that your instances are launched within a virtual private cloud (VPC), specify security group IDs instead of security group names.
Go to the Amazon Console, select EC2. Select your instance. Right-click and select "Networking / Change Security Groups".
