However its not working and the local administrator account name isn’t changing to my requirement.  When I run GPresult /r it confirms my GPO has run at OU level and the Default Domain Policy hasn’t run, but it still shows the admin account with the incorrect username for the DCs that are in the Domain Controller OU.
I have renamed the Administrator username at the Default Domain Policy, therefore this applies to the whole Domain.  This policy is set in Windows Settings/Security Settings/Local Policies/Security Options/Accounts/Rename administrator account.
Is there are way I can run the Domain Controller OU GPO to override the Default Domain Policy, I also have the Domain Controller Policy as Enforced and in link order 1.
I have created a GPO with the settings in Windows Settings/Security Settings/Local Policies/Security Options/Accounts/Rename administrator account, I have set the required username.  I have linked the GPO to the Default Domain Controllers OU and disabled inheritance, so that I don’t pickup the local Domain Policy.
What I want to do is set an different username for the Default Domain Controllers OU.  There I want all our DCs to have a different username to the Computers and Servers which fall under the Default Domain Policy.
