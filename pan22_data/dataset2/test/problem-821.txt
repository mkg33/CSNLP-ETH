is a value of the oracle datatype DATE. This type contains date and time. If you want to display this value to a user you must convert it to a string. This conversion can be done by an application or you can let oracle convert it to a string type as it is done in this example. This automatic conversion to the oracle stringtype VARCHAR2 is controlled by nls_date_format and some server settings. If you want your view to return a VARCHAR2 value with the calculated date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS' and not a DATE value you can do this by using a conversion function: expression
Best practice is to avoid Non-SQL function calls inside SQL queries as the function may not be universally available -- in my system there is no numtodsinterval function -- also because of the additional overhead to switch context from SQL to PL/SQL and then back to SQL for every row returned or tested if the function is called in the where clause.
Note that the result is an Oracle DATE value which contains also the TIME.  If it does not appear to have TIME when you run the query, then the problem is in your NLS_DATE_FORMAT or your UI's implementation of converting dates to strings.  Be sure to do TO_CHAR yourself with the time portion in the format string in order to see the whole value.
