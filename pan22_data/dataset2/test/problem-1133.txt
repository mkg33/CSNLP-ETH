I have often found that if you plug in the cable modem and give it a minute or so to fully boot and get the necessary IP info, then power up the router, things go more smoothly.  However, that experience has all been with Rogers in Canada
I've gone through various combinations of cable modems, routers, computers, and apartments in my life, and one thing has always puzzled me. Why is it so difficult to get these things to connect to the internet? Once I'm connected, they work great, but establishing the initial connection is always painful.
For me, when ever my internet goes down (most likley due to my el-cheapo router) I simply unplug everything, wait a minute, plug in in my router, wait for it to initialize, plug in in my cable modem, walk to my computer, and go to google. This has worked on two networks, one with 3 computers over wireless and wired, and another with 7 devices over wireless and wired and a vonage middleman device. 
If a vanilla config is not what you want (you want DHCP, your home LAN is on 10.0.0.x addresses, you want the router to establish PPP automatically, integrate an access point, switch ports, VLANS, etc, etc), you are into network design already.
So, if your computer is connected to your PC, you will need to reset your cable modem if you connect it the router. Over and over..
If you have a 0.0.0.0 issue, have you even tried checking the drivers/settings on the computer? Are you waiting for the router to fully initialize? Are you waiting for even the connection phase to finish? Is this reproducible with other routers (borrow one if you have to)? 
I dread the days when I need to unplug my modem or router, because it usually results in something like this:
if you want a standard service with pre-configured router, my experience is that they work pretty well, with the drawback that they offer limited functionality ... just enough to google.
I've been working for an ISP as a second level IT and we were using DOCSIS cable modem and it was hard for customers to have it done with a router but when it's done, it's fun! ;)
A systematic approach is needed here. Make a design drawing and consult the router's manaual to see what elements / services need to be configured. Search for default config files of service providers offering the same router model
You can read a bit more about DOCSIS but it's not related to your issue. Just follow a simple procedure to reset it and it should work.
Why is this? Is this an inherently difficult problem? Is there a foolproof technique that I'm not aware of?
It might be due to DOCSIS specifications. DOCSIS cable (Videotron ISP) must be reseted everytime the cable modem sees another MAC address attached to it. 
For some providers a reset to "factory defaults" will not reset a router to the vanilla-config provided with the service which can be a pain and some 20-hours debugging sessions with the helpdesks.
