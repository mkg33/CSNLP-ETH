If I'm expected to be on-site in five minutes, keeping a constant watch on systems (despite having alarmsystems), I'd most likely shoot for 200-300% daily salary, with a one week rotation.
For the above, I can reasonably expected to be allowed to drink a beer or two, with a on-site time of an hour or two. I.e., be allowed to have a social life.
This can vary widely between employers and environments.  Where I'm currently at, we're expected to be on call, but only when it is our turn in the rotation.  Our work schedule is pretty flexible, so if you're up late the night before because of an issue, you can usually come in late the next day or even work from home.  I agree with Kara Marfia that this is something that needs to be agreed upon in advance, and that things should be spelled out pretty plainly, both what they expect and what you expect.
One thing that's important to take into account is "on call" v.s. "state of readiness" (call 'em what you will) when considering just compensation.
The proactive thing to do would be to investigate and clean up whatever went wrong, write up the incident report, plan a look-over on the remaining servers, order new hardware etc.
The reactionary thing to do would be to investigate and clean up whatever went wrong, as well as write up an incident report.
I generally know my systems well enough that problems don't occur, so I'm happy with 10-20% pager bonus, but on the occasions an issue does occur, I want fair compensation i.e., per-ticket compensation.
How much that compensation is is up to you and your boss, obviously, but a few of the "soft" parts of the package I like to include are:
In my current role I am the entire IT "department". I am not on call. Nor am I expected to provide 24x7 service. However, In the event my services are required out of hours I expect to have to do whatever is needed and this has been factored into my salary. Fortunately, most issues are solved with a phone call or a few minutes connected via the VPN, which is handy because it's a minimum of an hour's drive to the office. There will always be some work that must be performed out of hours (maybe two or three days a year) and for that I receive time off in compensation.
A quick example would be noticing that a server had a disk fill up overnight (possibly despite having been 30% free the evening before).
* Flex time (while it's true that I'd be compensated for any issues, getting in at 8am or 9am after staying up until 4am is hardly productive).
One thing that makes our system a bit better is that we have a Network Operations Center that is staffed with pretty bright people.  They can usually resolve issues that are well-documented without needing to page or call.
For me, I feel an added 10-20% salary is fine if I'm expected to carry the pager and handle/redirect any incoming issues.
Even if it just looks like a one-time issue, other people on your team may very well have useful input, and the review process itself (no, not just a incident report, but an actual honest-to-god face-to-face meeting with your team and your boss) will help you stay proactive rather than reactionary.
As everyone else has already said - it depends. If it's part of the job, and stated up-front, you have nothing to quibble about.
As far as I'm concerned, if you're on call and must be available (which interferes with your "off" time), you should be paid full hourly rate for every hour you are on call.  It is so disruptive to your personal life that you should be compensated for contributing to the business and this should be considered overtime.  Employers are taking advantage of people and trying to force us all into a 24/7 society and unless the government labor laws protect us, we can only fight for our rights.  
IMO, in a larger environment it should be a combination of off-shift staff (typcially entry-level), paid oncall for most technical staff and unpaid oncall for senior technical staff.
It can be difficult to get the second version approved, and so my favorite is a bit of a hybrid system.
