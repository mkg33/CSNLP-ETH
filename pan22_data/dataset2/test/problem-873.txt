My Macbook Pro, however, sleeps every time I shut the lid and wakes every time I open it... reliably.  I never shut it down or reboot it unless an update requires it.  It's one of the features I like most about Macs.  I don't even worry about the battery running out, because if it gets that low (reserve power), the Mac is smart enough to save the system state and power itself off so next time you plug it in, you're back where you left off.
However, I know others who rarely use the laptop so they hibernate instead of sleep. For them, the laptop is used maybe once every couple of weeks. 
Most people I know using modern laptops use sleep as the most common method of leaving the machine. For laptops I have had, I always let it sleep overnight or even over the weekend. From a max battery, it may last several days.
Throwing laptop to sleep is very easy to get used to and I don't even recall when last actual reset occurred on my computer.
Regarding how much battery it would consume varies based on processor, motherboard, and additional onboard components. As far as a "recommended time", it is a personal decision and up to you and your environment. I have my sleep disabled. I occasionally force it to sleep when I want to for extended periods of time (30mins or more), but it's usually always on except for the trip to/from work, so i just shut down. vista performs better that way anyway.
I leave laptop regularly at sleep overnight. Consumption is low enough to last for more than a week on my model.
Depends on the system.  I never had luck with Windows laptops going to sleep and waking up reliably.  The best alternative to shutting it down was hibernate.  This is almost always because of poorly written drivers.
I would not put a laptop to sleep overnight.  If you really want to keep it "running", look for a hibernate option instead.  But the best thing to do is save your work and shutdown.  Laptops really aren't intended to be left on all the time.
While consumption does depend on motherboard and other components, you should be able to get few days of sleep without problems.
