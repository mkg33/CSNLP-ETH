First, don't use the Ubuntu packages - you will end up with an old version, in some cases very old (I have seen 1.2, 1.6 etc.).  Use the 10gen packages, as of writing this you should get 2.0.4
I replaced the mongodb-10gen install with the Ubuntu package (mongodb-server, mongodb-client and dev). 
Next, the HTTP interface defaults to +1000 from whatever your defined MongoDB port is, so if you were expecting it on 27018 then you would have had to set your MongoDB port to 26018.  That seems like an odd choice.  If you left the port settings as the defaults, then your normal port would be 27017 and the HTTP REST interface would be 28017 - have you mixed them up perhaps?
I have searched for days, and there doesn't seem to be anything on the Mongo site about a similar anomaly. If you have encountered a similar issue on Ubuntu Oneiric, please add your comments, even if you haven't found a solution to this issue. 
That will get you a list of all the open listening ports and their owning processes, add another pipe and grep for mongod to narrow it down even further.
