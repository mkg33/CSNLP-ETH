The higher voltage means that the battery can maintain the minimum voltage required to operate the computer for a longer period of time, hence extending battery life.  The actual voltage used by the computer is electronically regulated, so this cannot cause any damage to the computer.
Now, my question is, how does voltage affect battery life? If we assume the needed power draw to be constant, a higher voltage would indicate less amperage needed, therefore the battery would last longer before running out, yes? Or am I missing something?
Laptop contains couple of switch mode regulators. It does not matter what voltage is available from battery, high voltage and low current equals low voltage and high current. Power in watts is still same. 
I ordered a new battery for my faithful XPS M1710. I'm not sure of the voltage of the battery I have now, but the new one that the Dell rep got me (after 3-4 times confirming my phone number and laptop model number) is 14.8v. I was a bit concerned about potential incompatibilities (as most of the other compatible batteries listed were 11.1v), but I figure that there's no way that Dell would "recommend" batteries that wouldn't work or fry your system.
Full 14.8V Li ion battery is 16.8V and empty 11.1V battery is 9V. Laptop charger usually provides 19V. If the 30W consuming laptop used a 9V voltage regulator it would use 63W at 19V. It would be insane to waste 11V and 33W as heat. 
The higher voltage DOES NOT mean longer period of operating time, laptop shuts off when any single cell in the battery reaches the low voltage limit. It is actually more likely to have one weak cell if there are 4 cells in series than 3 cells. The low voltage limit is always same.
