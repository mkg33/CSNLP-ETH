The second approach is to deploy a server with a know and fixed IP address using noip and every device should connect to the server (we know the server IP). Every device will have an unique ID, so the server will have a database with all this IDs and their corresponding current IP address, if the IP address changes, the device will simply send the new IP to the server with his unique ID. So on this way I only have to keep a single fixed IP address but I have to add a server capable of handling all the connections.
With this problem in mind, I though of using some services like noip, but the problem is I will have to pay a lot of money for a unique IP for every device I have every year.
Is there any other approach am I missing? I'm not a networking guy so this kind of things are really new to me.
I'm starting a personal project where I will deploy some Internet connected devices (maybe hundred of them). I need to be able to get data and communicate with this devices through my computer or my phone, but the problem is I can't rely on the public IP address because it can change.
