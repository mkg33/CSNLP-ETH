Then I right click the network adapter, click on properties, and tried to find the 'sharing' tab. But I can't find it.
I'm going to create a connection using Cisco VPN, but it gave me error 442 which say "Failed to Enable Virtual Adapter". After looking around, I found that the reason is because the internet connection is shared. I remember I was creating network bridge in the past to try bridging two wireless LAN, but it apparently failed.
8)Clear the Allow other network users to connect through this computerâ€™s Internet connection check box.
Now I'm trying to shut down the ICS. But I can't find the network bridge anywhere. When I see the wireless connection adapter with internet, I see:
Go to run Type: services.msc and press ENTER Find Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) Stop the Service Change Startup Type to Disabled (Reboot the computer)
EDIT: forget it. The share tab suddenly appeared out of the blue. But I don't know how that happened. :(
6)Look for Shared in the Status column in the Network Connections window and right-click that device (e.g. Ethernet adapter, WiFi adapter) and click Properties.
After searching through the internet, I found out that you can make the tab reappear again by recreating the network bridge and then delete it. So I tried to make the network bridge between my LAN adapter and the wireless adapter. But it gave me error "To create a Network bridge, you must select at least two LAN or High-Speed Internet Connections that are not being used by Internet Connection Sharing."
Well, it is being used by ICS. But I can't turn it off. Now I'm in a deadlock because I don't know how to rephrase my question in google so that it can returns me the correct article for my problem. How can I fix this problem and remove the 'shared' status from the wireless connection adapter? Thanks.
