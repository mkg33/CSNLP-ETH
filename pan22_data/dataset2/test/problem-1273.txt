I'm training a CNN for a 3-class image classification problem. My training loss decreased smoothly, which is the expected behaviour. However, my validation loss shows a lot of fluctuation.
It looks like the loss is decreasing (put a line of best fit through the validation loss). It also looks like you might be able to train for longer to improve results, as the curve is still headed downwards.
Should you be worried? In short, no. A validation loss curve like yours can be perfectly fine and deliver reasonable results; however, I would try some of the steps I mentioned above before settling for it.
Additional info: I'm fine-tuning the last layer of a Resnet-18 that was pre-trained on ImageNet data in PyTorch. I must note that I'm using a weighted loss function for the training phase since my data is highly unbalanced. To plot the losses, however, I use the unweighted loss as to be able to compare the validation and training loss. I would use the unweighted loss, were it not that the distributions of the training dataset and validation dataset are somewhat different (they are both highly unbalanced however).
From simple inspection of your plot, I could make a few conclusions and list things to try. (This is without knowing any more about your setup: training parameters and model hyperparameters).
Specific to your task, I would also suggest trying to perhaps unfreeze another layer, to increase the scope of your fine-tuning. This will give the Resnet-18 a little more freedom to learn, based on your data.
Should you just pick the best performing model? If you mean taking the model at its point with best validation loss (validation accuracy), then I would say to be more careful. On your plot above, this might equate to around epoch 30, but I would personally take a point that has trained a little more, where the curve gets a little less volatile. Again, after having tried some of the steps outlined above.
Is this something that I should be worried about, or should I just pick the model which scores the best on my performance measure (accuracy)?
