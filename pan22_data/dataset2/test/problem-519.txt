If I change the WiFi router to bridge mode, will the transfer speed between WiFi-connected computers and the NAS decrease? Or will the WiFi bridge route packets going to the NAS directly, without going through the main router? My fear is that changing to bridge mode might force all traffic to pass through the main router (computer -> WiFi AP -> main -> WiFi AP -> NAS instead of computer -> WiFi AP -> NAS).
My current network configuration comprises two routers, one of which [main] takes care of the wired part of my home network, the other of which [wifi] provides WiFi connectivity. The wired router is also connected to the internet.
The question could be restated as If my WiFi access point is in bridge mode, and I attach a NAS to it, will packets going from a WiFi-connected computer to the NAS transit through the main router?
I have a NAS wired to the WiFi router. Since the WiFi router distributes IP on a different subnet than the wired router, only WiFi-enabled computers can access the NAS.
