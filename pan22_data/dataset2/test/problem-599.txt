I'd probably want to scale out, too..  get a pair of servers, do mysql circular replication between them, loadbalance and cache with Varnish.  Back these applications onto a server with fast disks(600GB SAS), and Lots of RAM (16GB+).
Since last month I am getting several down notice from Pingdom. Right now I am facing more down alert than before. And have to restart my site several time to up again.
Try to keep logging and database partitions on separate disks, so the logging (sequential, mostly) access isn't interrupted by database access (random reads and writes)
I'd want a dedicated server, because that way, I could guarantee that I could prioritise the system processes to handle the IO for the website, not having to worry about whatever the server was doing for other users.
I think your biggest downfall will be doing this on a virtualised system.  I wouldn't put a high traffic site on a shared host, of any kind.  
RAM is cheap now, and Varnish will use lots of it to speed up delivery of your assets.  You'll notice a massive increase in speed.  DB writes will also be faster because of the faster disks.  
I am running a wordpress based site which is now hosted on (mt) under DV-Extreme package 2GB+256MB addon RAM. It a muti author site where people are engaged in writing posts, comments, updating status etc. According to Google Analytics this month traffic
