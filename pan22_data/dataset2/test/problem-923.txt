If you want redundancy, split the network into two. Have half your connections going to one switch, and the other half going to the former.  
This is a very bad idea; not to mention it will not work how your anticipating it will. If you did split the pairs like this, you would only get use out of one set of them. Auto negotiation will allow a single pair to function by autoing down to 100Mb; remember, 100BASE-TX only functions on pairs 1,2,3 and 6. 
End-user computers, generally, do not require this level of redundancy.  You would see this level of fault tolerance in a stacked/chassis setup for something like a server farm. You would have two routing engines, two power supplies, multiple cards and multiple links to that node with 802.1ax (i.e. LACP/PAgP) to help protect you in every instance from an outage.
if dual nics are possible, then the best solution might be to use an active/passive redundant NIC configuration on your nodes. In this configuraton, nodes use only the primary NIC but can perform tests to determine network availability on each and switch to the secondary if a failure is detected.
