I've done some research in this area. I've found first order Markov chains work well for predicting within game scoring dynamics across a variety of sports.
This blog deals with the prediction of a NFL match after the half time is already over. The prediction is 80% accurate with simple GLM model.

Michael Maouboussin, in his book, "The Success Equation," looks at differentiating luck from skill in various endeavors, including sports.  He actually ranks sports by the amount of luck that contributes to performance in the different sports (p. 23) and about 2/3 of performance in football is attributable to skill.  By contrast, I used MM's technique to analyze performance in Formula 1 racing, and found that 60% is attributable to skill (less than I was expecting.)
That said, it seems this kind of analysis would imply that a sufficiently detailed and crafted feature set would allow ML algorithms to predict performance of NFL teams, perhaps even to the play level, with the caveat that significant variance will still exist because of the influence of luck in the game.
A lot of people have stressed about what are the things that can be predicted in their answers. Now, with the fascination for deep learning, you could, for example, use RNN's(say LSTM) to predict outcomes for sports problems that are based on time. These are state of the art and beat traditional models hands down.
