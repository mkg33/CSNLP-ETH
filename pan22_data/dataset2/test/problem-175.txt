We already have a semi-backup (files, not user-state) on box.net, which does allow granular access to various users.
Maybe you should offer her to reinstall her PC while she 's around you, so she can be sure her precious data is not compromised
Her view is, that nobody (not even the other directors) should be able to view the HR documentation on her PC.
Basically don't be afraid to cover your own arse in this area - most people will understand and the HR people will appreciate that you're respecting their role and authority. Plus of course you should never piss off HR anyway, these ninny's help decide your fate for some crazy reason :) 
Perhaps there's a technical solution to this, how about getting your HR people to backup their own stuff to encrypted external disks that they own/manage/store?
Ultimately you have to protect yourself, if there's no way you could get at HR data then you're in the clear, if your management see that you've tried your best and provided as secure and private a means to functionally get your job done without exposing yourself to accusations of data prying then they'll be happy - even if the process is clunky and slow.
My opinion on this may not be popular here but I think she's right, HR is a very specific role in most businesses, requiring one very key skill - absolute discretion. IT people have to have a very wide range of skills and while discretion is important it's not the 'be all and end all' that it is with HR. Typically recruitment of IT people is less thorough in this area too.
She claims that nobody else should be able to see the information on her computer. Fair enough.  I think that the systems administrator (me), should be in a significant enough level of trust to be able to make a backup, no questions asked, and delete the backup once the task is complete.
The other points to make is that as bad as it might be if you did read this stuff via the backups, firstly is she seriously saying that would be worse than the documents being lost forever because they were not backed up, and secondly that as HR director she should be able to ensure that any misuse of system admin privileges can be treated as gross misconduct.
She has a point, but as you are trusted with other sensitive information you should be trusted with HR info as well. Explain you need access to backup the files.
I'm about to backup and reinstall the HR Administrator's PC.  I suspect that the fastest way to do this is to use the Windows 7 Transfer tool, and create a backup of the entire Users and Settings profiles on the NAS.
Lastly, are you a member of the BCS / other IT Professional association? If so, these have members rules about ethics. If you're a member of such a professional association then pointing her to your professional ethics requirements might re-assure her.
I have full read access to my current systems. Everything gets backup and file access is logged. I've got more important things to worry about that poking through HR files, or finding how much the school spent on food for the school cat. In my previous workplace I was unable to view some of the Admin areas (but the network manager could).
System Admins are trusted here, but all admin actions are logged. I don't know how much something like that would re-assure her - the logging of actions so it can be demonstrated that only the backup process is backing up this data, not you reading it for entertainment.
