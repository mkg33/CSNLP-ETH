I have a personal experience with these types of situations, and guess what happened to me when the FBI arrested our CFO for several charges? Nothing, and because I CYA and all evidence was saved in case something bad happened.
On the other hand, if you have deleted records which do not contain evidence of anything illegal but still get subpoenaed after the fact, it is unlikely you would get in trouble for that.
For technical issues: limit privilege, setup procedures, internal controls and audit trails to make it difficult for people to conceal behavior. If everyone knows that an audit trail exists, that will serve as a deterrent. Push for data lifecycle policies... (ie. periodic eltion) In larger environments, you use the service desk/help desk to put a firewall between users & IT or users & accounting.
As far as I know, the only issue with legality is if you are deleting evidence of illegal activities. That could certainly get you in some trouble.
Personally, I tend to work to the same rules as others have mentioned. CYA. Document, audit, and log everything as far as is feasible, and if it makes you feel uncomfortable carrying out the request, I trust my moral compass and try to make sure its documented as authorised as high as I can get.
For human issues: You need to be aware of the law/regulations that you are subject to. Then you need to have a backbone. Say "no". Doing so may mean that you'll face reprisals from your management. 
Great question. I can't really reference anything to the United States as I don't work there, but ethics / legality has been one of those things that often crops up in the work of anyone with elevated system privileges, but there doesn't seem to be anywhere near enough formalised guidance on. Personally, it makes me wish there was a strong industry body that represented us in the same way that doctors and lawyers do. I do know the (UK specific) British Computer Society having published a code of conduct for members, which made me join to feel breaching that code would be a reasonable relevant defence for turning an unethical request down I'm guessing maybe the ACM may be similar from a US point of view?
As mentioned previously, there's obviously a fine line to walk in many situations that present ethical dilemmas. Most of us feel obligated by personal and professional standards to conduct themselves in an ethical manner. Government employees are subject to criminal sanctions in many cases for practices considered normal in the private sector. (Gifts from salesfolk, etc)
First IANAL, but I have been involved in IT legalities issues.  My understanding is that actions of IT come down to what can be reasonably expected for the IT person to know.  EG the boss tells you to delete the acounting files.  You KNOW that they are under investigation.  You do that and you are likely to be charged with obstruction.  On the other hand same situation and you did not have any idea that there was any investigation (and the goverment gets to make that determination), and it's reasonable that you would have been asked to delete those files, you would be OK.
As an IT staffer you are deemmed to have some understanding of what's reasonable and customary (I believe that's the legalese).  It's not however illegal for them to fire you for not performing requested activities, the federal whistleblower statutes would apply.  Small comfort as you're likely to be a marked man in many of the smaller states.
as previously indicated there are other regulations that might apply.  In biotech 21 cfr part 11 regulations would apply
I had actually written an article called "Managing the Manager" covering this topic, 6 years ago or so. But what it all comes down to is **Cover Your A****
The principle all administrators should live by CYA always. It doesn't matter who is in charge, always do it for that "just in case." That is why a Computer Policy should always be implemented, it covers you from liability provided they sign it or at least pass it out with that intention. The same goes with the Local Security Policy login prompt, use it for that reason as well. As soon as they login to their computers, make it say they agree to the terms of the policy.
