This probably isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it's a start (and free!).  It's an Outlook macro I wrote a while back to do just this.  The biggest issue is it doesn't do attachments which could be a showstopper for you, but thought I'd share anyway.  You click on a folder you want to export and it sends the message info to a SQL table.  It's easy enough to modify this if you want more fields.
I'm still amazed no one has really been able to come up with an answer.... what do you guys do to archive your e-mails? Toss 'em out of Outlook or Thunderbird after 6 months and forget about them?? Store them as .txt or .eml files somewhere??
Anyway, the best solution I've found so far isn't using SQL Server - but it still looks quite powerful and useful:  MailStore Home - free for personal / home use, and quite nifty at that. Too bad it doesn't support direct .pst file import :-( - that's only in the $$$$$ pro server version, but so far, that's the only bitter-sweet moment with this app.
