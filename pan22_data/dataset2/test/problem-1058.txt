To explain what I mean, keep in mind that your 802.11 device can only transmit or receive on a frequency at any given point in time.  At the very least, to maintain the connection there are times when it will be transmitting, and quite probably there will be data sent by your device to the network in addition to that minimum.
Monitor captures require the capturing device to keep its radio in a passive listening state.  Promiscuous captures allow the capturing device to remain connected and transmit data and listen only when they are not transmitting (and depending on the driver, the capture may be filtered to the currently connected ESSID/BSSID/SSID as well).  Generally, monitor captures are what you want when capturing wireless data.
I haven't tried to capture packets in OSX before, but if "Option 2" allows you to remain connected, this will limit your ability to capture as it is actually a "promiscuous" capture and not a "monitor" capture.  I would have to guess then that the OSX interface does not provide the distinction between the two and any "capture" is considered monitor (even when actually promiscuous).
While it is transmitting, there is no way for it to be capturing any data that may be transmitted by any other device.  Normally if there were two devices transmitting at the same time, this results in a collision, which you can sometimes determine by your capture.  If your capturing device participated in the collision, you wouldn't see that in any way but rather have the full data that was transmitted.
