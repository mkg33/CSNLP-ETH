How many messages per second does your application dispatch? 1000? RabbitMQ can handle it.  5000? Easy.  50K? Now we need to start doing a few things.  Remember, this is through a single channel of the connection.  If you're multi-threaded, you can get 50K per channel without much trouble.
But the problem is I want to round robin the messages, not connection. i.e if i send 1000 msg at a time from 1 connection then 500 msg should go to rabbit server1 and 500 msg should go to rabbit server2. What should be the configuration that i have to follow?
In order to round robin the RabbitMQ servers, you'll need to have your client connect to HAProxy, send the message, then disconnect (don't keep the connection open).  Reconnect to send the next message, then disconnect.
I want to use HAProxy as a load balancer. I want to put two rabbitmq server behind haproxy. Both the rabbitmq server are on different instance of EC2. I have configure HAProxy server by following this reference. I works but the problem is messages are not published in roundrobin pattern. Messages are publish only on one server. Is there any different configuration for my requirement?
Bad Rabbit.  Bad.  There is a degree of overhead when establishing a connection and a channel in RabbitMQ as well as the potential for increased latency when doing this in a clustered RabbitMQ environment.  You definitely don't want to connect, send, disconnect.  Leave the connection open.  RabbitMQ is quite fast and there are ways to get really high performance out of it (e.g. use publisher confirms instead of transactions, use in-memory messages, etc.).  You'll kill your application performance if you disconnection/reconnect on every. single. message.
As long as your client keeps open the connection to HAProxy, the connection from HAProxy to RabbitMQ connection won't move.  HAProxy is a connection-based load balancer, not message based (as far as I know).  It does not know when a message starts or ends (it would have to know the internal protocols for it to successfully do this).
I have made some R&D on this and found that HAProxy is round robin the connection on the rabbitmq server. for ex: if i request for 10 connections then it will round robin the 10 connection over my 2 rabbitmq servers and publish the message.
