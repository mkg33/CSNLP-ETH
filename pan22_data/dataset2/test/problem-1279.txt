This is something you really want to hire a cable vendor to do. Outside Plant (OSP) cabling is a specialty, and there are things you must do for safety (legal requirements), and things you must do to make sure the cable will not fail.
Be careful, because if this cable plugs in to some equipment that your ISP installed in your building, it is probably NOT active optical equipment, but just a patch into another cable that runs to the ISP's optical equipment in a network room somewhere in your neighborhood. Extending the cable may not be supported by your ISP.
Instead of extending the ISP fiber, you may want to investigate the possibility of leaving your ISP installation as it is, and running cables between your buildings that plug in to your internal network.
For instance, outside cable is not allowed to extend more than 50' inside a building, you must bury it at least 24", or below the frost line, whichever is greater. Direct buried cable needs to be armored, loose-tube, and probably gel-filled. There is also grounding, bonding, and lightning protection that must be carefully done because the armor will be metallic.
Yes, I totally agree with Law29. It seems that you are only changing the length of the cable, so actually you do not need to determine whether you need multi-mode or single-mode fiber cable. The mode of the fiber has to correspond to the mode of the optical equipment that you're plugging it in to. In other words, you still have to use the same mode cable as you used before.
Multi-mode is cheaper (never wondered if it's the fiber or the optics, probably both). For multi-mode the best you'll do over 2000 ft is 100 Mbps.
If you want to just plug in your replacement cable, then you don't have a choice, because the equipment optics determines multi-mode or single mode, in other words it's not just the cable's physical connector that has to fit where you plug it in, but the fiber's mode also has to correspond to the mode of the optical equipment that you're plugging it in to.
This is not something for amateurs, and the cable vendor will run bulk cable and terminate it to a cable patch panel with the appropriate type of connector.
First off, you need two of those at each end, one for each direction. Second, it looks more like SC/PC to me, not SC/APC.
