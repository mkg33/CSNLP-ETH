Also think about it logically, a drawing that is going to become a 3D model, a drawing that is going to be created in to a realistic person once in the game and then a Sprite (eg SNES style) are both going to cost different amounts.
Also, try poking around an art department at a local university or an art guild. I'm sure there might be a student dieing to get there work exposed or create something that can get them more exposure.
If you want a ball park figure then you'll probably looking at again a different amount for the detail inside. For example if this is going to be a cartoon style character, or in the style of perfect people, or in the style of a realism. Additionally it is a different story to draw an animal, a person, an imaginary creature or combination.
Set a budget, search for people who will do that for that budget, and among them chose the one you like most.
Without spices you'll never get a figure. I'd suggest posting (not necessarily on here...) a more in depth request with the intention of people coming back with amounts they feel it is worth or they would draw them for you.
Before you run out to pay for any art, see what you can find online for free that comes with a license that works for you, if nothing satisfies you I would use temporary art that is on the net until you able to come up with something.
The DeviantArt Job Offers Forum is a place where people often request such projects from designers. You can probably find proposals with prices, but from what I can tell, they're very disparate. 
Ultimately, you may not have to pay much if at all if you can find the right people and prove that you wont be wasting anyones time! =)
