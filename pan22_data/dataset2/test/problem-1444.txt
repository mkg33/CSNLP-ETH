It's not possible to specify a logging statement per view. However, if you use syslog logging with syslog-ng you can filter out the messages by using a filter.
You can do everything within Bind itself rather than syslog. I use this config on all my Bind 9 DNS servers. Just insert the following lines into your named.conf, run named-checkconf to make sure it the syntax is good, and restart Bind. Once you're sure it's working you can start messing with the severity settings and other parts. I think a reload of Bind should pick up the changes. 
I tried putting a logging { }; section within the view but bind complained.  Any thoughts on how I can separate the security messages out for this particular view?
If you use this method, make sure to rotate this file, or it will grow to pretty massive proportions.
I setup a view in bind to provide different results for VPN users but I do not provide other queries so that non-vpn queries will fail and route back to their internal network dns server(s).  It is working fine but I'm getting tired of all the query "denied" messages filling up the syslog.
