Splitting OS & user data sounds like a heck of a lot of pain to me, using AD you can have your users' data stored on the server, roaming profiles & folder redirection will make your users much happier, their data will be transparently stored on the server and easy to back up.
For a lot of common software packages, check out Ninite.  You can create a group of programs that you want installed and kept current from the available programs.  Set it up to run weekly with Task Scheduler.  Any software not on their list will have to be manually updated (or some other solution).
I'd highly recommend looking into Windows Small Business Server (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/windows-small-business-server/default.aspx). It will manage your user authentication, updates, Group Policies, etc., and is specifically tailored for smaller networks like what you're describing.
For the OS, just set each one to automatically download and install all updates.  You can set the time and day it applies any updates, if you need to get specific about it.
I'd rather not have a Windows server but would consider it if necessary. What other options do I have for making this task as painless as possible?
For some additional peace of mind, have 2 accounts on each workstation: 1 user account and 1 administrator account, and put a password on both.  Keep the user account as a standard account, so that they have to ask you to make changes and you know what's on each one.
The method you describe sounds like hell to me. How are you going to manage users? What about backing up the PCs?
My ideal solution would be to partition separate system and user volumes, then periodically push out an updated image containing all the updates. I've found instructions for splitting the OS & user volumes, but somehow I doubt this is realistic. Wouldn't the system partition need to know about the user logins? And, how to handle user installed apps?
I'm looking for suggestions on how to best manage a group of 5-10 Windows 7 PCs.  My primary concern is making sure the OS and applications stay up-to-date.
