The payoff is great once you're up and running and learn how to properly administer them. But you don't want to be learning everything from commandline to compile time on a production server. You definitely don't want to feel your way around learning to configure, maintain, and back up a server with all those services that is also accessible from an external network!
For file sharing i would go trought setting up a Solaris server with CIFS sharing over ZFS, that way backups and instant recovery are going to be easy.
There is a free edition for up to 50 users, and a "premier" edition for $50/user/year.  Either can do everything on your list. I would go "Premier" if you think you will get beyond 50 users anytime soon or think "Google Groups" (essentially an intranet) has value to your company. 
I'd suggest taking a look at google apps - probably one of THE best webmail interfaces around, file sharing with google docs, and incredibly easy to support. Its free for the number of users you have, or 50 USD/year/user for the premium version, with a lot more space
You do have to consider the cost of support too. This type of setup will be the cheapest to support in the long run. I'm assuming you don't work for free, so make sure you include your time in any cost estimates.
You asked for something non-MS, and as someone pointed out the Small Business Server would fit the bill, unfortunately.
For email and calendar maybe you may look at Zimbra which is a opensource email and collabaration system.
IMHO the only thing you are risking with Google Apps is the time it might take to migrate should you decide to go another direction.  If you are in a hurry, get started with Google Apps and take your time deciding on a permanent solution.
Either way you're going to need to invest in securing your server and having a good backup solution and invest in a good support structure for maintaining the system(s).
You would best be served by hiring an outside contractor/consultant local to your area to help you or grow an in-house IT department, even if it's one skilled person, to handle this (with thirty people you probably would be in need of this kind of service soon anyway if you don't already have one started). In the meantime the MS solution is well supported and there's far more people with these skills in the commercial sector than I'd care to acknowledge.
Windows will work fine, there are more people that tend to maintain and be knowledgeable in that OS so they are cheaper, but you still have labor costs (if it's outside your expertise) and more licensing costs.
The best answer is that this depends on your skillsets. A Linux/FreeBSD server can do all this and much more, BUT they have a BIG investment on learning curve if you don't already have the skills.
I know you asked for non-MS, but Small Business Server 2008 does everything you asking for, is extremely widely supported, and is pretty easy to get going. It's not the cheapest at about $3000 Retail if you have a server already, but it's a fair amount cheaper if you buy it with a server (like from HP or Dell).
Linux/*BSD would work great, as long as you have a knowledgeable person on staff to configure and maintain it and support your users. It would be minimal in cost except for the talent maintaining it.
