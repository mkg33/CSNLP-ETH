The only way round this really is to have a dedicated Server that is always listening for users so that users who try to play the game do not host their own session but instead use a Server dedicated for the game...
So I made a simple game where two players can connect to play together - one of them chooses the server option(and then the game starts listening for incoming TCP syncs), and the other enters the IP of the server player to establish the connection and exchange gameplay data over the TCP socket.
Or it's impossible for two applications to connect over WAN without one of the sides setting up port forwarding?
So I guess that if the players are in different LANs, the server must have port forward the game port(55555), and then any client can connect by entering the public IP address.
But the players can connect only if their computers are in the same LAN and the client enters the server's private IP address.
However it is normally quite simply to port forward most router guides contain instructions on completing this. The problem you will have is that public IP's for home users are rarely static and will change causing the 'known' public IP to be wrong..
Is it true(currently I don't have the means to test it), and what are the common ways to avoid port forwarding, because most users don't know how to do it.
