You need to have a fundamental re-think about the nature of your data. This is not C-specific; the same thing would apply in Python (or whatever other language you use). You're very often carrying around display information (the letter 'X' and 'O', for instance, or coordinates on the screen) and using those to affect your logic. Your logical data should be pure, in the sense that:

You have another habit - hard-coding things that should be computed. This especially applies to manipulating coordinates of the game grid. The contents of the game grid should not be 'X' and 'O', but rather an enum with three values - blank, player1, or player2. The game grid should be represented as a two-dimensional, and not one-dimensional, array. Manipulating this grid should be done with two-dimensional coordinates, and not a one-dimensional "flattened" index. Rewriting your code like this will make it easier to write loops and functions, and significantly DRY up your code.
