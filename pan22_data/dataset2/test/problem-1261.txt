Check out GoDaddy unlimited plan. They are offering unlimited space and transfer and gives SSL certificate for free, 15$/mo. I don't have such a big traffic needs than you, but had no problems so far. Just give a try.
Note that most of the "unlimited bandwidth" say "1.5Mb" or "10Mb" in fine print.  You need 100Mb to handle peaks (since it's doubtful your 10TB would come through evenly.  ServerBeach.com, one of the least expensive dedicated providers (again, you NEED dedicated unless you want to manage 10-30 shared hosts), has a 10Tb deal on a 100Mb connection for $1000/mo.  This is about as cheap as you'd be able to find.
Also, if your screencasts fit into their scheme (I'm not sure if they have content type limitations), libsyn offers plans based on the amount you can upload per month and has unlimited downloads.
Unlimited means they won't charge you extra money, but you're still capped at WELL below 10tb/month.  You might be able to get away with pumping that through 10 free hosting services (setting up a single server to manage redirection), but never one.  Consider that a single server would likely struggle a bit to provide the 100Mb+ bandwidth peaks, and then imagine sharing that server with 199 other websites (shared hosts will often bundle 200 to a server).  Not going to happen.
10TB of quality bandwidth costs a whole lot more than $10/month.  Feel free to give a cheapo hosting company a go, but don't be surprised if you get kicked off or throttled after a few days.
I'd like to add that you could lower your "pure" download requirements by also offering bittorrent tracking for your files. Not everybody will use it, but it might lower required bandwidth on your side significantly, so that you have more options on the "classic" download side.
Amazon just added a streaming media service today (Amazon Cloudfront).  For the first 10 TB of data, they charge $.17 per GB, and even provide a calculator to estimate your monthly costs.  10TB of data would cost you a mere $1740.82 a month.  Are you sure you're looking at 10TB a month? As Farseeker's calculations show, that is a LOOOOT of data to be pushing over the wire for free.
