Once it's done, bring the tunnel up on the CentOS box with sudo service ipsec start.  Find out if it's working with sudo ipsec auto --status|grep MYNAME; you're looking for a non-zero IPSec SA (IPSec SA non-zero is identically equivalent to "tunnel is up").
Here you need to set all values except "PSK", which is a configuration marker that should remain unchanged.  The LongString is a pre-shared random key that the CISCO will need to know as well.
This configuration is taken from another CentOS 6 box, linked via IPSec to a CISCO router of some kind, so hopefully it can be fairly easily adapted for your use.  You will need to change all the values in CAPITALS.  MYNAME is a simple text string that names your tunnel; it's only used locally, for disambiguation; the other values are hopefully self-evident.
You don't say if you have to configure the CISCO end as well; I'm really hoping you've got someone with network clue to do that bit for you.
1) Get openswan, the userspace toolchain's in the standard repository, with sudo yum install openswan.
