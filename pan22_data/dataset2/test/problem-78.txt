At least this is how it worked with synchronizing my iPhone to iTunes in my Windows. I almost never lost data and if I did it's because I had done it on my laptop not my phone.
I used to get confused when doing such stuff because I do not know if my Mac has data A, and my iPhone has date B, to sync them will mean to make Mac have the exact 'B'  or 'make the iPhone have the exact 'A'?
A similar scenario is my Mac stores some mp3, and I truly hope to use 'sync'  in a safe manner to copy the mp3 from the mac to the iPhone.  Yeah, I know it is quite a stupid question. Finally I take the courage to ask.
*** OTHER WARNING: Your iPhone can only sync with ONE computer. YOU WILL LOSE DATA IF YOU SYNCED WITH ANOTHER DEVICE PRIOR TO SYNCING WITH THIS ONE. Also, it will inform you of this change.
What's copied where during a sync is something you can configure in iTunes; when you plug your device in, click on it where it appears in the iTunes sidebar, and you'll find the settings for different types of data under "Photos", "Music", &c. I don't have a copy of iTunes handy, but as I recall, you can choose a folder from which to sync photos to the device, and choose which albums on the device are synced to the computer; the same holds true for other types such as music and movies.
For example,  I took many photos in my iPhone, and never know how to get them out with this 'sync' functionality, because my Mac has no photo and if I understand the wrong way and do the sync all my photos in Mac would disappear, right? 
The case where there are different versions of the same data is called a conflict; when one occurs, iTunes will pause synchronization and pop up a dialog to ask you which version of each file to keep.
The data on your iPhone is almost always updating (I.E. Song counts). It essentially does a diff and takes whatever is newer, so if something doesn't exist on the Mac, then it shouldn't delete it from the Phone. If your phone is set to sync photos in iTunes, iTunes will then grab all the photos from your phone. Same thing goes with music, (I think) it will automatically find new purchases of music, movies, and apps and automatically inform your mac that there are X,Y,and Z changes. HOWEVER PLEASE NOTE, if you delete a song from your music library it will be deleted from your phone.
