We have a windows server 2008 box at my work place. I want to map a drive from the server to my laptop. I use windows vista home premium x64. 
If you are trying to connect to one of the administrative shares (e.g. \servername\C$, \servername\d$ etc) then UAC is preventing this. By default only the explicit local Administrator user account or an account that is a member of the Domain Admins Group has the automatic elevation privileges required to connect to administrative shares remotely. An account that is a member of the local Administrators group does not have these rights. 
I am connected to my workplace through VPN. i can map the drive when I use the administrator account on the server. But the log on is unsuccessful if I use my personal account on the server to map the drive. My personal account on the server is part of Administrators group.
This can be disabled\changed by GPO but this is a fundamental principle of the behaviour of UAC with regard to remotely accessing administrative functions on a Vista\Win7\W2K8 target system. The relevant UAC security settings are detailed in this MSDN article.. This refers to Vista but the same rules apply to W2K8.
