I used it to virtualize a server, move it onto a different machine so i could upgrade it back onto the original hardware as an inplace upgrade wasn't possible. Messy but it worked!
This is not a good situation to be in; the upgrade was done without a plan for continuing operations. This is where an ounce of prevention was worth a pound of remedy.
I'm slightly confused by your question to be honest, it could do with a rewrite - but if I understand correctly then my answer would be that VMWare ESX (you don't mention which product you're talking about) allows you to mount ISO files as an emulated CD/DVD - this might be what you want.
trying to use passthru disks in this case won't work for either esxi or hyper-v, they need exclusive access to the underlying drives. And in this case your booting off that drive thus you can't have exclusive access. boot into the old os and use disk2vhd to p2v these things.
Most virtualization software can easily run from a physical drive. However, most Windows solutions require access to the whole drive. If you have a single drive with two partitions (old and new) you'll have to copy the contents to a VHD or VMDK. If the OS is XP/2003 or older, you'll have to mess with the HAL and driver to get it to boot in the VM. 
You could use VMware Converter and convert the original machine.  Then, just add the resulting VMDK files to your new 64-bit VMs.
I have done this in the past (for really weird reasons). I downloaded a trial of System Centre Virtual Machine Manager (http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/en/us/virtual-machine-manager.aspx). You can then convert a physical machine into a virtual one using the software. This then allows you to boot the machine of Microsoft Virtual PC (which is free) or Hyper-V server. Then just scrap the 32bit partition and extend the 64bit one to free up your space!
