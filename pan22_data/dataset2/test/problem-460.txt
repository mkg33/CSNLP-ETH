Similarly, if your own computer is compromised, every email you send and/or receive is potentially public.
The main problem is that you've got to convince your correspondents to use the same encryption scheme. This is quite impossible, as no one wants to put effort in enhanced privacy. My guess is that email messages will always be sent unencrypted, regrettably. 
The biggest problem with encryption is still initial key exchange. I don't know of anyone who's really solved that problem from a usability standpoint.
In my mind there's not enough people using e-mail encryption to make it usable except in special circumstances (or certain groups of people). Signing your e-mails, on the other hand, doesn't come with any compatibility problems, so that's probably useful, if you care.
I disagree concerning the practicality simply because in order for the message to remain secure, the recipient must be using a secure email system and the transmission between email servers would also need to be secure. If you have a specific recipient and you're able to work with them to meet these challenges, then it can be done but for a wholesale transition to encrypted email, it isn't practical. 
For example, if you send an encrypted email using a perfect encryption scheme to a friend, but your friend uses a spyware/trojan infected computer to check his mail, there's nothing keeping your emails confidential at that point in time.
