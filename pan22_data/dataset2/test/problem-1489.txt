When working with binary files such as images, flash compilations and other, you can manage version but you won't be able to do diffs and merge changes.
I've had no experience with it, just heard of it.  Not sure if it is geared to be a mission critical robust revision control system, or more something like Time Machine on the Mac. YMMV.
I will say, consider your audience carefully.  Most of my experiences with trying to get a group of designers to use version control have ended badly.  Their brains just don't work in the same way as a developer.
You didn't mention your operating system, but for Windows I know FileHamster is designed with designers in mind.
Consider the mindset of your designers, and be flexible with considering other models, such as maybe having a couple tech-savvy designers act as the gatekeepers for those that would wish to avoid version control.  Obviously there's scaling problems with that approach, but there's also problems with forcing version control on people who haven't bought into it and will likely ignore it.
For an easy to use personal version control system I suggest FileHamster and software I wrote called FolderTrack (www.foldertrack.com) It will work with multiple editors.
You can use any existing version control such as Git, Subversion and others for managing revisions for design work.
Subversion (or any other version control system) works with any file format, but it can only merge and provide diffs text files (such as .html, .css and .js).
