FYI, the <label> tag is significantly less usable without it either encompassing both the radio button and label text, or having its for attributed defined.
I'd also use external CSS to default all the text fields to hidden -- to avoid that first nested loop in your JavaScript.
If you use data attributes and CSS classes, the event handler becomes pretty generic. You could use "event delegation" and attach the handler once to the parent element (avoiding that forEach loop -- which is not supported natively in IE8).
I'd use data attributes on the radio buttons to point to the IDs of the text inputs. Then you don't have to worry about constructing the ID strings in code. For IE8, use getAttribute()
I'd then use a CSS class to toggle the visibility of the text fields (if the class is present, the field is visible, if the class is not present, the field is hidden). This makes it easier to locate the currently visible input (document.getElementsByClass), instead of having to iterate through all the text fields every time a radio button is clicked.
