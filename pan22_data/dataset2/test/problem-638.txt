You can check the bios (by entering the magic key combo at boot) and make sure USB Wake, or a similar sounding option, is enabled in the hardware. It's not disabled by default but I think it gets disabled for power saving reasons. 
I have 2 mice and keyboards under the device drivers. One mouse and one keyboard have power options, the HID ones do not.
just being a helpful googler here with a suggestion for those who are in the same boat as I was. For some reason, the wireless mouse plugged into USB 3.0 ports weren't waking up my computer.  The USB 2.0 ports worked, however.  Try moving your mouse receiver into a USB 2.0 port.
This could also be caused by your motherboard and/or BIOS configuration. This article explains step-by-step how to check if your motherboard USB "jumpers" are enabled, and how to enable the wake up event in your BIOS. It's specific to an MSI motherboard, but the principle is basically the same no matter what kind of hardware you have.
Waking from wireless USB mouse/keyboard didn't work for me on Windows 7 or Windows 10.  I started using my network device to wake up the computer.  I installed free Mocha Ping Lite app on my iphone "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/network-ping-lite/id289967115?mt=8"
