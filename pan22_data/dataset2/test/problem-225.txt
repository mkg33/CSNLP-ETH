The closest thing to domain "ownership" is registration of a domain.  Which is what WHOIS shows you.
Are you sure there is such a thing?  According to Domain Bits: Domain Law, [there is] "No Such Thing As Domain Ownership."
But, if you want a simple answer... here's a straightforward answer that may set you on the right track in many/most simple cases:
Note: There might be some laws that are relevant.  For instance, Trademark law might have some impact: If you own a trademark, that might give some rights to the domain name.  Or might not.  If you care that much, then this is no longer a simple technical question.  Instead, this would be a complex legal question that may vary based on details like what registrar you used, and what laws are in effect (which can involve details like where the registrar is, and probably where you are located, and possibly when something happens, as laws may change).  So if you care that much, you may want to review contracts, laws, and seek out review by a law professional.
