Assuming you are running windows 7, you could replace the motherboard and boot the computer up and install the drivers you may need (without BSOD or any issues at all). If there are issues (if have done this numerous time with no issues), boot using a Windows live CD/Flash Drive and install the drivers (put the drivers on the flash drive). If you need help understanding this, please let me know.
The decision in the long run is your's, but from my perspective (been repairing computers for years) I would replace the motherboard. If you buy a new board, make sure that it is the exact one that is in your computer already, or you may end up having problems.
The motherboard on my HP P6214Y is fried and the local computer repair shop wants $300 to fix it (I paid $500 for it 1.5 years ago).  Should I order my own OEM motherboard from Hong Kong for about $170 and attempt the repair myself or buy a new HP for around $450 and try to move my old HDD to the new computer.  I have some programs on the HDD that I no longer have the installation disk for (including some downloaded programs). 
On the other hand, a computer that is 1.5 years old could have a little bit outdated technology. It would be easy to install the old HDD into the new computer to get the other programs. If you have the product keys, you can probably download trial software off of the company's website and enter the key to unlock the full version. If you lost the product keys, Lifehacker recently posted an article about something called ProduKey that can retrieve them after you install the HDD in the new computer.
