If you can't ping the server, it's dropped off the network and restarting any Windows service won't fix anything for you. You've either got a problem with the network itself, or the server's network card.
The problem occurred again yesterday morning and at lunch, but this time it was just one PC that wasn't in the affected group last week. During the problem I did the following: 
I ran into a similar issue about a year ago, my file server was not recognizing one of the clients. I did the following:
I set the network attack blocker to only block the attacking node for 1 minute. I'm also going to investigate what the synflood attacks could be. At least for now I know why those machines were disconnected from the server. Of course now, I need to figure out the source of those dos.generic.synflood attacks. 
Went to the server, collected wireshark packets between the affected PC and the server. Then, I restarted the server because I know that works. That fixed the issue. I was only able to read through the collected data for a few minutes because other issues came up (I'm the only IT pro - one man crew) that occupied my time for the rest of the shift. Thought about it through the night. Came in this morning, collected network traffic just to see if there were any network process hogs and couldn't find anything bloating the "pipe." Then it hit me: check the kaspersky logs on the server. I checked the network attack blocker logs and found that last week Kaspersky detected dos.generic.synflood "attacks" from the 3 affected machines last week and the affected machine yesterday. When Kaspersky detects things like that, it will cut off communication with the attacking node for 60 minutes. The logs gave the exact time of the issue and the time matched up with the time affected users called me about the issue. I tracked the logs back 30 days and noticed those logs were clean of attacks. 
Given the fact that it's only some machines, and it doesn't sound like your network is internally routed, one of your switches may be crapping out or having ARP problems. Sounds like they aren't managed, so the next time it happens, you're going to have to do some troubleshooting while the problem is occurring to find the fault.
I'd have to agree with Mfinni, restarting any of the services mentioned, wouldn't allow/stop traffic getting to your server.  If anything, check your server for any firewall configurations.  Unfortunately, this issue is so intermittent that you are going to be playing a waiting game to troubleshoot.  The best you can do is determine a plan of action for when it happens again.  For that, I would start by running Wireshark, or some other type of packet sniffer on the server and client, while the issue is occurring, and while you have a constant ping from the affected machines.  I would also check if those affected machines can communicate with any other machines on the local / remove subnet to narrow your issue.
