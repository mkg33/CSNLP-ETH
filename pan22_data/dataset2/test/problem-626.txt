Reinstall is the easiest, most complete and best option. Not to mention the quickest solution to your problems.
These are your System Restore points.  In the highest numbered folder you will see a folder named snapshot.  In this folder are registry hive files which you need to recover your system:
D. Create a subdirectory; i.e, D:\Windows\TMP. Copy these files to the TMP subdirectory.  Rename them:
B. Open Windows Explorer.  Click on Tools|Folder Options|View.  Check the box beside "Show hidden files and folders".  Apply your change.
A. Connect your non-bootable hard drive to another computer, as a secondary drive or use a usb adapter or enclosure and boot into windows. If you can see your data on the drive, back it up Now, then follow the rest of these instructions.
G.Put your drive back in its original system.  Your system should start normally.  If you get the same error repeat the procedure and choose another folder ( RPnn) (next highest number). You can repeat this procedure choosing lower RPnn numbers until you get operating again.
You will see a folder named something like _restore{.........}  the dots represent an alpha-numeric sequence.
The error you're being given is misleading - the problem is not a corrupted registry. It is a damaged HAL of an unknown cause.
Windows restore points contain registry hives, if you have restore points these can be used to restore the registry to a previous state.
If you had the knowledge you could possibly rewrite the HAL required for Windows to run, overwriting the damaged area. But without knowing what's damaged and extreme indepth knowledge of how the HAL is constructed you don't stand a chance. It's well beyond 'Superuser' and more along the avenue of Microsoft's programming team. I certainly wouldn't know where to start (I'm Microsoft Certified and I've been repairing/installing/building PC's & Servers for over 12 years).
NOTE  D: may not represent the hard drive you connected to your PC, it may be E: or F: or G:, it all depends on how many other drives (including cd/dvd) you have in your PC, So subtitute the appropriate drive letter in the instructions below.
