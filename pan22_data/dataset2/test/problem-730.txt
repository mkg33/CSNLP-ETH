Snoopy is a wrapper around exec functions, and logs any  external binary that is executed(not shell builtins)
as root, you could replace their shell with a simple wrapper script that logged their commands before passing them to the real shell. This would only work prior to them logging in.
However, if you desire to see every character typed into the terminal, then you will have to use another tool.
If you want root to "spy" on other users without their knowledge, the best and most efficient solution might be keylogger software/hardware.
If you're being cooperative, you can use GNU screen between two users - have one establish the screen session, then have the other join using screen -x.
If you want live view of commands executed on your system, this may be it. Warning: snoopy is not proper audit solution and can easily be circumvented.
Be aware though, that spying on your users might be subject to regulations or even outright illegal depending on your local legislation.
Changing the shell is very trivial to circumvent, patching the shell itself is better, but you have to patch all shells. Our favourite cracker uses this, as a bonus he doesn't bother himself with disabling bash_history.
ttysnoop uses the same method, but it is unmaintained. (I probably had issues making it log ssh connections, can't rememeber)
pseudopod and rootsh can be used for logging legitimate sudos. And shwatcr is another thing to monitor logins.
