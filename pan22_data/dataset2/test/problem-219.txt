So here I am, completely helpless and about to throw in the towel. I have never had any problem installing both Windows and Ubuntu together until now. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
I wanted to share partitions within the SDD for both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 14.04, and leave the HDD for data storage. All my efforts proved in vain. Windows 7 was installed without problems, but then Ubuntu messed everything up during installation and I couldn't eventually start anything.
Next I decided to separate them in different drives: SDD for Ubuntu only, HDD for Windows 7 only. After having Windows 7 installed, there was no way now to enter the Ubuntu installation. I also tried with other distros: Linux Mint and Fedora, without success: the CD kept loading on and on until there was no response. I could only see a black or a grey screen. The same happened when I tried booting a boot-repair CD.
I tried to find out and read about something in the BIOS called EFI or UEFI, which I haven't ever heard before. Someone told me this may prevent SOes different from Windows to start. But I don't know what to check or uncheck. There are many options in this BIOS (it's not even blue screened, but more graphically advanced). I've tried to enable anything called "legacy" and disable anything called "uefi" or similar, without success. I finally restored defaults just in case.
I'm struggling with the installation of Ubuntu in dual mode alongside Windows in my new computer (it's taking me days of my free time!!). First of all my device specs:
