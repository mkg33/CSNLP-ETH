Could there be a specific Windows Update I could uninstall to make this work? I have 142GB avaible on my hard drive and 8GB RAM, and I have Windows 7 64bit.
So I installed a huge chunk of Windows Updates a month ago. After that my active programs ,such as Firefox or MSN, have been freezing (Not responding) for few seconds and then coming back to life. I've been trying to search for specific update that is causing this, but haven't found anything. I've also scanned my computer with no infections, so I am almost positive it's some Windows Update because it has happened since updating.
It has started becoming very frustrating, when programs constantly freeze. It has also made my computer freeze few times, when leaving it on overnight. After my screen goes black, the computer freezes and when I wake up and restart screen and move my mouse, I see that time still it at "00:40" for ex. when the real time is "10:39". My mouse and keyboard stop working and I have no other option but to force reboot computer.
