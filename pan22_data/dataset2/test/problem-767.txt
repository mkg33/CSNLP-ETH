Note that this is a one-way trip. Your Win2K VHD will be running multi-processor code indefinitely after that, even if you go back to a single virtual CPU.  You might want to back up your VHD first, as these multi-processor binaries are less efficient than the single-processor ones when running single vCPU.
Your first problem in your little test with 4 cores is that you're running an unsupported configuration. When you run unsupported, results are difficult to predict. Check out this document from Microsoft. You can only run a single CPU while using Windows Server 2000 on Hyper V.
Lastly, please understand that the reason that Microsoft isn't supporting more CPUs for Win2K has partly to do with the fact that the Win2K kernel has no idea isn't being virtualized and it has some hard assumptions that all CPUs run all the time.  Breaking this assumption by virtualizing more processors will result in less than linear performance gains (cough, cough.)  You might get reasonable performance with two processors.  More will probably not help.
Both of the other answers are correct.  Calling Microsoft for support with Hyper-V and Windows 2000 will result in being told that the only supported configuration involves one virtual CPU.
With that said, I suspect that you got exactly the same performance each time because Windows 2000 didn't automatically reconfigure itself as a multi-processor installation when you added virtual CPUs.  Win2K was only using one CPU, even when you assigned it four.
If you give your VM a single core and assign it 100% of that core, you've maxed out what performance you can from that system. Your other options are to deploy a physical box or deploy a hypervisor that supports SMP on Windows 2000 (like ESXi).
Second, measuring CPU usage of the host server is not as simple as using Task Manager, since Task Manager is itself running in a virtual machine.  For more information on measuring CPU usage in Hyper-V, please check out this article.
You need to go to device manager and change the HAL from the single processor HAL to the multi-processor HAL.  (Update driver on computer type.)  That will trigger the installation of the multi-processor kernel, ntdll, HAL, etc.  My memory says that there were about six binaries that changed.
