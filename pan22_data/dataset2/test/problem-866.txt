The Netmon appliance from netmon.com (not affiliated with the Windows software) does a good job of capturing packets. It is also a full featured network monitoring tool.
get windows version of tcpdump and analyze traces later with anything [ including wireshark ] on separate desktop box.
If you have some bucks to spend, try Wildpacket's OmniPeek. It has enormous analysis features and decoders, session/flow based views, easy-to-build filters and great support for real NICs with hardware filtering. 
I use Wireshark on Windows all the time - with a SPAN session or similar, plus cunning use of capture/display filters, you can get it to tell you pretty much anything you need.  And you can make pretty graphs for your boss, too.  What did you mean by 'security history'?
Something to keep in mind if you're looking at a commercial analyzer: many of them use older versions Wireshark (or Ethereal) as a back-end for decoding.
or use network switch with port mirroring and attach linux [ or - in worst case - virtual machine with linux and bridging to separate ethernet interface ] and perform all sniffing on it.
I often use it for my daily work to analyze problems in chatty customer networks - you can drop some small linux-boxes with tcpdump and use them as remote-NIC for larger setups.
Wireshark's security record is one of the very few aspects of the project that I've been unhappy with. The good news is that we have a talented team of developers and a solid architecture. One of the reasons you hear about Wireshark's security is that we actively look for flaws and report them. We're usually the first to discover them, and I try to push out updates and advisories as quickly as possible when they are found. The bad news is that eliminating every flaw in 1.7 million lines of code is Really Damn Hard.
