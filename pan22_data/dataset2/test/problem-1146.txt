If you're running Wireshark, you should see the UDP and TCP packets pass back and forth on port 3389 at this point - I would recommend filtering to those ports to weed out all of the other traffic, or follow it in conversation mode. (You can also run Wireshark on the target if you have out-of-band or console access to it, and verify they are passing back and forth at that end.)  If either system does not show them, you've a firewall in the way.
In addition, you should have the Terminal Services for Administration toolset installed and started on the target; this runs the terminal service upon which RDP is built. This will allow 3 concurrent connections (2 user and 1 admin or 'console' connection). If you need more than that, you'll need to install and configure Terminal Services as an actual server role, and license it accordingly.
Make sure you're watching for both TCP and UDP packets on port 3389, and verify that they are being sent from your client (the remote terminal) to the server (the system you want to remotely administer).  Also, rather than disabling Windows firewall, set those ports to pass traffic thru in both directions - keep in mind that a disabled firewall is often a closed firewall, not an opened one.
