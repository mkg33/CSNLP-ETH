Has anyone come across anything we can use to stop them launching multiple instances of the same application? 
I'd seriously consider looking at the resources you have allocated to your virtual machine and start filling in the gaps that are causing your performance issues.  Memory is so cheap right now, you should have your servers fully-stocked to accommodate your current and anticipated load.  If maximizing your RAM doesn't solve your problem, start looking at clustering the machines for load balancing.
Ideally you could tell it what to watch for, and when the user tries to open a second copy it will stop it happening, and tell them why. 
I don't think your solution should be terminating the process that the user is trying to do.  I'm sure terminating iexplore.exe processes for whatever reason will result in more negative consequences than anything.
We have recently moved our production terminal servers from stand alone blades into a data centre running on virtual servers(windows 2003). 
Anyone know of anything, please bear in mind it is running in a terminal server environment so needs to work per user (each user can have one IE process open)
We are starting to suffer quite major performance issues, and one of the main culprits seems to be IE7, and users launching multiple copies of it instead of using a new window/tab. Its taking up quite a large memory footprint.
Are you sure that IE7 is the issue? Because opening a new tab in IE does start a new 'iexplore.exe' in the processes list, so it will in fact appear to the process list that multiple IE windows are opened...
I can't think of a way to natively do this.  I know IE8 has a new process model, which means it has to use multiple processes - but there is a way of reconfiguring it so that it only uses one.  However, if performance was your main concern, moving to IE8 is not going to be the best idea.
It would be relatively simple to script a solution to this, but I think this is treating the symptom, and not the cause.
