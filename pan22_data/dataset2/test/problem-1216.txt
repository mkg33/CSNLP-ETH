For example, Western Digital has a feature called TLER (Time Limited Error Recovery) as listed here: What is the difference between Desktop edition and RAID (Enterprise) edition hard drives?
Until recently some of the newer PERCs, H700 and such, did have a firmware that would not allow the use of non-Dell branded drives in a system.  I believe within the last month or so, they introduced a new firmware revision removing that limitation.
It would be unusual for DELL to be using some sort of proprietary drive.  The sales person may be referring to "enterprise" SATA drives which often times have firmware that helps when being used in RAID.
I don't see anything in this Dell Technical manual that rules out using any other brand of drive.  Pages 29 -  31 are the relevant ones.  It says you have to choose hot-swap or not when you buy the server and from the pictures it looks like if you go w/ cabled there'd be no problem using any old drive.  If you go w/ hot swap, you'd have to do what your said - take their drives out of the trays and put your own in.  That'll void your warranty, of course...
