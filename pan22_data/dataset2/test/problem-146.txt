I got a new notebook with Win7 Enterprise, Hungarian language. I like to use my OS fully in English, so I downloaded the English language pack and installed it. Now 98% of the user interface is in English all right, but I still bump into the occasional Hungarian language labels. For example, on the login screen I'm prompted to enter my "JelszÃ³" instead of "Password".
Is there a way to make sure that Win7 will use English, and only English, and nothing else but English after installing a language pack?
(Additional info: this was a vanilla win7 OEM, only software I downloaded before the language pack were a couple of high priority security updates)
Check out all the settings to make sure they are in English and then check both boxes in the bottom.
From here, you can change the other language settings such as the login screen and UAC prompts (which officially run as system - not as your user).
The way to change this is to go to Control Panel > Region and Language, then click the Administrative tab followed by the Copy Settings button.
You need to copy the English settings by opening the Region and Language properties box and doing the following.
