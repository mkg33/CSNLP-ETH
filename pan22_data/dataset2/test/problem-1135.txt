One help is the browser's bookmark converter tool: Just like it sounds, this will convert your existing bookmarks from another browser to Speed Dial entries. But it doesn't just add new tiles for each site in your bookmarks; instead it creates a tile that expands to show the bookmarks.
In Opera 18 how do you bookmark a page? I red here it used to be Ctr+D but that didn't work. I notice there's an "add to stash" icon but I have no clue what stash is. How can you remember a page so it can be visited in the future and give it an easy to remember name?
Stash is similar to the Reading List features I've been seeing appear in products like Windows 8, Safari, and mobile browsers. A heart icon always rests at the rightmost end of the address bar at all times; when you're at a page you have a mind to come back to later, just tap the heart. After that, when you open a new tab, you can click the Stash button at top center to see rows of your stashed sites' headers.
opera developer is trying to improve their bookmark system as soon as possible stated in the article.
Your bookmark is going into speed dial as they have decided it in new version so there is no bookmarkbar anymore. From this article I came to know about this as I don't use Opera
