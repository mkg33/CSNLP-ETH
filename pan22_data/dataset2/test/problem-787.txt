Click on the AdBlock button in your tool bar, and go to options. There is a list of filters currently applied. One that is not ticked by default is described as:
Regardless of its nature, the user must perform some action to make the box disappear so that the user can view the unobscured page. 
This is not a true "pop-up," in the sense that it is not a new browser window that has been created without the approval of the user; it exists within the already open window. But, it is a nuisance like a traditional "pop-up," because it either prevents the user from clicking or scrolling anywhere outside the box or dims the background to such a point that the original webpage content is obscured.
Sometimes the pop-up box is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It poses some patronizing question to the user, which merely serves as an "inviting" pretext to acquire the user's information. An example of this initial inquiry might be, "Are you a good person?"
You can use "No, thanks." browser extension. It is not free, but also not expensive and it blocks a lot more than just newsletter pop-ups: https://www.no-thanks-extension.com/
In case you are unfamiliar with the email-request pop-up that I've described, here is just one example (out of countless infringing websites):
Having to do this on a site by site, element by element, is not really an answer to the original question, since the OP is using Wired.com as an example to reference the type of popup in question.
We can make it more general using the google_ads text we saw earlier, and remove the limitation to Wired (note the * to make the text match less specific):
I have never once entered my personal information in any of these unsolicited boxes, and the likelihood is low that I will ever want to do so.
To be clear, I am not referring to the more oppressive form of pop-up box that might state an instruction along the lines of, "You must disable your ad-blocking extension before viewing this page." or, "Please disable Adblock to support us." 
If you refresh the page or click on a different article on this site, the pop-up will not appear again. That is, pop-ups are automatically prevented if one already has a Wired.com cookie saved on their computer.
Now that I've articulated the problem, I am hoping that somebody has a solution that would, ideally, work universally across all or most websites.
If the user wants to exit out of the box, the user is forced to click on an even more patronizing answer (which is supposed to be "clever"), e.g., "No, I am not. I like murdering puppies and stepping on sandcastles."
The real answer is that so long as you have Javascript enabled, there is no way to prevent these popups. Disabling Javascript works, but of course, that has other consequences that may render some website inoperable.
My fear is that the manner in which these websites implement the pop-up request boxes is too generic or broad for any extension to reliably block these pop-ups (that is, without also disabling desirable or user-initiated pop-up boxes in the process).
My justification? Before I would want to hand my contact information to a random website, I must first trust the website and be interested in its content. Generally, this process takes me more than a few seconds, so I habitually exit out of the box without ever considering its request.
The box usually requests some personal information, particularly an email address or social media account. The user must either provide this information or exit out of the box to see the webpage in its entirety.
There is an extension for Chrome and Firefox called NoScript, which at least makes the toggling of Javascript a single-click action.
In this specific example, while the background is only slightly dimmed (instead of being very dimmed or blurred), the page completely "freezes" when the pop-up appears. The user cannot scroll or click anything outside of the box. To close the box, the user must click on the "x" in the top-right corner of the pop-up, or submit their information.
While at times neither of these handicaps occur, the large box still dominates the screen, which is distracting.
I have tried downloading the Adblock, Adblock Plus, and uBlock Origin browser extensions and enabling every possible filter that is provided within these extensions. Still, I have found that these three extensions do not reliably inhibit the pop-up info-requests (which makes sense, as I don't believe that they are designed to).
The id and  name elements, while containing the text google_ads also contain data specific to this page. To make this blocking rule more general, I unticked those, leaving type and class, because IFRAMEs are hardly used any more, and one that is supposed to actively hide is pretty suspicious.
I used to use uMatrix for this, then got tired when 75% of websites used to break. But now I discovered a nice addon, 'open in incognito mode' wherein I can seamlessly open the page in incog without uM enabled
