Every time I've ran in to this issue, it's been the wireless card "slowly" dying. I've had multiple friends call me in to troubleshoot this same issue on Toshiba Satellite series laptops before. I'm gonna take a wild guess and say the laptop is older than 2008. Sometimes, components just fry before their designated lifespan. 
If this is only happening when you are running on your battery, check your power saver settings, as it may be putting your laptops WiFi adapter into a mode in which it uses less power. 
Long shot... but I've had similar experiences which I resolved by locking my router to a particular channel.
It isn't much of a fix, but I recommend just getting a new wireless card or disabling it & using a USB wireless dongle. 
Most routers nowadays are set to hunt out a quiet(er) channel if they experience heavy traffic  (collisions?).  Additionally, many are set to prefer to use channels 1, 6 or 11 (802.11bgn 2GHz).  I found that using channel 3 is best for my area, with another option being ch 9.
Seems that the router is jumping channels to find a less noisy frequency, and Windows then has to go hunting for it, taking time, 'dropping' the connection in the mean time.
Another area to examine is interference on the wifi channel your router is using.  Not sure what happened in my neighborhood but some wifi device using the same channel was constantly forcing my laptop nic to reset but after changing router to different channel, this seems to have stopped....if you download wifi analyzing tools, you might also see what's happening in your zone
This could likely be due to a power setting. Access your Device Manager and go to the properties for your wireless interface card. In the Advanced tab (or with certain models/drivers there is a "Power Management" tab), there are several power options in this section that may disable your wifi card over time.
If you're an Android user, the "Wifi Analyzer" app by Farproc is very useful to show channel usage in your area.
I've sometimes deleted the wireless NIC from the device manager to let my computer reinstall it to resolve issues similar to this.
