There are quite some window management commands; for example, :close is a variant of :quit that won't exit Vim. Though initially confusing, learn how to use them, as they are very powerful. :help windows has all the information.
You must have somehow arrived at a sole help window. Usually, :help splits a window, and a :q in that window will just close the help, and return to the other window.
I use Ctrl+W+C or Ctrl+W+Q, although I agree that like many other more modern read only windows, it would be more natural if we could quit it with just pressing q.
Or, you've typed the :q while in the other window, not the help. Vim doesn't "count" help windows as full windows, and will quit completely when only help windows would be left.
Use Ctrl+W followed by a cursor key to make sure your cursor is in the help window. Then try :q again.
:q is a little bit annoying since this is a readonly buffer. And I believe people rarely need to record a macro in help buffer.
It closes not the whole vim session, but only the active window (split section within vim). If this is window is the help, only the help will be closed. If your document is active, the document will be closed.
