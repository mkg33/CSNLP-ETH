You must Select and Copy text (by clicking the Left Mouse Button after you're done selecting). Simply selecting text does not copy it automatically (like the default windows console quick edit settings does).
I completed the settings above, and found that console2 select fails sometimes, i.e. on a particular console2 screen I can select some text but some text won't select.  
Console2 is not a shell. It is a console window enhancement. You can configure Console2 to run any shell you want such as cmd.exe or bash.
I can't figure out how to copy text from the console to the clipboard -- dragging over it with the mouse won't mark anything, and there is no option in the right-click menu to "mark" as in cmd.exe
The answer was a window sizing bug.  If you start console2 then drag the window to be taller, you may find that anything below the original lower border of the screen is not selectable.  If you drag the bottom edge of the console up and down a little, it seems to correct itself. 
Console2's key and mouse assignment is a bit funky.  Here's how to actually make left_click == select text:
Yes, Console2 is just a front-end and I also use it with msys bash, powershell, and the basic cmd.exe. The shortcuts may be the same for more than one function (I have left mouse button for select and clear selection). However, the default in the "behavior" tab in the settings defines BOTH automatic copy on select AND clear selection on copy, so it will look like the selection is immediately being discarded (the text is still being properly copied though). Just uncheck the clear selection on copy and the selected text will stay highlighted.
