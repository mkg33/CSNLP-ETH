I have the same error when downloading (running XP Pro 32bit SP3). Antivirus is Symantec Endpoint and i couldn't find any problems in here.
When finish, save it (make sure it got .reg extension at the end), and run it by double clicking on it. Problem solved.
I was plagued w/ this same download problem in Chrome, but also in IE and FireFox too.  Tried everything.  Nothing worked until I did a thorough AVG2013 uninstall including AVG in my Start Menu, registry keys, Program Files AVG directory folder removal, etc.  And voila, the downloads keep on coming!
Use another computer, I used my Chrome book, to DL the very small "Virus Scan Fix" file to a USB drive.
When i have this ticked the files will download, when it is unticked i get the same error again... So could well work for you too.
Thinking back, this whole Win7 DL problem started when upgraded to the new AVG2013 engine.  I've decided to go w/ Avast! free version for my anti-virus protection.
Go to the settings tab in Chrome, the 'show advanced settings. and tick the 'ask where to save each file before downloading'.
