I downloaded and re-installed the Adobe Creative Cloud desktop application. (Note: I could not uninstall it, so I just installed the download right over the existing one. There is a special program for uninstalling Creative Cloud if this doesn't work.) This cured my problem completely. 
So, I started windows task manager and clicked on the processes tab. After watching for a little while, I could see that the Adobe desktop manager was coming off and on the list simultaneously with the loss of focus change of color. 
For those with Creative Cloud, this might be the program. For those without, watching the processing tab and the change of color around the edges of the windows with each loss of focus may help you find the culprit.
I was having the problem of the active window losing focus every few seconds. I would have to left-click to keep on typing. Maddening.
My Samsung Galaxy S6 was in constant "Upgrading Android" and when connected through USB for charging, I've got lost focus problem every 10 seconds, but no explorer window popped up into front. I've changed usb port and selected to "Usb Charging" mode from phone, after that focus problem went away.
I noticed that the color scheme for the areas around the edges of the windows windows would change every time it happened. It seemed like and  easy way to see loss of focus without actually typing.
Check for a backup utility such as Gladinet or Nuance Cloud Connector. (Both use Gladinet's engine and this sort of problem was known to them in 2012 already.) They are running a windowless / task-less dll based within Explorer.exe.
