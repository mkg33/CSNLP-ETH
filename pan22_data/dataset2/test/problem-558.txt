In China, proxies do not really help. It does not totally disguise your identity. Data still has to be served to a chinese ip and that will most likely fail.
The problem with such requests is that the information is available not only to you, but to the opposite side, that tries to restrict you. Anyway, I suggest you to try some vpn server in another country. I use witopia when I need to connect securely from a public place, it's reliable, feature-rich, but not free, so YMMV. 
When I was working in China last year, I used a VPN and it worked perfectly. Some existing friends in China rent a VPN server for about Â£10 a month and it works for them...
There's a comprehensive discussion of foxyproxy and watching video from blocked countries in a recent episode of FLOSS. If I remember correctly, they say that, to be able to get good download speeds for youtube / video, you would probably have to pay for your proxy service. Again, the foxy proxy website has details of paid proxy servers. 
I suggest you migrate to the civilised world or get a SIM card from another country to open data connections over HSDPA / UMTS. In the bigger cities of China this worked for me.
It's also a great way to meet some nice people, there are lots of people who want to practice their English and enjoy talking with foreigners.
Foxy Proxy allows you to easily set up proxies on a site by site basis. The site also has notes on watching video from restricted countries. It's a firefox addon, so needs firefox to work. 
Are you in China now?  Just stop by any Internet cafe, you'll find plenty of people that know what to do and will be happy to help you.
