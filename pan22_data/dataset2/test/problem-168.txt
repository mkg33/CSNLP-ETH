The vast majority of time you will start to see bad sectors.  That is a sure sign the drive is starting to fail.  SMART has saved me many times.  I use software RAID 1 and it's very helpful since you simply replace the failing drive and rebuild the array.
However, the high Raw_Read_Error_Rate and Seek_Error_Rate is being pointed to as indications that the drives are dying.
I realized this discussion is a bit old but want to add my 2 cents.  I have found the smart information to be quite a good indicator of pre-fail.  When you get a smart threshold tripped then replace the drive.  That is what those thresholds are for.
My interpretation of this is that we have not had any bad sectors or other indications that any of the drives are actively failing.  
For further reading on the calculation of the normalised (between 0 and 100 values), see this article.
Make sure to install logwatch and redirect root to an email address and check the daily emails from logwatch.  SMARTD tripped flags will show up there but it's of no help if nobody is monitoring that regularly.
I think those fields can be safely ignored if you're running one in your case.  Just make sure the two fields are reporting the same number and in sync constantly.  If they're not...well... That actually might mean a problem.
We have a linux server that has been in heavy use for 3 years.  We're running a number of virtualized servers on it, some that have not been well behaved, and for a significant time the server's io capacity was exceeded leading to bad iowait.  It's got 4 500gb Barracuda sata drives connected to a 3com raid controller.  1 Drive has the OS, and the other 3 are setup raid-5. 
In my experience, Seagates have weird numbers for those two SMART attributes. When diagnosing a Seagate I tend to ignore those and look more closely at other fields like Reallocated Sector Count. Of course, when in doubt replace the drive, but even brand new Seagates will have high numbers for those attributes.
Sorry to commit necromancy on this post, but in my experience, the "Raw Read Error Rate" and "Hardware ECC Recovered" fields for a Seagate drive will quite literally go all over the place and increment constantly into the trillions range at which point they'll cycle back around to zero to continue the process again.  I've a Seagate ST9750420AS that has had that problem since day one and still works great even after quite a few years and 3500+ hours of use.
