If it's not really fun, move on.  If it is, just make your real-life implementation more like what you're imagining.  
When you close your eyes and imagine yourself playing the game, imagine every detail of how you're playing it.  Is it still fun?  Where's the fun?  Then how is that not matching up with what you're prototyping? 
Move on to another idea for a bit. If your brain drags you back to the first idea, revisit it. But don't let yourself get stuck.
And by trying to mash up these ideas you may stumble on something that makes your original basic concept work. I'd say the best advice is to not think of games as really having a SINGLE concept, but instead being a collection of ideas that may be better off in a slightly different form.
I think the key point here is that you can trick yourself that what you're working on is actually fun, but only when other people come into contact with it will you really be able to see whether it is.  Which means that you want to do that as early in the process as possible.  
In my opinion fun should be the core mechanic. It shouldn't need bells and whistles to make it fun - the fun should be there without the bells and whistles, you add those to make it deeper. If the core mechanic ain't fun, no bell or whistle will make it fun (unless one of those bells or whistles is the core mechanic.
The moment you have your first prototype, you should be having players test it, and watch how they experience it.  Maybe even before your first prototype (if you can figure out how to prototype the game in words and on paper).
And be willing to shoot your sacred cows.  If you have this click-heavy procedure for shifting the weeble-blatz left so that the snork-cannon gets an aim-bonus and getting that aim bonus is awesome(!) but doing the five hundred mouse clicks to get there sucks eggs, you need to either make the aiming-the-snork-cannon minigame fun on it's own or ditch the entire subsystem.  And sometimes the idea for your entire game started out with the snork-cannon aiming and you really, really, really don't want to cut it because it's your baby.  Shoot it in the head.
Also, it depends on your situation.  Do you have to ship something?  Do you have to buy groceries?  Are you doing this in your spare time as a matter of passion?  
Having said that, I once worked on a game where while coding it I realized it was missing that one thing that made it fun and something did pop in my head and was what made it tick. The core mechanic we defined simply wasn't fun. But in the end you should be able to point at one defining element that defines the fun factor in your game - what is it that turns it from interacting with a simulation to actually feeling challenged.
I like to analyze any ideas of mine that don't seem fun and break them down into a few components. The reason behind this is that there's probably SOMETHING you can salvage from any given failed game project for a future one. Maybe the arena combat gameplay doesn't match with your theme of atmospheric horror. Maybe most of the game is generic crap but there's on really COOL idea that kept tricking you into thinking the project was going somewhere. Figure out the bit of your concept that's the most interesting to you and see if you can jumble it up with a few ideas from other projects you've worked on our outside sources.
