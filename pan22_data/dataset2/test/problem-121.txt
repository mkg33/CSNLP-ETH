So I guess you went to your registrar to renew the domain by paying for it, which put it back on its previous nameservers.
Both 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8 and 9.9.9.9 now also have this set of nameservers for your  domain, so your problem seems solved:
Based on @MLu answer, we see the nameservers which are the one of your registrar (Amazon), as they were cached by some recursive nameservers.
You probably forgot to renew the domain name (since the registry shows its expiration date to be 2020-09-04T23:33:05Z) and when that happens many registrars will either suspend the domain (put the domain on EPP clientHold) status) or change the domain name nameservers, which will provide different answsers.
What else could be missing here? As far as I'm aware, nothing has changed since 2018. The domain was automatically extended earlier September if that makes a difference.
Instead of dns1.registrar-servers.com. it should be something like ns-123.awsdns-99.net. and similar. 
Go to your registrar (apparently that's Route53 Domain Registration) and make sure that the list of nameservers there matches the list of NS in your Route53 Hosted Zone thuijls.net.
