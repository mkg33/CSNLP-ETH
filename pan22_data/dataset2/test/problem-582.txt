if you have already servers and you want to ported to puppet/chef I suggest blueprint - this is a python tool 
Is an image management and deployment program.  It allows you to take a disk image of one machine, and deploy the exact same image to multiple other machines.  It also has some options to make basic configuration changes, and automate making those changes after pushing out an image.  (Basic things like probably not wanting all 500 user machines to have the same hostname, for example.)
Clonezilla doesn't have to fit into this anywhere, though it's a somewhat interesting idea, it would probably add too much complexity for too little value to the picture.  You'd probably want to use one tool to deploy the OSes initially (Clonezilla or Cobbler) and then one tool as your configuration manager (Puppet or Chef).
Yes, what you're suggesting is possible, and precisely what you'd use these tools in combination for.  You'd use Clonezilla or Cobbler to push out the initial installs, and Puppet to keep the configurations in sync once they're installed.  (And FYI, the other popular configuration manager for Linux you didn't mention is called Chef.)
Is a network installation manager and automation tool.  It would be used, much like Clonezilla, to help automate and standardize the installation process.  The most important difference between the two being that being that Cobbler standardizes the commands for doing network installs, rather than pushing out whole disk images.
You can also consider (R)?ex, it is easy to learn, and helps in  configuration management and software deployment. It needs SSH or HTTP on his nodes.
Typically, it's used (in an enterprise environment, at least) to deploy the same image and configurations to multiple user machines, so that everyone has the same desktop/laptop image and make helpdesk a little more tolerable.
As far as general advice... well, we don't really do that here, as it's too braod and subjective to be a good fit, so I'll just go with the three things that it's hard to go wrong with.
Is a configuration management suite.  It's used to create and maintain the same configurations on machines after they're imaged and setup.
And see below for a brief description of the programs in question, and links to their "about" pages, if you're not crystal clear on what they are and what they're used for.
As with Puppet, this is a configuration management suite.  It's used to create and maintain the same configurations on machines after they're imaged and setup.
