I know there are services out there but the best one i could find so far is Scancafe.com and they charge like $0.29 per photo so that's not going to be in my budget. 
I saw this article today, in case you do end up doing the 3rd party scanning route. Which I'd recommend cause it's a pain otherwise :)
29 cents is a good price! I'm going to check them out now. I can't imagine it being significantly cheaper than that-- especially if you're talking about irreplaceable photos that are effectively priceless.
Feed them all through (or at least batches of 50 or so), then find a utility to split the multipage images into separate image files?
The only other alternative is to buy a decent scanner and do it yourself. I've done that, but there are serious issues with it. One, it takes time-- a LOT of time. Two, there are quality/photography snags that keep it from being as good as you think it should be. My problem was dust. I had to wipe down each photo and the scanner bed everytime I scanned, then I spent a long time finding the optimal resolution and fussed endlessly with white balance.
I have about 700-800 standard sized photos sitting up in my room that i want to get scanned in before something happens to them (flood fire lost). 
For the negatives you have use a negative scanner. These come with a cassette into which you load the negative strip and you can then feed these through the scanner to process many images at a time. The image of this one on Amazon shows the cassette.
