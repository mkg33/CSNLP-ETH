As far as I can tell adding the person or group where I was should fix it, but nothing seems to be working when I try it.  I've even tried giving a user full admin rights on that server, putting them in the administrator group...same results.  Anyone have any idea why I'm getting this and how to make it work?  Thank you in advance!

I'm currently running a Windows 2008 R2 print server.  Everything seems to work fine, except that i can't seem to cancel jobs stuck in the queue.

I've tried adding our helpdesk there as a group, individually, even adding myself and giving myself full rights.  Every option gives me the same result.  When I click "Cancel" or "Cancel All Docuements" I get the following error:
