The second possibility is to use an imaging program, so you end up with an exact copy of your old installation (which means that if you had unexplained glitches, they will probably stay). I cannot tell you much about advantages and disadvantages of this method, as I've never used it. Clonezilla (http://clonezilla.org/) is a free imaging program with good reputation, and I think that you even don't need a second PC, but can run the imaging process from a kind of LiveCD. But you'll have to find out how to use it for yourself, I cannot help you here. 
About question #2, there are two ways. If you want a clean install and have a Win7 install medium (some PCs are sold with only a recovery partition) : Go into the BIOS and choose the SSD as the drive from which the PC should boot. Then you change the boot order (also in the BIOS) to be 1. optical device, 2. SSD. You put your Win7 DVD into the optical device and do a clean install. Then install all software you want, copy the data you back-uped first, and change all the settings in all the programs you use (hint: don't forget to use Firefox Sync or an analogue for other browsers before you start). This is a great way to remove cruft from an OS. 
Whatever you do, please invest in an external HDD (should currently cost ~$70 for a terabyte if you're not after speed), copy all your data to it before starting, then pull it out and don't plug it in again until the new installation is complete. The idea "all my data is already on the D: partition and I'm not going to touch it anyway" can go terribly wrong in too many ways. 
I am not so sure about question 1, because my computer was built by the seller. I think not, but somebody else has to tell for sure.
