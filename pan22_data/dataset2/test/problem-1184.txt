I think you should just use it if it really improve your productivity on the internet. But if you need to go to the sites banned by the government then don't use it.
I had the same experience when I tried OpenDNS, noticing Level3 was faster.  Plus I didn't like some of the redirection OpenDNS does.  I don't want my DNS thinking for me.  :)  Just fast.
I tried it last night, but noticed it was slower than Level3 DNS, so I switched back this morning.  I think it depends on your location.  I'm in the east coast, so I think that's why I notice better performance with Level3.
Using google as DNS would mean they will see ANY DNS search or in other words they would know about any site you (likely) went to and so you provide them with a LOT of somewhat personal info, which they could collate with the other info they gather on you, make sure you are fine with that and be aware that if the law changes or there is some subpoena they could then be handing that info over to authorities who as you know will 'use anything you say against you'.
I did speed comparisons 3 times during the day and night yesterday, and both my ISP's DNS, and Level3 came back as faster than Google DNS.
