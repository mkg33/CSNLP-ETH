VLANs are layer-2 domains, and they end at a layer-3 boundary (router). A layer-2 frame is stripped from the layer-3 packet at the first router it encounters. When the layer-3 packet reaches the second router, a new layer-2 frame will encapsulate the packet for the VLAN of the destination subnet.
If the packet's destination address belongs to the IP subnet on VLAN 10, then the router will forward the packet onto that VLAN.  I am assuming that the IP subnet for VLAN 10 is different at each site.
Based on your diagram, 10.0/16 is the subnet on both sites. For that to work, one would need a bridge between sites. An IOS tunnel interface could achieve this. (as could several other methods) Bridge "VLAN 10" (whatever interface that may be) and the tunnel interface, and it should work [tunnel and vlan remain layer-2 interfaces; the BVI handles layer-3.] Some tweaking would be required to keep the DHCP domains isolated -- since this creates one broadcast domain.
A better solution would be to segment each site into it's own subnet. And place each guest lan into an isolated, local-only VLAN. Then let routing and VPN(s) (tunnel or not) handle everything. VRF and/or ACLs can isolate and restrict guest access.
