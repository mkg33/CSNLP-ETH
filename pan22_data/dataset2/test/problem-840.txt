That's supposing that the players spawn only at the beginning of the game.  If they spawn later, I guess you'd want to put them as far as possible from any player's current position – at a vertex of the Voronoi diagram defined by the other players.
At the beginning of the game, spawn all players in the center of the map, but without any means of harming the other players. They will then have to swarm out and acquire the means to engage each other (build a base, pick up a weapon, gather resources, etc.)
You can do this by making a flat map which is square, and joining each edge to a copy of the opposite edge. When a player walks off the side, they are teleported without the player's knowledge to the opposite edge. Of course, theoretically you would not be able to see players on the other side of the boundary. To fix this, create clones of that player which appear to walk around on the other side of the boundary so that you can see them, and when you run towards them you teleport across and the actual player is stood where the dummy was.
There is either a bit of luck or map knowledge involved in finding a good start location early (depending on whether you use procedural or handmade maps). But when and where to settle is mostly a strategic decision. Deploying early gives you a time advantage, but puts you in a dangerous position. Picking your base carefully puts you behind in the early-game, but can be a decisive advantage in the mid- and late-game.
If the playing field is a topological torus (i.e. a rectangle where going “out of bounds” means entering at the opposite side), this is likely to be a good answer: player j spawns at x = (pjW/N) mod W, y = (qjH/N) mod H, where W,H are the dimensions of the rectangle, N is the number of players, and p,q are integers to be determined; they are distinct, (probably) relatively prime, and not too far from sqrt(N).  The spawn points form an oblique ‘wallpaper’ pattern.
Going for something not suggested so far: Make it so there is no centre of the map. What I mean by this is that the map edges join onto the opposite sides. This would take a lot of programming work, but in practise it can make the level repeat itself infinitely if you walk in one direction. This means that there is no centre, and a random spawn position will have no advantages or disadvantages.
Alternatively, the entire map could exist on the outside of a sphere, however this makes coordinates difficult for spawning.
As in, there's a square of a certain size that spawns around every player and follows that player around - no other player can spawn within that square.
