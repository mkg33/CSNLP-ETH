When you once install windows 10 and activate it, you can always for free install the same version of windows 10 that you previously activated on your computer and it will activate again.
Also, if windows does not activate, you may still be able to use your windows 8 key to activate windows, but if you have a windows 8 home key, you can obviously only activate a windows 10 home version.
So I got Windows 8 out of the box, upgraded for free to Windows 8.1,  then to Windows 10 (again for free). Then I installed Ubuntu, then went back to Windows 10 (cracked). I had a PC expert I know install Windows 10 cracked on my PC. Seems like he used this hack "AutoKMS" and it worked. But it seems like he got an unofficial version of the hack that had a "surprise" in it. If you know what I mean.
I know that product keys can be reused and are saved in the motherboard. So... If I do a legitimate clean install is it gonna activate for free?
Windows Defender detected some Trojan I don't remember the name of so I deleted it. Then another Trojan came: Kaymunder.C. and I deleted that too. But for safety I wanna have a legit clean install.
Lastly, KMSpico is always found to be bad by windows defender, because they know very well what the program is supposed to do and want to scare away users with a false positive.
