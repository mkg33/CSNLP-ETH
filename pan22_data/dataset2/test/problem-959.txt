A lot of developers  here use AllRoundAutomations "PL/SQL Developer" tool, so many in fact that we bought a site license. Single seats can be had for US$180 per seat. It fits your requirements. I have not personally used the debugger but it is a mature product, I would expect it to work as advertised. 
While I have grown quite fond of Oracles SQL Developer, have you considered trying Toad as an alternative for Oracle's SQL Developer? (You can download a 30 day trial from Quest's website.) 
The product of Quest Software full fill all need and is easy to use. Currently I am running Toad version 11.
Toad is an option... but can be pricey. It satisfies your want-list. If you want to pay for all the bells and whistles and have to support a lot of differenct databases it might be worth it for you. 
But as far is goes to the free software the "Oracle SQL Developer", IMHO the best software to connect with Oracle.
I haven't found anything 'free' that works as well as Oracle SQL Developer. In the past it was pretty buggy and frustrating. I am on a 3.0 Early Adopter release now and very happy with the improvements. I am a heavy user and have had no crashes in the 3 months since going to this release. I wasn't sold on the interface early on but I am familiar with it now and very productive with it. I also make great use of the User Defined Reports -- all the SQL Queries I had floating in text documents for troubleshooting I wrap into their own custom reports.
