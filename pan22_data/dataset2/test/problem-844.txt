Okay, so I've researched this question and found many answers but not the question that I need answered. I have the following internet setup in my room. We have a wireless router in the living room but the signal doesn't reach my bedroom. I have the wireless router wired to a device that sends the signal though the electrical wiring in the house to my room. It does slow down the speed quite a bit but I can deal with it and it works fine for what I need. Now I want to hook up my PS4 to the internet and want to split the connection that is coming out of the wall. Both my computer and PS4 are hooked up to the same TV/monitor so they will never be on at the same time so they will never compete for the same signal or "talk" to each other. For what I want to do, is it possible to use one (1) ethernet splitter that I can buy as little as 99 cents or do I need to buy a switch?
P.S. I tried to use an old router to split the signal but it didn't work. Both my computer and my PS4 were able to connect to the network but unable to connect to the internet. I don't see or understand why they could get on the network but not the internet. Seems to me if you can connect to one you should be able to connect to another. I am anxious to get things working as soon as possible and greatly appreciate any help you can give me.
