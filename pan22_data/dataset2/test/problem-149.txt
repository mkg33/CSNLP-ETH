Alternatively you can use DVD Imager (up to Leopard) for creating a DVD image that you can burn on a DVD with Disk utility. Internally, it uses mkisofs (not available on Mac OS X but shipped with DVD Imager in its resources subfolder - ctrl-click on DVD imager icon and choose "show contents of packet") with a command line similar to this one:
Mount a blank DVD to the Mac Finder, drag the two ..._TS folders to it, burn it.  Works for our studio 100% of the time, has for years.
I'm trying (on a Mac using Disk Utility) to burn this to a DVD.  I've created a DVD/CD master image of this structure in a couple of different ways and then burned them, none of which have produced a DVD that is viewable in my DVD player.  Here's what I've tried so far:
Many data burning utilities can create Video DVDs, but you need to make sure they don't try to burn as a data DVD -- data DVDs won't necessarily lay out the files in the proper order, and may use the wrong filesystem for the disc.
The backstory: I've purchased a DVD via online download (from EZTakes.com).  The files appear in this kind of directory tree:
Oh, I believe the medium itself isn't an issue.  I'm using DVD-R discs, and both DVD players I tried these burns on claim to be able to play DVD+/-R discs.
So I'm wondering what contents the filesystem image needs to have.  What's the right structure so that my DVD will play in a regular DVD player?
Drag them into Toast, burn a UDF data DVD, works 100% of the time for our studio, has for years.  Tons of techno-bable over nothing, if you ask me.
In a technical sense, the VIDEO_TS folder already contains the video data in DVD format.  A Video DVD is the contents of this VIDEO_TS folder burned onto a DVD+/-R disc in a hybrid ISO9660+UDF filesystem.  As Steve Rowe has mentioned, Video DVDs use UDF v1.02.
The format of the disc for a DVD is UDF.  When playing back a DVD on a computer, this is what is used to access the files.  However, older consumer disc players don't use this structure to read the disc.  Instead they use the alternate ISO-9660 file structure.  Make sure you are burning your disc as UDF 1.02 or UDF + ISO 9660 if you want the most compatibility with consumer players.
See Doom9's DVD Structure article for details of the filetypes.  When burned as a Video DVD, the files in the VIDEO_TS folder are layed out on the disc in a particular order.  For example (notice the files are not layed out in alphabetical order):
If you have the mkisofs command available (in the Terminal on MacOSX and Linux, or Windows with Cygwin), or the hdiutil command on OSX, you can make a ready-to-burn ISO with one of the following commands (source):
