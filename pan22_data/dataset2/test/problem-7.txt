The main reason why I want rid of this responsibility is spam.  It is compute- and resource-expensive to filter inbound spam with any kind of effectiveness.  It takes time and effort on my part to maintain the spam filtering to ensure that we are as up-to-date as possible with the techniques being used by the spammers.  And then there are times when your tools seem to be actively mis-maintained by the maintainers, such as when SpamAssassin started marking up everything with a date in 2010 or later because it was impossibly far in the future.
But most of all, I probably wouldnt do it all. I would "go for an external provider with a good privacy policy and encrypted data instead?"
The security I currently have on the VPS is limited to iptables and installing/running the bare minimum of what I need (currently basically irssi and lighttpd).
I have a VPS running Debian (with a dedicated IP + reverse DNS), and I'm a fairly capable Linux administrator, having setup a couple of webservers, home networks, and looking over the shoulder of sysadmins at work.

In both cases it was like walking on red hot nails bare foot while eating most spicy chilly mixed with most throat burning alcohol. 
I want a secure mail solution, as I am looking to move away from Google and other parties looking into my private data.
If you want to have a feeling for what you are doing you need to get familiar with the terms of mailserver setup and from there decide what tradeoffs you can live with. I have no great oevrview at hand, but here is the checklist I would follow(my experience is 1-2years old):
Email used to be interesting and fun.  Now it's just one long, slow, hard kick in the nuts (pardon my colloquialism).
I have used this tutorial twice, both times I failed multiple times to get everything working correctly. First time I spend 2 days while I got it working. (about 5-6 years ago) 
For some example as a webdeveloper I can relate to php. It has extensions, you can also configure things by just looking on the keyboard.
Look at MS Server setting up a mail server is mostly next next finish and it works and it can do the same thing.
Secondary-MXing is broken.  Spammers just beat up on that, and your system gets to accept, then scan and possibly bounce, drop, or false-negative it into your users mailbox.  Frankly I never secondary-MX anymore because if my primaries are offline for longer than it takes email to die then I've got bigger problems (probably headed by the need for finding a new job).
Using black-lists can skim much of it off, but inevitably someone finds a blacklisted host that they want to receive mail from.  
How much of a PITA is it to setup my own mailserver? Should I go for an external provider with a good privacy policy and encrypted data instead?
Then there are the RFC-nazis.  You'll get blacklisted if you are not strictly RFC compliant.  And then you'll get shouted down by people who hate the fact that your anti-spam choses to bounce rather than just drop, meaning the innocent people used as header-forging get buried in the back-scatter.
I run several mail servers of varying sizes ranging from my own for two users to hundreds of IMAP mailboxes.  My opinion of email can be summed up by telling you that I am planning to decommission my own private mail server and move to Gmail for my domain.
Someone trying to email one of your users gets blacklisted so they can't mail you?  That's your problem.  The email is always of earth-shattering importance and it is up to you to create an exception to let their email in.
If you run a mail server, blacklisting is always your problem.  You get blacklisted so your users can't mail out?  That's your problem.  Especially when the blacklist is some penny-ante ISP in Southern Wisconsin which is blacklisting you because ten years ago your IP block was used by some fly-by-night DSL provider and not the backbone provider it is today.  Or they insist that they have to run a "relay test" on your server before they'll de-list you, even though the IP that is in their list is an outbound-only IP and doesn't accept email from the internet at large. 
When setting up a mail server, is there a lot of stuff to take into consideration? Will my outgoing mail be marked as spam on other servers if I don't implement a number of solutions? Will reliable spam filtering be difficult to setup? Can I easily encrypt the stored mail?
Greylisting works much of the time too, but some relay systems just can't deal with it properly -- and even though greylisting is legal, dealing with the broken systems is your problem.
To answer your question, I think it´s because of the Unix community mindset. If a "Dr. Poweruser Sysadmin Hacker Pentester John Doe" can set it up then don´t fix it and let it be the way it is.
