We recently moved 50+ Dell servers (1650, 1850, 2850, 1950, 2950, etc.) and various other components (switches, firewalls, etc.) in two racks to a new data center 30 miles away (no mountains involved). We secured all of the equipment in both racks, wrapped the racks with moving blankets, strapped them in the back of a moving truck equipped with air shocks and had 6 movers move each one for us. When the racks were placed on the data center floor we reseated all hard drives, recabled all of the equipment and, knock on wood, 2 months later we're still running without a blip.
The most likely components to have trouble are the ones with moving parts - HDs, PSUs and CPU fans.  It's also possible for cables and even PCI cards to work loose in transit.
You don't mention how long the drives have been in use, how old they are, etc. The longer they've been running 24/7 the greater the chance they won't spin back up.
Having said all of that, I've placed Dell servers at the tender mercies of courier companies before, and on longer trips down twisty narrow and hilly countryside roads, and they've always come up smiling.
Pack everything very well, but label and remove each and every drive and pack them separately and transport them separately from the servers/racks. Hand-transport them in your car with foam lined cartons, then plug them all back into the proper server and drive slot, so that hopefully they'll take less punishment in your car than in the back of a transport truck. Some would probably argue this is overkill, however.
Travel with the backups and servers separately. An accident or incident shouldn't kill both your data systems and your backups.
I can't speak towards the 2850s specifically, but the 1950s are quite resilient and have survived far more than some bumps on a road.
Buy some spare drives. You will most likely have a few die. If not now, definitely down the road :-) 
What I'd do is pop out the components in question, box them separately (using lots of bubble wrap) and transport them in the boot of someone's car.  Making sure to clearly label what belongs where of course (goes without saying).  When reassembling all cables and cards then get an extra nudge to ensure that they're seated correctly.
How old are the servers? We had some old (5 year) video storage servers that had about a 10% hard drive failure rate when we had to just shut them down for a few hours for power maintenance. We figured the 24x7 fatigue on the hard drives finally caught up when they were spun down and then fired back up. Something we definitely didn't expect from performing a soft shutdown/startup.
