Sure, they not exactly these nice wall plug solutions but high quality power supplies solve 90% of the problems with long term use of the Pi. Just saying. You do not have to get on of these but I keep repeating this so people understand that the wall plug USB power supplies are like going fishing in stormy weather.
You do not have to break the bank, you can get these of ebay or dx.com for about a fiver for a 3A and under a tenner for 5A.
Removing the LCD power supply coming out of a Pi USB socket will unfortunately remove the touch data going into the Pi.
You should invest in a a slightly higher quality power supply. Forgot these cheap USB things. I am talking about power efficient switching power supplies that only use as much power as you need AND provides clean DC power.
You should endevaour to split as much away from the Pi as possible. Like using USB HUBs, which again, can be powered by 1 good power supply, bypassing the Pi. 
I do hope this tip can be used by a keen enthusiast or two but it may be that a powered hub may be a better option.
So the (slightly) tricky part is to open up the LCD power lead and cut the red and black power leads, and I do mean snip them and bring them out to connect to the additional power supply that will be used for the LCD display. So the USB plug still attaches to the Pi to enable the touch data. This sounds simple to me and would be easy to implement but I understand that some non electrically minded folk might assume this is way too complicated a task. Maybe someone here could draw a simple diagram to show how this will work.
You do not need to use separate power supplies. You can just use one bigger power supply and split the power cables out. In general it is a good idea to not overload the Pi. So that means if you can power the LCD using the seperate power cables, just by pass the Pi and wire it directly to the power supply!
