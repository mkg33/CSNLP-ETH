The difference between logging into the computer via this method and by initially logging on the account by establishing a Remote Desktop session is that this method is the equivalent of logging in at the machine's physical console. As a result, programs that do not play nice in an RDP session are more likely to work correctly.
You can try configuring the server to automatically log on a user account on system startup.  This is accomplished by configuring the registry.
Be aware that this, in fact, does logon an account at the machine's physical console. Any user that has access to the console, including via a virtual machine management interface, will be able to access the machine via this already logged-on user account. Take this into account when using this method.
We use it on an old 2003 box to run rules in Outlook for an ancient (and soon to be deprecated) application.  Outlook only works if someone is logged on to the machine.  Firedaemon makes it appear that we are always logged on.  You also don't have to always be RDPd and logged into the machine with it.
