Here's my suggestion. While it doesn't answer your question it does give you a direction to follow to either:
Outside of significant amounts of code, exchange/outlook plugins, etc. Exchange/Outlook are just not designed to meet your needs.  There are a lot of your requirements that are theoretically possible, but what breaks it for me is the:
Say I'm an authorized user.  I send an email to a super-secret group, and carbon copy someone who shouldn't know about it (or the message gets forwarded to them); "security" defeated.  This scenario is pretty much guaranteed to occur when there's no training allowed.
Authorized User 1 has a hallway conversation with Authorized User 2 about sending out a mail to Super Secret Group X.  Unauthorized User 3 overhears.  Group name compromised.
Doing a lot of those things would be "rigs" at best, so I'd never be willing to back that statement.
Open a support case with the Microsoft Exchange Server support team. It'll cost you less than US $300.00 and is going to either help you accomplish this or prove to the PHB that it's not possible.
Don't really align themselves very well.  As recommended by @joequerty I'd get MS on the phone (sounds like you are probably a pretty big shop and probably have a support contract in place) and see what they say about all this.  They may have some super secret hacks they can use to make this happen that aren't published to the outside world.
One horribly ugly idea I'll throw out would be to write a custom transport agent to enforce some of the crazy confidentiality rules, as normal transport rules aren't at all flexible enough.
Treating distribution groups with the sensitivity level of nuclear secrets is pretty much destined for failure.  As we've discussed in some of your previous questions, there are some means to hide groups on the Exchange side with a lot of wrangling, but when you're trying to enforce policy completely on the technical side and not on the human side at all, it's not going to work.
