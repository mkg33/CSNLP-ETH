Quote ssh-with-port as a single argument like -e 'ssh -p 2222' or -e "ssh -p 2222". What you wrote specifies ssh as the argument to the -e option then the -p option to rsync (same as --perms) followed by a probably spurious filename, which would give an error if connection (and authentication) succeeded.
I am trying to push a directory to my computer running SSH on port 2222. See below. I get a connection refused error. Any idea how I can make this work?
Do not use $2222. That would not specify the number 2222; in singlequotes it would specify the actual string $2222 which is not a number, in doublequotes it would expand to the second positional parameter of your shell, which is probably an empty string, followed by 222.
Alternatively, as the man page says, you can use the ssh config file (normally) .ssh/ssh_config to specify the port automatically (for all, one, or some hosts). That also applies to other things you do that use ssh, such as scp sftp and of course ssh, which is probably desirable here.
