I often perform upgrades on my client servers via remote desktop. While it's quite powerfull tool, when you want to transfer 100 MB it's a bit of slow. Therefore I use zip to make files smaller and avoid necessity of installing additional software on a client's server.
I recommend you 7z if your need a simple click'n'decompress, or NSIS if you need something customizable.
I don't know what you mean by "not implemented - error on 64bit system", but 7zip has supported 64bit Windows for a long time. I use it to create sfx archives on several x64 machines. Personally, I would stick with 7zip; it's free, and it gives around about the same compression ratios as Winrar in my experience (sometimes better, sometimes worse - depending on the file type and content). The only thing I've found it to be poor with is JPEGs.
winrar is very fast and supports sfx. Rar also suports many compression formats and is available for a variety of OSs
I use WinRar. For a loss of a few kb (as compared to 7zip) it's far more prevaliant that 7zip, and will create SFX archives at the cost of about 50kb. I use it on x64 workstations and x64 servers without any issues at all.
7zip is a good alternative, but recently I cannot force it to make SFX archives (not implemented - error on 64bit system).
