3.2) Intel Management Engine Components (PCI Simple Communications Controller): Chipset_Driver_MNN8P_WN_8.0.0.1262_A03.EXE
2.4) Click on "Load Driver", click "Browse" and select "Removable Disk" (the flash memory device). Then select the directory "Serial-ATA_Driver_VWCH1_WN_11.6.0.1030_A02\f6flpy-x64\f6flpy-x64". The complete list of partitions should appear after installing the driver.
3.6) Intel Centrino Advanced-N 2230 WiFi (Network Controller): Network_Driver_HP8FN_WN_15.3.1.2_A03.EXE
Notes: If the installation of the SATA driver fails, retry. It is also possible to have unexpected blue screen errors for "iaStor.sys" (address FFFFF880030A043B) when Windows is about to automatically restart, but they can be ignored (seemingly). These problems occurred to me only when using the alternate method (making a bootable DVD including the SATA drivers). 
There is no need to install “Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver” nor configuring anything. After downloading "SetupRST.exe" from Intel web page, I was surprised to see that the System drive was already being accelerated:
I actually followed the instructions from the following site... Step number 4 describes the changes that need to be made in the BIOS in order to Install a fresh copy of Windows 7.
Note: At the end of my install I had no network drivers loaded, so had to download these from Dell copy them across to the laptop and then perform an installation. Once installed I had network/Internet access and could complete all other software upgrades directly from the laptop.
NOTE: An alternate method (more complex and with few advantages) is making a bootable DVD from the original Windows installation disk for including the SATA drivers. This is explained in “Tutorial: How to clean install Windows on Inspiron 17R SE” (forum.notebookreview.com/dell-inspiron-dell-studio/686824-tutorial-how-clean-install-windows-inspiron-17r-se.html). Instead of using "Ultraiso" (the evaluation license cannot work with Windows DVD because it contains files greater than 300 MB), "Imgburn" (www.imgburn.com/) can be used for making the bootable image. See “How to create a Windows Vista / 7 installation disc (bootable) using ImgBurn” (forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=11194).
2.3) After selecting Windows installation language and accepting the license terms, select "Custom (advanced)" installation type. Then the list of available disks and partitions will appear (not all of them will be shown because a proper SATA driver is missing). So:
I have just managed to get rid of Windows 8 and installing Windows 7 in my laptop. I hope this helps:

2.2) Reboot the laptop, press F12 (Boot Options), change the UEFI boot mode to Legacy (Secure boot: OFF) and boot from the DVD. Windows installation process should start.
3.4) Realtek USB 2.0 Card Reader Controller (USB2.0-CRW): Chipset_Driver_MTT9W_WN_6.1.8400.39030_A01.EXE
install windows XP, then u are free to install the rest. Something to do with RAID or some ish, worked for me, windows 8 pro 64bit installed fine after XP and even the Wifi driver were there
3.5) Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller (Ethernet Controller): Network_Driver_P7W53_WN_7.065.1025.2012_A02.EXE
I found the cause. You need to go to the UEFI with F2 and set the option Load Legacy Option ROM to true. 
Note: Delete the existing partitions and create a new one if the installation complains about "GPT style" partitions.
1.3) Save the resulting files into a flash memory device, within a folder named “Serial-ATA_Driver_VWCH1_WN_11.6.0.1030_A02” (for example).
I had the same problem, but found I could install Win 7 Pro if I changed the BOOT mode to "Legacy; Secure boot: OFF".
1.1) Download all required Windows 7 (64 bits) drivers from DELL (http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/Product/inspiron-17r-se-7720). The SATA driver (Serial-ATA_Driver_VWCH1_WN_11.6.0.1030_A02.EXE) is needed while installing Windows. The rest (see the list in Section 3) will be needed after installing Windows.
I had the same problem with a very similar laptop and was able to figure out how to get passed the Windows Starting freeze screen.
When preparing (see Section 1), the following drivers for Windows 7 should have been downloaded from www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/Product/inspiron-17r-se-7720. Installing them in this order worked for me:
1.2) Execute “Serial-ATA_Driver_VWCH1_WN_11.6.0.1030_A02.EXE” and select the option that allows to extract the contents of the package without installing the drivers.
2.1) Plug the flash memory device (including DELL Inspiron SATA drivers) and insert Windows 7 installation DVD.
3.3) Intel USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller (Universal Serial Bus Controller): Chipset_Driver_M2RXF_WN_1.0.6.245_A03.EXE
