For a filesystem that will have mostly large files, I would recommend using XFS.  It has great performance for large file sizes and is very mature.  JFS is worth mentioning, as well and has similar performance to XFS and is just as mature.  
Another option for direct storage (in addition to Alex's NFS recommendation), is to use iSCSI.  I export storage to my Windows and Linux boxes via iSCSI using iSCSI Enterprise Target.  Failing the need for direct access, samba will do the trick just fine.  Just don't export over samba storage that you've imported over NFS; you'll have file locking problems.
Given all access to the filesystem from non-Linux systems will be through an abstraction layer, pick whatever you want! I'd suggest your distro's default (ext3 probably). Media storage has no special needs in terms of speed or reliability, so you'll just add unnecessary complexity picking an exotic filesystem. In terms of the specific use cases you mentioned:
However, depending on your distro, it might do you well to put the filesystem on top of LVM so that you can expand your storage seamlessly.  Going one step further, I'd put the filesystem on LVM on top of a RAID array.  This way you gain fault tolerance and performance while maintaining your ability to scale.  
DLNA is designed EXACTLY for sharing media across a network, there are several choices for linux - like mediatomb or ushare.
XFS is best for storing video because it's very stable and has excellent large file support. It's not even exotic anymore.
