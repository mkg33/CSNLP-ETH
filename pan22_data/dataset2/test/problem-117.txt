The key here is that you have to measure the current traffic (per session and/or user) and trend that based on the anticipated number of future sessions and/or users. While it should be easy to measure the current traffic levels, anticipating future growth will be a little trickier and some part of the answer falls on the customer. How many sessions and/or users do they expect to use the site in the next month, 6 months, 12 months?
How can you calculate expected traffic without a historical trend of traffic on the system?  I would implement one or more of the following:
Calculating expected traffic is not an easy task, the best way would be to have some sort of network traffic monitor installed, setup 10 testing engineers and tell them to browse the site and then collect bandwidth data used by 10 users. Once you have this data, you will get per user usage and then you can determine other parameters like how it will drive users? I mean how do people will know about your site and they will come? by ads? or you already have fixed number of users visiting your site?
The customer asking you to estimate what the future traffic level will be is analogous to them asking you when the lightbulb in the broom closet is going to burn out. You can give them an approximation based on the rated life of the bulb and it's current useage, but it's hard to predict what might happen in the future. Will the light bulb be turned on more or less frequently in the next month, 6 months, 12 months?
ratio like P/E value compared to similar companies. technically you can profile os or just logfile analyzer or oldschool grep through logfiles are used. depends on technical load or market penetration. first probably serverside measures and latter surely most reliable always validate via external service, don't measure yourself, and compare relative others instead of absolute value. 
you can apache/IIS/lighthttpd/etc.. log parsing program to know the traffic. The most well know is awstat.
