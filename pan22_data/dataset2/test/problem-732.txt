This formula simply returns the index of the first - and only - row that is a match for the previous conditions (matching UID and DATE (which was the maximum date that matches the UID)).    
The MATCH formula searches the array returned by the IF (same conditions as above, but simply returns TRUE if it is a match), for the first TRUE value. The 3 parameter, 0, demands an exact match.
This array formula simply performs the equivalent of an SQL WHERE clause with two conditions: for all rows that match both the UID (A column) and DATE (B column), return the row's value in the C column (STATUS).   
* FOOTNOTE: if you are not familiar with Array formulas (though I think you are), see this: basically you enter the original formula that should result in an array of values (without the squiggly {}), then press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. Excel adds the squiggly {} for you, and calculates all the values as an array. 
If all else fails combine all the data onto one sheet sort by date (make sure formated the same way) then copy the most current date to new spreadsheet then the next most current date so on. Go to the Data tab remove duplicates.  Since excel keeps the 1st record entered into the spread sheet and removes the next occurring duplicate this should work.
The first formula should have been good enough, but since we don't have a way to pull out only the non-null (or non-FALSE) value, and Excel does not have a COALESCE formula, we need to resort to a little indirection.
If you get an error saying that it can't find any visible tables, just click OK and in the Options dialog box select System Tables from the show list. That should then give you access to the sheets in your worksheet
I have several spreadsheets with information I need to consolidate, each with different (and sometimes overlapping) portions of the final data set I'm hoping to create. Typically, combining spreadsheets with similar data is easy to do by dumping all the data into one sheet and using Remove Duplicates. However, I want to make sure that the line items which are left represent the latest version of the duplicates.
Here is a several-step solution, assuming you can do some of this manually, and don't need a single completely automated solution: (and if you do, I'm sure you can take it from here...)  
Click the SQL button and you get access to the query itself, which I think you need to change to something like the below (using a GROUP BY and MAX to get the latest date):
Now it is simple enough, to take the index of the matching row from the MATCH, and pull out the corresponding STATUS value from the IF array. This returns a single value, your new STATUS, which is guaranteed (if you've done all these steps correctly) to be from the latest date for each UID.   
What I need is for my output to contain only one line item for each UID, and have data from the STATUS field which matches the most recent DATE for that UID from the input sheets.
@AviD is correct, in that Excel isn't a database, but you can import your data into another spreadsheet via a Microsoft Query data source. It's a bit ugly, but will give you access to a SQL statement, which should enable you to get what you want.
