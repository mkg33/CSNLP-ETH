just checking...is it because of the https/ssl (443). I remember that SSL is not mandatory (but recomended) for WSUS setups.
Opening https://65.55.185.26 on the server computer ought to give you a Windows Update page. If it doesn't, you've got communication issues.
First I would uninstall and re-install and configure IIS and if that's not succesfull then I would rebuild the WSUS-server and install WSUS 3.0 SP3. This could be the fastest way to get WSUS environment up and going. In fact I did this when I was upgradring WSUS 3.0 SP3 into new server.
If you're seeing nothing coming back from 65.55.185.26 then you should start sniffing at the border of the network to see if the server's requests are making out to the Internet or not (and, if they are, seeing if response are coming back). This has the feel that something is firewalling either your requests outbound or the responses coming back.
I'm happy to see you're using Network Monitor to see what's on the wire. When you say "it receives nothing in return", are you saying that you're seeing TCP SYN requests going to 65.55.185.26, port 443, and not seeing anything coming back at all?
My dumb self didn't check the edge firewall rules well enough when I removed the TS Gateway role from this server. An outbound NAT policy was still set to translate https traffic to a different external IP, which caused any SSL site attempt to fail.
