I suppose it depends on what you mean by hosting in the cloud and what your requirements are. There are plenty of sites in which you can rent space, such as Amazon's EC2/VPC services. You set up a server and serve your content from there.
What you really need to decide is "do I host in Australia, or overseas?".  Hosting in Australia is expensive, because the bandwidth market is just stupidly expensive (the .au side pays most of the costs of hauling all that data across the Pacific, so in effect we're all subsidising the transit costs of the .us providers -- also, we're a much smaller and geographically dispersed market, which also drives up the costs).  On the upside, if your customers are in Australia you can give them a wonderful low-latency browsing experience.  Hosting in the US is cheap (bandwidth is orders of magnitude cheaper, for a start), with the latency downside for .au-based users of your site.  Note that you don't necessarily have to go with a US-based provider to get US hosting -- there are several Australian companies that have local support teams, but can provide you with a US presence (so you get the upside of local support in your preferred timezone, but with the cost benefits of being in the US).  (Full Disclosure: my employer is one of the companies that provides this option).
Yes, it's possible to host sites "in the cloud", but it's no different than hosting sites anywhere else when it comes to the basic economics of hosting in general.
Is it worth it to host in Australia?  It depends on your site and what your needs are.  Only you can decide that.
Just a quick note that we should be able to help with the bandwidth. Since we don't have a datacenter directly in or around AU just yet (perhaps later in 2012), we might actually add a little latency for some visitors in AU (some would hit the USA, some would hit Singapore right now). If the bulk of the traffic is not in AU, then we should be a pretty good option.
