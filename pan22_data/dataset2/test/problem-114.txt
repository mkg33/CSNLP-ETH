There shouldn't be a problem with more than two webcams on Win7, even Home Edition, I'm running a few right now.  Without further information, such as an error message when running more than two webcams, I can't be of much help.
Personally I have no issue running more than 2 cameras from a Linux box, via zoneMinder, but the Windows equivalent: iSpyConnect, states you should be able to run 4 cameras at 320 x 240, on a windows box with 2GB ram, see: http://www.ispyconnect.com/userguide.aspx 
I was able to add an additional camera when I reduced the resolution to 320X240. I presume this is a hardware limitation on the system as I could not find any other reason for the exception.
I have had the same issue while working on a java image processing project. I was using windows 7 professional 64 bit. I could not capture from more than two video devices when at 640X480 resolution using OpenIMAJ java library.
By any chance you have the factory software for each webcam installed in your pc? That may be causing conflicts.
I can assure you that Win7 allows more than 2 webcams. For my college project I used 2 "security" cameras for a development I made, and both were handled as webcams in my program. They were USB cameras.
