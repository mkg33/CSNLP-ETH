However, in the case of software raid in Linux (md+raid1) then yes, there's no disk header or secret block-level optimization going on there. 
In launched disk management by right clicking my computer. Found the disk which had an yellow warning sign on it and was labelled 'foreign disk"
PS. It was not possible to do this my attaching the drive via USB. I had to go through the internal sata's for the option "Import foreign disk" to be available.
Only if things are the same, ie same raid controller, or the same kind of software raid supported (IE, I would expect than any software raid created today would be supported in the future, but the deprecated stuff may well go away at some point).
In the end; you can try connecting the disk regardless of controller. If it works, it works. No controller will damage the data on the disk as long as you don't tell it to - i.e. as long as you don't execute an operation such as "initialize" or anything.
I took one of the Raid 0 disks (created under windows) and plugged it into the internal sata port of another machine. It happened to be the same spec machine but I think given that it is a windows mirror it would be the same everywhere.
This is not guaranteed to work, but in many cases it will work.  One specific example, I took one hard drive from a Raid-1 array created by an ICH9R chipset, plugged it into a system with a SB600 chipset, and was able to successfully boot off of it.
Disregarding RAID implementation? Then the answer should generally be no: you can not assume that all hardware controllers treat disks in such a transparent way. 
In the case of Disk Mirroring in Windows, it involves the disk having been initialized as "Dynamic" and, well, should just work, given that the system that reads it can understand the dynamic volumes - in other word it will most likely only be accessible from another system running Windows.
