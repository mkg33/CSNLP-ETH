Although if they actually replaced everything but the bluray and graphics card then it is probably not the hard drive.
Vacuum the dust balls out of the machine. Not only will you have improved cooling, but lower power consumption as well and extend the life of your system.
I'm getting a little worried, I can't afford for my PC to suddenly fail during the next month - I have a lot of coursework to do. Any thoughts? 
Anyway, I need my PC to sit some classes over the summer, so I put it in for them to run a HDD stress test and to replace a bunch of the components. I ended up replacing almost everything - the only elements I still have are my blu-ray drive and graphics card. They said when they started to run the HDD stress test it failed instantly (They started the test and it immediately said 'Test Complete' so they assumed it was at fault, and put a new HDD in since I was still under warranty with them.) I took it home a few hours ago, and I am still hearing the noise!!! 
Another trick is if you think it is the hard drive is put your hand on it and see if you feel a click when you hear it too.
If it is in fact happening after the PC was shutdown then it isn't the graphic card fan since it turns off almost immediately. It could be something else environmentally around the PC. Maybe the fan in the back is blowing some papers, or cords, and those get rustled occasionally when the PC is off too.
Take a side cover off and watch closely when the sound occurs. Try and pinpoint it to a smaller area.
I had a computer that would power down the hard drive if it wasn't actively in use. Then when I went to use it again it would make a slight noise as it powered the drive back up. If the replaced your drive with the same model then that is possible. Although that shouldn't happen after the computer is powered off either. 
I'd look at the CPU fan or PSU. Sounds like something kicking in. Your case might need a good vaccuum and cleaning.
Make sure you have a good backup system in place, and if it fails (which they can do at any time) you can switch to a new system quickly.
It could be the fan on the graphic card. Anything with moving parts can make a clicking sound. But I noticed you said:
If it is happening fairly frequently (within every couple minutes) then take the cover off (while it is off) and carefully lay it on its side. Make sure there is nothing around that could fall in the open PC. Then turn it on and hold your head close, see if you can figure out where it is coming from. I've had cords fall into fans before and cause noises like that. Stuff like that you can usually see.
A few weeks ago, I started hearing an odd noise. I struggle to describe it, it sounded sortof like the 'click of death' you hear when a HDD may fail, but not quite... (And it was far less irregular) Also, I was sure I heard it once or twice a minute or two after I shut down the PC. This was going on very irregularly for a couple weeks. Some days I would hear no noise at all, others I would hear it often, maybe once every 30 seconds or so. I could find no common denominator - i.e. it did not happen more during gaming or any other intensive use. 
My PC was getting pretty old, 5 years or so, and over the course of it's life I replaced the graphics card, HDD and a couple of sticks of RAM; but the PSU, processor, motherboard, fans etc. were all original.
