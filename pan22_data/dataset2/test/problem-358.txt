Basically what this does is it starts up freeradius, then reads the log to STDOUT in realtime, updating as new lines are written to the log file.
I have set up a freeradius container in a kubernetes cluster. By default freeradius doesn't log authentication attempts or log passwords in plain text, however, if the service is started with the "-X" arg (debugging mode), it overrides the default configuration and logs EVERYTHING to STDOUT. I have tried not specifying that arg in the deploy file, but then the container crashes upon startup.
Ok, so it turns out there was a completely different way of achieving my goal than what I expected. I was able to get the freeradius container to start without debugging mode by creating EmptyDir volume mounts for /var/run/freeradius and /var/log/freeradius so that those directories would be writable (not sure why /var/run/freeradius doesn't need to be writable in debugging mode but oh well), then for command, have the following line:
Is there a way to either run freeradius in the container so that it doesn't create those logs in the first place, or to configure the deployment so that those logs cannot be accessed?
