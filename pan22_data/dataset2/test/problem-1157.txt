P.S.S.S. Getting help from author isn't possible, author not replying to anyone in years (saw many posts about that).
After repairing or reinstalling Tabs Outliner, you will need to reactivate it by finding the original license key email and clicking the link in that email. You will also have to re-authorize the extension to connect to your Google Drive. After completing that, you should be able to access all of the backup features.
Hopefully these instructions allow you to salvage at least the majority of your data from this extension.
I have had no problems with the extension (across multiple computers) since I allowed it to reset my tree. My current backup size is around 400 KB. I do still occasionally manually export my tree to a local file now, just in case.
The Tabs Outliner extension is somewhat broken in current versions of Google Chrome, and it will spontaneously self-corrupt almost at random with absolutely no warning. The larger your backup file, the higher the risk of spontaneous self-corruption. When the extension first stopped working for me, my backup size was around 14000 KB (14 MB) because I have been using Tabs Outliner for several years.
Currently the only way to interact meaningfully with that file is to use the View Exported Tree option in the Tabs Outliner Options window/tab. You may have some luck with a lightweight JSON viewer, or you may wish to write your own Chrome Extension or script to read from this file and/or convert it into a more useful or human-readable format.
However last 4 files already modified and few moments later 000008.ldb was created with small size of 200Kb, this is probably current opened tabs which override settings with only current opened tabs.
I have failure when Chrome eat too much RAM and I get out or RAM, when that happen in Chrome crashed addon Tabs Outliner which I use to store and unload many tabs, writing notes, e.t.c. When that happen Chrome ask to restore addon and it seems like recover it by reloading, however it reset all settings and only current opened tabs are shown in it. I immediately go into settings folder where data saved as LevelDB/IndexedDB, the path is: C:\Users\__NAME__\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\IndexedDB\chrome-extension_eggkanocgddhmamlbiijnphhppkpkmkl_0.indexeddb.leveldb
I tried to read manifest file, but it have a lot of binary stuff and probably unreadable, I also open DevTools on extension page and navigate in Application â†’ IndexedDB where I find a key to store this tabs in JSON format. Also trying to google for similar issues I found this article https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB where show examples of writing to DB from console, I also try to open it and have success with that:
P.S.S. Extension have sync with Google Drive, however I don't have actual version of data I need to restore, since it was not automated process plus to that in Google Drive I have not access to this files, as they hidden behind extension access functionality and I can only grant access to store data, but can't upload latest files by myself if they stored in same way or in other way it would be more complicated task.
I cannot help with recovering the extension data from the db file, but I can help with some basic usage instructions for Tabs Outliner which are easily overlooked...
Telling Chrome to repair it (or reinstall it) is the only solution, both of which will delete all your local data and settings for that extension.
If you opt to continue digging around in Chrome's innards and manually yank stuff from the extension database, I wish you the best of luck and godspeed.
I found still not deleted Database file with timestamp before I reload crashed addon and I copy files to save them, this is are:
I restored from backups probably ten times over the course of three weeks. In the end I had to give up and just start over (and dragged a small handful of important windows over from my backup) because my tree was way too big for the extension to handle, and the developer is unlikely to release any updates anytime in the foreseeable future. Welcome to surprise abandonware.
