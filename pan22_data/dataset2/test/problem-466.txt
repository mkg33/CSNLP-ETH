Also, if you go the JungleDisk route... pay the extra $$$ and get the version that does block level file updates (uploads only the changed portions of large files).  Its worth every penny.
The original file count was much, much smaller... only a few gigabytes.  Over the years it has grown to somewhere around a terrabyte of data.
The cost of Amazon S3 (and JungleDisk) is SOOOOOOOO cheap that I would absolutely recommend it to small businesses as a means of off-site backup.  But obviously you need to be responsible and keep a local backup as well.  I'd even recommend an OFFLINE backup at least once every XX weeks or XX months.
I've mentioned this before in answers to other questions to my apologies in advance if anyone gets bored.
We backup over 4.7 million files from our master Ubuntu file server to a slave Ubuntu file server (same location) via a 10.0.0.xxx network using rdiff-backup once every hour.
If the master file server fails (or a small number of files are accidentally deleted), we just restore from the local backup.
If a catastrophe were to happen (ie. colocation facility burns down) we can fall back on the JungleDisk/Amazon S3 backup.
