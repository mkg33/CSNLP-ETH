I have looked at Bucardo, Slony, and SymmetricDS but they all seem like redundancy / backup solutions, but what I really need is seemingly basic single table replication from each site to the central database. 
My initial impression with Bucardo is that I would need to install it at each one of the sites to accomplish this. I'm looking for a little guidance if anyone can offer some advice. I believe I have Google'd to death, but I'm hoping to be proven wrong.
My goal is to setup a local database at each site with this one table that is gathering the syslogs and replicate it to our central database (hopefully synchronously) to a new table named after the facility (rather that one big table gathering all 17 facility data). 
I currently have a few dozen sites pushing data to a central database over VPN with rsyslog. All these records are going into one table (there are roughly 20 - 30 per second being inserted per site). Thus, there are roughly 30 million records in ONE TABLE and growing fast. The database design is a separate issue to be dealt with later.
