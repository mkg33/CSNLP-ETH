Many, many years ago (Windows NT 3.1 in fact) I started out as a programmer specialising in writing services and even the occasional device driver. This means you get to know the Windows kernel very well. In time I got a bit bored with the programming and switched to network management. I've found my background in programming has been immensley valuable over and over again.
I think we're kind of different, when we hire a gifted administrator .. we half way expect for them to (eventually) find their way to programming, even if its just hacking something we use to work the way they need it to work.
It's not just that writing VBScript scripts is relatively painless. Knowing how the guts of Windows works, and particularly how IP works, helps greatly with detangling odd server and network problems. Also it's a mindset. Programmers are used to documentation and version control, and it horrifies me me to see how many Windows admins will just try something to see if it works and worry about untangling the mess afterwards.
With all the descriptions here, I'm not going to say that I am a sysadmin. But the fact that I built and manage a couple of windows/linux server, I must admit something:
Most of the junior admins can look at one of our programmers and say (with authority), yes, I installed it correctly, here's where you have a leak which is why the code you just pushed is breaking. Or "No, its not our version of MySQL, look at your query here ..."
Knowing how to bind to your LDAP and retrieve needed info in your scripting language of choice is key for everything from troubleshooting to really stepping up various types of automation (account and resource provisioning, more intelligent checks on user or machine accounts).
All very well, but it isn't very useful advice to say go away and work as a programmer for ten years! However I think it would help most sysadmins to have some experience of programming in a "hard" language like C++ or C#. And if you have tame programmers in your organisation go drinking with them!
I am a programmer and senior admin/integrator. To work where I do, you need to know the following things:
Scripting is essential, but I'd second the advice that knowing some "real" languages is a definite bonus.  You can do some very useful things with the .NET System.DirectoryServices namespace, for example.
May seem basic but I have seen plenty of bread-n-butter shops where folks don't think they have a need for this kind of system administration.  Plenty of places spend big $$$ on big sets of administrative tools and, as far as I can tell, 95% of what they use the tools for could have been done with a few hours of scripting if anybody knew that or knew how to do it.
