Wherever the dns A records are stored for your domain (godaddy, dnsmadeeasy, networksolutions, etc), you can easily add an A Record for a subdomain that will point to your external IP.
Using DNS should solve this problem. Instead of entering the IP into the phone, use a DNS entry like "mail.YOURCOMPANY.com"
Once we connect one of these devices to our INTERNAL wifi network, ActiveSync can no longer work because the device cannot see the external IP once it's on our internal network.  We have to reference the internal IP to gain access (highly undesirable as you can imagine).
I know the issue, but I don't know what this is called or what needs to be done on the router to "forward" the requests internally. Is this called "internal IP remapping" or something? I can't find any settings on our RV042 cisco gateway to configure to "map" the external IP back to the internal IP of the exchange server.
We can only connect to ActiveSync on our exchange server from the outside world (using our external IP address). This is true for iPhone, Android, and OWA (outlook web access).
