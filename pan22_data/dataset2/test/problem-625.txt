ELBs don't forward these headers when using TCP in the ELB, but if you set to HTTP/3128 then it does.  But now squid doesn't work.
We have two Squid proxy servers for High availability. We want to use Amazon ELB in front of these Squid proxy servers.
When we use Load Balancer Protocol as TCP and port 8080, Instance Protocol TCP and port 3128 -- After exporting squid proxy using ELB name on the test instances, we are able to connect to internet.
Any ideas on how to get the ELB to pass the server name?  Also not clear why the host header has port 3128 on it.
Squid proxy configuration is the original configuration file that we get with the package. We have only added the virtual hostname.
When we use Load Balancer Protocol as HTTP and port 80, Instance Protocol HTTP and port 3128 -- After exporting squid proxy using ELB name on the test instances, we are not able to connect to internet.
1. Use your ELB with TCP (and NOT HTTP), and configure it to forward the client IP using the proxy protocol.
I suspect they want to get at the X-Forwarded-For original IP of the requestor for the logs.  I know I am.
