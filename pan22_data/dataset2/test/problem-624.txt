I'd like to upgrade my servers as well, but I'd wait at least until the end of June before doing so.
I would stick with 8.10 like cletus said. There aren't to many major differences between the releases. If you stick with 8.10 then you know what your getting, if you upgrade to 9.04 there could be bugs that haven't been reported yet that might affect you.  
The major thing you have to consider when upgrading is this: Who are you working for? If this is your server then do it and see what happens. If this is a business server that servers the needs of other users, then wait.
There's a bug in 9.04 where degraded RAID arrays don't automatically start. Otherwise, I've been happy with it on my home server and my VPS, but I haven't finished my testing for my work cluster(s) yet.
If there's one thing vista taught us, it's that the "latest and greatest" isn't always better then what you were using before.
However, I have usually found that upgrading can cause lots of problems. On desktops I usually put the home folders on a separate partition so I can do a fresh install without losing any data. If you don't have a really important reason to upgrade, don't. Upgrading is good for desktops so you can get all the cool new stuff. On servers though, you don't want to mess with more than you have to.
The problem I had with ubuntu upgrades, is every time I upgraded in the first month or so after a release a lot of stuff were broken, and it took some time until they were fixed. Good it is only on my home stuff.
According to the Ubuntu release history, 8.10 will be officially supported for another year (almost). 9.04 is less than two weeks old so I'd perhaps be slightly hesitant to upgrade immediately unless you have a pressing need. If what you have now works just stick with it until the 9.04 issues are bedded down.
