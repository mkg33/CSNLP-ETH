The only way I was able to solve this was the CMOS method, as it appears as though my computer might have been subject to some kind of power surge or failure (even though everything was on surge protectors).
Here is the thing! am on day 5 of no wired internet connection. I have spent the last 4 days searching through every forum and Q&A sites, until i finally decided to post this, so I have done my homework. Before I take my laptop to maintenance shop for hardware failures i want to check with you guys first.
  Like the question says my wired connection stopped working suddenly after an update. I am using ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Network Manager says Wired Networks disconnected. Wireless is working perfectly.

Second. We may try to install the latest atl1c driver. Go to a convenient, empty directory, and issue these commands:
and see now whether this works. Just let me know, if at all solvable your problem will require a few iterations.
