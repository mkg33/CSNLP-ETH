If you are still just deploying the server it would probably be fastest and safest to start over with good disks.
The main question is: is it safe/correct to manually fail and remove a disk from an array while it's still syncing?
I'm preparing a server with 4 disks assembled into software RAID5 during Debian 8 installation. Shortly after the system was configured, SMART detected an Offline Uncorrectable Sector error, so I thought it'd be a good idea to replace the probably-failing disk while the server is still on the testbench.
RAID 5 allows for a single disk failure before you have data loss.  If it is still rebuilding, you do not have all 4 disks being part of the RAID yet.  Removing a disk before it is synced will cause complete data loss.
There are 4 x 500 GB SATA each divided into 4 partitions and assembled into 4 RAID5 devices md[0-3].
The whole procedure looks, I assume, like this (I'd rather do a disk hot-swap out of curiosity and in case I'll have to do this on a live server someday):
Month long rebuild times are the main reason people don't recommend RAID 5 anymore for large disks - the chance of a second disk failing during that resync time is just too high.
