I have a small Win2003 server that I need to allow remote file uploads. It is behind a router with port forwarding. Is there something simpler than setting up FTP on IIS and making the necessary changes to both IIS and the router to allow the passive connections through? Is there something more secure (like SCP/SSH) that doesn't get complicated and/or expensive?
WebDAV might work for what you need.  Everyone says it is dead, or dying, or depreciated as a protocol, but nothing strong has replaced it yet.  
Personnally I prefer SFTP because I only need to forward one port (usually 22) while in FTP you need : 
I already installed the server once and it is pretty easy to install and configure. (But I did not use the SSL functionality. I don't think it gets that much more complicated.)
You can under windows run Serv-u (not that expensive) and good for production which allows you to choose either FTPS or SFTP.
A free alternative to WinSSHD is FreeSSHD- it also support SFTP, ssh, and so forth. Filezilla is a great client- supports FTP, SFTP, and FTPS.
