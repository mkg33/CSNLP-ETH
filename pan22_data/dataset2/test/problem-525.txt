It's a patch panel, as others have stated -- however, there is one really awesome reason you'd do so if that had been a switch.
The kind of cabling you use for in-wall installation is often different to the wire you use in a conventional cable for patching.
The previous answers are correct, but in general it is also possible to have multiple Ethernet connections between two switches. Normally, all but one of these are "blocked" by the (R)STP; these are backup links. In more exotic networks, there will be Virtual LANs to logically organise groups of users and to trim the broadcast domain (leading to a more efficient network). Some switches allow for a spanning tree per VLAN, which can take advantage of the some of the "blocked" links, using more of the network's capacity.
A Patch panel is typically used as a place to terminate (connect) the in-wall cabling, with the other ends usually connected to wall sockets out in offices or classrooms. Since none of this wire moves, it isn't subject to wear and tear (metal fatigue) that occurs with flexible cables.
Patch cables are then used to connect the patch points to the actual network equipment. This allows for flexibility - patches can be changed to accommodate changing business (or technical) requirements, without touching the wires inside the walls.
