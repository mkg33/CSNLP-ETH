To create a VPN or not depends on the path you chose. In any case, I don’t see a problem in having a Replica broker on the same subnet as your Domain subnet and the Hyper-V hosts. 
If those sites are connected with a VPN tunnel, you could setup TRUSTS between Active Directory domains or Active Directory forests (depending on your situation) and then use Kerberos as an authentication method. In that case, Hyper-V replica traffic will default to port 80 and run unencrypted, but you have a VPN connection so that should be fine.
Case 2: You don’t wanna or can’t set up a Trust relationship between those two domains – Then You use Certificate based authentication, and if so, You shouldn’t use a VPN connection between those two sites for Hyper-V replica, because with Cert. Auth.  all traffic is encrypted (As long as the hosts' private keys are adequately protected, it’s as safe as much as anything can be to transmit certificate-based Hyper-V Replica traffic directly across the Internet).
My only concern would be a Replica traffic bandwidth utilization and its impact on my network. Keep in mind that Hyper-V Replica allows you to perform the initial replication using portable media.
