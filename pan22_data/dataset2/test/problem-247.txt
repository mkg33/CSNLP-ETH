If you want more than the 2 connections, you need to get a license for Terminal Service CALs.  Then you can do as many as you have licensed.
Else you can also try a TS challenger: go-global from graphon. It doesn't use the Terminal server layer.
why do you need more than 2 ? If it's because people doesn't logoff, you can set TS to logoff people when they are disconnected for too long & co, even through GPO is many servers.
You get 2 remote administration connections and a console connection, and that's it.  There is no way to override this limit (that I've ever seen at least).
Going further than 2 mean license and change the server to a TS application server, why may not be what you want.
It looks like you want to use the server as remote desktop server for allowing people to using the applications on the server rather than just managing it. If so, you need to turn on Terminal Service from Add/Remove program first. And before you allow people to log in, you need to purchase and set up TS License server.
