Is there a comprehensive article that compares and contrasts the various utilities used to monitor and restart a process?
If your OS uses another init program, don't change it. I can't really help you with the other tools you mentioned, as I generally use Ubuntu where Upstart is still present (as of the latest LTS), so I have little to do with them. But it's not a hard task to create a simple script which is run from cron once a minute (or more frequently in ie. a loop), which can check if a PID exists and issue restart on failure.
voidlinux uses runit as it's init system & also for service supervision (search the package tree for run files for examples of runit scripts).
If your distro uses Upstart, go with it. It has very basic support for job restarting, but includes limits that can prevent from restart loop, as mentioned by @EEAA.
I have a Nginx web proxy, gunicorn web server, and a python/flask web app. The Gunicorn process apparently died, and I want to ameliorate that in the future by looking into a utility that can monitor and restart the gunicorn process in the event it crashes again.
I've been using runit with socklog by the same author inside Alpine Linux lxc containers for around 10 months to manage web / database & various other services. It is light, easy to manage & I have had no service failures. The logging daemon also runs as it's own user & not root which is nice.
