I don't imagine you were thinking about Raspberry Pis (or other SBCs), but I'd estimate that 80% of all Raspberry Pis ever sold are either in plastic cases, the cardboard box it was posted in, or in no case at all.
A metal case isn't a hard-requirement, although can offer some benefits if you want to do some EMI shielding. You can do the same shielding with some metal that's not integral to the case though, if you need want the shielding without the case.
If you are building the projects for yourself, you do not have to comply to FCC part 15, but if you intend to sell them that is a different story. If you want to build a case out of wood and sell the resultant product (not as a kit, there is a whole weird legal thing about kits) you will almost certainly have to coat the inside with some sort of conductor. 
To pass the requirements of FCC part 15 class b most computers must be in some sort of conductive case. You will notice that most metal cases don't have any slots or holes larger than about half a centimeter, this has to to with antenna theory.
Faraday shielding is not necessary in most circumstances. My primary computer is in a wooden case, and it works. If you were building a machine meant to be really high-reliability, perhaps a metal case would save you from occasional cosmic rays.
