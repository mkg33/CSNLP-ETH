You might ask "since noone uses them for their original purpose and they are not used for anything on the Internet why not ignore the RFC and use them as general purpose private addresses?". 
So in principle if you had a network with a static mapping between network-specific addresses and the host part of IP addresses you could use addresses from 0.0.0.0/8 as the source addresses during an initialization process to find the network part of the IP address.
Yes their intended use is local to a given network, but their intended use is very specific. They are not intended to be used as general purpose private addresses.
In practice that is rarely if ever done. While static mappings between network-specific addresses and Internet addresses were a thing in the early days of the Internet they are basically unheard of nowadays.
0.0.0.0/8 is said to be the current network. Are the IP addresses in the range not public available?  Are they essentially private IP addresses, although not said to be?  Thanks.
The IANA registry of IPv4 addresses refers to RFC 1122 for 0.0.0.0/8.  RFC 1122 defines the addresses in that block in section 3.2.1.3, note that it was written in the classful era, so some translation is needed to translate it to modern terminology.
In practice this address is widely used for DHCP, it is also used in the sockets API as a wildcard address to specify "any interface". Some implementations also treat an attempt to send packets or make a connection to 0.0.0.0 the same as attempting to send them to the loopback address.
