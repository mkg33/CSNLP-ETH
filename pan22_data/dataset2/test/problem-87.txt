One option is to set a public internet dns server instead of an internal dns server for your static dns entry.  Options include Google (8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4), OpenDNS, and many others.  The downside here is that you won't be able to use dns to resolve names on the local networks, only the public internet.
You should first verify the settings of your network adapter's Properties / TCP/IP Properties / Advanced / DNS tab. It is possible that you have configured a DNS domain or forwards that correspond to your work network, so deleting this may fix the problem and return you to the purely automatic DHCP.
You are likely viewing cached pages on other networks which is why it appears to work for a few seconds. If you have internal DNS servers specified, then you migrate to another network with DNS servers that are addressed differently, you will not be able to access your previous DNS servers unless they are external to the LAN.
Mostly, though, you just shouldn't set static IPs on portable devices.  Static IPs are for devices that are more, well, static... things like printers and servers.  If you want a consistent IP on your internal network, the better way to accomplish that is to use a dhcp reservation.
