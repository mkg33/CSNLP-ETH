There are many possible reasons why this won't work, and your post doesn't have nearly enough information to give conclusive advice.
How about buy a wifi router that's designed for business use with lots of clients and not a $150 one designed for gamers and movie streaming. Seriously there's a huge gulf between cheapo consumer wifi and pro-grade kit, that's why its more expensive and under the 'professional' tab on manufacturers web sites.
Is there a problem at all with the IP distribution (DHCP) or do you have any IP conflicts occuring? You have just one subnet I guess, any VLANS?. You must be testing the connectivity by pinging, is that right? I can't understand why you think the problem relates to DNS connectivity only. Can these clients ping the server IP all the time?     
First: check that computers connected to the wired network get a valid IP address, and that their DNS server is set properly.
You're using a broadcast IP address (255) to test responsiveness which could be a problem. I'm not sure how your broadcast host does the ping redistribution but maybe it switches from ICMP to UDP ping, which is not correctly handled by router.
