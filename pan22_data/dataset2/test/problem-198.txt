You can optionally append the Reveal Finder Items Automator action. This would open your downloads folder after the file is saved, and select the downloaded file.
To use your service, select a URL and press the assigned keyboard shortcut. The file will appear in the folder specified in Automator.
While Safari allows you to Option-Return to download any URL this way, Chrome does not support that, so http://example.org/file.zip will download, http://example.org/file.htm won't.
Go to System Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Services, locate your new service, and assign a keyboard shortcut.
Press CMD + S in the Chrome browser window where the URL is displaying and it should automatically download the URL :) 
Open Automator, create a Service that receives URLs as input in any application. Add the Download URLs action (don't worry about the Safari icon, the application isn't used at all or even started when executing). Save as "Download URL" or similar. You can now access the service from Application menu » Services » Download URL
