This is a function of the update - if it fixes a priv. escalation that results in root access, then you might want to apply it.
That being said, I think it's good to get in to the habit of rebooting machines on a fairly regular basis when possible. A lot of hardware and software failures will manifest themselves only on a reboot and it's better to find out about those when you're planning a reboot instead of during an unplanned outage.
As mibus mentioned, if you install the kernel and don't reboot, make sure it's not the default. You don't know if or in what state your server is going to come back in, so make sure it's tested.
Take note that some of the debian kernel updates require (well, highly recommend) that you reboot ASAP after you apply them.
There's no simple answer to this, some kernel upgrades aren't really security related, and some may fix security issues that don't affect you, while others may affect you. 
I'd also consider apticron or similar to get the details and changelogs of any other package updates.
This is the case when the difference is not sufficient enough to warrant a modules directory change, but the modules may differ.
In the event that you don't reboot, you should ensure that the new kernel isn't the default one to start on boot.
Best approach imo is to sign up to the relevant security mailing lists like ubuntu's security-announce so that you can see when security patches are coming out, and how they could affect you.
