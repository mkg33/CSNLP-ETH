I get the data in a .CSV, and for expediency & urgent deadlines, I've been pasting it into an Excel spreadsheet. (That's why I'm looking to move it to an actual table...) I've created one column for each possible answer, and if the value in CSV.Col1 = Excel.TableHeader, then I put a 1 in that column. This allows me to quickly filter the Excel rows and sum the 1s for a quick total of how many there were. This is probably not ideal for an actual database.
The data will be moved from Excel to Access, with the intent to move it into SQL Server as soon as possible.
We're collecting survey data for multiple sites, and one question is a check all that apply. Currently, there are from 2-5 available options based on the site, though that number could increase. When I get the data, I get anywhere from 2-5 columns (based on the number of options available on that survey), each column in the result set responds to one of the options. The data in the columns will all be either NULL or a text value representing that ordinal option for that particular survey. Different sites will also have different options from a set, so there is no guarantee that column 1 is always the same response. There are 13 total possible options to pick, at this point, and no one site has more than 5 available, but it's possible that we'll add more options to pick from, and that the there could be more than 5 options per site in the future.
