Another method is to create a stroke and set the Join and Cap to be rounded. Copy the path and paste in place and remove the stroke from the copy. Then select the original and select path > stroke to path then union the 2 shapes back together.
Here's another method that I've just discovered when I wanted to add rounded corners to an existing irregular polygon for the purposes of creating a laser cut perspex design that is more resilient to cracking.
For a purely cosmetic effect (that is, you don't end up with a rounded path) you could try applying the Filters >  Blurs > Cross-smooth effect. Then open the Filter Editor and set the Standard Deviation Effect Parameter to about 1.0.
Drag the two bezier points at the bottom left so that they form a satisfactory curve. I hold down Ctrl and align them on top of each other to look like this:
Inspired by bonaccia answer (thank You for it) I discovered that to get control over rounded corners You can use some additional rectangle or square and a snipping feature. Check out the following GIF I made.
You can use the XML Editor in Inkscape to make rectangles rounded corner.  Open the XML Editor, select the <svg:rect element.  Add the rx and ry attributes, in the lower right of the XML Editor there are two fields and a Set button.  Put rx in the top field, and 10 or any other number, then press Set.
