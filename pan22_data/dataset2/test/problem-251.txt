Switches are the primary network device in use today, when you don't see the type of device defined you can safely assume it is a switch rather than a hub.  The advantage of a switch over a hub is that it will not forward a packet to all ports if it has seen the destination mac address previously on one of its ports.  Then the packet will only be forwarded out of that port.
The example above is simply an example.  The reality is that any network structure can become saturated given enough data transfer from enough hosts that the network fabric cannot move the data quickly enough.
At this point, you have two options - segregate your network, or increase the capacity of your switch fabric.
This is great provided the mac has been seen and isn't a broadcast packet.  Where this is not the case, the switch must forward the packet to all ports.  There will always be some broadcast traffic on a network, and it is dependent on what is going on the network as to when you get to the point where the traffic starts to saturate the switches.  No matter what percentage of traffic is broadcast, there will be capacity limits in the switch itself.
