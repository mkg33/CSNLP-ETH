You should take a look at what modules can be enabled by looking at the config files in /etc/apache2/mods-available/, if you are using Debian.  I believe Ubuntu Server is exactly the same.
On Debian, by contrast, you need to symlink the configuration file from mods-available to mods-enabled.  There is a tool called a2enmod to help with this, for example:
First, with regard to enabling modules this will vary by distribution.  On RHEL/CentOS, for example, the rewrite and proxy modules are included with the base httpd package, you shouldn't need to do anything else.
As far as number 2 is concerned, you can put the proxy configuration in a <VirtualHost> declaration that you'd like to proxy.  This can, again, vary by distribution or preference.  Most RHEL/CentOS systems will encourage the use of a site-specific my-website.com.conf file in /etc/httpd/conf.d/.  Debian users should put the file in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ (or in sites-available, and create a symlink with a2ensite).  A full guide on these helper tools can be found here.
