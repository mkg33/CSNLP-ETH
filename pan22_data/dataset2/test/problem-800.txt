macOS has built-in SMB (Windows-style) file sharing and a built-in ability to create Wi-Fi networks. So you can create a Wi-Fi network from the Mac and share the file via SMB, and then connect your Windows PC to that Wi-Fi network and then connect to the Mac via SMB in order to transfer the file.
Without knowing the exact specs of your Mac and Windows PC's Wi-Fi chipsets, it's hard to know what data rate you'll get for this Wi-Fi network, so it's hard to predict how long the copy will take. Worst case, it may be something you want to set up at the end of the day and leave running overnight.
Windows versions before Win10 don't have proper IETF ZeroConf (mDNS, Bonjour) support, so you'll probably have to look at your Mac to see what IP address it has on its Wi-Fi interface, and then tell your Windows PC to connect via SMB to that IP address, not the name.
Now, on the Windows box, join the Wi-Fi network you set up in step 1 above, and connect to the Mac using SMB with the username/password of the Mac account that has access to the shared folder.
