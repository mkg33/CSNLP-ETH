They won't know it if it is well done or if they have not the internals skills and practices. For discovering that a hack has been performed, some measures (i'm not exhaustive here) needs to be implemented such has auditing files change, collecting IDS logs and performing a deep analysis with multimple hosts correlations.
Furthermore, a determined person will certainly after gathering as much as possible informations about the target will try to use social engineering in the first place because   users are generally the weakest link in the security chain.
I would guess that most of the high publicity hacks we hear about start with either the company, or the media, being tipped off by an end user that someone has messed with their account/stolen their identity/etc.
Then the company reacts to this, goes through their logs to try and discover the extent of the problem and what happened, patches the hole, etc. and then (probably) issues a press release and tries to contact affected customers.
Generally they look for subtle forensic clues; such as their homepage being changed to a banner which reads "p0Wned by TeH L33t Krew!! haahah1h1!! u noobs"
A sysadmin can set up honey pots, dummy computers to fool hackers into thinking that they're a real system with real data. In the honey pot all activity is monitored and the behaviour of the hacker is studied to help learn more about what a hacker or virus is trying to do to help security experts figure out how to prevent future intrusions.
