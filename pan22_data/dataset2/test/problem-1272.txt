I have bought some time ago a TP-link TL-WR841N v.8 and it worked ok. After i moved in into another apartment i had experiencing some bad signal and speed issues. I have the same internet provider and the speed they provide is 300 Mbps. The speed issues may be from their side, but the signal issues i have never experienced before and doesn't have anything to do with the internet.
I wonder if the placement is wrong or i should flash it with DD-WRT or something else. The signal varies from full signal on a laptop to about 3-4/5 lines, the issue is not constant. I also experience this when is only one device connected.
I placed the router in the hall that connects all rooms and still having issues. I thought it may be from the interfering with other routers and i tried to change channels but the same. A router that is not in my house has better signal than mine. I measured the signal is about -60 the other router has -50. After i switched back to auto, the download speed boosted from 2MB/s to 7MB/s, but still having troubles with lagging and low signal some times.
