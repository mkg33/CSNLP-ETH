If you have linux, you could use dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb or whatever the USB is shown as, and then gparted to create a new partition table on it.
Many vendors provide a low level formatting utility. However I tried them two times (trascend and dikom) and both times even the low level formatter wasn't able to restore the device... when the flash is broken, the pendrives is just a useless silicon and plastic brick...
If its failing, you might have a problem somewhere that can't be skipped. Usually, they just mark that area as unusable and you have less space, but overall its still functional.
Quick formats usually just write over the partition table whereas a full format will supposedly check each sector (or unit or whatever).
It does sound like the drive is toast, but even if there are things you could do to potentially "fix" it, it's safer to just get a new one than to risk your data all over again.
often you can also just open the usb case, take out the internal harddrive and connect it directly through IDE or SATA to your PC. I managed to get back my data once using this way.
USB drives are cheap.  Is it really worth putting your faith in a drive that has already shown signs of unreliability?
