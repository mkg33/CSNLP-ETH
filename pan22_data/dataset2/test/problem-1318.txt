I have a Fujitsu Siemens Esprimo Edition P2411 tower PC. It has been running Windows XP from new quite happily for the past two years and I was not aware of any problems before this fault occurred.
I can almost guarantee this is a RAM issue. But there are other possibilities of course. Since it happens outside of your OS as well, we can rule out a software problem.
Now it seems to almost randomly be powering on and/or off, firstly occurred as just a random shutdown of windows (as if power button pressed singly) but now seems to reboot in quick succession (at the bios screen) (sometimes passes BIOS, sometimes not).
Can anybody suggest any course of action or shed any light on this problem that is driving me up the wall.
Move to any other slots - test each one. If you get no restarts, set this DIMM aside and repeat with all your DIMMS. Most likely you will find that one of the DIMMs doesn't work in any slot. You may also find that all DIMMs fail in one single slot.
A PC's 'self preservation' can be misleading.  I've had seemingly random reboots boil down to overheating, though that can vary based on room temp as well as what's being run.  You can easily go hours without heating up the cpu, gpu, or ram - whatever's worn out its resiliency.
There doesn't seem to be any pattern to the reboots that I can tell, I do not think the switch is faulty (buzzed "ok" with multimeter), sometimes it boots itself after 30 seconds, sometimes 5 mins off, sometiems hours. I can not think of anything software based that could cause this and the tower seems quite clean from dust now.
You can use MemTest86+ to stress your ram for testing purposes. It is also available on the UBCD along with a lot of other diagnostic tools.
