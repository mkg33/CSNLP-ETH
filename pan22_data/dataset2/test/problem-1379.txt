Also possibly, incremental time increases when solving parts of the puzzle (like time extensions in racing games) could be used for these games.
You could make multiple different game modes with different timing systems, try out what works and give the player some options.
I am currently thinking that this can instill a sense of urgency to the player and make them feel more challenged. Along with increasing the actual puzzle difficulty, a time restriction could be another way to increase difficulty, and the combination of both can be used as a way to give a sense of progress.
What I'm wondering about is, what's the accepted thought about using time limits? Would they work as I'm currently thinking or am I missing anything?
I'd say, the harder it is in the first place the less need for a time limit. Bejeweled wouldn't work very well without some sort of time control, in more complicated games the limit may just be annoying.
Of course, it goes without saying that this can only work when the puzzle is randomly generated (say, something like minesweeper/bejeweled) and not hand-designed levels (such as trainyard, theseus & the minotaur etc).
