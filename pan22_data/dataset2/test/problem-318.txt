Services won't get the chance to shut themselves down cleanly. For instance, if you're running a web server, when it gets asked to shut down it may well complete any existing requests (with a timeout) rather than the connection just going away.
I normally don't dare to take any risks, but that might be some "legacy" habit from when such things were a problem. If anybody more technical can explain WHY it's not a problem that would be awesome.
I do remember exercising more caution with Windows 98 (FAT, of course), but even then all I get is a scandisk on boot.  I think it's a legacy habit.  I'm guessing most of the other typical precautions are just Microsoft disclaimers.
In addition to all the answers above, on the machine that have a RAID on their HDD and a high IO activity, a hard poweroff will most likely interrupt HDD IO required for the RAID to function sometimes leading to HDD failure and frequently - to random data loss.
Assuming you've saved everything, no damage.  I do it all the time and I have yet to see even one problem.  It's probably NTFS journaling saving me.
Basically think of anything a system might want to do when closing down in terms of either the on-board disks or connections to other systems (such as network connections) - all of those are going to be happier when shut down properly.
I'm not sure if it's a problem anymore, but I recall that back in the day (15 years ago when win95 was being released) there was a risk that hdd read heads, if reading, could shift when the power was cut and scratch the disk. I suspect the emergency head park that derobert mentions was the resolution to that.
If you have online services, a clean shutdown may sign you out of them appropriately, instead of the service thinking you could just have network problems.
It's unlikely that the whole machine will die, but if there's anything still in file write buffers, you'll lose that data... and basically the machine probably won't know the difference between you powering it off and it shutting down due to a power cut.
The "file write buffer" doesn't just have to be the Windows buffer, either. Again taking a web server example, the logging might be buffered so it only writes to disk every 100 requests or something similar. A clean shutdown will flush this appropriately; a hard shutdown won't.
