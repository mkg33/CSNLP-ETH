I've heard that it may have to do with log file buffers on the devices. On a power cycle the logs are wiped and this freed space can then be used by the other functions on the device. I do not have any hard proof or evidence this is the case. Do any others have ideas regarding this?
I bought a Linksys WRT160N, and had to reboot it every three or four days; it would become unresponsive after that time.  I flashed it to DD-WRT, and haven't rebooted it in two months.
I'm speculating here but from a hardware point of view, electronic devices do drift under increased temperatures. More so for analogue devices, which is what most communications gear is made of. However, the units should have been designed to work within accepted tolerances. Check to see if the temperatures are exceedingly high. If it is, something else might be wrong, causing the parts to overheat.
From what you describe, there could be a problem with either the router or cable modem or both or even your OS.
Reliable software running over long periods of time is a difficult thing to do, not to mention creating reliable operating systems and networking software.  It takes decades to get it right and reliable.  The firmware in most consumer level routers do not begin to approach this level of testing and reliability.
