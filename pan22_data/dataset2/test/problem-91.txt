As you describe the scenario (local development at home) the quickest way is to set up manually a DNS entry in your machine. This way you avoid setting up a DNS server. (Why expend 2 hours setting a DNS when you can have it in 2 mins...)
Dns is useful to propagate names over the network. So, yes, if you want to have app1.myserver transformed into <192.168.1.1>, you need a DNS server.
Apache receives your HTTP request, looks at the Host header, and direct the request to the good application. This is called Virtual Hosting,and this is what you do when you create Apache's virtual hosts.
You have to manually add an entry to Hosts files on all the machines in your network (that I guess is your server and your computer). If your server is 192.168.0.10 and your local machine is 192.168.0.9
Now, if you have 3 applications: app1.myserver, app2.myserver and app3.myserver. When you connect to one of them using http://app1.myserver, you browser sends an HTTP request that contains a "Host" Header.
So, you don't need mod_rewrite, a basic Apache2 server, and a local Host file (or a DNS) and you're all set.
But, if you are the only person using this (or for testing purpose), you can simply modify the hosts files on your local computer and add an entry for
