Having full disk image is good only if you want to avoid reinstalling your entire computer. As they take more space and are good only for that specific hardware. If you wish to just backup your precious files, then use a file backup.
Ideally that image should be stored off site, but if you cant do that then at least keep it some distance from the PC. If in a flood prone area, keep it up high. If worried about fire, keep it down low (but not at floor level - water = enemy of hard drives).
This is probably over the top for what many people would want but it has saved me on 2 separate occasions.
An image using modern software and for about 250GB will take a couple of hours to make. Using a modern 1TB drive - expect it to run overnight.
If you want to handle backup of data files, documents, photos, etc, then the internal between images will generally be too long - you need a daily or weekly backup. Again there are many programs out there which can do this, or you can just copy the files to a (different) external drive. Again - store it safely. There are also programs which will make this easier, and some which will monitor your machine for changes to files and copy them off to a backup within seconds. If going this way, for about $300 you can get a network (NAS) drive which you can populate with drives yourself - then you have an always-connected backup solution. If you go this way, use gigabit LAN or the performance won't be as good as USB or eSATA.
If your definition of "backup" is copy and paste in explorer windows, for your system partition you would HAVE to image to get most of the data.
An image makes it very quick to recover, and it can recover programs/settings as well - saving your the trouble of reinstalling everything.
A full backup followed by periodic incremental backups would do what you want. I only use images for a base install, not for data recovery.
However, an image is going to be bigger, meaning you can keep less of them. It can also be hard to recover individual files (depending on the imaging software you use; the new Acronis versions let you browse the image like a folder and pull out files).
Generally what's best to do is to take an image every week/month/major change, and to backups daily. This means you can quickly get a fairly recent base system up, then recover you data onto it from  your backup. You should take a fresh image every time you change something big - such as updating key software. It's also good to keep an image offsite.
Either with rsync, acronis or something else. These give you a robust delta changes, where you only write the differences, thus using less space.
My solution is using Acronis for daily files backups (I'm backing to a network drive, but extrenal drive is just as good). This allows me to grab a file i might have deleted or changed by mistake.
An image (to another drive) allows you to get going again with exactly the same installed programs, etc, in the event of a disaster. Making an image is fairly easy it you have another hard drive in an external (USB or eSATA) enclosure. Use some of the popular imaging software (eg Acronis, Clonezilla, Ghost, and many others). Do this periodically, or perhaps a few days after you have installed a big new program and given time for getting used to it, setting it up etc.
The data files backup, in general, gives you up-to-the moment backup of important data. The image gives you all the other junk as well.
