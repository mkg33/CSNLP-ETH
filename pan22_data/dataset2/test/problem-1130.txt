You can backup all your files and folder in onedrive. You can use it free but limited for 15gb. However, if you have office 365 subscription you have 1TB storge in onedrive and it is included.
There is a better solution to your problem: move the folder to a more appropriate place (e.g. %USERPROFILE%\Documents)
If other applications depend on this folder being on the Desktop, you could create a symbolic link with the "mklink" command. Since symbolic links are handled at the file system level (while shortcuts are actual files that simply point to another location), there should not be any compatibility issues with programs that try to use this type of "shortcut" in paths.
Another thing you might consider doing is enabling the File History feature of Windows 8.1. This will allow your system to automatically keep a history of changes to your files and folders. It's best to use with an external storage location, but could be used with a local drive as well. 
If you must have access to the folder from the Desktop, you can always create a shortcut. This ensures that while you might accidentally delete the shortcut, you never actually delete the folder or its precious contents themselves.
