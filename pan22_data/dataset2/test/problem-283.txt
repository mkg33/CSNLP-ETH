For an online copy/lecture notes/reference, (as suggested by Suresh Venkat) go with  Jeff Erikson's lecture notes. They are really awesome! 
try Concise encyclopedia of computer science, Wiley. unfortunately a complete/thorough table of contents for this ref does not seem to be available on the web [a somewhat unusual omission nowadays, maybe Wiley could correct this on request] but the complete index appears to be browsable on amazon. it has coverage that is much broader than TCS such as hardware concepts etc, but it appears to cover significant parts of TCS eg:
If you want a more textbook style book then Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein's "Introduction to Algorithms" would be my suggestion to a mathematician.
Jeff Erickson will not say this himself, but his online lecture notes are among the best out there to cover the basics of algorithm design at a level that doesn't patronize the reader. I use them in my grad algorithms class, and for a research mathematician, these notes convey the right kind (and level) of intuition, allowing you to fill in the details yourself easily. 
it is a 902pp abridged version of the complete encyclopedia, Encyclopedia of Computer Science, 4th Edition, 2064pp
Algorithm Design by Kleinberg Tardos This book helps develop a concrete understanding of how to design good algorithms and talk of their correctness and efficiency. (I studied this in my first year at college, very much readable) 
I'd go for Combinatorial Optimization: Theory and Algorithms - Korte & Vygen. It will go you a good overview of algorithms with a constant focus on optimization. This book is intended for those with a heavy math inclination IMHO.
