To 'fix' this the buckets are checked every so often. Simply imagine someone walking past buckets of water. It they contain a little bit of water (a 0) they are completely emptied. If they are mostly full (a 1 then they are topped up.
The practical way to recover is to recover the information from a non-volatile medium. E.g. via an auto-recovery feature which periodically saves you changes to disk.
No; RAM only holds information as long as there is power flowing to the memory.  If power is interrupted, the information in memory is lost.
The working of a DRAM can be described as a leaky bucket with water. If it is mostly full then the bucket represents a 1. If it is mostly empty it represents a 0.
Some applications have some form of autosave feature which may at intervals save a version of open documents etc.
A UPS will also protect you from power surges, which is the opposite danger of having too much electricity ...
As a private user you probably neither have this equipment, nor the skip to use the resulting raw information. And the time to do this gets ever smaller with decreasing DRAM size (think of smaller buckets and larger holes).
Now these buckets are leaky and stand on a floor with a layer of water in it. If you fill it to the brim with water then it will slowly leak out. Of you empty it then some water may leak into it.
As Shevek said, autosave can help, but in this case the information is saved to the hard drive, not to RAM.
If you have very specialized equipment then you might be able to quickly cool down the DRAM chips (e.g. by spraying liquid nitrogen on them cooling the DRAM chips to 77 K (−196 °C, −321 °F). That will buy you some time to move the chips to dedicated equipment to read their contents.
If the program has no such feature or if loosing even a the information between the last auto-save and the current state is not an option then you only have to choices:
Yes, but you probably don't have the equipment required to extract it. A residual charge will remain on the capacitors within the memory itself, but it's so small that extremely sensitive equipment is required to detect it, much less read it.
