Well you have two solutions.  Many Linux distributions include tools for reading and writing to NTFS drives...
The same problem applies to encryption as well: I use LUKS on Linux, which has some support on Windows. TrueCrypt can't be integrated into Linux systems too well, compared to LUKS, so I settled on that one.
try exFAT, which becomes available for more and more OSes. Accordings to the linked wikipedia article (see sources) there's an open source kernel module for linux in development.  OS X supports it since 10.6.5, Windows supports it since Vista. There are updates for oler Microsoft OSes.
I settled on using NTFS for my external drives, that need to be plugged in into Windows computers, as well as Linux computers. For my removable drives, that are mainly, if not only used on Linux computers, I use XFS.
I struggle from the file size limit, which by today's standards isn't that large anymore. Since exFAT isn't available on Linux yet, I was looking for alternatives, and it's really hard to find something suitable.
I'd suggest the use of exFat file system because I formatted a 120GB Harddisk partition with exFat and it works perfectly with macOS, Linux, and Windows.
The simple answer is- no.  There is no lowest common denominator across these OSes aside from FAT32.
UDF was once meant to be a cross platform and cross media filesystem, but it kinda got forgotten. There is an option to format UDF for hard drives, which is quite suitable for removable drives, but from what I experienced, support on Windows is minimal, if at all. I don't know if Windows 7 supports UDF drives other than BluRay discs.
An alternative would be to use Ext2.  There is a windows utility which integrates the filesystem with the Windows operating system.  I think this would be your ideal solution:
