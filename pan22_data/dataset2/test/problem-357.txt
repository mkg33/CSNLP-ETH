Pitt-Warmuth-1993 - The minimum consistent DFA problem cannot be approximated within any polynomial.
If your FSM is a DFA, then this is the Minimum Consistent DFA Problem, which is well known in the machine learning community. This problem is NP complete 
The problem is also known to be hard to approximate within any polynomial factor. Indeed it is even hard to find an NFA whose number of states is an approximation of the number of states of a minimum consistent DFA. 
this seems an interesting FSM optimization problem; have not seen it studied, wondering if it has been and/ or looking for other insight. 
There are many known heuristics and algorithms for tackling this problems. A well studied algorithm is due to Angluin.
in other words one is given finite lists of words that are in the language and not in the language. there is a simple algorithm of creating an FSM with the given (non)acceptance and then minimizing it, but is this also the smallest possible? it seems to come down some to the question of cycles in the FSM graph. the simple strategy will not have cycles, so could smaller FSMs with cycles exist? there is also the question of nondeterminism.
