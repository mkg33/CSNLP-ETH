Rod Smith also created rEFInd.  It looks like a good choice to me.  Once you've installed it it's supposed to scan for EFI-bootable OS's automatically.  So you don't have to configure them all manually.
I recommend avoiding the automatic os-prober from upstream GRUB, at least for booting multiple Linuxes.  It requires that you notice kernel upgrades on the other installs, and run update-grub manually.
Also, you may want to think about how to re-install your boot manager in case it is lost.  In a BIOS computer, the problem was that installing a new OS would overwrite the existing boot program.  In EFI, the problem is that if you happen to reset the firmware settings (or, in some cases, upgrade the firmware), it will forget where the boot program is.  Boot discs are Good To Have, especially linux live discs with working network drivers :).
An alternative possibility is the traditional (ab)use of the boot loader of one of your OS's, to provide a menu for all of the others.  I.e. add custom entries into its GRUB menu, to chain-load the other loaders.  I think it's relatively simple to add the entries, but it's extra complexity and potentially fragile.  My Fedora laptop has never been able to boot Windows from GRUB for some reason, and I read other reports of the same.  On Ubuntu I find it hard to even get into the GRUB menu (I think it's supposed to be hidden unless it detects another OS?).
