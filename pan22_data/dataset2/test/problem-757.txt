Im familiar with doing this on OSX (Mac) using a programme called Carbon Copy Cloner, which creates a bootable clone of your drive. So you just run the clone process swap over the drives and your all done.
OSX's operating system is free and thus doesn't require a license. Where as W10 / W10 pro do require licenses so i presume the license transfer process is slightly more complex. 
Alternatively, you could clone the HDD to the SSD. If you bought a Samsung SSD, it comes with a free copy of Samsung Magician which will clone the drive for you. There are many other drive clone products, some free and some paid.
Ive been reading up online about how to do it, but allot of the articles seem to be pointing to 3rd party software, im not sure if its the correct software to use, or an affiliate marking ploy. Can someone point me in the right direction to port / transfer my data and license from the HDD to SSD ?
Ive got a laptop running Windows 10 pro (originally shipped with W10 standard that i upgraded to Pro) that shipped with a 1TB HDD. I want to upgrade the HDD to a SSD.
You can link your Windows license to a Microsoft account. When you log on to the new system, it'll register the license for you.
