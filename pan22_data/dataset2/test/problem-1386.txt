No problem, we have had this before, except that when I look in AD there's no key, which means somebody forgot to back it up.  So I randomly click on a handful of other laptop objects and find another not backed up.  So this has me thinking we need to seriously look into this before it happens again (on a higher profile employee).
I've been looking online but so far found nothing exactly what I want, usually it's much more complex than I'm needing.  
We currently use Bitlocker on our laptops here at work.  The helpdesk are responsible for backing the Bitlocker key up to AD when they build the system.  We ran into an issue recently where a user had a hardware problem that set Bitlocker off, so it won't go past the screen prompting for the recovery key.
I can't say what permissions you must have the least, but domain admin is enough(might be an overkill)
Instead of going through the entire laptop OU and clicking on the Bitlocker recovery tab, is there a way in PowerShell to check that tab and see if anything is in there?  I wouldn't even need to know the key there, just to know if any data is there which would show it's been backed up.  If not it's not the end of the world, but I'd much rather be able to do that with a script than manually. :)
