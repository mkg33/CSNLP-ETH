Say I had an httpd running on port 80 running inside my network, but that was blocked by my ISP, I used Port Forwarding in DD-Wrt to map a different external port to get directed to 80.
tcpproxy should do what you need. I'm guessing that your server is listening on TCP/135, and you want to punch a hole in your firewall and expose TCP/8081 on your workstation to the outside world. In that case, you would run tcpproxy on your workstation with a config file that looked something like this:
Of course, replace 'eth0' with whatever your interface name is, and 'xyz' with your server's actual hostname.
So effectively, from outside the network, I could connect to mydomain.dynalias.net:8081 and my server would stay on port 80.
Port Forwarding in DD-Wrt can probably do what you want it to do if I'm understanding you correctly and use NA.
Your ISP blocking 135 for good reason. That port, and port 445, are two of the major vectors for the continued attacks by malware and worms against Windows machines. 
Port 135 is used by active directory and other Microsoft services.  It is unlikely you'll find a good method for redirecting that port either on the client or the server.  You would be better off giving your friend remote access to a virtual PC on your network, using some kind of VPN, or otherwise getting him onto your network where these port assignments do not need to be changed.
I would seriously consider setting up a site-site VPN instead of monkeying around with ports.  Most home routers on the market support it now.
