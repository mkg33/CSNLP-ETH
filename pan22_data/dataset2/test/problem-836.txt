(Of course, to make this work, other players must be able to help defend the target location, or otherwise sabotage attempts to capture it.  You could also, say, make players lose immediately if their capital site is captured; that way, if someone makes a premature play for victory and commits too much of their forces to it, others can attack their now poorly defended capital, and take it out before the over-eager player can win.)
By the way, to see this balancing mechanism in action, I'd very much recommend trying the card game Munchkin.  It's nothing like a 4X game, but it does have a very strong emphasis on (sometimes literal) backstabbing and rapidly shifting inter-player alliances.  The main victory condition is very simple (reach level 10 through combat) and, combined with the plentiful single-use resources that can be used to aid or (more commonly) harm any other player in battle, pretty much guarantees that the game ends in an epic one-against-all fight.
You'll also want to ensure that, when one player (whether through guile or just brute strength and persistence) does get to the stage where they're undefeatable, even by all the other players and NPCs together, the game should end quickly.
One way to achieve this (and also the goal of clearly signaling when someone is close to winning) is to have some specific single goal whose achievement decides the game.  For example, your game world could have a single heavily defended (but otherwise neutral) location whose capture wins the game.  That way, it's pretty obvious when someone sets out to try and capture this location, and if they do succeed, they win immediately.
This meant that if you gained more production capacity than another player, you were very quickly able to leverage that economic advantage into a massive military advantage, to bring the game to a speedy and exciting conclusion.
Many games suffer from linear progression. Things seem to difficult at the start, but later on it is too easy and becomes boring.
It's also worth noting that in 4X games (and other territory-taking games), the larger the map you're playing on, the more positive reinforcement is required in order to bring the game to a close in a timely manner.  If you don't want to put a lot of extra positive reinforcement into your game, you may find that simply reducing the size of your map makes things a lot more satisfying, without making any other changes to the game.
Note that negative reinforcements for advancing in the game are generally a lot more annoying rather than helping. 
In the context of a 4X game this could be prevented by making spying easier when a civilisation is larger. It makes sense that if their borders are larger and their machines more numerous, then it should be easier to steal those ideas. This would mean that the leading civilisation will slowly help the others to advance.
A victory should require effort to achieve, and this effort should stay valuable, otherwise, the victory itself loses its value. 
If you tend to have a long and tedious end-game phase, that means that you aren't getting enough positive reinforcement to overwhelm your opponent and bring the game to a close.
All in all, if someone gets a significant advantage, they are either stopped by the collective effort of all the other players or quickly get to the victory and enjoy winning if other players have no resources to use against the potential winner. No time is wasted. 
Another issue facing civilisations is outside interference. Imagine a space 4X where if one civilisation got too far ahead and were mercilessly crushing others, perhaps an even older, even more powerful computer controlled civilisation could turn up and try to redress the balance of power. They could still win, but now there is a bigger threat for them to face and may have to rethink their strategy of steamrollering.
Perhaps something more "humane" could be added too. What if you were so advanced that the  other civilisations were no match, and you decided to crush them. Not everyone you despotically rule over will like this. perhaps they will start to form dissident groups, then a resistance force and finally revolt and kill you! There you are forging ahead with your evil plans and you overlook your own people and are assassinated or deposed.
Anyway, those are a few that come to mind, but there are plenty of ways that an advanced civ might not automatically have so much of an advantage that they can roll over the others.
One interesting approach to giving better positive reinforcement is in Chris Crawford's The Global Dilemma: Guns or Butter released in 1990, which set up its economic systems so that doubling the amount of money spent on something quadrupled the amount of output.  So for example, if $1000 bought a tank, then $2000 bought four tanks.  And $4000 bought sixteen tanks.  And $8000 bought sixty-four tanks.  (Note that in Guns or Butter, your money had to be completely spent each turn;  you couldn't "save up" between turns)
In a 4X game, you're most likely to go with positive reinforcement;  you want a player, having gotten ahead, to be at an advantage over the other players.  And once that advantage becomes large enough, you want the game to end quickly.  (I think it'd be fascinating to design a 4X game around one of the other two reinforcement models, but that's probably not what you had in mind)
What I am going to talk about has generally been said before, but I think that I have a perfect example to illustrate some of the points and gather them together: the tabletop game called Munchkin. This example is perfect not just because it has all the tools needed to ensure that it stays interesting for the whole session, but also because this game is so simple and easy to understand. 
In multiplayer games, a very effective "automatic" balancing mechanism is that the weaker players can (and have a strong incentive to) join forces against the strongest one.
