STP has to elect the root bridge for L2 segments, and that election can take upwards of a minute or more. If you haven't manually configured who the root bridge should be, it's possible you can have a sub-optimal piece of equipment doing the bridging (i.e. you attach 10-year old switch to a 6500 and the older one has a good likelyhood of winning the election because of the rules of STP).
You almost always want to be using Rapid Per-VLAN STP, rather than simple STP. I say almost only because you can't prove a negative.
In general, Spanning Tree performs poorly across high latency networks, highly congested networks, or networks with even fairly minor reliability/loss issues.   
How have you identified that STP on the router is the culprit?  If you take the output of a "show STP" on each of your routers/switches, you should be able to see where the spanning tree's root is.
It's hard to believe you'd actually be having a loop, since from your description you only have 1 connection between two offices.  More likely you've got a misconfiguration, or you've got problems with your MPLS circuit that are causing BPDU's to get dropped, thereby throwing spanning tree into a tizzy. 
I think to troubleshoot this, you need to figure out which of your switches is the spanning tree root bridge and document your spanning tree topology.  My guess is that when you do you'll find a clear issue such as two switches that are both trying to be the root bridge, a spanning tree depth greater than 7, etc.
I think I understand what you are saying.  On the switch port(s) connecting to your MPLS provider, you should be able to block STP messages (called BPDU filtering).
Some troubleshooting suggestions. You should apply these universally to all network bridges within the same L2 ethernet domain, which will likely include routers and switches alike. You may find it useful to sketch a quick diagram of all devices involved.
PVST has separate elections for each segment, so if your MPLS link is it's own segment (and if it's not then you're either doing something extremely interesting or extremely bad), then that election should only affect that link.
I think we'll need more information to give you an kind of useful answer.  For example, you say that "have identified that the Spanning Tree Protocol from the cisco router as the cause", but normally routers don't participate in spanning tree, only switches do.   When you said router, did you actually mean a L3 switch (like a 3750)?
Running a packet trace with Wireshark or something similar would show the broadcast storm in progress, if that's what's happening, and hopefully point you in the direction of the box responsible.
