If I allow multiple logins (ie, user "test" can login more than once) and a user doesn't log off, but leaves the sessions open, eventually the server will not allow any new logins (once the max is reached) - even for the user "test".
If you are locked out because of too many sessions, I think you might still be able to connect to the 'console' session. I am not sure of the syntax to do this windows, but if using remote desktop from Linux you can use rdesktop -o serverName. You can then kill sessions by going to 'Terminal Services Manager' in administrative tools, right click the session and select disconnect.
I suspect you have to reconnect from the same PC that you originally connected from. Not sure though. I've seen the same behavior. As regards the mstsc syntax Microsoft in their wisdom decided to change the switch from /console to /admin from Vista onwards for console sessions.
It appears that under some circumstances the remote desktop will only attempt to start new sessions, rather than reconnecting to the old sessions.
