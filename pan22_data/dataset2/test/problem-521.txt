As with any important system, you need to have a solid backup. If you get in trouble with this (or any other suggested process), you're going to need that backup.
But I would certainly make sure you have good backups before starting, when things go wrong, they go horribly wrong.
We have a Dell server with 3 300GB SAS Drives that are combined as a single drive with two partitions. The partition the OS is on is only 12 GB while the remaining space is on the other partition. We need to resize the 12 GB partition to about double that size, but I am unsure on the best way to do so. Dell recommended we use Partition Magic, but I am concerned since this is physically three hard drives even if the computer sees them all together as a single drive. Will Partition Magic work in this situation. Is there some other way to accomplish this goal. 
It should also be said that -- unfortunately -- formatting and reinstalling just isnt an option in this instance. 
LVM could be good answer for your questions. Or some FS such as ZFS. But if you run Windows OS, try to use soft like Partition Magic.
Presumably the 3 drives are attached to a RAID controller of some sort, Partition Magic claims to support RAID and won't know or care if it is 3 drives or 1 drive or 10 drives;
