This was a result of the configuration file trying to restrict binding to IPv4 interfaces only using 0.0.0.0 wildcard.
Firewall rules restricting traffic to port 123 for both source and destination are possible.  This provides a working ntp setup but limits access by other tools.  Some tools allow you to use port 123 as the source port if it available.  I am partial to using ntpdate in debug mode. 
You can also check /etc/sysconfig/ntp or equivalent for any configuration that might restrict interface binding.
Shane is correct about the reach value which indicates you have access to the server.  The high offset and jitter values for your time server indicates it may not be very reliable.  They may be high, because your server is still synchronizing.  The fact that the poll interval has increased to 128 indicates that your server is getting consistent results.  It should gradually increase to 1024 seconds.
So basically ntpdate worked and there were not firewall issues and yet ntpq -p showed reach =0 for each server listed.
Yes, the time server is unreachable, for a reason I couldn't ever determine. The good news is that one of the external DNS servers to which I have access turns out to be serving NTP packets itself, and it is connecting to that external time server for its ticks. It's a workaround, not a fix. But, I'll take what I can get.
If you are correct about the refid of the upstream server being your IP address, it appears to be using your server as it's preferred timesource.  Try adding restrict noquery to your configuration.  It may be your upstream server is poorly configured.  Try adding your router and/or nameservers as sources, I find they can be better sources than the official corporate server.  
Just wanted to add my two cents to the top Google search result.. I ran into this problem on a host where NTP was not binding to the host's external interface. If you have this problem, look at the output of netstat -tulpn.
Try removing the server 127.127.1.0 from your config - the * by *LOCAL(0) tells us that the local server with stratum 5 is being used for sync, preferred over the remote server with stratum 1; the delay and offset both being 0.000 likely has a lot to do with that.
Turned out to be the restrict lines in ntp.conf.  I just removed all the restrict lines from ntp.conf and restarted ntpd and everything worked from there.
There are a number of restrictions which can be set on ntpd to limit how much information about the server can be accessed remotely.  It is possible you are restricted to only using the upstream server as a time source.  
If you are going to include the local clock fudge its level a fair bit.  It looks like you have it set to 5.  I generally set it to at least 8 (fudge   127.127.1.0 stratum 8).  If you don't fudge it, you can appear like an atomic clock to other hosts on your network.  On one network I scanned, I found a lot of low strata servers announcing times which were usually incorrect by hours or days.
As a side note, I did register with the NTP bug database so I could write enhancement bug 2297, asking for formal documentation for the peer refids .INIT., .LOCL., and LOCAL(0).
