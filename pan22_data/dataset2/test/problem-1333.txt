I use XP file explorer in the most basic view, the address bar at the top and files always in list view underneath.
I am trying a freeware file manager I found on download.com. It's called NexusFile V. The home page is http://xiles.net/programs/. I use the mouse more than the keyboard but a quick walk through the settings and you can customize the fonts (including size) and the colors, so you should be able to set it up for high visibility. You can also customer the function key actions so if there is a keyboard shortcut missing you have the possibility of using the function key mapping to add it.
The reason I do this is because I'm almost blind and do everything from the keyboard and don't touch the mouse whilst navigating through files, this is because I can type "L[ENTER]D[Enter]B[Enter]" and know that I'm in "c:\documents and settings\Brett Ryan", and I can hit [Tab] once to go to the address bar to type in a folder.
Can anyone suggest a replacement for windows explorer that brings back this basic navigational behavior?
I have Vista and Windows 7 and on both machines, I use XPlorer2.  I use the paid version, but the free version has quite a few features that would make anyone wonder why they still use the built-in Windows Explorer.
One tip, in Windows 7, if you want to get right to a directory, just hit the Windows key and start typing your path.  Press  and Windows Explorer will pop up in that path.
ZTreeWin is text-mode, tree-structured file/directory manager. It can be far more effective for getting things done than Windows Explorer, with only a few easily learnt keystrokes.
Sorry to hear that. I am using Windows 7 RC and it seems to me that the same keyboard shortcuts I use in XP still work. That said, I am not a big Windows Explorer fan either. I use another replacement on my XP machine, but I have not installed it on my Windows 7 machine so I don't know if it will even run.
I'm still refusing to go to Windows Vista and now Windows 7 mainly due to the windows explorer, I find it cumbersome and hard to use exclusively with a keyboard.
