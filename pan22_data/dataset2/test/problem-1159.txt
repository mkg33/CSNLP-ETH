With your au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt syn match, your intermingling several aspects: filetype detection (the mapping of *.txt to an (here: implicit) filetype), filetype customization, syntax highlighting). It would be cleaner (and more extensible) to separate the things:
The multiplier for 1 or more matches is \+; you forgot the backslash (or the \v "very magic" modifier). Using \ze at the end is superfluous. ^ matches at every beginning of line \n only starting on the second line. Please be aware that Vim uses a special regular expression dialect, so what various web sites tell you may need adaptation. The :help pattern pages are the best and authoritative reference.
Also, your syntax addition may be obscured by existing syntax rules. You can try appending containedin=ALL, but that's not a general solution. You may need to analyze the existing syntax and craft a special solution for each syntax. As an alternative, you may use the :match command. This works on top (and independent) of syntax highlighting. The downside is that this is window-local, so you need :autocmd magic if you want to apply this only to certain buffers, or also to window splits.
