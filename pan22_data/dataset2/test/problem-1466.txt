Buy a new drive, but rather than “wasting” the old one, use it as an off-site backup.  You can use the packaging that the new one came in, tape it up and label the package.  Leave it at a relative’s house for safe keeping.
At this point it simply not time efficient to keep digging deeper. (Unless you enjoy it). If the problem persists, you can always decide to go deeper in your search, or replace the drive.
Look for the THERMTRIP# or THRMTRIP# signals in the Intel's chipsets datasheets (e.g.  Intel® 200 and Z370 Series Chipset Families PCH Datasheet Vol. 1 ).
If a partition "doesn't show up anymore", the first thing to check would be what diskmgmt.msc sees - is the partition itself gone (which would mean something damaged the partition table - which is a rare thing unless malice is involved), or is the filesystem in that partition damaged beyond being recognized (use filesystem specific tools), or has something simply unmapped the drive letter?
Anyways, especially since you were playing, it's extremely likely that this was not a hard drive or other device's failure, but just an instance of overheating.  
In your question you seem to ask which things you 'can' do, but in the title you ask what you should do.
If the reliability of a drive is suspect, generic SMART utilities (eg the mentioned CrystalDiskInfo) are your friend - try to understand as much as you can of the actual SMART values displayed, not just the conclusion a tool draws from them. "Pending sectors" that aren't going away fast mean the drive should be going away fast. Overtemperature or spinup failure events also can make a drive suspect.
Of course it's of little use in most cases, since you'll usually have no way to save the work you're doing.  
I think in some cases I did manage to keep the pc running even after the chipset's shutdown, however, by cooling it down quickly.
Of course some generic maintenance (e.g. cleaning the fans) can never hurt, but don't spend too much time on it.
It has probably nothing to do with Windows, as others suggested: some computers (especially laptops, but possibly desktops too) have overheating protections that cause the southbridge/PCH, where the hard drives and other things are attached, to shut down.
Get into the habit of keeping a temperature-monitoring product running, possibly with alerts set up, and see if you reach dangerous temperatures often enough to warrant a cooling system overhaul (or at least cleaning).
Usually (well, on my laptop, at least) after a couple minutes from this the whole computer will shut down.
