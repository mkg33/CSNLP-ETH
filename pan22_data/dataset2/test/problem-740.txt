It is possible, and I know gParted (a Linux/Gnome application) will resize Windows partitions for you.  If done right everything works great, however one time I hit a snag and lost all the data (although it could have been my fault, it was the first time I attempted it).
Yes - you can use Partition Magic or the like to do this. Defragmenting your drive first should give you a bit more space at the end of the drive to work with.
I currently have a 160GB drive partitioned as C: (Windows, Primary) and D: (data). I was a terrible estimator in the beginning, and the C: drive is approaching capacity, whereas I have ~35GB spare on the data drive. 
Although I love GParted, I would have to recommend EASEUS Partition Master.  I just used it to repartition my Windows 7 computer and know that it works flawlessly.  It runs directly from within Windows so you don't have to create a boot CD.
(Just for your own peace of mind, I'm backing everything up and starting fresh anyway, as I figure that's safest, but I've been wondering about this).
Is it possible (and using what?) to safely change/adjust these two partitions so that I can expand C:, without losing any data?
I recommend gParted too, you can get it on a LiveCD, and resize your partitions rather safelly. It's never 100% safe though, you should always backup important data first.
