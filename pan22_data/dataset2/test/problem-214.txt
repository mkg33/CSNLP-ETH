I turned off the RHEL 6 server's interface and brought up the RHEL 7 server's interface.  I assigned it the IP address but I am unable to connect to it.  Traceroute shows no response.  I dropped iptables, tried traceroute again and still got no response.  
To keep things as simple as possible I want to move the IP address in use by the RHEL 6 server to the RHEL 7 server.  
I am trying to replace an authoritative DNS server running on RHEL 6 with an authoritative DNS server running on RHEL 7.  DNSSEC is enabled.  
I copied the zone files, keys, etc from the RHEL 6 DNS server to the RHEL 7 DNS server and confirmed named-chroot was resolving names with dig @localhost xxx.xx.xxx.xxxx.
I asked our firewall (Sonic Wall) admin if there was anything in the rules that would discriminate based on the server's hostnames (they are different) but he showed me the rule that sends all DNS traffic to the IP address so that would not seem to be the problem.  
I deleted the ip address from the RHEL 7 server, turned off it's interface, and brought up the RHEL 6 server's interface.  Traceroute now shows a response and the RHEL 6 server resolves names correctly.
