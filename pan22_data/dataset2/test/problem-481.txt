In its infinite wisdom, some versions of Windows show a file named e.g. xyz.jpg.exe as if it was an image (JPEG), you ask to open it, and it is run as it is an executable... game over.
I believe you are referring to the fact some email viewers block the downloading of images in HTML emails.  This isnt so much a security concern, but a profanity filter.  If the email client sees an email with images as from an unverified source, it will block the images from downloading as it might contain images that some find offensive (porn spam).  This feature should be able to be disabled in every email client and allow all images to be downloaded with the mail.
Why does viewing an image in a web browser or any other email can pose a security concern? Do some viruses pose as images? 
The image formats are quite complex, and so are the programs/libraries that process them. There have been bad bugs in those. Add that the images gotten via email/WWW are (by definition) from untrusted sources, that a bug can very well lead to run code specified by the attacker and loaded into the image, and you are in the exactly same situation as above.
