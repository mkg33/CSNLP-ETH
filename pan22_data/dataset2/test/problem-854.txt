I don't think there's any native way to do this. The only way to do it would be to export the state when you disable it and then re read it from a config file when you enable it. You may have better luck on StackOverflow with this one.
After some testing and research I discovered the location in the registry where msconfig stores the past enabled start value as well as the disabled date.
What would you need to determine? Whether or not it's already set to the type you want to set it to? 
How can I create a script or use the command line in a program to determine which start type to use when re-enabling a service?
It really doesn't matter what the current state is. If you are "re-enabling" a service by setting it's startup type to Automatic and it's already set to Automatic then no change will ocurr, so you really don't need to determine what it's current state is.
It consists of sub keys for each disabled service and each sub key has the following values: YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND as well as the short name of the disabled service who's data contains one of the following:
I found that they can also be enabled or disabled using sc config commands, by setting the start option as disabled or one of boot,system,auto,etc.
What O/S are you on? Powershell may be a better bet. You can Google "Get-Service" to get you started.
FYI: 4 = disabled. That's why it is not in the list above. Only keys which are currently disabled are listed in that location. And I don't think XP has 5.
