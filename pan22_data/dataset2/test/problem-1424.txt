In my experience I have found VMWare to be a brilliant virtualization tool. I have used the workstation version and the server version, it's worked flawlessly for me, however; I do find that VMWare is not as simple to get going as VirtualBox is, if you want the free (server) edition you will be running a little excess overhead to manage the services component.
In summary, if you want a dedicated machine to handle your virtualization, go with VMWare, but if it's for development purposes on your local machine, I'd definately go with VirtualBox.
VirtualBox also contains a snapshot feature that is only part of the workstation (retail) version of VMWare.
I had better performance, and a smoother experience, with VirtualBox, but VMWare's handling of multiple VMs blows it out of the water - so it depends what you're using it for.
Thanks to VMWare I installed a fresh copy of Virtualbox and it's running smoothly. That's how I feel about the two. 
On the other hand I've now switched to VirtualBox on OSX and it's been everything I've ever needed. It works perfectly for a development environment and allows assigning USB ports exclusively to a machine or based on vendor codes (filters).
You might consider to use both at first! Install a Linux VM in both VMWare and VirtualBox. Use both for two months or more. After a while, you'll notice that you're using one of them more than the other. The one you use most is the best one for you, providing you the most features that you're using.
I ran into some config issue with VirtualBox (shared folders weren't working anymore and I didn't know how to enable it again) so I tried VMWare as I assumed it was a professional piece of code and maybe I could get it going faster than tracing my issue in VirtualBox.
VMWare didn't solve it so I decided to go back to VirtualBox. In the process of uninstalling VMWare on WindowsXP I lost all the network connections and my tech support gave up fixing it so I ended up re-formatting the drive and installing everything again, thanks to VMWare.
I've used VMWare with great success for developing drivers where you need to run checked OS builds and debug & single-step kernel code. I think that is its major strength. I use VirtualBox for hosting assorted OSes holding software I don't want to install on my work PCs (like old versions of browsers and applications, etc).
