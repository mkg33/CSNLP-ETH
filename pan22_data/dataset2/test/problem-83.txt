I did the brute-force ignorant method. Delete all registry keys that have the extension mentioned in them, as well as delete all the registry keys that have the previous application (bar.exe) mentioned in them.
Similar to the top answer, but I find it best to only delete the UserChoice sub-key because you don't need to kill all of the info about the file extension (like the open with list), just the "choice the user selected" (aka-UserChoice).  I use a REG file to make it fast to repeat for testing.  You can copy paste this, including the version line, and save as a REG file.  Just change .ics and .vcs to whatever extensions you want (or just remove one line if you only want to reset one):
Also, and the main reason I posted this answer, with this solution I don't have to restart explorer.exe.  Maybe something specific to my setup, but I've used on Win7 and Win8 and never had to restart explorer.exe for the change to take effect.
If you aren't familiar with REG files, the above lines that start with "-" simply delete those keys from the registry.
In Explorer, go to Tools | Folder Options | File Types, find the extension you're looking for, and click Delete.
None of the other answers' methods worked on their own for me when trying to delete the file association for something like .htaccess. This combined method worked (Windows 10):
