However, you shouldn't be using root passwords in the first place, use ssh keys for authentication instead. Then the impact of shared server keys is pretty small if you only log on from a LAN.
The impact of shipping the same key pair with all your devices is directly related to the security of the clients connecting to them, as it means that there is no way (from an SSH client) to uniquely identify the device it may be connecting to. Should your key pair be leaked, it could be used for MITM attacks.
Behold I tell you the truth, he who compromises one device compromises all of them. Once obtained one, expect bad people to jump from one to another at will and the security rolled back as though it were thin paper.
It sounds like in the first option, the SSH keys would be available on the SD card. So any user could take the card and read them out. So basically your private keys have become (mostly) public.
The possibilities are endless. And the target would never know, because the sshd key is identical to the one found on the real server. Depending on the physical security of the facilities that are receiving your device, this could be incredibly trivial. Don't do this.
Rather than storing host-specific data such as ssh host keys on the SD card or other read-only media, you can store this in NVRAM, which is what it's for on an embedded system. You'll need to do some custom scripting to store and retrieve the keys at boot time, but the scripts will be exactly the same for every device.
And now every server has a new key. Because you really, really don't want to be distributing copies of a key. I mean honestly it's at least as bad as snapping a picture of your house keys and uploading them to the Internet with your home address.
SSH also provides forward secrecy, so an attacker has to be able to setup a false server to benefit from the keys; passively sniffing the traffic will not allow decrypting it.
Oh, what's that? Your password is "I like cats"? Boy, this is an interesting email you sent to your wife. I bet it would be even more interesting if she read this email that you sent to your next door neighbors wife.
If your devices are, say a Raspberry Pi's for example. If I walk up and yank the SD card from one, I can stick the SD card in my own computer, find the sshd key and copy that to everywhere I want. Maybe I grab my own raspberry pi and a USB ethernet card. Now I can stick that in between a target device and wherever they're going and monitor for ssh connections. When I see that the target device is trying to make an ssh connection, I do this:
I read this in horror! I who have done multiple machines in the same cluster with the same ssh host key would never dare do this. Do not under any circumstances allow machines with different sets of administrators to share ssh host keys. That way lies madness and screaming horror when you get posted for your lack of security.
Instead, do what you already propose but fix it. Before you write your image run something like this:
