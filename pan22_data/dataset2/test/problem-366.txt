The downside of this is that if you have a lot of them around you are going to need to do a lot of processing on each decision cycle so if you have large levels you may want to have an overview AI for the area outside of the user's viewport, just controlling how many NPCs are in the area and occasionally posting some new ones into view, and then the agent-based approach for those that are currently visible. 
If it were me I would give each NPC agency of their own - if each one has a simple goal ( get as far as possible from Zombies/get as close as possible to humans ) that they act on, you can get quite interesting behaviours from relatively simple inputs without too much processing. 
The best approach for your particular case will undoubtedly be to experiment with the options and find the simplest case that is fun. As a general rule, the more complexity you add the more frequently it will fail. Because AI tends to be non-deterministic it is way harder to validate its operation with automated tests, but fortunately manual tests are often either interesting or hilarious, so it has its merits.
