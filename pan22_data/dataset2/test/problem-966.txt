This was in the days of ILoveYou.exe. I was doing web development for a small company that sold refurbished hardware.
I've even had one call because he punched the computer and it quit working.  A big dent in the side panel but once I plugged a power cable back in it continued to work.
That's a strange message, I thought. Well not as strange as "lp0 is on fire" but I was pretty sure I had never heard of Windows calling the printer "broken." So I go to her desk on the open floor.
We were really happy and proud that our work was over around june. The problem is, our boss thought that just installing an air conditionner for the server room was good enough. But unfortunatly you have to refuel the gas. So the air conditionner was venting hot air.
A quick look at the error box shows the problem--no such user.  Since it's in-house e-mail the offending message isn't being accepted by the mail server at all.  A look at the mail--that's not how to spell her name.  Repeat a few dozen times, sometimes with minor variations.
Let's just say thank god for backups.  We also immediately ordered new locks/keys for the rack doors and didn't bother giving one to our lovely manager.
So she forwarded every email. Enter ILoveYou.exe. I read about it no Slashdot; and I quickly wrote an email to all employees, and the boss of the company printed a dozen posters saying "DO NOT OPEN ILOVEYOU.EXE" and posted them around the office.
About 1 year ago, with my collegue we worked our ass off to have a stable network with security policy, (ldap, proxy, internet quota, mail accout, and so on).
In result 1 year of work destroy, all drive didn't support the electric shortage. Fortunatly, we were still having the previews server, so we put them online ASAP. But still after destroying our work, our boss said to us "Well, it's your fault. It's your job to fix the air conditionner! It's not my fault!"
In his world computers have only two states:  Working or broken.  Any message box that he doesn't expect is broken.
Back around 2002, I was working for a manager who was about as technically clueless as they come.  One day he was giving a tour of the data center to some higher-up political types and was describing the amazing virtues of RAID.  While standing next to a rack of production servers, he decided to demonstrate by opening the rack and removing one of the drives from a mission critical system running a single RAID 5 array.  If he had stopped there, the story wouldn't be very good, but he didn't.  He went ahead and removed a second disk from the array.
Let me introduce the main character. There was this one lady who worked as a salesperson there, basically her job involved her being on the phone 8h a day. In those days mobile phones were a bit more expensive, but still; I learned she had a FRF1000 (~ â‚¬150) mobile phone bill, while probably making only 10000 a month. Indeed, she was spending all of her break time on the phone. And who was she calling all that time? Her roommate, whom she saw every evening in person. FWIW she was not gay, so it wasn't even hot phone sex; just random chatter.
I glance at the screen quickly, shocked. I stare at her while putting my finger on the alert box that had popped up. I wait a few seconds. She says nothing. So I ask her.
I report the problem, his solution stopping all servers. Well good idea, no one was there for the next week, so a good solution until the air conditionner is fixed. I'm going to the server room, start to shutdown the server.... no, my boss find to long, and shut down the breaker of the server room.
A few weeks later, she calls me complaining that I had broken the printer. I was just doing web development, but obviously I had become the computer guy since there was no one else to do it. I ask her what the problem was.
My boss tells an amusing anecdote about one of my coworkers, a Chinese man with a thick accent.  Smart guy, but hard to understand on the phone sometimes (I'm an expert in Engrish).  So one day he gets a tech-support call from an Indian guy, and is having a hard time getting the guys name and problem description.  After about 5 minutes of listening to the Chinese guy on the phone, my boss, native English speaker, offers to help.  He gets on the phone "Can I help you?" to which the poor Indian goes, "Oh thank God!" 
She was the type of person who would pass around every single chain letter. You know, Ericsson will give you a free phone if you forward this mail to 1000 persons? I was one of her recipients. I told her it was BS. I showed her a web site explaining it was BS. She proceded to call Ericsson and get laughed at as soon as I turned around.
