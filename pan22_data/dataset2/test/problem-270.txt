If there no enough free space you have to buy a large hard disk and then replace it, if that you could also use this software Partition Assistant to migrate your OS to the new drive without data loss and reconfigure (reinstall) OS.
There is a number of commercial software packages for re-partitioning and partition / filesystem resize operations. There also are open-source Linux based LiveCD solutions like the GParted project with a pretty wide range in hardware (controller drivers) support and a broad feature set (resizing / moving partitions, resizing FAT/NTFS/extX filesystems). 
In general, you should take the route you feel most comfortable and confident with. If you have never used partition editing utilities, you might prefer the backup/restore approach, although it would mean a longer downtime period and more manual work for the admin than the other two. Under no circumstances should you use partition editing utilities which have little prevalence in the market and thus have not been widely tested by a large number of users in most of the possible use cases.
If the system partition is the only (and thus the last) partition on your disk, you could use a Windows Server 2008 / Vista / Windows 7 DVD to start the recovery mode and use the command line to invoke "diskpart" to extend the volume as described in KB 325590, thus removing the need for involving non-Microsoft software in the process.
Windows Server 2003 does support the expansion of volumes but it does so for non-system volumes (i.e. not the one where your "WINDOWS" directory is) only. If you need to expand the system volume, you would need to resort to 3rd-party tools. 
If the volume in question is on a FakeRAID device, you are very likely to encounter problems with any solution, so the recommended approach there would be creating a full backup and replaying it on a new installation.
Is there any free space on the same disk that could be used to extend system partition? If yes, you could refer to this article it contains the tutorial resize partition: http://www.extend-partition.com/resource/how-to-partition-a-hard-drive.html
