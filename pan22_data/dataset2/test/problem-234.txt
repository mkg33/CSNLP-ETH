After that I find the closest enemy on a particular side by checking the distance from the enemy to the player and returning the closest one:
The best way to do this depends on a few things. I'm going to assume the following - if any of these are incorrect, please let me know and I'll update my answer:
The left enemy robot is closer than the right enemy robot, but I want the character to attack the robot that is closest to him on his right side. I can't use Physic.SphereCast or anything of that sort because it will just find the closest enemy on both sides. How can I make this happen?
All the left enemy are in lower value in x-axis position. Objects on right side are on higher value. Subtract main character's x value from enemy's. Positive results are for enemies at right side.
in a straight line to the right of your player and return the GameObject of the first collider it hits?
Made it work by assigning a "Left Side" tag to the enemies on the left and a "Right Side" tag to the enemies on the right.
