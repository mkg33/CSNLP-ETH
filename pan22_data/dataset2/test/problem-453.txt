Is the WAN team configured to use the LAN team's ip address for DNS resolution and is the WAN team configured to register with the internal DNS? If so then my bet is that's the problem.
About your problem: I don't think there's a way to solve that, other than manually configuring Windows Firewall to block everything you don't need on the public side and allow everything you need on the private side; Windows really doesn't have any way to read your mind and say "hey, this is my private network and this is a public one I shouldn't trust": it's a domain controller, obviously any network connections it could have has to be a domain one. After all, you could very well be creating a domain on a set of public IP addresses, couldn't you?
I have a Server 2008 R2 Enterprise server with 4 NICs.  2 are teamed for LAN 2 are teamed for WAN.  This server has the Active Directory Domain Services, DNS and RRAS roles installed.
A DC shouldn't be multihomed (= placed on two different networks at the same time), because this could mess up quite some things unless you can deal properly with DNS registrations and some other settings; and, even in this case, it could mess up some things anyway.
