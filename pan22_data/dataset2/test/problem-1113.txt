Therefore there might be some limitation on the ISP side, like some proxy, protocol filtering etc. This must be communicated with ISP itself, but I personally don't even believe some provider will shut down HTTPS. Is there any other HTTPS-enabled site accessible? Facebook, twitter for example.
These connections often have many transmission errors, which can break https connection and all encryptedâ€‹ content must be reloaded.
Most https sites has heavy weight content now. PSTN dialup speed can't be more 64Kbps or 128Kbps for ISDN connections. It takes more time to download this content but https protocol is very 
We have some customers still using dial-up in remote locations. After disabling HTTP and forcing them to use HTTPS, some of those offices have indicated they cannot connect. 
In theory, there is no reason why dial-up cannot do https. It is Level 7 protocol and dialup is on levels 1-3, so it even doesn't know there is any https (it is just pack of data).
I have searched online and only confirmed my prior knowledge so far - dial-up uses PSTN to connect to the internet and should be able to support HTTP/HTTPS. The only possible causes I can think of are platform supportability for our current TLS cipher suite. However, the customer is using a recent version of our software and working on Windows 7. LMK
Also Windows 7 often downloads it's updates which has usually 300MB per a week. The computer will take more one day for it with such speed.
