In order to solve various network problems, I have configured a central GNU/Linux router, where I use tools like iptraf in order to monitor the current network usage and obtain detailed information on the traffic that is originated from and destined to each host on the network.
How would I diagnose what's slowing down the network, and/or finding computers on the network using an unusually high amount of bandwidth?
I manage a small LAN (30 computers, mix of Linux, Windows, and Macs). Transferring a 100MB file to a local server (i.e. in the office, not on the Internet) used to take me about a couple minutes, but recently it's been taking nearly 30 minutes. I've checked my localhost and the server, and each machine is fine, so I'm assuming there's some issue with the network.
I would suggest you use managed switches as syneticon-dj suggested, and have a local server be configured to monitor its vitals and traffics, you can use cacti to graph its traffic, cpu/memory usages and else. You can also configure it to send off alerts when the thresholds cross some level that you configure in, nagios would be more useful in such alerting tasks.
It is also quite likely that you are not seeing a bottleneck, but errors in transmission due to either mis-configuration (e.g. a duplex mismatch) or bad cabling. Observing the error statistics counters of your switch should give some clues.
Besides checking the hardware, consider investigating what happens at OSI Layer 8 -that is, the users.
There are cases where employees use file sharing applications or video/audio streaming on their workstations -something that may cause a serious impact on a network's performance.
What are good network monitoring tools for Linux (specifically Ubuntu) that will help me in this task? Most I've found seem geared for monitoring the network access of the localhost, not the access of other machines on the same network.
This is because they would be mostly useless in a switched network. The switch is separating the data traffic so a host ideally only gets the data it is intended to get. If you need network-wide statistics, you would need to monitor the RMON statistic counters of your switches (only available if you are using managed switches).
