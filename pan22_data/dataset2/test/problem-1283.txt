If you can find a user group or similar of folks with your proposed computer you might get reports of what actually works (who knows, could be 256 GB works fine, and those are getting less obnoxiously priced, while the 512 GB and 1TB cards have the large $/GB premium now.)
Yes, it should work fine... but be aware that filesystem may suppot only 64GB of that 128. In the worst scenario, you would have to create partition that would only have half of whole size, but that shouldn't be necessary in most of cases.
I'm not quite sure if this was the correct board for this topic. But I had been searching for an answer and found no luck in with regard to this specific question..
Yes the 128gb MicroSD works fine. In addition I am using a 128GB USB to improve the storage. Both work well together. In essence you will get 64gb internal, 128gb microsd and 128gb USB
The main question is if it can support 64GB then it must mean it's a SDXC compatible card slot, so in turn it should (?) be able to make use of the 128GB card. I can't afford to physically test this myself since there is a no refunds policy if I willingly buy the 128GB card knowing about the 64GB limit of the device (I'm gonna be buying from the same store.
I'm looking to buy a Lenovo Miix 3-10 (80HV0025PH) Hybrid Windows tablet for school. As it only comes in 64GB eMMC (other options are only 32GB), I am thinking that it would not be enough storage space for me, as this will be my main and only computer. This website, the official shop site and some other sources state that I can expand the storage with an sd card of upto another 64GB. Normally I would be satisfied with this setup but if I have the option to put a 128GB card then why not?
My particular device is a Campark Action Cam in which the specifications state it supports 64GB micro-SD cards.  Since that implies it supports SDXC I thought I would give a 128GB card a try.
In many cases what is officially supported and what works are not the same, but the only way to know for sure is to try, which can be a rather expensive method if it does not work. i.e. my phone officially supports only 32GB micro-SD, but is widely reported to work fine with 64; personally I went with 32 not so much due to the "officially supported status" as the fact that I don't really do enough with the phone to stress the 32 GB storage and at the time 64 was a large premium in price/GB. 
And indeed it does work.  More exactly it reports 119GB free after a format and can record and playback video.   I placed the camera in loop record mode and will report back on how it behaves as the card fills up beyond 64GB.
