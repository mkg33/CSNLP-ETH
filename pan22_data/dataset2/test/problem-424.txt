If installing custom firmware on a router seems to hard for you, there are people selling routers with the firmware already changed on ebay.
I have suggested this to a couple parents before.  Using a router like WRT54GL (linux variant) and installing something like dd-wrt firmware, or tomato firmware, you can control access at the router level, and EVEN add keyword filtering (blacklist words, sites, etc).
allowing internet on such a machine is just a matter of the right cronjob which brings the WAN interface up or down at the right time :)
i like my soekris a lot, can do a lot of fancy things since it has a complete OS (and lots of user tools on it).
Great little routers, and if you want gigabit, just buy a gigabit switch, and plug it into your router as the last point out to your internet (unless your internet connecting is 100mbits+)
I'm using a D-Link DIR-655 router, which includes an Access Control feature that will do what you want.  Set up blocking based on schedules, ports, IP addresses and MAC addresses.  It's an excellent router.
I had a TrendNet WGR533 and now own a Linksys E3000 - both allowed you to manage access by schedule using IP address or MAC address.
