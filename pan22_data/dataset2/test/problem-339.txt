Perhaps the next piece of code may be overwhelming for a Java beginner, due to the fact that it uses advanced features of the language such as streams, lambdas, and try-with-resource clauses. However, just for showing a different approach using functional programming, your program could be rewritten as follows:
Google "try-with-resources". This will make it so that your program will close the file even if something goes wrong in the middle.
You should not have each of these as individual values. You arrived at the right idea later on with the count array. All of those individual letter count variables should go away and you should operate on the array directly.
Keep in mind that this isn't 1989-era C, so you don't need to predeclare all of your variables at the top of methods. Declare them where they're actually used.
Welcome to CodeReview! Especially as a beginner programmer, it takes bravery to show your code to the internet, but you've taken the first step.
What is the number 23? This is a so-called magic number. If it really needs to be in the program, it should be put in its own named constant. However, I suspect that this is the number of lines of input. First: you already have logic to quit once you find the end of the file. Also: why store every line? You only need to store the results of letter summation, not the raw input. So this array is not necessary.
