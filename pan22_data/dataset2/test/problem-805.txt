For practical purposes, a WAN is routed, and packets passed between devices in the network go through routers which direct them to their destination. A LAN is not routed, and the devices in the network communicate with each other directly (they will probably go through one or more hubs or switches, but not routers).
One way to think about the difference is not in terms of size or geographical location, but control:
In addition there's also MAN (Metropolitan Area Network). These are usually smaller than WANs and larger than LANs (although there's really no size restrictions). Their purpose is to provide higher quality service or differentiated service to a smaller geographical area like a town, city, or university campus and to establish a connection between the several LANs it may serve and the WAN it may be served with.
A LAN is typically something completely within your own premises (your organization's campus, or building, or office suite, or your home), so it's something you build and own yourself, all the way down to the physical cabling. In contrast, a WAN is something that connects between geographically separated locations, so you generally have to lease access to lines or data transmission services from telecommunications carriers to create your WAN.
The differences between LANs and WANs tend to be at the physical and data-link layers. At the network layer (Layer 3 in the old-but-still-helpful-for-some-discussions OSI layering model), most people use IP (Internet Protocol) nowadays. Because it all uses IP, applications that use IP don't have to know what physical and data-link layers are in use, so anything you can do on a LAN you can potentially do on a WAN as well, if you have high enough bandwidth and low enough latency for whatever it is you're trying to do, and as long as you haven't blocked it at your firewall (or via the accidentally firewall-like properties of a NAT).
Because of the technical hurdles associated with moving lots of data long distances reliably, WAN links tend to be lower bandwidth and higher latency than LAN links. Also, because you're usually paying a separate telecom carrier for the service, to keep costs down, most organizations try to limit (or at least not go crazy with) how much data they move over WAN links.
Because of the shorter distances needed for on-premises networks, and because of the focus on connecting PCs and servers, LANs tend to be built on Ethernet and other 802.3-family (and 802.11-family) physical layers and data links.  1000BASE-T, 1000BASE-SX, 1000BASE-LX, etc.
So, after several answers have been tabled for your question...   As far as a small home/office router is concerned: 
Many Answers here have given textbook-like definitions that have touched on this, but there are certain practical, real-world distinctions worth underscoring:
Your company may have routers in Chicago and LA, but since they're under one company's control, they're part of one LAN. You probably route traffic between them publicly, over the WAN.
Because off-premises network links usually need to go longer distances and work over the telecommunication carriers' existing infrastructure, they tend to use physical and data-link standards that are more common in the telecom industry. Then again, for your convenience, telecom carriers usually hand off to you using an 802.3-family link, even if what they're using behind the scenes is, say, OC-3 and SONET/SDH.
