Also for faster removal, you can disable windows caching on Hardware section of your device, sometimes windows will take longer than expected to flush the cache to external disk and will display that message saying that the device is in use (because it will be, by Windows itself)
I only had a single Explorer, others sometimes have two. Just note which one comes back on. Try and close/eject the USB. Mine worked fine, close the USB.
If yours does not eject/close, then probably it was the other Explorer. Try again and Restat that one.  Good Luck.
If this is the case, open "Computer Management", then go to "Disk Management". For each partition on the device, right-click the partition, select "Change Drive Letters and Paths", and remove any drive letters assigned to that partition. Once you do so, you should find that the "safely eject" feature works as you had hoped.
Now you can see all files being accessed by the system and which processes are accessing them, ordered by the file path (which btw starts with a drive letter).
Here's a quick PowerShell command to query the event log and show which application is blocking drive ejection (works for me with Windows 10, probably works with 7/8 too)
The output will list all instances in the past hour where the system couldn't eject a disk drive. The Message column shows the process that blocked ejection. In my example below, task manager was actually the culprit and I was able to eject after closing task manager.
If you open "My Computer" and your drive is not listed under the "Removable Storage" headers, then Windows is viewing it as a fixed system resource for some reason. You will have to unmount any partitions on the drive.
