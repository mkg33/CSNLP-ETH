I have Acer Aspire One A521 with brand new SSD disk, on which I've just installed brand new Windows 7 HE 64. After installing system I installed all drivers, including Conexant audio driver. Starting from that moment, after each system restart I see Windows prompt asking me, if I really want to run application C:\Program Files\CONEXANT\cAudioFilterAgent\cAudioFilterAgent64.exe.
Since this is brand new Windows, just installed, its autorun locations are empty. The only entry I do have is ATI graphic card driver manager startup string in HKLM Run. I have checked that fact ten times (but only with above mentioned program and manually) and I'm 100% sure, that in none of known to me autorun locations there are no traces of Conexant program startup string.
Situation like that is quite normal to me, and I always use some "startup scanner" to find such software and purge system out of it. I have very, very old Startup Control Panel 2.8 by Mike Lin. It can have even ten years, but it has never disappointed me, so I continue using it. It scans Startup folders for current user and common one, HKLM Run, HKCU Run and Run Once sections of Windows Registry. For past ten years I thought that these are all locations where application, that is being autorun during system startup can coexist. Turns out, I was wrong.
What do I miss? Does Windows 7 introduces some new startup location or a new method of autorunning programs, that is beyond, what I know and what Startup Control Panel scans?
Solving this problem is a snap for me. I can use brute-force method of removing manually that file or renaming it or I can uninstall Conexant audio driver at all (for the very, very limited use of audio in my laptop, that I have, Windows driver will for sure be enough, I've installed Conexant one "just in case"). But I'm really, really curious, how Windows is possible to run this program each time I restart it? Where autorun string for it can exists?
