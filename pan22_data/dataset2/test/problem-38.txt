The simplest way would be is if the device in question was configured for DHCP snooping/IP source guard. This will create a binding table on the switch that should be easily queried. As an example:
If the switch is a L3 switch and the gateway for the attached devices, most of the information should be present in the MAC address table and the ARP table on the switch, but this will take some correlation of data on your part.
I just wanted to get the IP address of all the attached devices by running a simple command in switch console.
If you have none of the above, then you would need to take the MAC address table from the switch and correlate it with data from another source (ARP table on the gateway device, another station that does an arping sweep of the subnet, etc).
Of course, it will likely be better to configure some sort of management/monitoring solution before hand that can collect/correlate information for you and provide a history of connected devices. This information can be helpful in many different situations and will give you a common point to query such information.
If the switch is not the gateway for the attached devices, but still has L3 capabilities that are part of the same VLAN as the attached devices, then you may be able to use ping (or better yet arping if available) to learn the IP addresses in the ARP table. Again you would have to correlate data with the MAC address table.
