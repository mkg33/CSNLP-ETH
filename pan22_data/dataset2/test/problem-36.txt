Start it again in as admin.  While it is displayed, right-click on the taskbar button and then right-click again on the "Version Reporter Applet" option and select properties.
I'm using the CMD quite often and after Windows Updates I usually check with the Winver command what version I'm now on. Interestingly, I can't execute this command anymore when I start a new CMD instance with Win.Key + R because it tells me there is no such command. When I open up an admin CMD everything works fine. This issue also applies to the PowerShell. I've checked on some Windows 10 virtual machines and some other Windows 10 PCs to see if it has been a general change, but it seems the problem just affects my PC. 
Check your path for both scenarios.  Copy the winver.exe to a folder in the non-admin's path.  You might want to actually manually try to run the winver.exe from the non-admin command prompt first manually to make sure it's not a permissions issue instead, but I would think that you would have gotten a different message had that been the case.
From there you should be able to see where the winver.exe is located.  On my machine, it's in C:\Windows\System32 but it might be different for you.  It's likely that the non-admin level command prompt is not using the same path as the admin-level one.
