You might also try to keep the not needed LAN connection disabled (wlan0 or eth0). To do that simply remove the auto eth0 or auto wlan0from your configuration.
I think this issue was because other OS(like linux  & others) will set the subnet mask as 255.255.255.0 and send the packets whereas raspberry pi was sending it as 255.255.255.255 which would lead the modem to reject the packet for DHCP configuration. Check for the network by pinging to google or somewhere outside your LAN. This worked for me. Please answer if any solutions found.
Please check if Link led is glowing on your raspberry, if not, please try changing your network cable before attempting configuration changes. In my case it worked - hop it helps some people.
I have noticed that this problem happens when the wireless router does not use WPA but older protocols like WEP2. When I switched to WPA and setup the password in the router, all started working perfectly.
You might have hardware issues here as well. The one I experienced was about some weird interference between my wi-fi dongle and wireless keyboard/mouse. Basically, wi-fi didn't work until I replaced wireless keyboard with a wired one. Probably that's because of power consumption, but it's not very likely because I use powered USB hub. Maybe it's because of something else... Anyway, in your case I think it's worth to try to use other external devices.
I assume you are using as well two LAN interfaces which I did. I have a USB WLAN stick and the build in LAN one. My approach was to set it up correctly, then switch from the LAN to the WLAN connection (as my TV isn´t in the near from my router). During that I had exactly the same issue as you mentioned and I solved that as explained here with adding a lower priority metric (e.g. metric 100) to the 2nd interface. So based on that finding the following configurations is working for me. If that isn´t done it looks like the routing is confused and is trying to do the DHCP via the wrong network interface. So for me the following configuration was working:
I had the same problem, after spending a night with all changes to interfaces file etc, I found it is a network cable problem.
