Once you have that info, connect your router and enter the administrative software. This is done by entering the router's IP address (typically default is 192.168.0.1) in a browser. Once in there, you can setup the Internet connection manually. Below is a screen shot of that. Also, make sure you click to copy your PC's MAC address. This will allow the modem to think it is connected to your PC again.
My modem is an Arris TG862G and my provider is TimeWarner -> Brighthouse -> Spectrum. (Name changes over the years) RoadRunner. 
The solution for me was to ask my ISP to change the modem to "bridge mode". Otherwise, it was giving my router a LAN ip instead of the public or WAN ip. 
Many modems will not recognize the new MAC address when you change to the router.  Some will reset after some period of time, and others have to be reset manually.  The can be done by cycling the power.  There are modems in the U.S. that have a battery (for 911 service) which you can't power cycle.  Those have a reset button on the back for this purpose.
If that doesn't work then you are likely going to have to set it manually. Therefore, view your network connection on your PC while connected directly to the modem in order to get the primary and secondary DNS server IP addresses. Also, if the MTU is available make note of it. 
Resetting the modem, even a pinhole reset of both the modem and router, didn't solve the problem. MAC Cloning also failed.
