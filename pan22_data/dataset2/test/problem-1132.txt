2) Uptime requirements. Maybe you don't want one server. Maybe you want two behind a load balancer (or cluster of load balancers) (or maybe co-located?)
No point having the best server in the world if you have to courier it off to the manufacturer if you get a hardware failure.
Consider allocating some of your 10k budget to pay for advice from someone who has built a server before. 10k assumes a reasonably high-traffic site and there are a lot of things you can get wrong at that level.
In addition to Wayne's excellent point about backup make sure you include a decent service agreement in your budget.  Work out what engineer callout time you'll need - 4 hours, 24 hours etc - and how long you'll need it for.
Just buy a HP DL360/380 G6, it's what about 40% of people worldwide do. Of course I'm only being semi-serious here but it depends how much fun you have wringing your hands over detailed specs, I love it so can spend ages picking the right part, lots of people can't be bothered and that particular model/family is just a 'no-brainer' for lots of different uses. 
Don't bother to build a server from components.  You can get new or secondhand servers from the usual suspects (HP, Dell etc.) and from white box vendors building systems based on chassis from Supermicro, Intel or various other vendors.  Get an off-the-shelf one - buy secondhand from a reputable dealer if you want to save money.  Some hints and tips:
