Several places had instructed me to use this command for Fedora 16, rather than following the prior instructions (new command: su - postgres -c "PGDATA=/var/lib/pgsql/data initdb" ), but upon seeing 'su' at the front of that, I assumed it would switch me to root when I ran the command. It kept prompting me for a password, but nothing was working. 
in order to get the configuration files and all that in /var/lib/pgsql/9.2/data going. Hope that's helpful to someone else out there!
I tried the root passwd, my own (as if sudo'ing), "postgres" and "pgsql" in case I was somehow supposed to be doing this as the postgres user, even leaving the password blank. I tried su'ing to root, and then running the command without the initial 'su -' (starting with "postgres -c ..."), but that errored as well, telling me that:
Finally, I tried running the full command "su - postgres -c ..." as root, but still using the "su", and wow- it worked. Now the service starts. Thanks Redhat bug tracking!
I installed PostgreSQL 9.1.2 on my fedora 16 in a method similar to mentioned here, and tested it, which means that my installation is working fine.
This is answering a little late, but may be helpful for someone out there... On Fedora 18, with postgresql 9.2, I ended up having to add /usr/pgsql-9.2/bin to my PATH in my shell, and from there I had to run:
The initdb tool should be used only when you need to initialise the data directory of the database server, and this should have been done automatically when you install your postgresql server using a package manager like yum on centos or apt-get on ubuntu.
