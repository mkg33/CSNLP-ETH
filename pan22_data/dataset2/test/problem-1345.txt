The "crossover" is already built in to these cables. When working with cables like these you don't have a concept of a DTE side and DCE side as you do with ethernet cables. On a typical ethernet cable the DTE(terminal) side will have transmit on pins 1 and 2, with receive on pins 3 and 6. The DCE(switch) side or the other end of that cable will be flipped with transmit on 3 and 6 and receive on 1 and 2. These direct attach cables are built with the transmit of one side built already connected to the receive of the other.
For the record, the short answer (as has been pointed out several times) is: you do not need a crossover cable for SFP+ ports, because the SFP+ terminals sort the RX and TX part out for you.
If you have SFP+ GBICs connected with fibre or a direct attached copper cable (either active or passive)  that are/is compatible with your card, then it is possible to make the direct connection work. In my case, I have two Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme II BCM57810 10 Gigabit Ethernet devices talking happily over a passive directa attached copper SFP+ cable. No fiddlying in the BIOS was required.
There are two types of DAC cables, Active and Passive.  You might have the wrong cable for your SPF+ ports.
It may happen that in the initial setup everything gets connected, but no packet moves over the link between two 10Gb cards and you get Destination Host Unreachable errors, although all network configuration appears to be fine. (That happened to me and has also happened to other people). In my case it was possible to get over the problem by rebooting the servers once the direct attached copper cable connection was in place.
