If you do reset the router, you should save a backup file of it's configuration so that next time you need to reset it, you can simply load a known good configuration. 
The reason I suggest a reset rather than digging deeper into other potential causes is that I can't think of a highly likely number 2 possible cause, and there are many, many things that could cause this - some visible from the web gui, some that would require interacting with the router over ssh. It will almost certainly be quicker to reset and reconfigure it than to track down the issue AND fix it.
On a PC that can access the router's web portal, go to the VLAN configuration page and check that the configuration is similar to the image below (from my dd-wrt router; default VLAN configuration). If your router's IP address is 192.168.1.1 you can access this page here: http://192.168.1.1/Vlan.asp
Although it won't help you with this current issue,  if you are curious about things you can do with VLANs on dd-wrt, see this site.
You will lose all customized configuration settings on the dd-wrt router if you do this - do not do this if you aren't comfortable reconfiguring the router (i.e. someone else set it up for you initially).
Although there is a web gui method to reset the default settings, a hard reset is nearly always recommended over that method (I've heard various reasons - the gui reset doesn't work on all models, the code is buggy, etc.). Use this Hard Reset method instead; this is the pertinent excerpt:
The symptoms you describe make it sound like the bridge that 'connects' the switch (wired) ports and the wireless clients is mis-configured or disabled. 
In this image, the bridge is called 'LAN'. As you can see, the VLAN configuration assigns the physical (switch) ports to VLAN 1 and ties them to the bridge 'LAN'. It assigns the wifi port to VLAN 2, and also ties it to the bridge 'LAN'. 
If the VLAN configuration wasn't setup incorrectly, or changing it's settings did not address the issue, then the next best option is the nuclear one. I would reset the router to the dd-wrt firmware's default values.
