Please note: This disables emojis on the touchscreen keyboard system wide. Not just for a particular program.
Open the dll file in Resource Hacker and navigate to the html section. Here you'll find a long list of keyboard layouts. Scroll down until you see the grouping of layouts that start with "EMOJI". Right click on each and choose "Delete Resource"
Before editing the file you will likely have to change the permissions on the file to allow you to make changes. Take ownership and give yourself full control. 
The virtual keyboard is being shown on a program I'm working on. I don't want any users to type in an emoji. Is it possible to remove the emoji button in the virtual keyboard?
If you get a warning that the file is in use preventing you from saving the changes be sure that the touchscreen keyboard is not currently running. You can stop the TabletInputService service to kill any instance of the touchscreen keyboard or kill any tabtip.exe processes in Task Manager. 
Overwrite the original file with your changes and that's it! The emoji button will no longer do anything when clicked.
You will need to edit this dll and remove references to emoji's. With all references removed the emoji button on the keyboard simply does nothing at all.
