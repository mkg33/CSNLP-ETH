I tried the above solution, it doesn't work for me... but just by following the below link it worked straight away.
When my /home/... partition became full, .viminfo was unable to be written, so those file positions were never stored. Once I cleared up some space, viminfo was positioning my editor again.
I'm using vim 7.2.330 on 64 bit ubuntu 10.04, sometime in the last week every time I reopen a file it places the cursor at the top of the file.  I can see in ~/.viminfo where it's saving the last position used, but it doesn't seem to be honoring it.
The vim-lastplace plugin does exactly what you want (I am the author). It improves on the above accepted answer / code snippet by handling commit messages intelligently. If you have debian-testing you can apt-get install vim-lastplace to quickly try it out.
You might want to check the permission and ownership on your ~/.viminfo file.  If you had earlier accessed vim via a "sudo -s" or something it's possible that vim cannot write to this file.  You might have to chown it back to your group and id.
