It seems wrong to people as they mentally link the table name to the contents (multiple rows needs a plural name) rather than mentally linking the named container to the contents (a container allows for multiple).
If you are doing the project solely and there's no real reason to go either way do whatever you feel is best, or just preference. Apply the same when in a dev team and just come to a unanimous decision.  
After working with programming for some years I have concluded that pluralization is a needless complication. My opinion is that according to the KISS philosophy a programmer should strive for the laziest and easiest solution to all problems for time and efficiency reasons. Thus singular gives you less work needed in all scenarios.
I think this is also because of years of plural being common practice and in most online teaching material.  
The person who does not make the correlation between table name and that fact it represents a container. Of course they know it is a container, but it's not there in the name.  
Those seem like common words that might go in line-of-business database. Plural words seem to be less common as key words than singular words. Therefore, it might be beneficial to use plural table names so as to avoid conflict with SQL key words. 
As always though there's often not a right and wrong, and it's more about what suits the scenario, and importantly being consistent with whatever you choose.
The person who makes a correlation between the table name and the fact it represents a container, which can contain multiple rows. 
An "egg carton" can have multiple eggs in it but that's obvious as the container reference is in the name, providing potential for multiple eggs. 
All this said, I think that technically speaking the singular is more accurate given that we're naming a single container, and containers can contain multiple (or single) rows.
However with the singular table name "user" the container reference is not there in the name. eg "user_container" would likely be acceptable for people who prefer plural names.
