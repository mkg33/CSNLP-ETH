I use DISM to capture images and store them on a network disk. I use a standard 32bit WinPE 4.0 environment to capture them.
I have a similar problem where the image fails around 60%.  Like you, I have nearly a terrabyte free and there are no quota management features enabled on the servers.  I'm using Windows PE4 32bit booted off a flash drive and the latest version of DISM.
The added complication is that I'm capturing to a DFS enabled share. Usually re-capturing the image succeeds so I'm not sure if my secondary fix of using a non-namespace share name the second capture works because I got lucky or if there is an issue with the namespace.  I wish I had a better answer for you but you might have to capture it to flash drive and manually copy later.
It ran up to 100% and which point it failed with the error There is not enough space on the disk.. During capture I monitored the network drive and I could see the image growing. When the error message occurred the image was deleted.
Depending on the boot device (USB or CD/ROM) the capture process makes a decision of where to write its scratch files.  Since a USB is writable, it tries to write massive scratch files to it.  Try using the /scratchdir option and direct scratch files to media with plenty of room.
