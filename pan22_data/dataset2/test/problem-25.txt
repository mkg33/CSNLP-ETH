It let me move my desktop from a hard drive that was having SMART errors without any trouble, so it should work for you too.
I would look into using a disk cloning solution that can expand the volumes during the clone.  That way, your existing configuration is unchanged and the process will take much less time that a fresh install of Exchange and a migration of the data and settings.
Another option, if there is room in the server, is simpliy to ADD, not replace the existing HDD.  Add the new disk (or disks, if you can add RAID when you didn't before) and format the drive, then simply use the tools available to move the Exchange data store.  This link has detailed instructions on how to do so: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc708031(v=ws.10).aspx
There are plenty of both paid-for and free options available alhtough not all will support growing the volumes during the clone.  The Ultimate boot CD contains a number of options as a starting point and can be downloaded from http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/
Ignoring for one minute the issue of running Exchange on desktop-class rather than enterprise class hardware...
