  That brings us to the question of balance. Should Norton be WARNING you for the levels/durations it's seeing?  Or on the other hand, does Norton's tolerances need to be set so that you occasionally see Norton's presence?  After all when it's time to pay for Norton again you will feel much better if Norton's telling you something from time to time.  You know it's there, you know it's working. That renewal fee seems so much more worthwhile than it would if Norton never told you anything. They could make it do it's job, mostly silently, but when renewal time rolled around, you might say "wait what has Norton really done for me?"
So to answer your specific question in the comment attached to the original question, If you see THE WARNING once a day or once a week then just ignore it (and get that happy feeling Norton wants you to have because you know it's there working for you).  On the other hand, if your getting it multiple time an hour and your PC is sluggish, now you have a place to start.
It's possible that a service can use more memory than normal, thus Norton's warning.  Norton typically doesn't notify the user as soon as there is high usage, but rather when it seems too much of the total is being consumed over a period of time.  THe state at which your computer becomes sluggish.
