Since your users are pointing to 192.168.1.200.7654, they are obiviously on your internal lan, and as such, you can install and configure a DNS zone on your internal network that applies a name to your site, so that they could use http://xyz200.com:7654 to access the application. This dns zone would only be accessible within your lan however, and no one on the outside will ever know it exists or recognize the name.
If I am understanding what you are saying about the facebook integration however, in the situation above, you could not tell FB that you are on xyz200.com, since as far as the public world is concerned that domain does not exist, or belongs to someone else. to FB, they couldn't really care less what your dns Name is, as long as they can query a public dns server to get its IP address, and as you describe it, that is not possible yet.
in order to have a dns name that you could give FB, you need to register it with a registrar like tucows, godaddy, etc, and set your server up to be accessed from the internet.
