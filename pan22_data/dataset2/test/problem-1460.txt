If you really want to test, then use badblocks write test. It will write data patterns to disk then read them to check.  During this it will stress your disk a bit. In my opinion, if it runs succesfully you can trust the disk.
I usually just do a full RAID init and where applicable, begin to populate the file system during this, all the time knowing that there might be a problem due to dead drives . This way, I don't waste any time for some kind of tests that are quite unreliable anyway and I would catch the real weak drives immediately. After that, there might be still some elevated chance for drive failures due to "infant mortality", but there is no practical way to eliminate this. 
Test will run as user 'nobody' and will create/rewrite/delete 100*1024 files, from 200 to 150000 bytes per file, within 100 autocreated directories below /home/tmp. And number of tests = 300.
In practice, none of the last few hundred disks I used in a RAID had any issues during the first year of operation. 
You could use the manufacturers test suite, or something like SpinRite to sweep the whole disk. It would also be a good idea to look at the SMART values, looking for bad sectors and other old-age/failure signs. 
I work for a company that does this sort of testing day in and day out. And Yes, we test every single hard drive we buy. Our process starts with running the drives through a free DOS based program called HDAT2. Its free to download. It can access SMART and some other features of the drive that are inaccessible from a Windows environment. Depending on the results there we will run them through one of several different lines of specialized hardware, but at the core they mostly just run SMART short self test, Long Test, a secure erase and an All Read to verify the sectors. My suggestion is would be to run a secure erase of the full disk, then run an all read, then a SMART short self-test. This order is important as a short self-test may not find anything if run at the beginning of your testing but after a full write and read of the disc it may pick up something. Hope this helps.
