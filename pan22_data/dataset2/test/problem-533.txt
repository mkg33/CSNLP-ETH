Is there a way to get the in-line microphone and remote controller on headphones to work on Windows?
I've got Koss iSpark designed to work with iPhone, but also other smartphones. It has in-line microphone and also push-to-talk button with ability to accept/decline calls and pause/play/next/previous song. Since I use it on my laptop a lot I was wondering if it can be used as a microphone (e.g. for Skype calls) and as a media controller (common practice for keyboards).
If the connector is 3 stripe (TRRS) and is compatible, the TRRS signalling methods (for volume control, pause / play, etc) depend on the vendor and there literally is no standard for that, as of 2017 anyway.
I assume some kind of driver would probably be required, at least for the media control part. Yet I haven't found anything useful so far and despite this question being asked before in several situations there was no conclusive answer.
The jacks on computers (PCs anyway, not Macs!) are typically 3 conductor TRS so they will only work for
