I would suggest you use a framework, even a simple one, to distribute the effort of maintenance to the community so you could focus on what's important in your app. 
For suggestions, I recommend starting with jQuery for the JS since it's the most common. For PHP, your choice, but I do recommend CodeIgniter since it's light weight. For templating, you could use Mustache to avoid mixing logic to your templates.
Just so you know, jQuery offers custom builds. You can build jQuery only to contain essentials, like AJAX and only some utility functions for as low as 10KB in size. Your JS could have been just the following if you used jQuery:
Sometimes, it's good to code from scratch. However, in your case, it seems like you'd be maintaining this code for a while. Scratch coding isn't that fun in the long run because you will run into bugs, cross-browser issues, and security. 
I couldn't provide PHP, SQL or templating suggestions since it's been a while since I have used them (I'm doing full JS at the moment). I'll leave it to the others to review your PHP and SQL.
