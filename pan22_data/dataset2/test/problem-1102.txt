Like the answer from Daniel Back already said, it's an problem with the suggest feature. You can fix this with going to:
Given the URL you posted, it might be related to the Instant Search feature of Chrome. It doesn't work for me and, according to some web searches about it, others.
Running Chrome 16.0.912.75 m on Windows 7 Pro SP1. I hadn't installed any new extensions for several weeks before this started happening. As far as I can tell, nothing has changed.
A few days ago, Google Chrome started acting up. Whenever I ctrl+T for a new tab, enter some search terms and hit Enter, I'm taken to a blank Google homepage with this URL: https://www.google.com/webhp?rlz=1C1CHKZ_enUS440US440&sourceid=chrome-instant&ix=hea&ie=UTF-8&ion=1. 
This happens with one-word and multi-word search terms, and with any of the operators I use regularly. It also happens when I try to search in the url/search bar of an existing tab. 
I created a "new" custom search engine using the below url. It allowed me to maintain the predictive search, but made the omnibox search work again (this issue is back as of yesterday, 06/16/14, for me).
In case you have a corrupted preferences file (you could test this with a pristine Chrome profile by specifying the --user-data-dir command line parameter), this should cause Chrome to overwrite it.
This was happening to me and for some reason disabling "User-Agent Switcher for Chrome" resolved the issue.
