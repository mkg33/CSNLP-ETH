So, has anyone seen any way to create an bootable iso from a custom Windows 10 setup? I've been searching for two days, and have not found anything that fits all the criteria I need.
Move the newly created WIM file to your C:\mount directory, you may need it later. Once the WIM file is in the C:\mount, copy the file once more to the Windows 10 Install USB drive's \sources directory, over writing the original file in there. 
Anyhow, be careful of some tools that offers easy one-click customization or use loads of crazy batch files. I guess that is why I built my own tool. It leans towards more advanced IT professionals, but it might be useful for your situation.
Having just finished a project writing a Windows customization tool stack for the enterprise, I would like to contribute some points:
In my experience, going to audit mode and sysprep again from a live system doesn't work exactly as it should, so I tend to avoid it altogether. This is significant in Windows 10 (1709), where unattend.xml stops honoring  flag.
You will need 2 PCs for this -- a test PC and a tech PC (the tech PC will be your PC). You are also going to need 3 USB drives for this: 
Hope this helps, it took me months to get to be able to explain this so simply and to perform these actions myself. Anything I can do to help people is exactly what I wanted for myself months ago -- an easy walk through...too bad I didn't find one...lol  
NOTE: You will also need the Windows 10 v1803 ADK -- install everything, it takes just under 9 GBs for the total install. 
I know there are some programs out there that will create an iso based on some of the program's configurations, but this is a fairly in depth image my superior is wanting(He is wanting a bare bones minimal image, with specific user accounts already set up, ect). I haven't seen any program that will customize the image the way I need it(we want everything gone, even calculator and other stock programs which are difficult to remove). To add to this, my superior is against anything third party, so that need to be a last resort option. 
I have been tasked to create some images for Windows 10 pro, for virtual machines and also native installs. The VM image is simple, but I am having trouble on how to extract an iso image from the Windows 10 configuration I have created. Moreover, this needs to be an image that we can use for a bare-metal install, so the default Windows system image tools won't cut it(it creates a .vdhx file, we need it to be able to boot straight from BIOS). 
At the X:\ terminal after the image is captured, type WPEUTIL SHUTDOWN and the PC will shutdown. Remove the two USB drives, putting the WinPE one to the side and taking the 64 GB over to your tech PC, along with your Windows 10 Install USB -- Plug them both in, and take a look at how big the newly captured WIM file is (mine are normally between 10 and 15 GBs, depending on how many programs and updates I have installed, as well as how many drivers I have set aside for later). 
It can get kind of complicated, especially when it comes to editing the files in the mounted directory. When in doubt, Microsoft docs on hardware OEM is your best friend.
Once the new WIM file is copied to the Win 10 Install USB, you can use that USB to install a custom Windows image to any PC you want. 
The only option that I have thought of is use a program to create an image close to what I want, which the computer name/users/ect. already set up, then I may be able to create a script that will do most of the rest, but this needs to be as automated as possible.
