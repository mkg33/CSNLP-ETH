Try typing 'net use' at the command prompt and see if any credentials for that server have been cached and delete accordingly.
Can you verify if you have Antivirus running on either of the machines? Also, check the Application Event Viewer when you get this error. You might get some clue there :)
My guess is that it has something to do with incompatible security settings in local or group policy. Look through the options in the Group Policy Editor on the Windows 7 box and see what you can find. It's most likely somewhere under: Computer Configuration --> Windows Settings --> Security Settings --> Local Policies --> User Rights Assignment or Security Options.
This seems strange to me, since there is no 'account' to be disabled: I wasn't even presented with a login dialog.  (The account that I would have used isn't disabled...)
then when you try to access the network share it will prompt for a username and password. use the correct one to access the share at this point.
This is caused by there not being a password on your account on the pc you are trying to connect From
The client (the one with the error message) is running Windows XP SP3.  The server is running Windows 7; its firewall is set to allow file sharing from any computer in our /16 CIDR (the client, naturally, is in this large block).
