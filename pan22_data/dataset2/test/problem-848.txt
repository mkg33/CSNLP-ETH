You might want to completely wipe and test the disk with special tools from the brand of the hard disk, that will ensure that you will see the right information. If that doesn't help, the hard drive either has a wrong sticker or is providing the wrong information.
Additionally, you can try Extend Volume option in Disk Management (Vista and above) or something like Partition Magic.
In the Acronis software, you will have to play with the partition sizes. You must boot from the Acronis CD and before you lay down the image, you should be able  to use up all 320GB ( I forget which step this is). I ran into this problem a few months back. Acronis isn't smart enough to realize that it is placing the image on a larger harddrive, you have to tell it. 
You might find that a tool like the gparted live cd will let you resize your partition to fill the disk.  Alternatively your imaging software might have an option for resizing the partition during the restore. 
I would assume that this is because partition table was copied from old drive also. There should be option during restore which will allow disk to expand. Since I do not have Acronis near me, I cannot say exact name of that option.
It's not clear from this whether you have checked in the disk manager whether you actually have a 60gb partition on a 320gb drive or whether Windows sees it as 60gb.  Since the new size matches the old I strongly suspect that's what happened.  You need to resize the partition to use all the space.  I think Acronis can do this.  Note that XP at least can't do it by itself.
Other than that there's the possibility of the BIOS not recognizing the drive properly--if that's the issue, flash it.  It's also possible you are dealing with an old controller.  There's no fix other than replacing the controller in this case (when drives started breaking this wall you found a lot of retail drives packed with a controller card) but my impression is that this would give you 137gb, not 60gb.  I've only hit it once and that's what it did--the 160gb drive reported as 137gb.
