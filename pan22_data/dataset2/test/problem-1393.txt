I keep my source control database on a USB key so I can transfer it between multiple machines, and always assign it to B because I know that drive letter will be available on every machine. Finding this trick simplified my life greatly.
Because back in the day of floppy disks, there were either two physical floppy drives (A: and B:), or just one physical floppy drive (A:) with one emulated (B:) so you could copy from disk to disk by exchanging disks every few hundred KB.
You can map a drive as B: if you want. Under computer management, go to storage/disk management.  Right click the drive you want and choose "change drive letter/paths" You should be able to select B: as an option. 
Here is how to do that: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/appvbeta/thread/d9d46885-d136-4ace-9cd9-3b881322b86a
I've seen Softgrid (now called Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) version 4.5) installs which use the B drive as it's hidden drive... It uses the drive to store the applications to run.
I use the B drive for mapping network drives when I've run out of other letters (surprisingly easy to do with USB hubs and such).
The A and B slots are very useful when you want to give a particular removable device the same drive letter each time it's inserted.   Windows will never assign A or B to a device, but if you assign A or B to a device using Disk Manager, that drive letter will be assigned on future inserts.
