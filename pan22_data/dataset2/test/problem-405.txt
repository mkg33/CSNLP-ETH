eTerm when on linux  (Terminal.app when on mac osx, rxvt when on windows w/ cygwin and finally putty when all else fails)
I am a big fan of teraterm utf-8.  I do a lot of serial console work.  It does a very good job at serial stuff as well as ssh, telnet, and the ilk.
It's the only terminal emulator I've found that has good support for "regions" in addition to "tabs" ('regions' being a split window, like screen does, but terminator supports vertical partitions). Default controls bind Ctrl+Shift+(O|E) to split the current region into 2 (vertical|horizontal) regions that are simultaneously displayed.
I used to be a 100% aterm guy, but gnome-terminal cleaned up sufficiently around 3 years ago, at which point I stopped bothering to install aterm. 
iTerm on the Mac is great.  It is tabbed and has a great feature - send input to all tabs.  Makes working on multiple identical servers a breeze. 
I have two screens, and I love to fullscreen Terminator to take up both screens. I tend to keep ~4-5 copies each of tail -f and top running on different servers in different regions while I do my shell work in yet another region. It's insanely helpful to be able to see them all on the screen at the same time.
