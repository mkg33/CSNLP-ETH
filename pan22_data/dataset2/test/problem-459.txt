I personally use Total Commander to do copying like you have to do. It offers mode bypassing windows mechanism and other functions I find highly useful.
Are both external drives the same? Maybe new one is formatted as some uncommon FAT32 variant? If you have somewhere long path (as Techpumpkin_WD suggests) there may be an issue.
I am trying to move all my music (~700GB) from one external hard drive to another one. While in the past, I used to do that with just dragging and dropping the files, now it does nothing at all. Not even displaying a message for the reason it's not doing it.
Windows usually first calculates data amount, then commits to copy. This can take long time as well.
I've seen a few solutions using command prompt to copy the files or using other software, but I want to do this using only Windows explorer, as I used to do in the past.
Note that this happens on both my Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate PC and my Windows 8.1 64-bit Enterprise PC.
It's possible that the file name is too long and Windows can't deal with it, sometimes it doesn't display error messages if that's the issue. In OS's perspective the file name includes the whole path of the file location. A file named 1.jpg is actually seen as C:\Users\MyUser\Documents\1.jpg. Are you trying to copy the files to a sub folder or to the root directory of the destination drive?  Try copying to the root directory or shorten the file name. 
Windows Copy uses (or at least used to use) System Swap File for operations like that. So copying large amount of data may be SLOOOOOOW... Especially when you do something else besides this
