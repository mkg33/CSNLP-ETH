I don't know much about my computer's specs, as Win7 is pretty new to me and I'm not entirely sure where I can go to look up hardware details, but system properties give me the below info:
I work in a small office, and several of our computers have recently updated to Windows 7 Home Premium (formerly Windows Vista -- not sure exactly which version).
Another interesting quirk is that physically disconnecting the ethernet cable from the box, waiting a few seconds, then reconnecting it will instantly fix the problem -- but again only sometimes.  This morning I had to disconnect and reconnect it 3 times before it found the network.
My first thought was that there was something wrong with the physical cable, but since this symptom has appeared on multiple machines in our office (at least 2), and so soon after an OS upgrade, I just have to believe they're connected somehow.
Ever since the upgrade, network connection has been flakey after boot up.  Sometimes it will say I'm not connected to any network.
