The Dynamic DNS is pointing to your external Comcast IP which your internal machine cannot access. If you can assign values your routers DNS server make the Dynamic DNS domain name point to your servers internal IP address.
Furthermore, all of the DHCP names of the internal machines (including printers and such) are served up by DNS properly so they resolve.
Internal DNS points to your server's local IP address (local (192.x.x.x or 172.x.x.x or 10.x.x.x), but not loopback (127.0.0.1)):
Set up a DNS server for LAN access only and hand it's address out via DHCP. That DNS server acts as an authoritative server for your domain but issues LAN address rather than the public address.
Example: I have a Linksys WRT54GL (got new for about $50) running the Tomato firmware (free). It handles the Dynamic DNS such that my domain resolves to a 192. internal address from within, for all machines on the network.
A good solution is to use a router which handles Dynamic DNS, and integrates it with its DNS caching service.
