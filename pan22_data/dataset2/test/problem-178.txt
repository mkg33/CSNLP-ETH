Yesterday, I disabled the Save AutoRecover feature in Microsoft Word and regained the ability to click and drag. I shutdown my computer last night. 
This morning less than 2 hours after booting up, I lost the ability to click and drag while working in Word. Funny....I did however have Microsoft Excel running with two worksheets; and, Save AutoRecover was enabled.  
I've been experiencing this problem off and on for a year now, since March 2014. Most online forums provide as work arounds instead of addressing the actual issue. Although there was one post that led me to pay attention to the save function.
Through observation, I have been able to determine that the source of the problem lies with Windows 7 and Microsoft Office's implementation of Autosave.  More directly, anytime a Microsoft Office product is performing a save function, the ability to left click and drag is lost. 
At my case, I have removed the top cover of my Microsoft mouse using my nails. Cleaned all dust with a cotton swab especially at edges and every thing back to normal 
The buttons on a typical mouse are small mechanical switches, and like all mechanical devices, they do go bad.  Even if the switch contacts are just dirty, it's unlikely that you would be able to clean them, because they are usually sealed units.  I think you will have to replace the mouse.  To find out for sure, try another mouse as a test.
This is not always a mouse problem... I have this problem on MANY of my Windows 7 machines. It is an intermittent problem and is most definitely some issue with Windows as I can change to a new mouse 5 times and the same behavior; only restarting the entire machine temporarily fixes it.
On my version of Windows (Vista 64) I can click and drag on the desktop, drawing a selection rectangle as I go.  This works using both the left and the right mouse buttons.  Anyway, this would allow you to test the mechanical problem idea mentioned by boot13.  It's a fair bet that one button has an intermittent failure, but much less likely that both left and right buttons have a very similar failure.  If neither allow you to drag properly, the problem is elsewhere.
