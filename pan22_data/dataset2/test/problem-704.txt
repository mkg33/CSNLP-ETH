My ideal solution would be to use something like TrueCrypt on the whole drive; then, without the password, the disk is useless anyway; there's no need to securely delete files as unless you have the password all that could be recovered from the disk would be garbage.
Securely deleting from a memory card is often much more difficult than from a hard drive. Because solid state memory cards fail a lot earlier than a hard drive if you write data over a single bit repeatedly, many of them dynamically move data around in a manner transparent to the computer. Thus, when the computer thinks it's writing over the same part of the disk, it's actually writing to a different part to avoid excessive load on the same disk.
As memory cards are a form of magnetic media, I would imagine that the same rules that pertain to hard disks would also apply here.
If you need to make sure a drive is unrecoverable, you should use a tool like the HDDguru Wipe tool for Windows, or if your using a *nix/BSD operating system your can just use dd if=/dev/urandom of=[your drive here]
You can recover from most formats as when you delete, you dont actually remove the information, you remove the inodes used to locate the information. Using a piece of software like PhotoRec you can recover data even if the inodes are deleted.
