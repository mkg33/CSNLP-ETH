"On this site, there is a problem with IIS. The SMB service has insecure permissions for Everyone:  IIS Admin Service (IISADMIN) : DC, WD, WO http://oursite.com"
I've looked at the services, there is an "IIS Admin" service and I've checked the permissions on the executable (C:\windows\system32\inetsrv\inetinfo.exe) but it doesn't list anything abnormal:
Using the "sc sdshow iisadmin" command I was able to see that "Everyone" had "Access" in the "Discretionary" permissions:
I did a lot of research, and had to document it.  I wrote about it here: http://bit.ly/18dYVYi for anyone interested.
I restarted the service, and checked all the websites, everything seems to be running smooth.  I'll have to wait for another scan to know for sure, since the scanning company didn't give any more details then what I reported in the question.  Either way, it seemed a good idea to remove the "Everyone" entry from discretionary. 
I've been looking at the services, and reading up on Windows SMB (Server Message Block) but still am not able to really detect what the problem is here.  Does anybody have more understanding of SMB service or windows permissions, and can turn me in the right direction?
