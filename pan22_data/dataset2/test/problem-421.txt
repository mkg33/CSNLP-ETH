I've been using LogMeIn. I've only used it between Windows machines, but it seems to work quite well. They have a Mac version available.
Another great cross-platform product (with free and other paid versions, though for Mac only the free version exists) is LogMeIn. They also have an iPhone client, which is great for traveling without a laptop.
I use RDP to get from Mac to PC frequently (I use a Mac myself and my company server is Win2k3), and as others have said, VNC works fine. There is a Mac VNC product called Chicken Of The VNC which you might find faster/leaner than the built-in one.
My main use for this is doing remote tech support for my extended family. I'm on a mac and most of them are on Windows. I've tried Mac to Mac using Adobe's product and iChat and iChat is much faster.
Just plain VNC will work between pretty much any platform, so long as you have a client and server. Mac OS X has built-in VNC capabilities accessible through the Sharing preferences, and a built-in VNC client located at /System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app. For Windows, UltraVNC is a fairly good server/client program. As JP mentioned, you can also use RDP when controlling a Windows computer, and there's an official Mac RDP client available.
I've used Timbuktu for Mac-Mac and Mac-PC, and it's very fast. It doesn't feel like an OS X application though (it looks very 'classic') and it's not really cheap. It does a lot more than just screen sharing mind you!
Personally, I like doing it with RDP if I'm going Mac to Windows.  But, also gotomypc is (surprisingly) very good too.
Now that Skype 2.8 is out of beta with screen sharing, I'm interested to hear what people have tried and/or prefer for screen sharing between Windows and Mac OS X.
