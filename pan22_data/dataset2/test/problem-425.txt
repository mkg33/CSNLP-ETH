From the development PC there are simple facilities provided, you easily use the Target Manager SDK to achieve this (you'll need to read the full description to see what else you need to set up as specifics are NDA'd).
From within the game, the simplest way is to insert something after the frame has been rendered to first flush the GPU (to ensure that everything has finished being rendered before you continue). The game should have a pointer to the current frame buffer somewhere, you'll know the format of that buffer (the stride, etc), you can then do what you want, including writing it out in a format of your own choice with a little work.
Do you want to capture the screenshot from within the game for some purpose, or from a development PC?
The PS3 runs a variant of OpenGL ES (which is the same thing most mobile devices are using), though I don't know of anyone that actually uses OpenGL directly. http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=1861 shows how to create a screenshot an an iPhone, I wouldn't expect it to be very different.
