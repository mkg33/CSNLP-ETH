Install the printer manually through Devices and Printers to the network. Select the option to "Add a printer using a TCP/Ip address or hostname. In the next window, make sure to change the the Device Type option to TCP/IP Device and NOT the Auto Detect option (which is generally the default). Enter the IP address of the printer and click Next. Finish the install as normal from this point. This should resolve this issue.
I'd like a way to disable this service (and only this service) at the print server, because any of the other options involve a lot more work than I'd like (2, 3) or have undesirable side-effects (1).  Does anyone know of a way to do this?
1 - Go to the Printer Web Interface and disable all WS relative stuff from the network settings (WS Discovery, WS Scan, WS Print). This will cause the printer to never advertise again through WSD
That disables WSD print service from starting and removes the location of WSDPrint.Inf if something wants to force it to start.
The service you want is the "Function Discovery Provider Host" (also called fdPHost). This will disable the WS-Discovery protocol. This has a side effect of disabling SSDP support as well, however.
On Windows 2008 R2 server, I can prevent this behavior by stopping and disabling the PnP-X IP Bus Enumerator service, however, that service doesn't seem to be present in Server 2012.
While WSD printers are shown in Add Printer window, and it seems you can add them, WSD ports are never created, and the WSD driver for printer is not installed. All criteria satisfied. Verified in Windows Server 2012 R2.
I am looking for a way to disable WSD on Server 2012 and Server 2012 R2.  Basically, a number of our printers on a number of our print server have decided that using this bloody service is better than using the TCP/IP ports they were assigned, and they are changing themselves over to WSD ports which results in users being unable to print to these printers.
1 Drawback: You should rename the 3 files back to their original names before doing any Windows Updates related to printing or WSD. And then change them back to .bak after patch installed successfully.
