Could one use list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes to show Andreev's POLY function is in P, similar to the way Sivakumar did in his membership comparable paper? Or is the POLY function known to be NP-complete?
They also point out Blum's pedigree as having proved a lower bound on Boolean circuit complexity that stood for more than 30 years. This of course is just "side information" since experts are already seriously studying the proof.
On Trevisan's blog there is a comment by Lovett suggesting what that hidden assumption might be in theorem 6.
It is unlikely to be correct for the following reason: the method of approximations is general enough that any lower bound can be  proven using them. This is a result due to Razborov. Why is it a problem? Because it means that method of approximations will not be the main progress, it can express anything, the meat will be somewhere else. There does not seem to be such meat in the paper, which suggests that most likely the author is making a subtle mistake, the kind of mistake that is hidden from the eye but essentially is an assumption that implies the answer. For those who are not complexity theorists: this is a very good smell test, it is as likely to be true as someone's claim to build a rocket at his basement to travel to moon in a week. 
Lipton and Regan's blog here has a nice high level discussion with an interesting comment on the proof structure.
