The "stop sync and remove all synced data" trick worked for me.  Unfortunately the steps have changed slightly and it is now "Disconnect Google Account" > choose YES to remove all data.  I shut down Chrome (and the 8(!!!!) instances still running in Task Manager, then just re-launch Chrome and re-sync and it's fine.
In IE changing the search provider allows specifying a prediction (suggestion) provider, In chrome, once you change the default search engine, you'll never be able to have predictions again!!
I posted a bug report a while ago but it seems no one looks at it. I'm about to give up on Chrome and go back to IE, the only good thing about Chrome is the Extension market and the AdBlocker (which I can find in IE as well). The perfrormance changes don't matter to me too much.
I recently changed the default search engine to a custom google search URL (using baseUrl) with some additional parameters and removed all the rest of the search engines, and since then, the search predictions stopped working.
