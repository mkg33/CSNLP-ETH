How to setup a physical machine that spins a virtual machine on boot, and this guest OS is automatically connected to all the hardware (monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc) and behaves like it was a host in terms of performance and hardware integration?
Out of curiosity, why do you want a VM? What it sounds like you want is something installed directly to the machine.
Virtualization is probably not the solution you are looking for - or at least not the single solution. For what you describe I would recommend Ghost, Acronis and the other variants. Virtualization may still fit the bill for other needs you have.
If you want a machine that "resets" each time it reboots (ie, you can't make permanent changes to it, can't get a virus, etc), you might want to look at something like a Linux-based LiveCD.
If you could explain what it is you're trying to accomplish, the community will be better able to direct you.
I do not think you are going to be able to accomplish what you want. What OS's are you running as "guests"?
