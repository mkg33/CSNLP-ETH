Do you happen have avahi-daemon running? I once had a similar problem as you on my RPI running as a nginx server that /etc/resolv.conf will mystically became empty after a couple of days but still be able to access via ssh and ping with IP address. I delete avahi-daemon and the problem go away since then. I still don't know what exactly caused it, but I think it is caused by conflicts from another DNS resolve service.  
Firstly there is no point in configuring /etc/dhcpcd.conf because you have disabled dhcpcd by calling dhcp (as you would see from the boot log).
The solution was to add the line dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 below the eth0 interface definition (iface eth0 inet dhcp) to the /etc/network/interfaces file and reboot the pi. After the reboot, the nameserver gets copied to /etc/resolv.conf and I am able to ping to websites successfully.
The problem was, as said by bobstro, that the /etc/resolv.conf file was empty, but the file is regenerated automatically every few seconds.
Secondly there is no point in editing /etc/resolv.conf, because it changed by resolvconf which is called so many processes (including dhcpd). There ARE ways of setting it (which you can research), but this is generally a bad idea.
Your /etc/resolv.conf is empty, which is consistent with you being able to ping by IP address, but not by DNS name. How are you getting your IP address on your RPi? If via DHCP, your DHCP server should be configured to provide DNS information. If you've manually configured a fixed IP address, you need to list a DNS server (e.g. nameserver 8.8.8.8) to your /etc/resolv.conf file, or via GUI.
