I'd like to also collect the average CPU usage, Memory, and Disk (i/o) utilization after the process has completed using time (or another command if necessary). 
There's also sar which reads system stats automatically taken every 10 minutes, or however long sard is configured for.
You can watch CPU stats, memory usage (RSS & Virtual), faults, anything top would normally give you.
So there is the time command which will show you the time it took for a specific process/command to run after the command has completed.
That's kind of what the getrusage calls are meant for, though most of the fields are unused on Linux (at least that was the case the last time I had to care.  
I'm not quite sure if this'll work exactly the way you want to, but vmstat <delay> will print out stats every  seconds.
Mainly I am using this to benchmark MySQL import performance using different innodb_buffer_pool_size settings.
I usually just use top -p myself, as it limits top to the process I care about.  You can then toggle additional fields in the usual fashion.  For example, top -p 1 would only show the init process.  You can then watch the performance of MySQL as you do your import.
