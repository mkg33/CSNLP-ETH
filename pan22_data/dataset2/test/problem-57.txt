This would be possible using real nameserver software like bind. But if you have no experience on this you should probably start reading ahead at bind9.net since this would be to broad to answer.
To set this up install the dnsmasq package of your distribution. Since Debian based systems are common these days I'll assume this distro.
There are only two caching recursive DNS servers that I can strongly recommend (avaiable both for Windows and UNIX variants)
BIND is generally considered to be the reference implementation of DNS, although I'd note that because it's a full general purpose DNS server it has lots of knobs and settings that a recursive-only server doesn't need.
You kinda need a server OS to do that (as of what I know). I would install Windows Server (preferred 2003+) and install the DNS role. It has a nice little wizard that will help you set up your own DNS server.
The particular reason I recommend these two is DNSSEC - they both have full DNSSEC validation built-in.  You won't get that with dnsmasq or tinydns.
Now edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf and set the listen-address directive to the IP address of the network interface connected to your network. 
Not sure why you would want a local DNS server, it wont speed up DNS lookups necessarily. Keep in mind the DNS server has to run multiple queries before resolving to the IP. At a DSL or even cable, they will be slower than a DNS server at a datacenter with big pipes....
