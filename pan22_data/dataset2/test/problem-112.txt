The subnet rules are simple for v4 addresses. A v4 address has 32 bits. A subnet netmask tells you how many of those bits are fixed and not available within the subnet. The remaining bits are part of the subnet address. The first address in the subnet has all zero bits, and the last address in the subnet has all one bits. Subnets are like loves of bread in that the ends are different than the middle. The all-zeros subnet address--the first address in the subnet--is the name of the subnet. The all-ones subnet address--last address in the subnet--is the broadcast address.
Network 5, if you really need to conserve addresses in this fashion - that'd be 12.0.2.129 - 12.0.2.254. with 12.0.2.255/25 being the broadcast address.
A network 6 with 10 computers require the "nearest greatest power of 2" bits for each to have an address, which is 16 (0-15).  0-15 wants 4 bits.
I'm taking this to mean you are required to pick the smallest subnet that will accomodate the number of nodes you want to put in it
12.0.4.128/25 is the next available, so you could do 12.0.4.128/28.  12.0.4.129 is the first available address, and 12.0.4.143/28 is the broadcast address.
I don't know what you mean by IP address space waste. For example, network 3 has 78 machines but 126 usable addresses. If you didn't want to have unused IPs in that subnet, just assign available IPs to new interfaces.
