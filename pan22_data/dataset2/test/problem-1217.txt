One issue you absolutely must consider when moving a DC to offline (as far as the production network is concerned) is that if it is off the production network longer than the tombstone time, it may contain objects that have been removed from the production network (known as lingering objects) and there can be consistency problems when it is reconnected to the production network.  I've experienced such problems and it wasn't pretty.
Set up an isolated network on the current ESXi host. Clone the existing servers needed for the test and bring them up on the isolated network. If need be, you can sieze the FSMO roles on the isolated DC, as it's isolated from the production network this won't have any ramifications for the production network. Join a test client to the isolated domain and perform your testing.
Active Directory functions by default in a multimaster replication mode, where each domain controller is independently authoritative for the domain(s) it manages. Thus, the test DCs will still be able to handle logins and receive updates (password changes and the like) even while disconnected. The two sets of DCs (the live ones and the ones in the test site) will slowly diverge over time, but that's only a problem if you intend to converge them afterwards.
It doesn't have to be problematic if you just take care of a couple issues in the process.  If the domain was originally Windows 2000 and upgraded to 2003, the tombstone age is 60 days where if it started out as a Windows 2003 domain, tombstone age is 180 days.  You can change the tombstone age, but this requires going in with ADSIedit or other tool to directly modify the Directory Service partition of Active Directory and I don't know if you would be comfortable with that or not.  (the path is: CN=Directory Services,CN=Windows NT,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=yourdomain,DC=yourdomainsuffix) This will make Active Directory take up more space on your DCs since they will hold on to all removed objects longer before actually completely deleting them.
As this is for testing only have you considered running a VM on one of the machines and setting that up as a DC? Something like Virtualbox, despite not being a good choice for production use, would do fine in this case.
Before disconnecting the off site DC you should be sure to do a time sync to minimize any time drift while it is off site.  The important part is when reconnecting, you should first configure strict replication consistency on the production network DCs prior to reintroducing the off site DC (using the Repadm tool with the /regkey switch) and be sure to set the off site DC up for a nonauthoritative restore, also prior to the reconnection, so it will get the new SYSVOL replicated to it as soon  as possible.
