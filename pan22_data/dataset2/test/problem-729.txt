Still, just remember my advice. The key is to move the camera and rotate the player rotation based on the X Mouse axis or the camera rotation based on the player rotation as a center of a circle (always apply only when player is moving). Usually the first is great for mouse/keyboard movement, the last is great with joystick movement.
For the script part: there are many ways to create a Third Person Controller (also lot's of already made scripts, Unity standard assets got one example that you can use to learn how to make your own), you should try to create a basic script and ask for more specific help when you tried to make it and it's not working (and debug until you find where is not working).
Example: if player is NOT moving your mouse should be able to move your camera (without moving the player) on Mouse X and Y axis (just remember to change player rotation based on your camera when you start moving). If player is moving your mouse should be able to move on Y axis but while moving on the X axis it should also rotate your player.
So, if your player is moving forward with W if you use your mouse you should be able to rotate, if you only press D your player should be able to move right (but your camera should face forward).
If you really want to move your camera based on the WASD (like you should do with a joystick). You just need to rotate the camera by using the player rotation (the contrary of what you do in the first example), just remember that the camera rotate as a circle with the player as center.
