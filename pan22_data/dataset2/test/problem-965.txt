A friend of me had the same problem and fixed it by downloading the newest drivers from http://support.dell.com. If this doesn't work: please check your Event-log by first pressing Windows-Key + R, then enter eventvwr.exe and press ok. Check specially Windows-log - System.
My os is vista and my audio was going in and out, I would have to enable it for it to come back on, so I set it to enable automatic whenever the audio does crash, it still gave me problems because when the audio went out, everything using audio would have to be restarted in order to hear the volume again even though the audio was already back enabled.  When audio goes out I receive a "host process for windows services stop working popup message" . could someone tell me what kind of issue is this, I went to my device manager to try a driver update or scan for hardware changes for audio, but it doesnt seem to fix the problem. Just to see if it was the actual internal speakers I hooked up the audio output to external speakers and get the same results.Can someone help me.... model-M1530
