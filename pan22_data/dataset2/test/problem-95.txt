My perspective: I'm a student at NYU, been heavily involved in game development since sophomore year, worked on several projects, and I'm graduating from university this semester.
For example, I'm loving it in NYC, but large game studios tend not to last long here. I'd like to work at a large game studio to get some experience working on AAA games. This may have been easier had I been going to school in a location with those kind of studios around. Similarly, since NYC is obsessed with tech startups, I've been immersed in that environment. The location in which you study can influence the paths you take.
For programming, yes - you can learn almost everything online or in books.  The danger is that you'll pick and choose the things you find interesting yourself and focus on them.  There is a lot of (on the surface) boring groundwork that you need to focus on too, and some measure of more formal learning will help you discipline yourself to that.
The one thing that going to college will definitely establish is that you're capable of taking a 3 or 4 year project and sticking with it to the end.  I'm not sure about the selective part - so long as they have a reasonably good reputation and teach the right kind of stuff I don't think you need to be overly concerned about that.
Fundamentally, successful people will be successful. There's no getting around that. If you have a shiny CS degree and 4.0 GPA from UC Berkeley, you may still get passed on for a game programming job by someone from Some Lesser Institution Of Learning(TM) if they're able to demonstrate strength in the skills and knowledge required for a position--especially if they have a cool playable portfolio. People in other industries may be impressed by where you got your degree from, but it seems like game people care less about it on average.
A final advantage I can think of is that you can select to learn some topics outside of the programming sphere, which will give you a much more well-rounded experience.
Of course you could always skip school and just move to an ideal location. But then you've gotta figure out rent and find a job right away, and maybe you still need to spend time building your portfolio and doing your independent study. It's doable, but college kinda puts you in this not-really-adult world where you can put a few of the real world concerns away for a bit while you learn.
I'm attending one o'them debt monster "selective" colleges. I feel if I had gone to a less prestigious university back in my hometown, I still would have learned fundamentally the same things. However, what I'm really paying for is connections and opportunities that I might not be able to get at another school. Of course, all schools have opportunities and connections, they just have different types of opportunities and connections.
