Enabling forwarding allows the machine to route packets to other hosts, and yes, it consults the routing table and only sends it to the correct interface. With forwarding disabled, all packets not destinated to this machine are discarded.
Your problem most likey stems from the fact that your FORWARD rules do not allow forwarding from the lan to the lan (which would be reasonable in the absence of that kind of internal NATting). Since DNAT happens before FORWARD, when FORWARD looks at it, the destination address has already been changed to the lan one.
DNAT happens in PREROUTING and SNAT/MASQUERADE in POSTROUTING, so all the steps in between (filtering by FORWARD, notably) always sees the effective, "end-to-end" adresses. You have to write your forward rules like NAT was non-existent and your private address space was routable.
Masquerading replace the source IP adress with the one of the outgoing interface, so that the request appears to come from the router, and not from the private NATted address. It also keeps track of the connection status, so that when replies arrive they can be directed to the original source host.
However, there is only a single instance of each table per system, not per-interface tables. So the packets get processed by Netfilter regardless of where they get routed, and you have to filter over the destination interface by hand in the rules.
