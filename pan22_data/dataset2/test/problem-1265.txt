That's correct. The default install of a desktop installs the ubuntu-desktop meta-package, which pulls in the normal GUI interface stuff. It also includes metapackages ubuntu-minimal and ubuntu-standard, which together comprise the basic Linux utilities.
Play around with the program tasksel if you would like to deal with server stuff; also note that Ubuntu has a separate server install CD if you wish to use that.
But with Windows, I can see that there's monetary incentive to do that. Windows 7 is less expensive compared to Windows Server 2008. 
The differences are just in what's bundled as a default packaging to make things easier. In reality the difference between a server and workstation are just the purpose they're used for; Linux is Linux in either case (indeed Windows NT variants were largely just differences in packaged tools/dll's and some registry hacks to enforce licensing differences for how much you paid for your license...the kernel was the same and the base OS was the same).
No, they are different. They use different kernels. Currently, the "desktop" version uses linux-image-2.6.28-11-generic kernel, whereas the "server" version uses linux-image-2.6.28-11-server kernel.
dmityugov is correct, but further to that, the kernels have different compile time options for things like raid, ethernet bridging, routing, etc...
In other words, Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop are two sides to the same coin. Server was just meant to run by default with some packages to make it easier to set up a LAMP server or file server by default while desktop looks nicer and has office tools/GUI/etc. for desktop users.
To take an extreme example, I don't think people will want to run a production web site on Windows 7 instead of Windows Server 2008 even though it's capable of doing that.
With Linux, I believe using server version is a lot easier rather than using desktop version and then optimizing it to match a server version.
Yes, you are correct to say that basically they are both the same. However, I can mention at least 2 reasons why people create desktop and server version of an OS:
