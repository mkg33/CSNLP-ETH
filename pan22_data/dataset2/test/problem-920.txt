The image can be a normal image as the hard drive itself handle the encryption, plus you don't have the (potential) hassles of a software encryption product and there is no slowdown as the encryption is run in a chip on the hard drive rather than taking up CPU cycles.
It allows you to build an image from the base OS, include drivers and updates (Service Packs and/or individual updates) in your image then create a DVD or USB stick or use Windows Deployment Services if your laptops can PXE boot.
We have a few issues because of new policies enacted at our institution.  First of all, the drives have to be encrypted.  Second of all we'd like to easily (and hopefully quickly) refresh (i.e. re-image) the laptops before we recheck them out.
It allows you to include scripted app installs and you can have users check the boxes or you can create packages.
We have about 20 laptops (windows xp or 7) that we're getting ready for checkout at a library.  People will be using these laptops anywhere from 1 day to 3 months.
The issues we run into is that encrypted drives can't be compressed, so the images would be huge (like 150GB).  The next issue we have is creating an imaging process that is simple for the library staff to use.
If you can upgrade to Windows 7, you can create a base image and set it to automatically enable BitLocker on the first boot. Deploying the image could be done with a custom DVD "installation" using Windows Setup.
Any suggests would be greatly appreciated.  We've looked into solutions like Deep Freeze, but we need the laptops to retain their configuration for more then just 1 reboot.  We're also looking into TrueCrypt to do the encrypting for us.
