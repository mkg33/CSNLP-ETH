Many things could go wrong, he can make mistakes, he can install backdoors. It's not about broken system. Mis-managed VoIP server could lead to significant loss due tool fraud, premium number calls and so on. Loss can go in millions.
I'm small company owner, currently managing about 15 Debian based boxes, providing VoIP and hosted PBX services
I'd like to hire system administrator, but I have a strong fear of giving root access to the stranger. 
Before down-voting - This problem is for sure not new or unique, but I haven't found on serverfalut information that is recent, can be applied to Debian servers and relies on software with licence costs that my small business can afford. So currently I see no duplicate thread.
No-root access is probably not going to be productive, I can't imagine resolving any serious system problems without root. Maybe I'm wrong?
I have read posts stating that I must have level of trust, and if someone will make damage, than I can sue him. But that's not the case for SMB. In such situation my company will bankrupt before first court session.
