The files in the site www subdirectory should be readable by the effective user-id of the running web-server. The Apache web-server often runs as user nobody, group nobody or user www-data, group www-data. So this user or group needs read permissions.
I'm looking for the best security approach in this case! And please don't tell me I need to move to a dedicated server: why would I ask any question then!?
But I can't `chown' anything, and since files will be owned by user:user, I don't know what the permissions should be.
If the site is public and the scripts contain no passwords, no exploitable security loopholes (e.g. race conditions), it may be OK to give world-read permissions. I would aim to have all files owned by your personal user-id, not by a user "nobody" or "user". Only you should have write permissions on files in the www subdirectory (and it's subdirectories). Even if your site contains no personal or valuable data - you don't want it to become taken over by fraudsters or spammers.
If the PHP scripts write to files, those files need to be writeable by the effective user-id of the running Apache service.
