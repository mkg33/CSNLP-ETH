I use a following script to give images some successive dates. Hope it helps. It expects a directory with the images to be redated as an argument i .e script directory_with_images
Combined with last import filter you can easily adjust the imported photos from a camera with wrong date and time.
Also, Shotwell Photo Manager on Ubuntu (current defaul photo manager on version 13.10) have a menu adjust date/time for selected photos.
There are two options, if you selected more than one thumbnail for updating: "Adjust all photo dates by the same amount" or "Set all photos to the same date and time".  Choose whichever is appropriate.  Then click OK.
In the Properties pane right click on the Camera Date field then select Adjust Date and Time... from the context menu.  The Adjust Photo Date dialog will open showing the current Camera Date for the first photo.
iPhoto and Aperture both have a time-shift option, for when you're in a new time-zone usually, or the clock is wrong. It can either leave the files unedited (only updating the App's db) or edit the files.  Clearly F-Spot needs to borrow this.
Select the thumbnails you want to update.  To decide which to update as a batch, you can either set them all to the same new date-time or you can change the first one and all the rest will be time-shifted by the same amount.
Exifer creates an empty tag or two in files, and not just in the EXIF block. It will also remove some tags written by other tools. As I haven't used it in over a year, I can't be specific as to which ones. 
Edit the Camera Date and Time as required.  If you just want to change a.m. to p.m., or vice versa, just select the "a.m." part of the time and type "a" or "p" as appropriate.  No need to type the whole "a.m." or "p.m." thing.
