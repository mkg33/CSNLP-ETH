I've done some research and found out that the 'fix' requires me to open an Anaconda prompt and install a pipeline or something like that.  Unfortunately, I get a Windows error.  I researched the particular error and found a github discussion thread that's on point for this Windows error.  
I'm not that computer literate, although I'm old enough to somewhat remember navigating DOS on an IBM in the late 80's, and this seems similar.
I'm trying to get graphviz to work with jupyter notebook so that I can print a visualization of a decision tree for a class I'm taking.  I have jupyter notebook code from the instructor that should work.  However, I'm getting an installation error.  
I found out libssl-1_1-x64 dlls in Anaconda/DLLS and Anaconda/Library/bin being installed at different dates, so, as an experiment, I copied the one in Anaconda/DLLS and replaced that in Anaconda/Library/bin and conda started working again, at least for now - I could install new packages again.
Once this is done, I believe I have the Anaconda commands that will successfully install (pipeline?...is that the term?), or otherwise make available for import in jupyter notebook, graphviz.
Apologies in advance if I shouldn't be posting here.  I was directed here by regular stack overflow.
So my question is, what are the exact commands I need to enter into my Anaconda prompt to accomplish this?  And is there anything else I need to do?
