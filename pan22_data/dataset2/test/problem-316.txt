I have not seen this mentioned about backups yet, but make sure you take them off site! You may also want to make a backup of switch, firewall, etc. configurations.
Yes - getting a few extra hard drives / spare parts on hand is good, but I would be more worried about the things I can't see or don't directly control. 
Put some protection beneath the racks, specially the one that is in hard concrete. It'll (or probably is) shake(ing) a lot. If you can't buy (specially because of the time) buy some earthquake-resistante floor, put some foam underneath it, to reduce the shaking.
Power:  If you lost power, will all of the servers, storage, san (etc) in your rack reboot on their own?  Or will they come up only after you press the 'On' button?
This is the perfect opportunity to go over what you have planned for business continuity. What is the plan if you have to move offices for a day or a week? Do you have up-to-date plans on drawings and which systems have priority for restoration? Is management briefed that you do have a plan and aware of 
Server equipment is surprisingly robust, and will continue to operate for years under some pretty awful conditions.  Chances are you'll be fine.
Just going over this in your head / on paper will help you know if you have any weaknesses that need work later and perhaps communicate this up the chain if your organization doesn't have anything written up. Start with a two page, executive summary  - just a FYI so that everyone knows what you're doing.
The acceleration from the blasts causing havoc on the server room is probably the least of your worries. Your utilities could be at much higher risk unless you are self sufficient with on-site power and robust connectivity (assuming you are not self-contained and only supporting local staff).
The real benefit of this process exercise is a reality check for your current monitoring system.  Once you've planned out some basic scenarios, you'll be better prepared for the unexpected. Having a short summary of what you expect to survive and what you don't will come in very handy no matter why you suffer an outage, and also assist in driving your efforts to improve monitoring 24/7 rather than when the foundation starts shaking.
If there is a water main or power or internet access failure, can you survive that? Have you called your internet provider to see if they are aware of the blasting and have prepped to restore service through an alternate route if your utilities are interrupted. You'll know your specifics better than we can guess, but you should have a list of everything you need to function and addressing "What if this goes away unexpectedly?" for each.
In addition to all the other excellent suggestions (particularly off-site backups) you should consider dust proofiing your room to the extent practical:  Weather stripping around the doors, tape around the windows, etc.
All that said, I wouldn't waste time/resources on nightly disk scans, or money on spare hard drives (maybe buy one or two for your most critical machines, but remember that you can overnight drives if needed).
