Recently, I moved over to using Macs at home (I still work on Windows) and iTunes really fits well into the OS and feels natural. On Windows, iTunes just feels out of place to me. It just doesn't feel "Window-like." :-)
Lots of the differences are just with differences in platform. The mac version has much better text rendering, even on Vista iTunes text still looks worse. The mac scroll speed used to be worse, but now I think it's better than Windows. Windows used to miss some keyboard shortcuts (eg create new playlist), but both seem about the same now. 
User usage wise, there is not much difference.  There are some minor things though.  The mac version integrates naturaly with the mac os with iLife and software update.  On windows, software update is a different application in itself. Other than a few install options and os specific features/code, no, they are not much different.
My experience as a long time Windows user is that iTunes used to install a bunch of crap that ran in the background and it seemed to cause my systems to have problems. iTunes now runs much better on Windows than it used to.
Cover flow is still slow on Windows and I don't think there's a way to make the mini player (The Window menu is missing on Windows).
One big difference was that on Windows, if you moved a file iTunes lost track of it. Macs work differently at the filesystem level, so that didn't happen. Is this still true?
iTunes rocks in a Mac; Sucks on Windows; well altho' the software is well written, feels out of place with an entirely different UI to common windows apps.
I still wish for a Winamp for mac, iTunes is just too big to fire up when you want to just play a folder of songs, and I don't like the way it insists on adding everything to its library.
