Using VNC you can access User Interface of RPI directly on your chrome browser in Laptop. You will need Chrome extension for VNC Client.
So I got a raspberry pi 3 as a gift and my only spare monitor and keyboard is my laptop, a cheap lenovo ideapad. The laptop is thin and light, so it lacks an Ethernet cable which means I can't follow any of the tutorials on how to connect it by that. The laptop has an hdmi, 2 usbs headphone jack, microsd and that is it, anyone know how to use the keyboard and screen from a laptop for a pi without ethernet?
What you are looking for is a way to setup a headless Raspberry Pi without ever needing to connect it to a monitor, keyboard and mouse. 
Then install VNC Viewer on your laptop, open it and go to 'raspberry.local', enter 'pi' as username and 'raspberry' for the password, and you are in.
This easiest way I have found to do this is by using PiBakery to image your Pi's SD Card, since you can specify your WiFi login details and enable the VNC server all from your laptop.
So basically, install and use PiBakery to image the SD Card providing your WiFi details and enabling VNC, then insert the SD Card in the Pi and connect it to power.
Finally, go to Preferences, Raspberry Pi Configuration, and Set Resolution to DMT mode 85 1280x720 for example, and restart your Pi, so you'll get a bigger resolution via VNC on your headless Pi.
