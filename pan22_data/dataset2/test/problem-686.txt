Now if it was a Mac...http://www.roblambert.com/2007/05/12/robs-practical-joke-of-the-week-fun-with-the-mac-say-command-and-ssh/
Connectivity could be done easily with a couple of batch files; one to ipconfig /release and one to ipconfig /renew at pre-determined times, scheduled in the windows task scheduler.  There is even a checkbox on the 'Create Task' window at the lower left, for making the task hidden!
You can just ssh into the box, and do pretty much anything from the command line. Want to reboot the pc? 'shutdown.exe /r'. I'm sure you can work some things out. A big plus for me would be that you can watch from a distance and improvise according to the behaviour of your victim(s). Super evil, but ooh so much fun :D
Send remote commands to the machine via remote desktop connection or ssh and make the computer talk.
Or... loosen the graphics card so it flickers when they knock the desk, though i hold no responsibility if this causes longer term issues :p
Using devcon (and Sysinternal's psexec to access remotely if needed) you could do things like remove the USB root controller drivers.  This would inexplicably disable any input devices such as mouse and keyboard until next reboot.  You may have to disable trackpad drivers as well if this is a laptop.
