My first thought would be to see if the manufacturer does have a 64bit version of their firmware upgrade utility. More and more servers are running 64bit OS's nowadays particularly when server 2008 r2 and Exchange are now 64bit only. If they are a reputable RAID controller producer they really should have this available.
My question is how to create bootable media, CD would be better in order to install those drivers. In older Windows version there was an option to create a boot diskette but i need this on CD which will load after restart instead of OS.
DOS no longer exists in Windows, cmd.exe is a Windows program that acts as a DOS-like command line interpreter. You can boot to safe mode with command prompt, that will just give you a command prompt, but that really gives you no extra functionality over doing so in windows.
I need to upgrade firmware in two RAID controllers on my Dell PowerEdge 1950 server running Win2008 64bit, this is required to be done from DOS because the driver gives me an error " You cannot install drivers on 64bit OS".
