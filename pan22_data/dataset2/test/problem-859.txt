This could still be a problem with the power supply as suggested above. Swap with a known-good power supply or (better) test the power supply with a decent power supply tester to get a conclusive result on whether the power supply was at fault. (preferably one that will report the actual voltages with a load applied). 
You should check your SMPS 20/24 pins connector first, Sometime the pins or cable getting loose of this connector. You can check it by replacing with new SMPS.
I had this exact problem with a Corsair PSU I bought a month ago.  It will power on for a second or two, then everything would shut off and it wouldn't even try starting again until I had flipped the breaker on the PSU on and off.  Replaced it with another PSU and everything ran just fine.  A clear defect in my PSU that caused it to trip its internal circuit breaker after a second or two of power up.
(Be sure to save this until after you've checked out the power supply - the drives pull a lot of current especially to spin up when the system is starting- so not only can a bad power supply easily make the drives misbehave, but also taking the load of the drives away from a failing power supply might be enough to cover up a problem with it and confuse your troubleshooting.)
With problems that only happen when a system is fully warmed or cooled, loose components are always a strong suspect. Carefully reseat the CPU, RAM, expansion cards, and all power connectors. Heat will cause loose connections to fail sporadically due to expansion and contraction of the components. (With the expansion cards, CPU, and power connectors you can just press them in to place to make sure they are properly seated. With the RAM, you need to pull the clips off the modules and then press the module back into place and be sure that the clips reattach themselves. Obviously, as with any time you do work inside the case, follow proper ESD precautions.) [1]
In rare cases I've seen a malfunctioning drive cause these sort of problems,. After ruling out the power supply, the next time the problem happens, try booting the system without the hard drives and optical drives connected. 
[1] - Yes, I'm aware that the clips on the RAM modules are supposed to prevent chip creep. But my experience has been that it does still happen, particularly with systems running at higher and higher operating temperatures.
Obviously, try swapping the power supply. If you don't do that, then you may never narrow it down. If you don't have a spare one then a techie friend might.  
And that fixed my problem. It used to take a lot of time at some times, but at least I did not have to keep pressing the power button.
