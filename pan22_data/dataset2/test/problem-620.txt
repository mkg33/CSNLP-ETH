I would suggest to make a base of a master server that could be used as a template to have all customer servers installed in the same way, like with kickstart under RH or Fedora. That template could include all software that you would require useful.
Configure ssh with keys. Disable root login via ssh. Use sudo for administration of the server. Have the firewall (iptables) configured.
There is harm in installing "too much" - it increases your potential scope for attack, more services installed and running means more things to patch, more things to miss, more things to configure et al.
If you are looking at setting up many near-identical systems, why not setup one system and ghost it.  You can write a script so usernames, passwords, hostnames et al are changed after you deploy the ghost image to make the system unique.  Also, take a look at 'puppet' for automated centralised administrative tasks.
The very first thing I do is setup the firewall so only ssh is available.  This is opened up to more services as I install and configure them.
Otherwise, reduce services and software on the server to a minimum - just have the things that are really needed.
Who is installing these servers? Has your company a minimum requirement on the needed software, libraries, etc. for the application you deliver?
