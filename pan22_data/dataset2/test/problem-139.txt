However, how could we get mouse and keyboard input from the box to the embedded device? Keystrokes are by the way not enough, the mouse has to be transmitted as well.
Is there such software? And if not, is there any other solution to this use case? Anything that works would be okay, I'm just hoping I can ditch the 2-3k KVM over IP solutions which seem like an overkill...
My problem is that mouse and keyboard input are coming form the remote desktop connection and not hardware on-site; otherwise a simple USB switch would be enough. So a software which simulates/forwards mouse and keyboard as USB output form the remotely accessed box to the embedded device would be best. But I couldn't find something like that.
Our wished setup for this would be a (cheap) windows or linux box in front of our embedded device which has a HD cam filming the console display of our embedded device.
We have a lab with an embedded test device. We cannot install any software on it what so ever. However we can plug in exactly one set of USB mouse and keyboard. Now we want to give developers (one at a time is absolutely enough) pseudo remote access to it.
Setting up and managing remote access to such a box would be easy. Seeing the console of the embedded device would also work naturally as video stream in the box (delay, frame rate and video quality are not an issue/critical).
However meanwhile several years have passed and I have a slightly different use case and therefore are looking for a different hopefully efficient/good solution:
