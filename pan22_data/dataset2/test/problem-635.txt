Perhaps http://www.JewelBeat.com. Maybe what you are looking for with huge selection of 35,000 tracks at $0.99. Comes with custom license made out to you. This should fit you as it works for commercial use without having to credit especially if you are not able to do not want to.
They often have sales for large collections (~20 tracks, with 4 variants of each track including loopable 1 minute sections) going for $8.41, or short samples (~40seconds) going for ~$5.
What about ccMixter or other creative commons sites? I did a quick search for sci-fi and found this: http://dig.ccmixter.org/dig?dig-query=sci-fi#
I'm looking for a royalty free sci-fi sounding song thats 1:00+ long, and costs less then, or is $5 usd. I want to have a nice BGM for my engine demo I'm going to release for a game I'm planing on having go commercial. I don't want to spend too much money on it, so my limit is $5 usd. I want it to be at least a 1:00 in length.
I can attest to their quality, I've used the discs I bought (Scifi, Mystery and Hard Rock) in all of my indie games work.
