Noting the relationship between neighborhoods of vertices in a dominating set instance and sets in a set cover instance, and inspecting the reduction, you will find that this reduction also shows solving $k$-Set Cover with $n$ sets over a universe of size $m$ in $n^{k-\varepsilon}\cdot f(m)$ time implies a CNF-SAT algorithm for CNF formulas with $M$ clauses and $N$ variables running in $2^{N(1-\varepsilon/2)}\cdot f(M)$ time. For the purposes of refuting the Strong ETH, it suffices to solve CNF-SAT in the case where $M = O(N)$. Hence an algorithm for your problem running in $n^{k-\varepsilon}\cdot 2^{m/\alpha(m)}$ time for some unbounded function $\alpha(m)$ would yield a surprising new SAT algorithm. 
In my SODA'10 paper with Mihai Patrascu we study the essentially isomorphic problem of finding a dominating set of size $k$ in an arbitrary $n$-node graph, showing that if $k$-dominating set can be solved in $n^{k-\varepsilon}$ time for some $k \geq 2$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, then there is a $2^{N(1-\varepsilon/2)}poly(M)$ time algorithm for CNF-SAT on $N$ variables and $M$ clauses. 
The case of $m = c \log n$ is in $n^{O(c)}$ time as noted by Yuval, but also note for $k = O(1)$ you can solve the problem in $O(n^k \cdot m)$ time (polynomial time) by exhaustive search. Assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (that CNF-SAT on formulas with $N$ variables and $O(N)$ clauses requires at least $2^{N-o(N)}$ time), these two time bounds are the "limit" of what we can expect in polynomial time, in the following sense.
