Also I know that there is a lot of free VPN services that can achieve the same with just typing username and password.
Here is another article with clues that this is possible (How do I setup a VPN service like “hide my ass” using Azure?)
When I type ipconfig I see my wireless adapter and another one for the VPN adapter. The last one uses VPN's ipV4 address. I want to use this address while browsing.
I want to use another IP address for browsing in certain websites. I know for that purpose can be used a VPN, so I started searching about it using Azure as service, because I have an account there. I want to implement my own VPN using Azure. But I cannot understand whether this is possible.   
I watched few youtube videos and tutorials from Azure academy, but still cannot understand how to "hide my ip address".
I executed all of the scripts listed in that article force tunneling. I have a local network gateways and few connections, but now I cannot understand how can I use it to connect from my PC to the infrastructure that I've created. 
In Azure I've created a Virtual network with subnet, Virtual gateway and configured the point to site (P2S) connection with certificate. It allows to download a VPN client, then I install it and connect to it successfully. The advantage that I can gain is that I can ping VM and other devices inside that virtual network.
