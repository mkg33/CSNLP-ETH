You can of course drop everything, but depending on what environment this actually is and how many rows there are in the table, it could cause quite a bad situation due to locking, blocking and deadlocks.
At least I would recommend looking first at the index usage statistics report in SSMS. It will tell you if the indexes are being actually used or not. The figures are since the last time the server was started. If the indexes aren't being used, then it's quite safe to drop them, the only issue of course being index hints in SQL statements.
After this I would also look if the indexes are more or less duplicates of each other. 50 indexes sounds so much that I would guess there's a lot of indexes that have (almost) the same fields in different order. When dealing with composite indexes, remember also that there can be statements that only use one or more of the leading columns of an index, and that's why not all statements can use the other index even if it has the exact same columns but in different order.
But for every insert and update in case of the indexed fields, then each of the indexes must be maintained, and that's then slowing down the operations.
If the table doesn't have many inserts or updates, then it's basically just wasted space (+ maybe longer maintenance / backup time)
