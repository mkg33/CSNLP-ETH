Here is the catch...your VPN is only as efficient as the lines supporting the tunnels, for heavens sake, please don't try to load group policy from a domain controller down to a client half way around the world over a 512KB line.
While the "open" suggestions are great, if you're asking this question, my guess is that you're unlikely to have success implementing them.
Save yourself alot of trouble and pick up two routers with VPN capabilities from a vendor like Linksys, Netgear, D-Link, or even Sonicwall.  They are very easy to set up and will connect two networks together securely.
In my experience, the routers will have some kind of virtual Point-to-Point link between them, perhaps a GRE tunnel or L2TP. The dynamic routing protocols treat this link like any other interface. 
There are some vendor/implementation specific configuration issues with the VPN configuration - consult the documentation, the vendor's support organization, or describe what products you are using.
Your router/vpn devices should have routes to the other locations, just setup the local DNS servers to address the machines the "other" side.
Establish VPNs between sites. Then enable a dynamic routing protocol to share network information between the sites.
When you setup a VPN connection, you probably want to have each location with its own subnet to limit the broadcast domain.  Why clog your limited bandwidth connection with extraneous traffic?
If the WAN-connecting routers on both sites support it, an IPSEC VPN sounds like the sensible option. Alternatively, a firewall or dedicated VPN-termination box (and possibly some static routing) should make it transparent to the individual computers that you're hauling the packets across a VP{N.
VPN tunnels. I prefer hardware based VPN, this is at router level. There are many out there from very cheap to very expensive. On the cheap side there is Linksys, DLINK and on the other side you have Cisco, sonicwall and others.
Also try to control your broadcast traffic accross network if both sites will have different subnets.
Once that is done, whether the computers "see" each other, is very dependent on the network being run and how that traffic passes over the VPN.  Windows Workgroups are broadcast based systems which may interfere with the "network neighborhood" showing all the systems.  Use of "lmhosts" files can help with name resolution.  This is typically what domains are used for along with trusts between domains if they are different.  By having a central registration for computers (Active Directory and DNS), they are able to "find" each other without configuring name resolution on each machine.
One key point relating to network design - you need to treat all the sites as part of one large network. For example, you can't configure all the remote sites to have a 192.168.1.0 subnet. Rather, you might be able to get such a nightmare to work with NAT and with a very convoluted routing configuration, but it is so much easier to design all the sites as being part of one network space.
