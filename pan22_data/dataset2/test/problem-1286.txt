I have no idea if the Greene-Kleitman graphs give an answer to your question, although I would expect their recognition to be either polynomial or NP-intermediate. Similar to perfect graphs, it seems reasonable to investigate this question for restricted graph classes first: for example, it can be seen that the split graphs having the GK property are exactly the (net,tent)-free graphs. I'm probably missing some of the relevant literature though as I'm not a graph theorist.
Let $G$ be a finite undirected graph. By a "$k$-independent" (resp. a "$k$-clique") of $G$, I mean a disjoint union of $k$ independent sets of $G$; the maximum size of such a set is denoted by $\alpha_k(G)$ (resp. $\omega_k(G)$). Say that $G$ has the "Greene-Kleitman property" if the sequences $(\alpha_i(G))$ and $(\beta_i(G))$ are increasing and correspond to conjugate partitions. It is known that comparability graphs enjoy the Greene-Kleitman property (see "The Structure of Sperner k-Families" by C. Greene and D.J. Kleitman, J. Comb. Theory, Ser. A 20(1): 41-68, and "Generalizations of the Greene-Kleitman theorem" by S. Fomin, FPSAC'94 problem session).
