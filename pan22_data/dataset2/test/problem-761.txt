However, the official "free upgrade" time period has ended.  For a time, you could still use the Disability Free Upgrade tool.  You may be able to use this tool in 2018 : https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/ .
Windows is always supposed to be paid; it's just not always visible to the user.  If you buy a new PC from Dell in 2018, it includes Windows and the cost is included in the price.  For several years starting in 2015, if you had an old PC with purchased Windows 7 or 8, then the upgrade to Windows 10 was free.
It is easy to download the modern Windows 10 ISO and create an installer USB stick or DVD.  It's also easy to install it.  You can choose "Skip" when prompted for your activation key.  However, after a few days, Windows will phone home to Microsoft to see if it's been paid for.  If not, it will post a little nagging text in the lower right hand corner, by the default clock position.
Microsoft keeps a large database of all of the different PCs that have had Windows 10 installed, using unique IDs from motherboard, CPU, and some other characteristics.  If it recognizes your PC as a paid one, it doesn't bother you.  If it does not recognize you, then you get the nagging text.
