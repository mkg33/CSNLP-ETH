I guess this will generate some pretty big files and I'm not sure how useful the diff output will be - but at least it should provide an answer as to whether the files are the same or not.
Audio CDs are generally not ripped with dd and stored as ISOs.  Audio CD data (CDDA) is closer to tracks on a phonograph record, spiraling inward with gaps marking the boundaries.  They do not contain a filesystem.
I would test this with a cd you have already burned and verified from an iso, then compare the original iso with your iso.
Does the dd work with other types of binary files? (try copying '/bin/ls' to another file and see if it still works?) 
You running 'FileVault' or anything on your machine ? Not sure if that could affect this type of thing ?
Instead, audio CD data is usually ripped with programs like cdrdao or cdparanoia.  Instead of an ISO file, audio CDs are generally stored as BIN/CUE pairs, WAV/CUE pairs, or individual WAV files for each track.  The CUE file is an ASCII text file containing the layout of the tracks, and the BIN or WAV files contain the actual audio data.
For whatever it's worth, this is what diskutil tells me about the disk that's currently in the drive:
