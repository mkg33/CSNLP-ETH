You can hear the disks spin up if you put your head next to the cabinet but when they reach top speed they're very inaudible. Any head rattle is practically inaudible too.
Be wary of manufacturer supplied acoustics as they probably all have variant methods of measuring sound and they are not unbiased.
If check the specifications sheet for the drive, the noise levels are listed and you can compare those to your current 7200RPM drives. I currently use WD Velociraptor's for development and they are very quiet, 15K Utlra SCSI's on the other hand can be a little noise when seeking. For instance:
The hard drives are not going to compete with the cpu/gpu fans. Especially if you're doing the sort of coding that is going to stand some improvement from 10k drives.
Currently the second generation (G2) Intel X25-M SSDs are about the same price as two smaller velociraptors and give about the same overall I/O performance imo - at the cost of some storage and the gain of being silent... 
SilentPCReview reviewed the WD VelociRaptor WD3000GLFS and it tops the (admittedly dated) list of quietest drives so far.  Note that there is a very significant increase in noise with the IcePack heatsink attached.  Editor Mike Chin notes that it does very little for heat transfer.
So to answer your question, no they are not significantly louder.  If anything, they're actually quieter in general.
I have two 160Gb 15k RPM disks in my 2 year old HP xw8600 workstation at work and the entire kit is very quiet. 
(80 GB should be plenty for a system drive with OS and development tools and sdks, keep your working copy on a separate and bigger drive/spindle)
Note that an SSD is probably a better choice for a fast and quiet workstation today, unless you really need magneto-disks.
