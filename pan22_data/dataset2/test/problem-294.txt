First, the last I heard, EasyBCD was next to useless on EFI-based computers. Typically, you'd want to use rEFInd, gummiboot, or GRUB to manage the boot process on an EFI-based computer. IMHO, rEFInd works the best of these -- but as I'm rEFInd's maintainer, I'm biased.
Second, Windows creates a 200MiB EFI System Partition (ESP) by default, so chances are that's the one you want to keep. That said, the only way to know for certain is to examine them both. Windows uses a directory tree called EFI/Microsoft on the ESP, so if the partition does not have that directory tree, it's probably safe to delete. Also as a side note, you should try to keep just one ESP on any given hard disk. Although the EFI spec expressly states that multiple ESPs are OK, the Windows installer flakes out if it sees more than one. The result is an aborted installation. It's conceivable that some other Windows tools would flake out, too, but I don't know of any specific examples. The ESP is meant to be shared, so Linux and Windows boot loaders can coexist on just one ESP.
