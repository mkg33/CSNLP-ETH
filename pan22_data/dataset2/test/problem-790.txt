there are some distributions that work with a rolling release schedule,meaning that when a certain piece of software is released,it is included in the distribution once tested and found compatible with the distribution
The timing of versions of packages in different distributions is based on the package maintainer at each said distribution. Therefore to keep absolutely up-to-date in all apps you'll need to use multiple distros. Virtualization is the easiest way to do this. Using virtualbox in seamless mode makes it seem, visually, like all the apps are running in your host.
If you want a package the day it is released, compile it from source, if a few days delay is not a problem, than debian unstable.
Manjaro is the most up to date distro you can get, it also supports proprietary drivers so no need to worry about breaking it.  
Still, if you want cutting edge you'll need to compile. Some apps aren't available in any distro until released as "stable". Some apps are never available in any distribution.
it is also really fast, definitely quicker than Ubuntu, only bad point is that some packages are put together on Ubuntu so they take a bit of tweaking to get working.
First, some distributions are release based and some are rolling edged.  Comparing them is unfair.  For example, compare arch with debian stable.
Currently most distros will not remain fully stable and usable throughout the alpha/beta cycle until release. Recent beta distros that have broken during upgrades include Ubuntu karmic, Fedora 12, Mandriva 2010 and OpenSuse 11.2. Typical problems are proprietary video and hardware drivers, kernel boot problems and gui system configuration tools. Often these problems can be fixed by patching and compiling yourself or waiting a few days or weeks until another update fixes things. As the distro gets to release candidate stage stability increases but application updates fall behind.
I think Funtoo goes further than any other distributions.  (Gentoo as a source oriented distribution always features blooding packages.  And Funtoo is the develop branch of Gentoo.  Enough said.)
I wouldn't recommend using any unstable distro version without virtualization. Keep your host running a released distro that's reasonable up to date like Fedora, Arch, Gentoo (you didn't want to compile though) or whatever distro you're most comfortable with that supports the virtualizer you choose. Then install the beta versions of whatever distros you need in virtuals to satisfy the range of apps you're interested in.
