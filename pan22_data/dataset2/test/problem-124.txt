I am looking for a way to automatically define some aliases inside my session on any server I ssh to. I can't put them in the .bashrc files on the server because the user accounts I log in with are shared by other people and besides there are dozens of them and maintaining a script on every machine would be painful. I know I could use expect to type the aliases automatically but I was just wondering if OpenSSH has anything built-in that could conceivably be used to achieve this?
One possible solution would be to put your script that sets everything up on a webserver that all the other servers can access.
You could write an ssh wrapper on the client side that sets up a nice environment on the remote side, but it wouldn't be pretty.
From the ssh(1) man page, if you create a file ~/.ssh/rc, it will be executed BEFORE the user's login shell is executed, thereby giving the chance to do 'pre-setup' tasks before logging in... the example given was to mount network shares before logging in.
If you don't want to use individual ~/.ssh/rc files, you can do the same with /etc/ssh/sshrc.   A quick test to check for your particular username or some identifyiing method could restrict others from even noticing this was in place.
If possible, I would store a small script that initialize/define everything you want on a server accessible from everywhere and execute it after login in each server.
/etc/ssh/sshrc is ONLY sourced if ~/.ssh/rc does not exist, so you can effectively achieve two layers of complexity.
