The above method would let you know what switch your end point devices are plugged in to, but you'll be missing any intermediate switch hops in the middle.
If you are a user of the network who would like to know the topology, your best option is to speak to your administrator about making this information available through some sort of self service portal or API.
That's all. Box you have access to and ip address of the peer. You need to know is there a switch between you and peer.
Switch will not allow arp reply with broadcast mac address. So if you DIDN'T receive answer - you DO have a switch on your way.
I know my answer is not exact for current topic, but i hope someone will google something similar and i can help.
CDP is link layer protocol that can help you determine layer 2 topologies. (exactly what you're looking for)
So, assuming you have a box you have an access and you have a peer. You already know ip address of this peer (we will not discuss here how to determine it).
CDP is Cisco proprietary, but there are similar things from other vendors and an 'official standard called LLDP.  
On most Linux hosts you can install a package called 'cdpr' that will sniff and report back a decoded CDP frame if it receives one.
If you're not seeing any CDP or LLDP frames, you can make a little bit of inference about what switching topology you're connected to by looking at the Spanning Tree addressing.
If they are Cisco switches (high probability) and they have CDP turned on (decently high probability) then you can sniff the network for CDP traffic.
The only way to do this is with access to the switches themselves. If all you have access to are end hosts, it will not be possible for you to obtain information about the full topology.
If you are the network administrator, I would recommend documenting your physical topology manually ASAP. There may be open source and/or vendor tools that help you get started, but your network topology should be something you keep track of and modify in a planned way, rather than something you periodically discover.
Traceroute will give you hops only on routers. Switches do not do any routing, so they are not visible to traceroute. What is the reason you want do "see" switches between?
