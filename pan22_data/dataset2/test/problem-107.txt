The track tables can also be used with route-maps set ip next-hop verify-availability 1.1.1.1 250 track 4
You want to look into HSRP.  Basically, router 5 and router 6 would share 192.168.1.1, but their real addresses would be .200 and .201 (For example).
HSRP is probably your best option, but since it looks like you are running a routing protocol, you could look at passing the default route. Just make sure you have a backup default route with a high metric like 254 as a backup or to help get the network cold started.
But of course, a switch can't have 2 default gateways (right?) and I can't give the routers ip addresses within the same range. How would I best solve this problem? So that the switch can ping any of these routers and in the future, ping any device in the other LAN.
The router on the left is a router on a stick to route traffic within the LAN that has different VLANS.
HSRP is so that non-routing (static) hosts can have the benefit of high availability.  This is the gist of the idea, I will add more config later.
I'm guessing these probably work with L3 3560 or 2960 or later, but can't say for sure. I'd still vote for passing a default route via OSPF :)
The left switch is the root switch for our LAN and works as the VTP server. This is also connected to Router 6.
Another option that appears to be supported on a L3 3550 is to use ip sla and track tables. I haven't used it on a switch, but have used it with success on branch routers to switch default routes when a route becomes not pingable.
I want to connect this LAN to a future other LAN (that will be connected in a similar way with Router4 and 5) using these four routers because the link has to be high-available.
