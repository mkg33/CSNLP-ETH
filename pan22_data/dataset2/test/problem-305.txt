I'd recommend running CHKDSK on the volume to be sure it's healthy, and, of course, being sure that you've got a good backup before proceeding.
(note the filesystem after the extend otherwise you will get a minimum extent error because you would be telling diskpart to extend the disk instead of have the OS recognize the new size).
There is another scenario that is common if you clone your HDD to a larger one OR if you have a VPS/Virtual Server and resize the disk what happens is that usually the partition will remain the same/wrong size even though Disk Manager will show it as the new larger size.
So I I resized a partition and now the partition table seems like it is screwed up. I am running Windows 7. When I open the "Disk Management" The table at the top of the screen show the disk as 139GB. Down below, in the graphical partition representation, it shows as 212GB. It is truly 212GB. The rest of the OS sees it as  139GB... why is this inconsistent two pieces of the same Disk management app are showing different sizes for this partition. Is there a way to repair this? Manually or automatically?
It's possible for the partition to be a different size than the NTFS volume inside the partition. NTFS maintains a count of the allocation units in the volume irrespective of the partition size. Having an NTFS volume show as larger than the partition its in is bad mojo, but smaller is no big deal.
If chkdsk comes back clean or minor errors found and repaired but size mistmatch still exists then I would boot off a live CD live CD like System Rescue CD and see how it lists the partition size.  You can use ParImage on that cd to change the partition size if needed but that may be addressing a symptom and not the cause.  Acronis has also great products for imaging and changing partition sizes, not free but affordable for workstation OS's. 
The discrepancy makes me think HD problems.  Backup first, even before running chkdsk! Copy the data to another physical drive, make an image of the drive if you want a 2nd backup.  Run chkdsk with verify/repair. If the drive has underlying issues you'll want to deal with that before making any changes.
