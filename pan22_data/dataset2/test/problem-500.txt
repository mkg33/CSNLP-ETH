A quick google turned up this, this and this, if you hunt around there are probably cheaper cases about. Or you could use a more convenitonal case and disk bay doublers like this. The problem with this approach is that you're going to need a cable for each HD (I believe that there are esata multiplexers availalbe - but they're very commonplace outside of dedicated enclosures).
A basic HP SAS expander allows a further 24 or 28 drives to be connected; presumably, this will suffice for the near future.
Alternatively, stick in a PCI-E storage controller with external connectors in there and just hook up SATA hard disks externally.
Server systems should not use disk storage in any non-redundant fashion - not for the OS, not for anything.
While there's lots of smaller enclosures about (1-5 drives) I've not seen anything big enough for 12 drives. And since you probably want the disks in caddies, I'd go with a large PC case (or 2) and several esata connectors.
Instead, you could invest in a proper HBA such as a card with an LSI SAS2008 or better - this offers 2 mini-SAS 6Gbs connectors (4 lanes each), and allows you to connect 8 SAS or SATA drives directly, or one or two SAS expanders in an external chassis.
It might be a better idea to stick in a motherboard, OS, 10Gb ethernet and hook up the drives as an iSCSI target (don't route this through your existing network - use a direct connection / dedicated NIC or 2 in the server).
The simplest way is probably to buy a cheap NAS and to then stick the harddisks in there. Mid-range NAS devices will typically allow you to export their hard disks as iSCSI nodes, so you could then use them directly on your server. This might put quite a bit of strain on your network load, however.
