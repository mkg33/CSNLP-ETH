Your floppy disk isn't created as a bootable disk. You have to use the sys program in the command line (or, alternately, if your BIOS file is small, you could try using the FreeDOS boot disk. I've had luck flashing machines booting from FreeDOS; just know that it may not always work--but the flashing program will fail to start under FreeDOS, not in the middle of the flash process.)
This is only an issue on OLDER BIOS's, as they often didn't translate CHS into logical sectors as the newer BIOS's do nowadays.  Older DELL machines suffer from this issue often.
At first look, this sounded like a bad motherboard. Though usually, the gx280 fails when the capacitors blow and the system doesn't even power on. So we might be able to salvage this situation.
If you have a hard drive in this machine which is GREATER than ~137Gb, and the BOOT partition is larger than 137Gb, then booting will fail if the boot files (somehow) get moved somewhere on the drive past the 137Gb mark.
Solutions are to defrag the drive to put the boot files back at the front of the partition (mydefrag is excellent for this, google it), but this doesn't help if you can't boot.
The first thing I noticed was that you were making a "boot disk" not a "MS-DOS startup disk" which is what you need to use. This brings you into a super simplified OS that you use to run the flash utility provided by dell.
If it still doesn't work after all of this, then you defiantly have bad hardware somewhere. My personal opinion is that the GX280 is a terrible system and you can build much more powerful systems for under $400 if you are building this for personal use. If this is a business, get the system replaced, your end user will probably love the upgraded performance.
Surprised though--most DELL BIOS programs come with a program that makes the disk for you, sys and all. Maybe that's changed (I stopped buying Dell years ago and only have worked with 5-year-old hand-me-down boxes from friends & family.)
I almost wonder if this isn't a hardware issue. Have you tried switching out the cables for the harddrives? 
So here is a step by step guide of what to do note (I have done this to the gx280's in my organization):
Partition Magic or similar tools could be used to shrink the boot partition down to less than 137Gb, shuffling files around as it does so.  This would resolve your problem and prevent it reoccurring in the future. These are typically on bootable media themselves and would be immediately applicable to your situation.
Another requires forethought.  If you install ANY version of Windows on a drive partition larger than 137GB, consider partitioning the drive into at least TWO partitions, first (boot) less than 137GB, second (or more) any size you desire.
You mention that you downloaded a boot ROM from the "manufactures website". Could you add the link that you used? If you went directly to the BIOS manufacture for the update instead of the OEM, you have the wrong BIOS. In many cases, the OEM (Dell in this case) modifies the files provided by the BIOS manufacture to fit their needs. While you could use a non Dell provided BIOS and get it to work, it is not recommended.
