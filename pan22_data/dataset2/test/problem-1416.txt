The way I found out what program was causing this message was to start Task Manager and see what programs were running.  There were two listed - one was "run As" and the other was "LGFW".  So I looked around the net for "LGFW program" and found the answer.
The same was happening to me.  Every boot brought the "Run As" box up.  Solved it by checking my startup list from "Run" msconfig.  An update recently started calling an exe file to stat at boot. In my case it was from an LG drive I have.  It can be stopped by disable the startup in the msconfig, or removing the program in your program files.(ie. "C:\Program Files\lg_fwupdate\lgfw.exe"blrun)
If you can't see the rogue app in Task Manager because it only lists 1 app (i.e. RunAs) in the 'Applications' tab, try the following;
Try making a new standard user (hopefully limiting access the program gains if you're concerned about that) and running the program as this new user. Then go find the only processes that is running as said user. Might be easier than digging through your system for it.
you want to get rid of the runas dialog box that pops up  when you start your computer on desk top, it's easy  start your computer go to desk top when runas dialog box pops up, push Ctrl & alt and delete buttons all at the same time, windows task manger will come up look at Applications that are running you will see in applications runas will be at the top and the program that's making runas start will be below it. write the name of the program below runas on some paper so you won't for get it, close windows task manager. now go to start at the bottom left hand Conner and click on it, go to search, for files & folders in the file search box, type the program name you wrote down and hit search when the program comes up click on it with your  right button on your mouse and delete that program, close restart your computer and the runas box will be gone, why does that work, that program is not compatible with XP, that's why runas box comes up.
