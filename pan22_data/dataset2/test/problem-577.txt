But if you have line of sight, I would go with wireless. There are some simple antenna improvement ideas online.
cheap wireless devices using bandwidth at theoretical maximum (so, no neighbors using wi-fi, baby monitors, cordless phones, or leaky electronics of any sort, no rainstorms, snowstorms, or sunspots, no bucket truckets or ladders in the path, etc.) will not exceed the reliability and speed of a wired link costing less.
The maximum segment length of 100BaseTX is 100 metres (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethernet) so you could comfortably connect your two PCs using a cross-over Ethernet cable.
This Sounds like a job for a CANTENNA!! (directional Wifi antenna, traditionally constructed using a cleaned out food can) (Assuming that you have line of sight and can set up external antennas on either end of the connection).  My personal suggestion - get two cheap linksys WRT54G's, hook up cantennas to either end and point them at each other.  set up one to work as a wired and wireless repeater, and voila - wireless network connection with decent signal strength even over that distance. 
For the cantenna, there are commercial solutions, and DIY solutions.  Which would be better depends on you DIY skill and how long this is going to be used.  If you only need it for a little while, or are a wizard with a soldering iron, go DIY.  If you're looking for permanent or are likely to use an eye with a hot pointy rod, go commercial.  Plenty of options for both show up with a quick google for "cantenna".
if you are unable to run wire in a protected location but you have a clean line of sight, wireless is a great hack.  But wired, as long as you can keep it from being trod upon or cut, is going to be better in the real world.
Best solution is an ethernet cable if you have less than 40 meters to avoid the walls, unless you'll certainly have to go wireless but 60 meters without an decent antenna gain is going to drop the bandwith down. Another option is power line communication wich deployment success will vary according to the electrical setup of the building.
