Depending on your browser, if you enable the password manager feature it may offer to remember the school login for you, thus preventing you from typing it every time.
There is an option to have Microsoft set the password for you. If you uncheck this box, it should enable you to enter your own username/password.
(I can help with the input, but not if I don't know enough information. What kind of box is it, for example? Is one box automatically highlighted, and can you tab between username, password, and ok?)
It turned out that I can solve this problem by going to control panel -> network and internet -> connect to a network then right click the network and select properties then make sure the box with the label "Cache user information for subsequent connections to this network"
What you'd do here is tell it to send the correct keystrokes to input the username then password as soon as the dialogue came up. Not quite automatic, but not going to be stopped by some silly greyed out checkbox :)
