I can confirm that it is entirely possible for traceroute to report back private IP addresses in other peoples networks.  This is because the packets are not destined for that IP address, rather the TTL packet which decreases for each hop is adjusted so it times out and returns a result.  The source address (ie one which the router is replying to) is your WAN interface IP address, so the packet can then be sent back to it.
I'm pretty sure that if 10.0.0.1 is your router (which makes sense) then 10.165.32.1 is your providers router.  They are probably providing you with the 
service - incompetently - using NAT.  (I say incompetently because they should be using Carrier Grade NAT and the 100.x.x.x network, nonetheless, using 10.x is fairly commonly used by ISPs)
Traceroute works by showing you the routers that packets go through to get from you to your destination.
Your WAN address would not appear in the traceroute because traceroute shows the "next router" address, not the address packets are leaving from - much like your home computers address is not 10.0.0.1 yet the first hop is - IE what you are seeing is equivalent to the LAN Interface on your router.
