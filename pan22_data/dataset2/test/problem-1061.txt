we recently added a MacPro with eight (yes 8) monitors on it.  We have various tools for monitoring our website (Chartbeat, Nagios, internal statistics, Jenkins, Smartfox, etc.) and they are currently free-flowing in various browser windows on the various screens.  
If you already have Nagios in your environment you're already there. Nagios can be set up to take in the feeds from all the various monitors you have in place and present a single combined view of everything. I've been a Nagios consultant for a number of years now. Send me a private message if you'd like to discuss this further. 
I use a firefox-plugin called "Tile Tabs" where you can tile your browser screen and load different monitoring-sites. You can also save the current tiles and load them again. So maybe you stretch your firefox across multiple monitors and just divide the content. For reloading i use the "ReloadEvery" plugin, where i can set the reload time in the context-menu of every tile if i need to. Its also a good solution for full-hd-tv screens to show a summary of your monitoring.
