We setup 10 virtual desktops and 10 physical desktops all running scrapers - and that is all they do.  The problem is the http requests and responses and scraping of the sites (especially if done asynchronously) will tax the hardware and the connection on that machine.  I usually have a web app as the only thing running on that server it sits on, the db(s) are on different servers, CDN is separate, and document/image storage is even different from that.  I know it sounds a little complicated or daunting at first, but seperation of concerns makes it way easier to debug bottlenecks.
I am taking it that your node/express scraper and your node/express/angular app are on the same hardware/shared server(hardware, not server instance).
First, the screenshot is only of the scraper server responses, that will not help too much from my perspective trying to answer, however, I have been there before. 
If that is the case, you could run a 32 bit python scraper and throttle a medium setup if your scraper is looping requests and responses as fast as the wire will allow.  
You will likely want to #1 - log your scraper success and fail rates on different base urls, to make sure you are not getting blacklisted.  #2 - wait each loop of the scraper, if even for milliseconds. #3 - and this is the most important, please get your scraper off your angular hardware.
