How would I perform the same calculation by matching frequencies instead of bandwidth? The wikipedia article on memory dividers provides an example I don't understand.
Now however there is no guarantee that the memory requests will be balanced equally between both channels. Each request to the memory controller in a dual-channel layout may have a benefit ranging from [1..2]. For example, given an FSB@200.00MHz and two DIMMs of DDR2-400 in separate channels, if the CPU requests 64 bits of data solely from channel 1 (none from channel 2), then that particular request will need by completed over two transfers.
I was having trouble accounting for the mismatch between the FSB and Memory I/O Bus frequencies, until I found this elegant answer suggesting to match bandwidth instead of frequency.
From what I gather, the RAM prefetch buffer is also completely immaterial to this discussion. The prefetch buffer is completely internal to the DIMMs: it allows the internal memory clock to run at half the Memory I/O Bus clock without a drop in bandwidth.
My working assumption is that the memory divider only denotes the ratio of effective (not actual) frequencies. For example, quad-pumped FSB of 200MHz has an effective data transfer rate of 800Mhz. Dual-data rate operating at 400MHz has an effective data transfer rate of also 800Mhz. This implies the memory I/O Bus actually runs at 400MHz, a fact glossed over in the memory divider ratio. Is this correct?
You are correct to assume that if you raise the base clock to 266 MHz it will result in the front side bus (x4, being quad pumped) speed of 1066 MHz.  Using DDR3 memory with a speed of 1066 MHz would result in a 1:2 ratio because the frequency would be 533MHz (x2, for Double Data Rate memory modules.)  That is assuming that your motherboard supports 1066 MHz DDR3 memory modules.  Check the motherboard manufacturers website for the memory support list for that specific motherboard to see if the modules you have in mind have been validated. 
Of course, given 50/50 odds (ie a linear efficacy of the dual channels), faster RAM provides diminishing returns, especially compared to $$. And perhaps the CPU is always able to batch memory requests to always utilize most efficiently the dual channels, in which case I should instead purchase two DIMMs of DDR2-533 in anticipation of overclocking the FSB to 266.66MHz? Or is this correct?
Therefore, my conclusion is to purchase two DIMMs of DDR2-1066 SDRAM in anticipation of overclocking the FSB to 266.66MHz. Is this correct?
The memory divider denotes the ratio between the FSB frequency and the Memory I/O Bus frequency. If, as per the article, the FSB operates at 200MHz with a memory divider of 1:1, then the Memory I/O Bus also operates at 200MHz. The article then claims this is compatible with DDR2-800 SDRAM. Why? DDR2-800 SDRAM operates at 400MHz, not 200MHz.
