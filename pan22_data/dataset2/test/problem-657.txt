Fortunately, almost every computer ever made has an excellent source of entropy: crystal oscillators (clocks). The rate of a given crystal is not just dependent on subtle temperature changes, but is subject even to temperature hysteresis in nonlinear ways. However, to measure the entropy, you need a second clock to time the first. What this means is that, whenever your computer has at least two clocks you can sample, you can use the rate of one as measured by the other as a very high quality entropy source.
If your hardware has something designed to be a hardware entropy source (note: this is basically a requirement for any proper IoT device implementation since it's needed for TLS, so your hardware should be designed with that in mind), just use that. If not, you have to get creative.
Since the problem here is really an XY Problem, I'm going to address solving that: how to get a unique identifier for a piece of hardware the first time it boots without having to preload identifiers onto them. All the good methods really boil down to one thing: having a source of entropy.
