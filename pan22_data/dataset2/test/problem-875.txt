These days people are more likely to recommend a hardware upgrade (cheaper and easier way out) which is quite all right. However it's important to see if we have done everything else right so a hardware upgrade would benefit more.
So going out and spending, say $4k on 2 servers will give you a significantly faster solution than spending even quite a lot more on a single server.
Web serving (unlike database serving) gets much more benefit from adding lots of small servers in place of one large server - and since you're already running a lot of long-polling over HTTP, this is especially true. Increasingly the problems become those of the number of open connections, the number of running processes, the size of the network buffers, the rate at which the system can switch contexts....
I would also check your connection to the server if you are testing remotely and not over a LAN/Localhost and getting such response times.
Having said that, sometimes upgrading (or preferably adding) hardware is the only solution - and often it can be the most cost-effective solution long before you've exhausted the tuning effort.
I would first see if there is anything I can do to improve the code behind or find out whats really slowing things down. A minute of response usually indicates a long execution time. Buying a new server right away may be shooting yourself in the foot. A new server may or may not improve your performance by much.
There is a huge additional benefit - say the availability for your server is 99% - assuming no shared dependencies, then the availabilty for 2 nodes is 100-100*(0.01*0.01) = 99.99% - its nearly a hundred times more reliable.
If you can't really fix the application (or it seems fine) for whatever reason or all optimizations have been done, and network seems ok then your only choice is to upgrade hardware for which you need to see your resource usage for a page load. Does the server use more memory or CPU. Its possible that other applications are competing for resources, can you start the resource/performance monitor and see the pattern?
While its possible that you could speed up your current system massively by tuning it we'd need to know a LOT more about the nature of the workload and the current config - and even then it would require a lot of work and testing to get an optimal solution - there are a few good books on the topic - go read some of them.
