Hand the wreckage (or at least the bits you don't hang up as a trophy) over to an E-Waste recycler and they will do something appropriate with it.
One quick and easy way, recommended by Steve Gibson, is drill a hole through the hard drive making sure you drill through all the platters.
The platters (and the read/write head - talk about paranoid) where then escorted to a specialized recycle company and melted down.
It shouldn't be that hard to expose the platter after peeling back the various stickers covered in dire warnings. Once exposed, you have a choice of fun methods. Bending it even a little would make spinning it under a head impractical, so that is probably a good place to start. A ball peen hammer could be used to make a nice texture, or just apply a belt sander. Wear eye protection, naturally.
As for disposing of it, it's basically iron and it's alloys. Just throw it into metal recycling container.
Pragmatically, unless you are holding national secrets, just scoring the platter with a scratch awl really ought to be sufficient to make it well beyond anything but the NSA's capability. If you are really worried, score both radially and in spiral.
Basically if it still works, use some utility, that overwrites each sector of the disk at least 10 times. Easily done for example with dd.
Although degaussers are also certified by our local friendly security agency, they still use the above method internally (well it is a while back so they may have changed there methods).
When decommissioning clusters of machines in the past we have used a gas powered nailgun through the drives, making sure to catch the platters.
In practice we took the lint out of backup tapes and put that into a shredder (work the same with floppy disks) and the snippets was treated to an acid bath by a specialised company. 
Hard disk was another matter, we took the platters out and sanded it down till we had bare metal. We used a belt sander for that, that does the job very quickly.
Perhaps not the most environmentally friendly option. But it is satisfying and you can get through quite a few at a time.
The NATO guidelines on the destruction of magnetic data-holders is that the medium should be dismantled as far as possible and the magnetic layer should be either shredded with snippets of less then 0.25 by 0.25 millimeter, pulverized, melted or dissolved.
