a) Add a new table to the database to store the "purged" subscriptions with 3 columns, purgedId, subscriptionId which is a fk referencing the subscription, and purgedDate. Then in any sql that references the subscription table left outer join the purged table and use "where purgedId = null".
b) Add a new column to the subscription table to store the purgedDate and add "where purgedDate = null" to all of my subscription sql.
Thanks in advance for any assistance you are able to provide and once again sorry if this is an elementary question.
I am a student intern, I've been given the task of adding a new feature the companies client administration system. Basically it involves "purging" subscriptions, they want selected subscriptions to be removed from the client admin system but remain in the database for recording purposes. We currently have around 600,000 subscriptions. They wish to "purge" 10,000 subscriptions right away and another 30,000 over the next few months, so around 6% of the subscriptions table.
