I have an SPF record on the domain, however it doesn't appear to be having any effect. Receiving MTA's seem to be claiming my domain is neutral about all sending ips. 
I believe I may see your problem.  I assume by your spf record that this is a google domain and you are using them to send mail.  Change your spf record from "-all" to "~all" - as I know that this can cause some issues.  See here: http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=178723 
As far as I can tell, your SPF record is set up correctly. I sent a message to one of my addresses (Gmail) using a sender address from your domain (test@foomatic.net). Gmail does evaluate SPF, but always delivers the message regardless. Here are the headers I got:
My guess is that the servers for yahoo.co.jp aren't evaluating SPF correctly, but I don't have any email address with them, so I can't test it to make sure. Aside from that, you might be running into other MTA's that simply don't respect SPF hardfail, resulting in messages still getting delivered.
Authentication-Results: mx.google.com; spf=hardfail (google.com: domain of test@foomatic.net does not designate XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX as permitted sender) smtp.mail=test@foomatic.net
Received-SPF: fail (google.com: domain of test@foomatic.net does not designate XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX as permitted sender) client-ip=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX;
