I ran into the same problem and i replaced the bin folder with a version of the application i had backup up the day before and it solved the problem. If you are having problems still then try to do the same with the (obj\debug) folder
PCA was already enabled & running on my system, but AE was NOT enabled; after enabling AE and starting the service, I've been able to Run & Exit my program in Debug mode 30 times consecutively without any problem. I also tested making minor, rapid changes to the program in between executions (as I had been doing, trying to find a good x/y size for a console-based graph), and I've not experienced this delayed deletion since.
For a while I was using the hack method of switching back and forth between Debug and Release when the compiler was unable to replace the project.exe. Fed up with the ridiculousness of that method, I googled for the problem and stumbled upon your post. Following your sevenforums.com link, I decided to try the answer listed in the very last post (enabling Application Experience and Program Compatibility Assistant), and lo and behold it actually worked.
Turn off System Restore? I suppose Windows is trying to move them to System Restore folder but the antivirus fought it somehow.
Have you by any chance used a registry hack to completely remove Library functionality from showing up in Explorer?
It looks like an explorer or iexplorer (IE) plugin is messing things up. Maybe the faulty plugin is fighting with your antivirus? Try turning the antivirus off and see if that makes any difference. Also, when you are waiting 2 minutes for the delete, watch your task manager like a hawk (with the extra IO columns if needed); it might reveal a clue?
It may seem like an odd recommendation but I had the same problem and noticed it came back after a fresh Win7 install when I did the remove Libraries mod.
