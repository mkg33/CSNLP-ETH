Dell drivers seem to only ever include highest resolution.  I fixed on my Dell monitor via Nvidia control panel and adding custom resolutions.  Check if there's any options in the 945GM driver to allow modes not reported by display or some such.  Or if there's option to add a custom resolution.
In windows XP you can force a custom resolution (as long as your video card will drive it) and timings using software such as PowerStrip http://entechtaiwan.com/util/ps.shtm OR through registry settings: http://www.mp3car.com/lcd-display/42122-tutorial-forcing-custom-resolution-in-windows.html
If you can't get either of those going, let me know ... there are other alternatives, but i would need your exact driver, and chipset version.
Under Display Properties, there are many resolution choices, but the only one that is 16:10 is 1920x1200. I would like something like 1440x900, as I don't want to stretch the screen. I tried re-installing the driver listed on Dell.com, but it didn't help. Any ideas?
I have a Dell Inspiron E1705 running Windows XP. It has Intel 945GM graphics. When I bought the computer, I got it with a native resolution of 1920x1200. However, this resolution is far too small to use, in my opinion. I have tried adjusting DPI settings, but it's not the same.
Install Intel Graphics Media Accelerator Driver. It solved the problem for me. It automatically selects the resolution 1440x900 upon reboot.
