If there is something wrong with your sound device, you may get a sound, but not the correct sound. I have seen systems with internal speakers "beep" instead of playing the correct noise. This generally means something is having problems.
Another stupid thing ... do you rebooted your machine? I've seen things like this after suspends or sleeps.
At that case, I would start with system restore and go back to a time when your sound worked. If that doesn't help, I would follow the advice by @Ganesh.
One thing to check: the selected output device. For example, at Winamp check your output device to see if there are more than one and chage it.
While the default sound profile is rather noisy, windows does not make "periodic" noises when you let it sit. Windows only makes noises when an event happens. Things like start up and shutdown are the most noticeable. There are a number of other common events that make noise. For example, when you open the basic volume control (left click on item in the system tray) and choose a volume level, the system makes a noise. This is so you have a way to tell how loud your speakers are. The default sound is best described as a "ding" noise.
Also you can check the default sound device at the Control Panel -> Sound Options [don't remember the exact name as I have Win in another language].
