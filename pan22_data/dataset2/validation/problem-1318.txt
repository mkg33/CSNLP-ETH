Using a good managed DNS-based solution would be easier though, if the cost for a reliable enough provider is within your budget, but this might be a viable alternative.
UltraDNS and Akamai can provide this service, however they are very expensive. I settled on using DNSMadeEasy which have DNS servers on both coasts, as well as europe.
It is in the Debian repositories (http://packages.debian.org/lenny-backports/geoip-database) which implies it is in fact properly "free" in many regards (though you might want to check the to make sure the license(s) are compatible with your project's codebase and direction).
How accurate do you need it to be? If you can live with a little coding of your own, more-or-less accurate location resolution, and giving a redirect response to browsers that  hit the "wrong" server first time around, then you could use the freely available "CeoLiteCountry" database to handle it yourself. I've got it on a list of ThingsToConsider for one of my planned projects.
We would like to use a DNS service to direct users to the nearest server, but can't find any. Does anyone have an recommendations for solutions. A cheap, hosted solution would be preferred as we would rather not run our own DNS servers.
We've got a website visited by users mainly in the USA and UK. The site will be run on servers in both these locations.
