I'm trying to understand the hype around cloud computing and whether it could be a better alternative to a traditional data center in terms of costs. I can see the benefits of cloud if you are a small business, but what if you were lucky and became a big giant?
A website that hosts videos, images, music, games, etc. would need an incredible amount of storage. If you were aiming at the next big thing on the Internet and if you eventually had to store, say, 200 petabytes of data, would you pay 200 petabytes * 0.15 per GB = 30M a month or would you buy your own storage? I know the latter comes at a price in that you need to pay for electricity, IT staff, hardware replacement, housing, data replication, etc., but I still feel like the former seems more expensive. OR maybe I'm wrong?
Of course storage is not the only variable that costs. You need to pay for bandwidth (probably the most expensive), HTTP methods like GET, PUT, and DELETE, and virtual machines. A website with high traffic and a large user base would consume those in high doses.
