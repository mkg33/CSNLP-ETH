I have two spheres in Unity. One is 1000x in size other is 1x in size. So I want the smaller sphere to be attracted to bigger sphere. So how do I do it. I know that it can be down through gravity using rigid body. But how do I change gravity angle towards the big sphere?
Else you can do it the other way around. But in any case this would probably be better since you most likely want to make gravitational pull different from planet to planet. 
Have the planet/big sphere with an circle collider, give it a child. Now, the planet should either be tagged planet or static cosmic object, and the child should be labeled Area of influence.
There's no need to resort to the gravitational equation.  Acceleration due to gravity is constant regardless of mass, so all you want to do is accelerate your small objects towards the large-object each frame.
In fact, I'm currently working on a game based around gravity: simply, you place stars to move your player through eliptical orbits and the slingshot effect. I disabled gravity, and used this code:
PS The code originally looped through an array of all the planets: this is edited and therefore may not be fully correct. It should be okay though.
What others said, gravity on unity is only towards a certain direction, so maybe you should instead disable gravity completly and script a force that moves the small sphere towards the huge one.
Put a script on the planet with a on enter/enterstay trigger, if it is a sphere of influence it should be pulled towards that.
