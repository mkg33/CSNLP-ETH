Alternatively, you can configure sudo to not ask for a password at all. I don't recommend this except in the case of automated actions carried out by service accounts. In that situation you can specify only the service account can execute only a specific command. However, you're more than capable of removing the sudo password requirement by changing the above line to something like:
You're really talking about two different things. Configuring SSH to do key based authentication only is part of the sshd config, and sudo (passwordless or no) is handled by pam. What you should really be doing is this:
You'll want to pick your sudo group and modify the sudoers file, using the visudo command and add something like this.
