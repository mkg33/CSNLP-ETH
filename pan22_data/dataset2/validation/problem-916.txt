if you dont want to change change your addressing scheme then best possible solution is the usage of NAT
Bridging and Proxy ARP. OpenVPN should be capable of providing this with a host on each end, probably also any Cisco with irb configured between an ethernet interface and an ipsec tunnel.
Renumbering is the right answer.  If you don't want to do that, then implement NAT in both directions.  This would allow you to keep the existing IPs in both locations.  However, each side would "look" like a different subnet from the other side.
IMO the better solution to accomplish this is with VPLS or L2TPv3. Contact your carrier to see if they can provide VPLS or other L2VPN services.
You will need double NATing to achieve this without changing IP addresses. You can not ping an IP that is in your LAN and expect it to reach somewhere else. As long as you are part of a LAN and communicate locally, your traffic to IP address in 192.168.2.0/24 will always go to your local network. As mentioned above, you will need two IP ranges lets say 192.168.102.0/24 and 192.168.202 that will be used for double NATing like this:
