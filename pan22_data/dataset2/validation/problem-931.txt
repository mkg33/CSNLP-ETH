Ideally, I'd want to be able to select both the Date and RoleType columns in their entirety and then spit out the results in a table that would have the different role types on the X and the different dates on the Y.
I'm trying to write a formula that will basically count the number of different role types of humpback whales (MC, G1, G2, etc.) seen per calendar day. It's really laborious to do it by hand, but I'm getting hung up on the formula. 
I'm going to try to make this as specific as possible, but I apologize in advance if I'm not clear! I don't do much logic coding in Excel. 
The idea is basically to come up with a sum of the amount of times a role type was seen per day. So if the data looked like this:
I'm working with over a thousand sightings, so I'm reallyy trying to avoid doing this by hand. The expression I came up with so far is:
Where A3:A14 represents the date range being investigated, F$2 being the target date, B3:B14 is the list of role types being investigated, and "MC" is a (clunky, I know) manually entered designation of which role type is supposed to be counted. 
I would want the results to come out as MC on 3/1/19 = 3, G1 on 3/1/19 = 1, MC on 3/2/19 = 2, etc. So I think it may be an AND statement situation, now that I think about it?
