I usually run RDP on a port "other than" 3389 (security through obscurity).  Also, I lock down RDP to allow only one certain user account.
So now I am wondering what I do for providing secure remote desktop or similar access to the machine for tweaking and manipulating the app online. taking the app offline etc. Do I ask the provider to set up some sort of whitelist allowing my office IP forward to the RDP port or do I need to provide hardware or other software to lock the box?
When your server's in the colo does it just have Internet access, or do you also have a LAN extension or similar private circuit to manage it over?  If so, then it's a non-issue and RDP won't be a problem.  If not, then I'd definitely recommend locking RDP down past the defaults; different port, oddly-named Admin account with a strong password and a restriction on which IP addresses can connect to the service.
I am planning to deploy a Windows server running a web application into a colocation for the first time. I have already run IIS lockdown and done a number of other security tweaks based on advise from the smart folks here on the site.
