I have a need to open Linux .desktop web links on a windows machine. Currently I drag the web page's address to a shared folder in Linux, and that is available on the LAN for others to open. This works fine with other Linux machines on the LAN, but Windows machines are not reading the URL.
All I did then was go Open With... for a .desktop file and point to the batch file, with the Always use this program ticked. Now, just clicking on a .desktop file will open the url in Chrome (which I will soon switch to point to Vivaldi).
Over at https://www.computing.net/answers/programming/batch-file-to-extract-address-from-url-file/27904.html, "Razor" posted a batch file that will find a URL in a text file. I had to amend the path to Chrome, which evidently now installs in the standard C:\Program Files folder.
The Linux .desktop link is actually a small text file, and the URL is embedded in its last line. But Windows does not recognize the file type, and when I associate it with a browser in Windows (vivaldi, in my case), the browser simply opens the .desktop file as a text file rather than going to the desired URL target.
