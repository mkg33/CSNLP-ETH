The other way would be to 'show formulas' but that would show formulas for every cell, not just a selected range.
I know you said non-VBA preferred, but if you end up with no other solutions, the Range object has a HasFormula property.
This brought out all the formulas, but obviously would also convert things like if $C$1 contained =if($A1=$B1,"Match","Different") to '=if($A1'=$B1,"Match","Different")
Notice the A1'=B1 in the middle of the formula which may be problematic, but still means you get to see the formulas, albeit non-pragmatically. Could use the SUBSTITUTE function to change it back, so $D$1 contains =SUBSTITUTE(C1,"'=","="), then just copy out to Notepad and paste back into $E$1
Returns: True if all cells in the range contain formulas; False if none of the cells in the range contains a formula; null otherwise.
Then specify the type of cells you want and click OK and only those types of cells will remain selected.
Well past the original date, but if it's of use to anyone, I managed to get around this by selecting the range of cells, then using Replace (Ctrl+H), setting it to 'Look in' "Formulas" and replace an equals = with an apostrophe-equals '=
Use Conditional formatting. Choose the "Use a formula to determine which cells to format" option and type " =NOT(Cellhasformula) ". This will format anything that is hardcoded.
