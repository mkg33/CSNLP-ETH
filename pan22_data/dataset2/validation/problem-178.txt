Fore pure cold backup I'd say RAID5 is fine. RAID5 will take a considerable amount of time to restore on 8x1TB SATA drives, but given the chances of something breaking at low IOPS that's probably not critical. If you want the added bit of safety, go for RAID6 which will give you the ability to survive two simultaneous disk failures.
On my filer I run a software raid 5 across eight 500 GB s-ata drives, which works great. Read performance near 160 MB/s write performance around 90 MB/s. Recovery time is about 20 hours. Athlon X2 4200+ and nvidia chipset.
If it is purely for backup purposes and IO doesn't matter, raid 5 should be fine, raid 6 would be even better but you'd be losing storage space. How critical is your data? You could also do raid 5+0 comprised of two 4-disk Raid 5's. This would let you lose 2 disks, give you better IO, and leaves you with about 6TB usable, but there's a good possibility your controller doesn't support it (usually requires higher end stuff). Raid 6 is slowest of all of the options, lets you lose 2 disks, and will still leave you with about 6TB usable.
You'll need to figure out how much your data is worth, in real world dollars, and how annoying or costly a failure will be before you can think about storage strategies.  A hint is that the answer can't be "no loss ever," because that has infinite cost.
As this is to be used for backup storage, I don't see the need for raid 6. It's unlikely that two drives on the backup raid will fail within a few days, at the same time as production data are damaged or lost.
Use that cost/time/data to guide how long you can tolerate a rebuild, or how many hours the system can be down, or how much money you want to spend on hardware.
