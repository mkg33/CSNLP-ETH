Note that you are mounting the entire disk, whereas normally you would mount a slice, such as disk0s2.
I know this thread is old, but I'm posting this for those that may stumble across it. I tried multiple different things including hdiutil and various software programs. However, most of these programs were sorting files by type and did not preserve name or the original folder structure of my hard drive. I tried EaseUS and it was the only one that was able to show me the files in the proper and original format. Incredibly happy with the results so give it a shot if you are having difficulty.
Be aware that this helps if your problem is with a disk image similar to mine. Nonetheless, it should still work with partitioned disk images, see man diskutil.
I have seen infrequent issues when Firefox has been used to download an disk image.  Very uncommon, but it has happened...
I ran into a similar situation.  I did what simonair suggested and I received a message in Terminal that Volume mounted successfully.  However It did not help me access the mounted Volume neither was I able to confirm the mounted Volume.  Nor was I able to mount the image using Disk Drill or even scan through. Nothing succeeded. 
Generally, if you are receiving "No mountable file system", that generally means that the disk image is corrupt or damaged....  Try re-downloading the disk image, or downloading the disk image from within another browser....
I have just had the same problem, with a disk image created by Disk Utility itself. In my case, the disk image is whole disk image, i.e. it contains a bare filesystem, no partition map whatsoever. Neither Disk Utility nor hdiutil attach disk.dmg would work, both complaining about the dreaded "no mountable file systems" issue.
Here is what I did to solve my problem.  I see that in this post some suggested that we should convert name.dmg to writable file.  I used the command from Terminal to convert but was not successful.  INSTEAD alternatively, I used Disk Utility, attached the Volume (yes I got the same message again, ''no mountable system files'' however, Disk Utility nevertheless attached the image, which I was able to do before anyways.  This time, I selected it and then clicked New image, and then selected image format read/write, not the compressed option. I created a new image.  This time this image was writable however, it still would not mount using Simonair's solution.  However, this time I was able to scan it with Disk Drill with exact file locations and folder hierarchy as I had. Recovering all from thereon was a breeze.  Just remember: when you create new image of an attached volume and chose not compressed but read/write, you need to have a disk with exact amount of space that totals the total space allocated within that name.dmg file (not the amount of space the data takes).  Mine was huge, and luckily I had an external disk with enough space to do that and it took about 5 hours for about 400GB of disk allocation.    Good luck.
