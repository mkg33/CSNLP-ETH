Every time when there is a forced garbage collection of entries, last_flush field is updated in the neighbor table, neigh_table.
When a forced garbage collection of entries is requested, entries that meet both the following criteria are discarded:
A periodic work, neigh_periodic_work tries to free unreferenced entries if the total number of entries is greater than gc_thresh1.
Now, if I understand correctly, if the number of arp entries goes beyond gc_thresh1 but remains below gc_thresh2, the excess will be removed periodically with an interval set by gc_interval.
My question is, if the number of entries goes beyond gc_thresh2 but below gc_thresh3, or if the number goes beyond gc_thresh3, how are the entries removed?
I'm trying to configure sane values for the Linux kernel arp cache timeout, but I can't find a detailed explanation as to how they work anywhere. Even the kernel.org documentation doesn't give a good explanation, I can only find recommended values to alleviate overflow.
In other words, what does "actively" and "aggressively" removed mean exactly? I assume it means they are removed more frequently than what is defined in gc_interval, but I can't find by how much.
