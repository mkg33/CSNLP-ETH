Also if you run distiller, you can see the compression settings for all distilled PDFs. I'm just guessing, but maybe acrobat applies these settings when saving your changed file. This includes stuff like you see in the PDF optimizer section... whether or not to embed fonts, downsample images, compress tags, etc.
Sometimes PDFs contains unused objects (and even unused images and fonts). That objects may be removed when PDF is re-saved. 
After highlighting, I save the file (using a different filename), and now the file change from 4MB to 3MB...  is it just compression?  Or making the images have lower clarity? (thought I cannot see any difference).  What is the reason?  If it is just compression, then why wasn't it done before, as winzip technology is quite mature more than even 10, 12 year ago.
I had some PDF files and just try to open it and do some highlighting using Acrobat 10 (also called Adode Reader X)...
acrobat automatically applies certain optimizations that shrink file size, unless you tell it not to. For example preferences --> general --> "save as optimizes for web view" checkbox.
If you update your question with links to original and updated files I'll try to investigate what exactly led to such reduction of the file size.
