you will need to use "ifconfig -a" to list all available network interfaces - at first you run just an "ifconfig" (without the -a flag), memorize network interfaces that it shows you and then run it again with the -a flag, and find that extra interface. In my case by running just a "ifconfig" I got two interfaces - “enp0s3”, “lo” and when running with “-a” flag I got an extra interface - “enp0s8”. After we got a name of that extra interface name you edit /etc/network/interfaces file and append these two lines there:
Both of the guest os have different ips. I am able to ping host from both guests, guest to guest and guests to host.
0-EDIT: to clarify, my setup is Ubuntu 16.04 running Oracle Virtual Box 5.0.24 Host & Windows7 Guest.
After that change you reboot the machine and now when running “ifconfig” should get a host-only adapter’s IP that you can use to connect from you host machine.
I went to network. Turn on network discovery on the guest machine (Windows Server 2012 R2). I think it will work for other guest OS.
I set the network adapter from NAT to Host-Only and it automatically addressed a new ip to my guest machine. It was 10.0.x.xx and now 192.168..xx.xxx. Then i pinged it from the host and it responded. Hope it helpes someone!
If Mick's settings don't work for you,this may. I followed Mick's settings, but was unable to ping back to the VM Guest in the end. I made one change, and that was to enable the firewall and set to "WORK", instead of disabled. I edited the firewall via  "Allow Programs to communicate through windows firewall", and selected "File and Print Sharing" under Home/Work (Private) profile. I was immediately able to ping my VM Guest from another pc in the LAN. I'm pasting Mick's settings below for clarity and single post help. Thanks Mick!!
I searched 3 days for a solution why I couldn't ping between my windows server 2016 guests on my Virtual Box internal network ... it appears that the firewall is blocking the traffic!
