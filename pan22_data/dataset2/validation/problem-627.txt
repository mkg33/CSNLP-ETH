Unfortunately I don't know of any way to "undo" it, but you can probably leave system files as owned by root and restore all the files in your $HOME to be owned by you (and do the same for all users of the system).  At that point you can fix permissions and/or owner on each file not in your $HOME directory that needs it as it comes up.  Yes this is a pain, but I don't think there's an easy fix.  That is what I would do anyway.
"Not quite" in the sense -- are you sure you were root when you did it and did the command go through to the end? If you've cancelled it, as soon as you saw it, then you might be lucky and the repair may be low. If you weren't root, this command shouldn't have been able to do it, unless you did something like sudo ....
It is also important not to restart the system before checking all the applications running and the user launching them on boot. If you do, some of them may not start properly due to permissions problems.
"Very" in the sense that if the command has indeed gone through, your security is screwed. You now do not know which paths have what owners and who should be allowed to do what.
If your using OSX apple provides a restore feature within Disk Utilities to fix this very problem. If your using a linux distro, I'm fairly certain you'll have to redo all permissions manually. In either case, smack your hands and don't do it again
There is no single remedy to this. If you have a backup, you can restore to it. You might need to check the ownerships in the backup and apply them. If you have been using a rootkit (say rkhunter) checker, it might have a list of the most basic ownerships and possibly be able to fix it. (Not quite likely).
