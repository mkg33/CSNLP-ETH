Also, you can try to use bootrec tool (included on windows, and use with other windows setup) with the option RebuildBCD to try to rebuild. Another way is using EasyBCD. I never tryed these two before, so use with caution and always make a backup of your stuff before doing anything!
So for helping you making it work, if you have any way to resize the partition down, you can install another windows in parallel. This SHOULD make windows detect this Windows 2008 installed on another disk and create a menu entry for it on the new windows. So it would work on the same disk. After that you can edit the bootmanager menu (Open msconfig using execute on  Start Menu) and remove the new windows entry. So you would have a direct boot for your Windows 2008 without the other HDD.
If its only the MBR that is missing, the Windows 7 Master Boot Record recovery would work fine as GRUB does.
On Windows 2008 (As up of Windows XP) sometimes when you install, it creates something like "boot partition" where Windows put all boot related stuff on it. If that is the case, you may have a problem because no aditional space will be available, and it may not work with grub.
