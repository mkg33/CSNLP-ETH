What it the external/WAN IP address of your main router? If it's 192.168.something or 10.something or 172.16-32.something then you'll need to as your provider to put your modem into bridge mode.
But from what I recall, the WRT45G is JUST a router, and there may be yet another device, the one that acts as the "modem" for your connection.  Is there such a device?
Once you know you can get to your outside router on a certain port, yes you will need port forwarding on both in order to reach a host that is behind both.
If so, you may want to talk to your provider about opening up those ports for you - some providers will block things by default unless you need them and ask for them to be opened.  OR, make sure that your modem isn't also being its own router and also in need of port forwarding.
In your situation, I would've suggested one of the routers that allows a separate "guest" network, but you've already bought it, so that's that.
I'm assuming you had the proper IP of the computer you were trying to forward to in those port forwarding settings?
When you are trying to port forward -- and assuming the family router is also the modem, what the ISPs call a "gateway" device (just to confuse things) -- you have to do it with the outside-exposed router to the inside address.  You can't just do it on the inside router (yours) because the traffic will never get to it.
Please note that when you say that your router has the same external IP address, that cannot actually be true.  If you are checking via something like "whatsmyip.com", you're just seeing the external presentation of your home's connection.  But with your router connected to the family router, yours has to have a "wan" address that is within the range of the LAN addresses that the family router hands out.  And you're not really gaining anything by hooking up your router to the other router, except for a separate additional wireless network that isn't buying you anything at all.
