They will be located in the VHD, the virtual hard disk that VMware player uses to boot and run the virtual machine. Extracting it would require you to mount the VHD in Windows. It may be easier to simply share the file with your Windows machine instead.
You need to think of your virtual machine more as an actual physical PC. If you pick up a hard disk, can you see what OS is installed? If you look at your CPU, can you tell what application are running?
Easier than setting up Samba or an FTP server on the Linux VM, why not install VMware Tools? That way you can share a folder between the host OS and guest VM - with the folder actually residing on the host. Save the files you want to access there and you can access them from your host OS.
Which Linux are you running? If you're running Ubuntu, install the vm tools is quick and easy. (I'm on slackware, not so quick and easy but do-able.)
The directory containing your virtual machine will have files that are: configuration information, virtual disk files, log files, snapshot files and some other misc files. Just like looking at a hard disk doesn't tell you what files are on it, you need to do something to see the files in your VM. While VMware does have some built in file sharing methods, you could also just share files as if your virtual machine was another PC on your network. That is, use Samba on Linux.
