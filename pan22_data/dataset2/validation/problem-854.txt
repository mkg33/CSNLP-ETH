The real thing to remember here is that Amazon does not need to turn a profit on this venture. This is another one of Amazons "Loss Leaders" where there goal is too get you to subscribe to Amazon prime and then once you are in their system they can start turning the real profit. 
TL;DR: It's hard to say exactly what Amazon is doing but we can be confident that devs are being well paid whether or not Free Time is independently profitable. 
1) Time Based As you guessed it possible that amazon is paying apps based on how successful they are in time. Although this seems somewhat problematic as it promotes bad design practices where the goal is time sunk into the app instead of fun. This means that a usual system used in other subscription mediums would fall apart here.
2) Commission/Licence Most likely amazon is paying a set amount for access to each game each month, or commissioning specific studios for amazon exclusive titles. This would put them in line with how Netflix runs their subscription model.
We can even run a hypothetical example of the inverse with this very product. So let's say you subscribe to Amazon Music (which is almost certainly losing Amazon money) and to make Amazon Music cheaper you get Amazon Prime. Now that you have prime you say what the heck and get Amazon Free Time, now Amazon is collecting more money from you originally at near no extra cost thanks to the digital nature of Free Time.
3) Some Weird Combination Big tech companies these days love their proprietary algorithms so it's totally possible that in addition to base monthly price they reward any number of things. This could include playtime, how often an app is opened, how much a customer comes back to the app, and other data driven methods. While 2 makes the most sense to me from the lack of information on the subject out there it seems very possible that this is the answer. 
While I'm sure your looking for details it doesn't appear that there are many details about how exactly devs are paid (and it might even be obscure the the devs working on the projects) I can give you some speculation.
