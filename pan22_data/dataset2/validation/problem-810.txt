Am I missing something?  If your goal is a "digital dice" hardware for use with physical games, then no pc is required.  On the other hand, if your goal is a PC game, it already has a perfectly good random number generator, and has no need of your hardware, and even
However, I'd recommend using a micro controller for communication. Something like the Arduino. Many have USB connections and will allow you to interface with your existing circuit with a few changes. Arduino also has plenty of helpful tutorials. Additionally, a micro controller will allow you to easily expand to other types of control inputs and hardware outputs. 
So, assuming this is just a cool science fair project, not a serious attempt to build hardware to be bought, sold, and used, I would think about packaging it as a USB device.
Or you could connect a button and 6 diodes to the port and let the computer do the rolling and lighting.
Parallel port is nice, but hard to find on a modern pc, and windows has made its programming rather difficult since XP or so.
You could do an arms-length integration by using a web cam and image recognition to decide what number was rolled.  Get fancy and call it an "optical air interface" to make it sound official.
FYI this is how those lava lamp random number generators work, so there is good precedent.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand
You'll have to build an additional or different circuit to communicate with the PC. Something you make yourself would likely be over the Parallel port.
