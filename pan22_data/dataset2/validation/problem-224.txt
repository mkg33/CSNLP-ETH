I use DenyHosts to monitor my logs for suspicious SSH traffic, and I have it configured to automatically firewall off hosts at a certain point.
There's nothing here to suggest that your box has been compromised.  Even if your passwords are pretty weak, a dictionary attack that only throws one login attempt at each username is extremely unlikely to succeed.
Non-executable data is probably salvagable, but anything with executable content (this potentially includes such things as MS Office documents and some configuration files) has got to go unless you're willing and able to either manually examine it to ensure that it hasn't been turned hostile or to accept the possibility that it could be hostile and either damage your system or provide an avenue for a future re-compromise if you keep it around.
So that doesn't look good. Now that I know I've been targeted by an attack and that some of my username, password combinations are weak, I'd like to know how can I...
However, if there is other evidence to show that your system has been compromised...  Nuke it from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
If you're only going to do one, monitoring system load is a very effective way of detecting compromise, because most machines when compromised are used to do things like send massive amounts of spam or otherwise receive a lot of traffic.  Perhaps not useful if you're a high-value target and people may be trying to specifically break into you for reasons other than to turn your host into a zombie, but valuable nonetheless.  Plus monitoring load is needed for profiling and to figure out when you need to invest in more hardware or better software.
I recently read an article about analyzing malicious SSH login attempts. This got me thinking, are the SSH username, password combinations on my Debian box that uncommon? Had I been targeted by a brute force dictionary attack? Let's take a look at /var/log/auth.log.0:
Valid login attempts are logged in as well, so if you see a brute force attempt followed by a success, that's a good indication something bad has happened.
You should also do comprehensive log analysis, looking at auth.log and others for things that are unexpected.  Log file analysis is a competitive market and the problem isn't yet solved, but there are free tools like logwatch which can be configured to send you summaries daily.
But, if you know your passwords are weak, then strengthen them!  I personally like pwgen (which is packaged by Debian).  On each run, it generates a large number of strong, but relatively-pronouncable password candidates which (for me at least) are fairly easy to remember, such as yodieCh1, Tai2daci, or Chohcah9.
Note there are a variety of other ways you'd want to monitor your machine to see if it's compromised, including load patterns, login activity, periodic traffic sniffing,  monitoring running processes and open ports, and ensuring file integrity with a tool like tripwire.
