Additionally you can make use of the pst import functionality in Office 365. You can upload all PSTs to Office 365 and then import them to the newly created mailboxes. This way your users can start using their new mailboxes while in the background all their emails are imported.
3) reopening Outlook let the user to use the POP profile (you can set it as default) until you enter in production with exchange online
2) in exch-profile add a new data file (.pst) and select the file of the POP profile (you will have exchange mailbox and local-pop mailbox)
When you will be in production with exchange online set as default the exchange profile (doing so the user will not open the wrong profile) and let the user move from local mailbox to exchange all the messages he wants/needs without downtime

My suggestion will not cover the user migration process because it may vary from hoster to hoster (reading your question I suppose you are evaluating BPOS).
