So, depending on the equipment, probably you want to size circuits to either have non-critical stuff on them or make sure that they're under 80% under all scenarios.
Also there are "80%" and "100%" circuit breakers.  A 80% CB may blow if you are over 80% load for more than 3 hours.  I've also been told that circuit breakers aren't typically tested as though they're precision devices - they don't go through a test suite where it passes QA if it can run at 99% of the rated load and blows at 100% of the rated load.  Instead, they're tested such that they pass if they don't blow at 80% load and do blow at 100% load, and what happens in between is ... undefined.
I'm not an electrician and certainly shouldn't be considered as an authority on such matters, but I'll jump in anyhow.
Another issue is that you may be at 82% of max load now, but what if the DC is really hot?  Often servers have fans that change speed depending on temperature -- and when they spin faster they'll draw more power, so now instead of 82% of max load you're at 88% of max load.  When things go wrong they tend to go wrong in surprising and unexpected ways.
There are different kinds of circuit breakers (thermal, thermal magnetic, others).  They behave differently under different types of loads.  (I've seen sketchy welders that draw 22A that don't blow a residential 15A circuit because it only ran for short bursts, for instance).
