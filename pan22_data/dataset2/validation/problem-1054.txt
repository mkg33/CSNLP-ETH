I modified my 2950 as follows. I pulled the SAS controller, Backplane, all cables associated with. Then added 4 port SATA controller in PCIe riser. Ran sata cables to front and attached to drives. ( have to move drives to sata position to get room for cables from fans) Tapped power from old backplane board connector (20 pin molex connector) which has +3,+5 and +12. Made my own Sata power harnes out of sata connectors. The system screams. Using NOVABENCH it scored 1106 without the Graphics check. NOTE: my system has 32gb ram and 2 3ghz CPUs.
For the application we used these drives for this was acceptable, but there are definitely applications and data that we would not be comfortable with a similar situation.
With the supported drives (that were smaller) everything worked fine.  We contacted the server/raid manufacturer and the issue may be addressed in a future firmware update to the RAID, but we aren't sure.
The hard drives that you purchase from Dell are no different from those purchased from Newegg/CDW/etc. The only difference is that if you purchase from Dell, your likelihood of being able to make a warranty claim on the drive is much higher than if purchased elsewhere.
I used some unsupported SATA drives in a RAID enclosure and while they work, we have issues booting the server sometimes.  When the server boots, the RAID initializes and sometimes not all of the drives turn on.  It usually requires a cold boot and then a warm reboot (or two) to get it going.  Which drive(s) don't turn on is pretty random.  Has been as many as 3 that don't turn on initially.
So really it depends on how important the service and data is that are relying on those drives.  What kind of compatibility and support requirements do you have?
