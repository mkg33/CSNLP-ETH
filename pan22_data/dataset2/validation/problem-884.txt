Is this possible? e.g. see screenshot link below, I just want my client to see/access Transcript folder, nothing else. http://i.stack.imgur.com/kEHfW.png
One approach: The 'match' feature in sshd_config allows you to specify rules based on group membership or username.
Now their need is when user login to sftp server either via winscp or some other client, they should be able to see only their own folders in home directory, the other folders should not be visible to them. Also in their home directories they should not see any files or folder which start with dot(.).
Thanks everyone, finally this link helped me to achieve my task. http://rmtheis.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/setting-up-an-sftp-site-on-amazon-web-services-ec2-creating-an-account-to-share-with-a-third-party-and-restricting-that-account-to-allow-only-sftp/
The display of hidden folders is a client-side issue and not something you can really influence server-side. 
My client needed sftp server for sharing files, so I created sftp server on a amazon ec2 ubuntu machine and added different users.
