If you're just mapping drives, why not just use a script w/ credentials stored in the script to map the drives:
I visit a number of different Customer sites each week, and I prefer not to join my personal machine to any of my Customers' domains (to not have thier group policy apply, etc).
Sounds like a really bad idea to join customer domains with equipment that isn't owned by the customer. That sort of thing has been a serious security policy violation at every employer that I have worked for.
Have you considered using VMs for this purpose? Create a VM for each of the domains and switch between them on demand.
The simple answer is that you cannot. A machine can only be in one domain at a time. The Microsoft way to deal with this would be for you to have your own domain, and for each of these other domains to trust yours. Good luck convincing your customers to do this, even for one-way trust.
I'm an independent contractor with domain accounts at multiple client locations. I do my development work on a laptop and would like to be able to join the domain at each site. Under Windows XP I joined one domain and mapped drives/VNC'ed into the others. There are two that I visit at least once a week, so I would like a painless way to switch between the two. Anyone know how to do this in Windows 7 Pro?
