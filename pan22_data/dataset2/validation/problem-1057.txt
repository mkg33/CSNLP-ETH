There are a limited set of TLDs defined and recognized by IANA consisting of every two-letter country code and certain names with three or more letters. Originally, the generic names were just .gov, .com, .net, .org, .edu, and .mil (along with .arpa for historical reasons, as well as defined unassigned names such as .test and .example).
Which should you select?  The one or ones that best fit your site's purpose and content. Pragmatically, if you pick anything other than COM or NET, you will probably want to consider also capturing the same name in COM and/or NET to prevent user confusion.
First, a nitpick: The .com part of a domain name is called the "top level domain" or TLD, not "extension".
I can't ever remember deliberately going to a .biz or a .info, so if you're looking for TLDs to avoid, they'd be right at the top of my list.  And probably .cn should be avoided, too, since when I see that I immediately assume spam.  That last one might be different if I actually read chinese, but assuming your site will be in english, that pretty much leaves .com or some sort of clever name/country TLD.
I'd say that the conventions as initially planned are mostly ignored. Originally .cx was meant for sites in the Christmas islands! And .com for commercial entities.  
In the long run, the idea is that organizations would pick the best name and stick to it, and end users would be educated that not everything ends in COM. 
Avoid any of the ones spammers seem to love. For instance I tend to be dubious of anything ending in .biz
Recently, the TLD name space was expanded with the names .biz, .info, and .name among others, and a mechanism was created for sponsoring organization to apply for and create additional names. A complete list with notes can be found at Wikipedia, and IANA maintains the official list.
Well .net would be the next major one you would want to grab. .org is suppost to only be for non-profit type organizations, so keep that in mind.  When I bought a domain, I just bought the main 3 you mentioned. .com .net and .org.
