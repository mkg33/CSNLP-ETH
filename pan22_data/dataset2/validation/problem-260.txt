What Jeroo doesn't have is variables. You can't do things like loop 5 times. You can only loop or if while a Jeroo hasFlower(), isFacing(EAST), or something like that. 
Yes. Programming languages that don't have variables still have conditional branching. The paradigm is called "functional programming".
They're not directly using variables, although they're using boolean conditions. I've found that starting with methods like hasFlower() makes the idea of x == 2 easier to wrap their heads around when we get to it.

We only spend a few days in Jeroo because students start to get frustrated with what it can't do. You can't tell a Jeroo to loop a set number of times. You can't ask a Jeroo what column or row they're at. You can't ask them how many flowers they have. Any of those frustrations work really well as a hook into why variables are useful. 
The first 6 or 8 days of the year we work in Jeroo instead of straight Java (there's a Python mode as well). It serves as a very quick introduction to syntax, ifs, and while loops. I've found it helps when I can go back later in the year with "remember in Jeroo when..."
