Since you only get dot-names (and not MIB-defined object names) in the response, snmpwalk probably guesstimates what the object type is.
So, I'm wondering whos fault is this? Does the remote device send the variable's type in responce? Or snmpwalk has to guess the type?
As you can see some variables are of a STRING type, others are Hex-STRING. The correct output would only have Hex-STRING types.
You can pass snmpcmd options to snmpwalk such as -Oa or -Ox to force variables not having a display hint to be interpreted as ASCII or hex respectively; or you can use -d to dump the raw packets. The explanatory text for -Ih is quite informative, too:
The best place to find fine detail on the SNMP standard is of course the relevant RFCs; the O'Reilly book Essential SNMP is probably worth a read, too.
This mailing list post explains things; per RFC 2579, MIBs can contain a DISPLAY-HINT in their definition of variables. This defines how the data might be displayed; e.g. as a number to 2 decimal places, an ASCII string, etc.
