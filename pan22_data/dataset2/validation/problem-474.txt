I need to find out if a disk is IDE or SATA (or anything else, maybe). I know that the device is /dev/sda, so I think it's SATA, but I don't know if I can be sure just by the name. I tried looking at dmesg and it always says "SCSI", but I'm sure it's not...
One pretty reliable method is to use lshw to lookup the model number and then to lookup the model number on Google to see what type of device it is.  This method doesn't work if the drive is in a USB enclosure, some USB controllers hide the HD info from you.
MadHatter is right in that the designation difference would be /dev/hdx versus /dev/sdx. But the surest way is to open the case and look at the cable. You don't necessarily need to shut off the machine to do that, depending on the system you're looking at and what kind of tangled nest of cables you have around the case.
smartctl -a /dev/sda which will produce a lot of information including manufacturer and model number; cross-referencing that on the manufacturer's website is usually fairly simple.
You cannot rely on /dev/hd for PATA drives.  For modern systems all PATA/SATA drives will show up as /dev/sd because the new ATA layer uses the sd prefix.  You will only see /dev/hd if your OS uses the old deprecated ATA drivers.
If the system can be rebooted you could use the Ultimate Boot CD to run a hard disk diagnostic, they normally identify the drive type and model. Even the BIOS might tell you at reboot what kind of drive it is.
