Because I use this setup at work, I immediately think of a digital signage solution - a free one (budgets are tight at work) which works well enough with elderly or cheap hardware  - specifically Concerto (not associated other than as a user.)
There are plenty of non-free "digital signage" solutions, but they are very non-free, so unless your budget for this is higher than one would expect for a home project, probably not an option. But if you are a high-budget operation, there's plenty of options.
It has all 4 of your points, in some way, but how you'd be able to do 1 & 2 on the stock software is probably not what you are thinking of, at a guess. But there are ways to do those things - I just suspect you are looking for a method which allows more manipulation based on them than I'm aware of being built in. You could of course, write something that does what you want and submit it to the project, but that assumes that you want to get under the hood.
That assumes you are willing to use a "digital picture frame" that will run Debian (well, some folks run other systems - I find Debian the least trouble) which won't (as far as I know) be an off-the-shelf DPF. But it can be a display connected to a Pi, or to a computer that is past updates (though there you have to be careful, as if you get too old the power bill will be enough to afford something newer and less power hungry.) Some tablets would also work, I believe. The machines speced at http://www.concerto-signage.org/deploy are all far above what I actually use in production (I don't run their "Player" - I just have a browser in kiosk mode running.)
