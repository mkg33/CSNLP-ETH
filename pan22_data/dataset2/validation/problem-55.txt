I don't have first-hand experience of the engine itself, but it definitely sounds like it's worth some experimentation.
Personally, I would recommend Unity. In comparison to Torque I've been able to get basic proofs-of-concepts running far faster than before. (Of course, there is a bit of bias as I was far younger when experimenting with Torque)
You might want to take a look at this tread on the Unity forums.  There's also someone working on an RTS "starter kit" but I can't remember who.
But in general, it's been a far more pleasing experience to work with. Also in comparison to what I remember from the community at Garage Games, the Unity community is far more available to help with issues that my arise.
My Digital Media friends are currently using Unity for their game development. They seem to like it because it makes it relatively simple to add and use custom 3D objects and the script is rather easy to handle( none of them like programming, but they seem to be doing an OK job at learning the scripting in a semester's time ).
I would add one disclaimer before you rush in though. Unity has an awful GUI system. Everyone I know who is using Unity in a professional capacity has had to buy a GUI system (I believe NGUI is a popular choice). RTS games often have a lot of UI elements and precious little of the stuff that Unity make easy (things like Physics, particles etc.).
