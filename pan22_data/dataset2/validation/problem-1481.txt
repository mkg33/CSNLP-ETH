The choice of using spreadsheets to teach programming itself is kind of baffling for me. I would rather you use of the several online ways to teach coding, which are much more useful. 
If these are first years, and I was a first year, I don't want to see Excel sheets. Spreadsheets make command line look like an attractive neighbour. 
My personal experience of using Excel as catalyst was really good one and I think using an user-friendly/easier IDE like Visual Studio with Excel is worth a try
If online is not an option and you want something simple, a straight forward combination of Visual Studio Code and GCC Compiler (which is probably already there on the machine) would be a good option. 
Using Excel alone can make students thinking in terms of sheets/tables which can make them picking the concepts of arrays,etc. pretty tough later on and even if you go in some depth of Excel functions, still I don't feel its worth an entire course (even to learn programming). 
I got a chance to teach Introduction to Computing & Programming course to Chemical Engineering entry students and their syllabus included both Programming concepts & Excel. I began the course with just Algorithms and after 4 weeks, switched to Excel & then on programming. Off course they are different to your target audience a bit but I found Excel('s functions) pretty helpful for them to comprehend the syntax (after a couple of weeks of Excel, I switched to Visual C++), so the pros you mentioned are really there.
