That being said, I agree with Ben S. If the only choice is sqlite (which I hope it isn't), NFS is the way go to. But a real DBMS is a much better choice.
I am helping in setting up a web service in which user data will be stored in sqlite databases on a server running perhaps Samba, and one or more web servers will read and write to those databases on the backend. I would like advice as to which network file system to use in an all-linux environment, as well as any other thoughts
This really is not what sqlite is for. It is possible but a much more robust system (and easier to maintain) would be a simple mysql installation instead of an entire fileserver.
so, be very careful!  NFS in particular is well known not to follow POSIX behavior, especially about atomicity.
NFS is probably your best bet. NFS is pretty configurable and will likely prove to be the best tool for the job. If you have any Windows in the mix, CIFS (Samba) is the way to go, but in an all-linux environment, NFS.
I'd suggest a real multi-user database. SQLite is the best choice for single-user apps, not multiple servers.
