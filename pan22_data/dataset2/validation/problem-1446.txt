If you choose to use clockwise/counterclockwise movement, there are a number of things you can do to make the system easier to intuit for your players.
If you are free to use the mouse you could always use mouse clicks to move around. Clicking on a location will cause the player to move towards that point and it will automatically choose the shortest direction. Circles are "clicks" and arrows are shortest direction.
1) How I would approach this would take sections of the planet: the top, left, right, and bottom sides (more if desirable). And have it so after the user presses a direction, the character will keep going that direction till they release that button. So if the character was on the left side and the user pressed up, then the character would go clock-wise till release. This way you don't have to worry about changes in the frame of reference while the character is moving, only after.
If the character is half blue and half red, then orientation becomes easy for players to remember.  Instead of having to identify "clockwise" or "counterclockwise", the players either move in the blue direction or the red direction.  If the character is always facing in one direction (preferably clockwise, so that movement is most intuitive while upright) it's even better, because English speakers (and anyone else with a left-to-right language) naturally tend to associate 'right' with 'forward', reinforcing the connection between the controls and the direction of movement.
I assume that Nintendo invested quite some research in getting the game play as smooth as possible and this is what they settled upon. I always like to look to what the bigger companies figured out, hoping they invested something in R&D for maximum comfort and playability.
Use A/D to move the character in the direction towards the leftmost / rightmost point of the planet, respectively, and W/S to move the character towards the topmost / bottommost points.
You might wish to "movement blur"  the universe when moving so it looks more natural and the eyes won't focus on the moving parts shifting positions.
Another way would be to change the way your game moves. Instead of moving the player when they are on a planet you could rotate the planet instead. This is also a very common choice but it can be disorienting if you have multiple planets on screen since everything except the player will have to rotate. If you decide to use this method it could help to only display a part of the planet to reduce the amount of moving objects your eye has to keep track of:
Additionally, a circular W-A-S-D or W-D-S-A pattern of input results in circumnavigation of the planet, which seems fairly intuitive.
At short movements the reference frame stays the same, the universe doesn't move, get beyond a certain threshold the universe moves along/shifts along so the reference frame is back in the middle.
Holding down more than one key could just cause the most-recently-pressed key to take precedence, or you could use more complex behavior such as having eight limiting points.
My first suggestion would be to just stick with A = Counter-clockwise and D = Clockwise movement. It is not very confusing and is pretty much the "standard" (i.e. most common) choice when it comes to orbital movement like this.
As an added bonus it's also very easy to translate to Mobile controls if you wish to publish your game as an app as well.
As long as you are moving your character, it's easy to maintain what orientation your controls are in.  After all, continuing to move in the direction you are moving in doesn't take any action at all, and when you want to reverse your movement, there's only one other key to choose.  It's only when you start moving again after having stopped that you are faced with a choice.  The longer you pause, the harder it will be to pick up again based on what you were doing before.  By reducing pause frequency and pause lengths you can keep players from forgetting how to move.
3) How you have it designed now. It can get a little getting use too but nothing players haven't seen before. You could edit it though so it appears the planet is rotating instead so the play is always "on top".
The game could either keep going in the same clock direction while the key is held down, or stop the character at the limiting point. If it stops, it doesn't seem like a big problem -- the player has a full quadrant in which to change their input if they want to keep going in the same clock direction.
2) Another way would like how "Lovers in dangerous space-time" approach it. With a joystick, rather than have the frame of reference depending on the surface, they have it so the angle the joy-stick was the desired spot for "character" to stop at. So their frame of reference was at the center of their "planet". I say character and planet but they had modular ship parts on the outside where you determine where they go, ie which direction the thrusters are pointed to move the ship.
In this way, the player is always moving the character in the same direction as the input movement -- e.g. D always moves right, S always moves down, regardless of the character's position.
