No. You dont own anyxthing - noone does. IP ddresses are not owned, they are assigned like a rental car. That said, a C network is NEVER assigned to someone - RIPE's smallest block that one can get assigned is 4096 IP Addresses. You got a C network from your provider for use with them. YOu kill your provider - the C network gets back to the provider, much as you return a car from a rental agency when you end the rental.
That pretty much is it - no way. You can route whatever you want, but unless the ISP supports it this is like trying to order a mercedes by calling a pizza service - it will get you nowhere.
What you route through YOUR router is totally irrelevant unless the ISP forwards the packets fourther.
Technically, I don't see that it would be a problem. I suggest talking to your service manager about your needs for routing to your own /24 over whatever infrastructure your new ISP will hook you up to.
Routing an IP network needs to be done through BGP protocol. So either your ISP let you announce BGP routes yourself, or the ISP does it for you.
There is a way to do this.  You have to have a very cooperative ISP (in addition to Comcast) and, at least in my case, a colocated system there.  The company (Linkline) added my /24 to their BGP table and pointed it at my colocated system, which knows how to route packets for (part of) that network over a VPN link to my system that sits behind a Verizon FIOS connection.  I've been using this setup for over three years now and it works, although I certainly don't recommend it for high-volume or low-latency applications.  I use it for incoming email and ssh, primarily, and a couple of other things.
