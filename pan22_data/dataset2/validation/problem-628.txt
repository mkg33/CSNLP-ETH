If you absolutely must have acme.local go to your website, you could edit the default.htm in your DC/DNS Server's Default Website in IIS and put in a meta refresh tag or do a permanent redirect (301) as such in IIS 6 (I think IIS 7 is the same):
Is the domain in question your Active Directory domain (i.e. acme.local)?  If yes, there's a reason why that resolves to your DC/DNS server and should stay that way.  
About the problem, x.y is your ACTUAL DOMAIN, so any query asks for x.y domain, always {should} go(es) to your AD's DNS, and because of the AD behaviour, it will resolve to the address of DC and you'll get that DC's IP adress ;) ( this will be more and more annoying when you have multiple DCs, because there's a very good chance to get different IPs {which will be that DCs ;) } ) And there it comes the 3rd mistake: Entering a host record "www" to DC's DNS that faces to outside... When a www.x.y query comes, DC's DNS will resolve that corretly, but, IT IS your DC! Your hearth, your center point! ( this is connected to second mistake i mentioned above ) And of course, semanticly, you'll want to query x.y to get your web server but no, what will return to you is your DC...
Second mistake is using AD's DNS as your outgoing DNS... Always use another configured DNS server which faces the internet, and to achieve that you should name your domains differently ;) And configure that outsider DNS to relay internal queries to AD's DNS... ( redirect x.y.local to IP(a.b.c.d) )
if i try the website with "www" it will work and go to the iis server xxx.xxx.xxx.174 but without the "www" it will go to the xxx.xxx.xxx.175 (the active directory and dns of the network) and becuase that there is no iis website set on it it will show iis under construction error.
About the solution, you'll have to configure the IIS on that DC and redirect your default site to your actual web server ( www.x.y ) ( like "gravyface" explained ) unless you dont want to deploy a second DNS server to your network to achieve this Front-end Back-end acrhitecture...
The easy solution is to put a redirecting site in the IIS root that redirects all traffic to "www.domain.co.il". 
First mistake is naming your outgoing domain same as internal domain. You can simply make them seperate ;) Like outgoing: something.com and internal: something.pvt or something.com.local. Just differ your name ;)
Having said that, you can certainly create as many A records as you want internally in DNS on your domain: i.e. if it's an intranet there's no reason why you can't create intranet A xx.xx.xx.174 and have www.acme.local as a CNAME to 'intranet'.
