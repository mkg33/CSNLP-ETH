I looked into apache, lighttpd, nginx, and cherokee, but I am not sure which one would be my best option as a load balancer.
I know your question specifically pertains to load balancing web servers, but I can't help but mention Squid for load balancing. I assume that you have multiple servers since you discuss load balancing, so I would highly advise you look into dedicating a box to Squid. It even has a neat round robin function to load balance evenly across your servers. Placing a group of servers running something like nginx behind a squid box would be a pretty powerful solution...
If you don't want to use Apache, Nginx or Cherokee. Cherokee is relatively new but looks promising, and Nginx is proven.
I was wondering which is the best webserver that would be able to server static content with the highest performance, and also is able to perform load balancing.
I can't judge your's but there are more places where things go ugly because of missing knowledge than suboptimal choice of static file server.
Their core function is to loadbalance and serve static files with the highest performance possibly across different geographic locations.
Here's another option for you - since its just static files, have you considered using a content delivery network (CDN) like Amazon CloudFront?
As others have mentioned, its not advisable to use a webserver as a load balancer when you could use a load balancer as a load balancer :)
