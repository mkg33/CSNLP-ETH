The easiest and most common solution would be to take a live snapshot of the VM (fsfreeze/flush/use the qemu-ga to maintain fs consistency before taking the snapshot), back up the underlying image, while the VM writes to the snapshot, and then merge the two when the backup is complete. 
If you are using LVM for the VM's storage you can also use LVM snapshots, wich are quick and not disruptive. This has the disadventage of not having the VM's RAM into account so it MIGHT have invalid data on any point in time.
So where question is, is there a way to do full VM backups that can be done consistently without freezing the VM and restore of backup should work aswell :)
I Found several ready scripts which i have tested, but they all either stop or "freeze" the VM for a little while, to save memory state. But this is no good for us.
We have few custom application that write logs, that need to be consistent and we cannot have 10-60second pauses while system is "freezed" for the duration of backups, also this "freeze" causes the VM's clock to be out of sync ( clock is behind by the duration of the "freeze) which in term messes with our custom sofware, where one of its functions is to monitor some measuring equipments timestamps.
I'm trying to setup a KVM backup solution for our servers that would take live backups without stopping the system.
I'd go with a different approach: instead of saving the whole VM's state, I'd keep a pristine image of a freshly installed VM just in case, and do routine backups of the data I'm interested to keep safe. The specific techique to do such a backup depends on the tools you are using (MySQL? InfluxDB?).
