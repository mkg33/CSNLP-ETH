Piriform makes a program called Recuva, I have recovered some deleted files I thought were gone. It might work for you.  In the future I would encourage(force) employees to use a network location with backup on it rather then letting them store information like that in a non-company cloud
In any case, do not use your computer as new data might be overwriten on the lost ones which will make harder to recover the lost data. If you want to continue using your computer, then take image of your hard-disk, so that you can continue using your desktop or if you try to recover the data by yourself, you can attempt to recover data from the image file which will ensure that your PC's file system will not be damaged . You can use Winhex to take the image and it also provides data-recovery options. but it is a basic program. More professional (and commercial) tools would be EnCase, Forensic Toolkit, DMZ F.I.R.E., Maresware
Well, we had an emplyee who used to store all of his business accounts in Dropbox. Now he left our company turned off the sync and uninstalled dropbox so all of his files went poof! His Dropbox account was not registered to his work email so we can't access the account. Now, we all are trying to recover those files, we tried Pandora Recovery but no success.
You could also try data recovery service provided by the harddrive manufacture's data recovery service. I know Seagate does this.
2) If your ex employee would not provide the log-in info. Then you can recover the data even if they are deleted and new data is overwritten on the old ones. However, the digital forensics may not be easy if you are new on it. Then I would strongly suggest you to contact with companies that does data-recovery, I think it would be the easiest option so that they can recover all lost file as they use good tools. It is even possible to recover the data with a professional tools even your hard disk is physically crashed. If you do Google search, you should see the available companies as Google provides result (or ads) considering your location.
If the data is really vital, and for some reason you are not able to get hold of your ex-employee, I suggest you go for professional data recovery service like SalvageData Recovery.
But as I said it would save you from a lot trouble if you contact with a company which does data-recovery.
