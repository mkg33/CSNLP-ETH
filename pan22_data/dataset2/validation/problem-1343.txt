The SM Bus is going to be you chipset.  You want to get the most current chipset drivers, basically three of the 4 listed under the chipset section.  Skip UTIL_WIN_R304257.EXE
Then under Network get NIC_DRVR_WIN_A01_R294111.EXE unless you sprang for the intel card.  Once you have those guys knocked out you should be clean.  But if anything else still lacks just go to Devman, then the properties of the device then to the details tab.  Then drop the selector to Hardware IDs and then just copy the stuff you see below into a Google and that will likely find the correct component so you then know what driver you still need.  The Broadcom USH COULD come into it but I think that will be knocked out along with the SMS Bus.
The Dell Latitude E6320 comes with one of 3 wifi cards.  My machine came with an Intel N 6205.  I downloaded the Intel WiFi Link 6205 drivers from the Dell site and everything works fine now.
The R308494.exe also worked for Windows 8 Pro 64-BIT system, you can find it here: http://ftp.dell.com/security/ it did prompted for an update, didn't run it yet.
Install your chipset and Intel AMT drivers, restart the PC then tell me what is missing in Device Manager. Install chipset first, then AMT
These are a pain the ass.  More than likely the Broadcom USH is NOT your issue.  The free fall sensor more than likely is.  I wouldn't even attempt to install the control point.  Worst piece of digital filth joke ware I've ever come across.
Then go back to the APPLICATIONS section and get this one for the sensor ST-MICROELECTRONICS_FREE-FAL_A10_R309372.exe (5MB)
In my case a file named Dell_ControlVault_A08_R308494.exe helped with 'Broadcom USH' and ST-MICROELECTRONICS_FREE-FAL_A10_R309372.exe (fall sensor) helped with 'Unknown device' (I had to install it even that the fall sensor was switched off in BIOS).
