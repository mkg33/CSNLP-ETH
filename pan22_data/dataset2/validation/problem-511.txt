The only outbound port your software can rely on for "phoning home" or contacting other servers  is port 80. And not only the port, but the protocol has to be HTTP. Some firewalls allow port 80, but they also inspect the protocol and block it if it is not HTTP.   You can also rely on 443, HTTPS.  Still, I would provide an alternative installation/registration workflow which works if there is no port 80 connection. 
If you're just sending email on behalf of an end-user, who originates the email within your application, use authenticated SMTP to port 587.
I am building an application that will be acting as a combined MUA/MTA on different networks. However, many of the networks are with ISP's that block port 25 for SMTP. Therefore I would also like to open up a secondary port so that some of the installs can communicate on that if port 25 is closed.
That being said, of course you can ship software that sends mail, and that uses port 25. However, that mail should go to an SMTP server which is configured by the user. (Quite often, a relay provided by their ISP, which may require authentication.)
For outgoing port 25, you'll need to specify a smtp gateway anyway, especially if the IP is listed in spamhaus's PBL list -- even if your mail makes it out, it will almost certainly be blacklisted by most remote mail servers.
You can pick any port you want, as long as you're building a closed private e-mail system and the MTA's all know to use that port to communicate with each other, as long as you stay consistent. If you need this system to communicate to the outside world though, at least one of your MTA's will have to use destination port 25 to relay, or use a trusted relay to get out to the rest of the world.
ISP's block outgoing 25 because it's used by spammers to directly contact mail servers from subscriber lines and deliver spam.
But the bigger problem is that all the mail software out there will expect to connect to port 25.   The mail exchange (MX) DNS record does not include a port number; it resolves to a host.
Your question is not 100% clear to me. Are you looking to have incoming port 25 connections, or are you connecting 25 outbound?   I will split the answer into two to cover both bases.
How do I choose a second port? I know some people use port 26 or port 2525. What is the correct way to choose a port that won't interfere with existing software?
As long as you pick something in the high port range, and it's something you can remember, this is fine.
Those people will need a workaround, ranging from changing their subscription, changing to another ISP, or using some machine in some other network as a port-forwarding proxy which forwards port 25 connections to the real server, using some port that is open.
My plug for DNSMadeEasy: Comcast blocked port 25 on me unannounced, killing my mail server. After reviewing the rerouting options, I chose DNS Made Easy. (EasyDNS in Canada, DNSExit raised prices, DYN ridiculously expensive). DNS Made Easy had me back up in under 10 minutes, and that’s with manual MX Record entries. They also responded very promptly to a silly question I had because I was rushed and didn’t hit the little blue “i” info button. They have a essentially infinite 1 GB buffer and my mail server is a lot more robust to downtime now that I'm using this rerouting service.
You can send mail to some servers via the SMTPS port 465, if the remote MTA is SSL/TLS-enabled and listening on that port, but don't count on it.
An application that is going to act as a mail server for a domain will generally not be deployable by users who cannot have incoming port 25 open.
For incoming 25, you can use one the many smtp rerouting services, provided because many ISPs block port 25. See this post: http://thenubbyadmin.com/2010/06/14/list-of-inbound-smtp-redirection-services-some-for-free/.
If by "installs communicate on port 25", you mean that the software installation tries to contact other servers using port 25, that is a bad idea. Do not ship software that calls out on port 25.
