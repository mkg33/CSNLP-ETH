On a Mac, the --max-depth option is supplanted by -d [depth].  So, to see a human readable listing of your root drive plus 2 levels deep use the following:
I have tried with du but I only get the size of the directories I specify (du . ./f1), and ls doesn't show the size of the folders.
You can ignore more folders by adding --exclude=blah. You can also specify several folders at once (ie gdu folder1 folder2 ...), and in that case, you can combine all the subtotals into a single size using option c.
On Mac, you can install the GNU (Linux) implementation of du with Homebrew (brew install coreutils). 
Note:  this command will expose the top two directory levels off your root.  This includes traversing one level into your Volumes, and will list the summary sizes of each top-level directory in each of your attached volumes.  Depending on what you have attached, this command could take some time to complete.
Building on the accepted answer, this command will show you the sizes of the folders in the directory, and will also list them by size for you to interpret easier:
