Most hardware firewalls are linux boxes.  It doesn't matter which is used - what matters is who implemented the linux build, and how good they are at it.  A dedicated hardware box probably has more time and effort spent on making the build secure, and it's probably flashed into the device so it's a bit harder to hack and change remotely, but beyond that there's no practical difference.
Yes.  The ONLY downside is a little less performance on your machine.  The upside is that if someone manages to break into ANOTHER machine on the inside of the hardware firewall, then you still have some amount of protection from bad traffic inside the data center.
I would recommend installing a software firewall like iptables on the servers whether or not you have a hardware firewall.  The more layers of protection you have, whether to provide more walls for an attacker or to provide more places that someone would have to do something silly to allow an attacker in, the better.
If you are safeguarding a lot of money, or something of equal value, then yeah, I would have some layers of defense, and a 2nd firewall might provide at least a cod-piece token offering in this regard.
I know, this is a bit off-topic, but I am going to tell you this: as for the security of your servers, do NOT be afraid of iptables. I don't know if ubuntu has some helper tool for dealing with iptables, but I would say, avoid it at all costs. Understanding how chain traversal works in iptables takes no time whatsoever, and closing down access to your server from certain addresses or setting up simple NAT takes as much as a few (extremely well defined) shell commands after that.
Ideally the network is setup such that this cannot happen, but that's more expensive and difficult to maintain well, so you can't always depend on that.
At the same time, I don't trust the colo's network either. Use the software firewall to control who can ssh in and expose a minimum profile to other hosts in the colo provider's network.
As for the "dedicated firewall box" - for some reason people tend to think, that it should best be a "hardware firewall" (like the used-to-be-oh-so-popular PIX), which makes no sense to me, because it is not some "magic box", it is for all intents and purposes a PC, running some specialized software. If you get your hands on such a device (PIX, ASA or whatever equivalent of those), good for you, but you still need a professional to set it up, it doesn't "just work". Best thing to do will be to set up a dedicated linux (or bsd, its down to preference, really) box just for that. You will, of course, still need someone to help you with hardware and software - depending on the complexity of the firewall setup you are looking for.
I am going to side with Adam Davis here and say, that the best solution would be the mixture of both - you should set up a box serving as a dedicated firewall and screen the connections  on the servers themselves, that is how we do it anyway. It takes next to none effort to restrict the exposure of the servers only to addresses, that you trust (takes a few entries in iptables). 
If it's a one-or-the-other choice, then generally yes.  Let the professionals who focus on this work take care of this for you.
That said, I would generally prefer to have both a software and a hardware firewall.  There's a real issue though, if it's a managed firewall, of the skill and responsiveness of the firewall provider.  If it takes them a week to open a port and you lose a customer because of it, was it worth it?  The vendor you are evaluating may be awesome, this is just a consideration I would have.
If you have good experience with managing firewalls and network routing, then there's no reason to believe that a service would do better.   If you don't want to hassle with it, then let them deal with it.
This is a function of the complexity of your firewall and routing.  The linux box can pretty much function as a dedicated low-end router, allowing you do to address rewrites, class-based queues, port rewrites, etc.
In an internal, "trusted" (your version of "trusted" may vary) network, I would avoid using software firewalls, and instead utilize your network infrastructure to implement communications controls.
Is a dedicated firewall, managed by professionals, a better solution than whatever I can manage with software?
In your case, I'd recommend using the colocation facility's firewall to protect you from the outside world, as it is presumably managed by professional networking people who know what they are doing. Also, you save your machines from dealing with DoS attacks, and other internet nuisances.
Not only is it overkill, but under certain circumstances, it can lead to other issues (packet loss, unidirectional pack transmits, etc.)
