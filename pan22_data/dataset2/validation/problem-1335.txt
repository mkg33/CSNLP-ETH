Note: After step 4, my VM forced me to login to the workstation again. Strangely, my Cisco session was not disconnected. There may be some Cisco configuration that may disconnect in this circumstance and cripple this workaround.
I have considered connecting via RDP to the VM instead of using the VPN Client, but one of my VMs is primarily used to connect via VPN to another network, and when I tried to RDP into that machine and then connect to the VPN (using Cisco AnyConnect), I got an error saying I could not connect to the VPN through an RDP session).
You can paste text into the virtual machine (Clipboard -> Type Clipboard Text). It should work with Ctrl+V but it regularly doesn't for some reason. 
For your specific case of wanting to RDP, then connect through VPN, you might try adding another NIC to the VM and using one for VPN and one for RDP.
I use Hyper-V on a development machine for multiple reasons and one of my biggest annoyances is that I can't cut and paste to/from the virtual machines.
What is annoying is that the Hyper-V manager and SCVMM say they use RDP to connect to the VMs so it should work. Although so should the mouse integration before installing the integration services but that doesn't either.
I've been through all the options and can't find anything that seems like it would allow this.  Does anyone have any good solutions?
Easiest solution is to close the VM window and login with Remote Desktop.  Clipboard sync works correctly thru RDP.
