I've had a look for an add-on to do this but the problem is the terms bookmark, folder and organise are too general.
The search box in the bookmarks bar only searches the bookmarks themselves, yet I have arranged the bookmarks into folders and subfolders. Sometimes I can't see the folder that I know I have, so I would like to do a search for it. Even if I find a bookmark that I have, onces it comes up as a result of a bookmark search, there's no way of finding out what folder it is contained within so I can get the other bookmarks - I'd like a similar function to Open Containing Folder.
I wonder how that's not a problem to a lot more people. I also use Go to parent folder extensions which helps a lot but doesn't solve the problem.
I'm one of those that like to tweak my folder hierarchy, so the lack of a 'folder' search in FireFox is a real problem and troubled me for years.  
I also have the same longstanding problem. When the bookmarks wast only a html file, I used to put a link to it as a bookmark, open it in the browser and then search it through there. That way I could easily search the folder names, etc. 
I used my Windows XP computer. I used Xmarks to sync my bookmarks between Firefox and IE. In file Explorer, search in the folder C:\Documents and Settings\yourusername\Favorites for your target folder. You will find the folder that you are looking for.
I've been missing that feature as well. These two addons, if used together, help a lot - still they don't solve the problem of not being able to search for folder names.
