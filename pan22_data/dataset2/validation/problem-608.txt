Not quite a solution to the actual problem at hand, but it is quirks like this that cause me to always buy my SSL certs from Thawte.  
Looking around the web, it seems that others have experienced this issue as well (http://blog.boxedice.com/2009/05/11/godaddy-ssl-certificates-and-cannot-verify-identity-on-macsafari/) But no solution seems to fix the issue.
Verify that the correct intermediate certificates are being given out by the server at http://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html
That gd_bundle.crt chain has a "Go Daddy Class 2 Certification Authority" that verifies up to a Valicert root. I don't think this is valid anymore - GoDaddy seems to issue certs that are signed by "Go Daddy Secure Certification Authority" that is in turn signed by a different, self-signed "Go Daddy Class 2 Certification Authority" - not the Valicert-issued one in your chain, so it has nothing to  do with your actual certificate.
We just got a new SSL certificate from GoDaddy.  And, while all browsers are fine with the certificate, Safari gives the following error:
You may be using the wrong cert chain. I assume your "gd_bundle2.crt" is the same as "gd_bundle.crt" on this page: https://certs.godaddy.com/anonymous/repository.seam
Go to the page referenced above, download "gd-class2-root.crt" then download "gd_intermediate.crt". Concatenate the two files (they're just plain text files) into "mybundle.crt" and specify this new file in SSLCertificateChainFile. See if that makes a difference.
For some reason Safari doesn't stay up to date with the latest trusted root certification authorities.  You can contact customer service and ask them to reissue you a certificate with a different trusted root certificate.
Does anyone know why this would be caused, or have experience with this happening, and how to fix it?
