With the versions of Samba found in current versions of common distributions you can certainly have a Linux machine act as an NT-style domain controller (this has been the case for some time).
If you don't mind commercial linux software, Novell's Open Enterprise Server 2 (SP1 and later) has a component called Domain Services for Windows that'll do exactly that. Cost-wise, however, it'd probably be cheaper to purchase a Windows 2003 server and create your own AD tree. But if you really want a Microsoft-free solution OES2 will do it for you.
I believe that taking part in an AD based domain is being actively worked on but not yet ready for production use, though it isn't something I've looked at recently so the support may have moved on.
My answer is going to be "why would you want to?"  You're probably far better off implementing a Windows DC; it won't cost you that much, and you'll be on a supported and more predictable environment.  AD isn't difficult - there's a lot in it, but it's not difficult.  So long as you don't do bizarre or wacky stuff with it, it's incredibly robust and has low maintenance overhead.  If you want the Linux boxes to authenticate against it, you can set it up in Mixed Mode and it will present itself as an NT4-like DC where appropriate.
Until Samba 4 arrives, you can use Likewise Open.  We have had a great experience with this on Ubuntu.  Another option that provides a lot of the advantages of AD is Novell's eDirectory.  I have zero direct experience with it so I can't personally vouch, but it's something more than one of my sysadmin friends have raved about -- one using with Linux servers and an all-WindowsXP client base. 
Samba4 is going to be able to do that, but it's still in alpha.  If you're adventurous you can play with the latest releases.
