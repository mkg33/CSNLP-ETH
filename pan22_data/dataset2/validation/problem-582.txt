Unfortunately - this is like asking which car is best suited to people who drive... there is and never will be a definitive answer..
The real list of available languages/methodologies and their purposes could go on for ever - so your best bet is to start looking at the sort of tasks you want to accomplish and find a language to suit (you want to work on 2012R2 IIS - PowerShell, you want to script browser-side webpages - Javascript etc..)
For older Windows systems, VBScript and batch files were generally the way to go.  Batch files because they are an effective and simple way to perform most tasks and have their roots right back to the Pre-Windows days.  VBScript because it gave a lot of extra functionality that somewhat bridged the gap between compiled VB programming languages and batch file based scripting.
Web - Javascript/PHP.  Both cross-platform languages - heavily rooted and used the world over.  Javascript is more predominantly Browser-side and has heaps of libraries that make it very powerfull (JQuery for example).  PHP has been around for around 20 years now as an open source multi-platform (Linux and Windows) server-side language which drives a lot of popular content managers (Joomla, WordPress etc)
Linux - bash/shell scripts.  It has been a staple of the Linux world for a long time (although PowerShell is slowly making its way in the Linux world for Enterprise)
There are also a lot of other good cross-platform scripting languages available.  One that I personally have come to love is Python.  I can run the same script from my XP, 8.1, 2012R2, Ubuntu and Kali boxes as long as I have the matching Python version installed on all the machines.
For administering pretty much anything Windows 7/2008R2 and newer - PowerShell is a very good choice.  The reason for this is that it leverages a lot of the power of the .net framework, has modules specifically designed for windows fuctionality (SQL modules, Active directory modules etc) and is very object-oriented.  It is also starting to break ground in the Linux world as Microsoft is striving to bring out a unified platform approach to IT.
