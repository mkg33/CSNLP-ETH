So, how to write queries to update balance while keeping every record of the transaction and the balance synced?
This question points at writing schema. While I already have the schema, I need to write an optimized query(or queries) to populate the tables.
1st and 2nd approach will lock the row and prevent any update. It won't be feasible if there is another column in the users table being updated. 3rd approach appears not feasible to me as there's going to be a million records at some point. 
The transactions can be carried out by the user, the parent user, and the system. Therefore, I have to query the balance every few seconds and show it to the user. There will be no delete operations on both tables. Just insert and update on the users table, and only insert on the user_transactions table. Since there's going to be thousands of users and thousands of transactions every day, most probably at the same time, these insert and update queries should be optimized.
I am using MySQL version 5.7. That's a minimal DB structure and indicates all the indexes going to be used. There will be more columns in both tables such as who carried out the transaction etc. I have to keep a record of the transaction in the user_transactions table and update the balance in the users table.
