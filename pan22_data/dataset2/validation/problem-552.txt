Even if your problem is due to some other issue running the wireless diagnostics utility that comes with OS X may identify the source of the problem or at least give you some useful information to aid in isolating the problem.
You can also identify this problem by running the command /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -s - look in the "CC" column in the output. If you see any differing country codes that is likely the source of your problem and your Wi-Fi connectivity will periodically drop due to the conflicting country codes. I've found that I can turn Wi-Fi off and on to immediately restore WiFi connectivity, but unless you can track down the offending wireless router and get its owner to replace it, you may not be able to permanently resolve the problem with the iMac if that is the cause of the problem.
Or you might be experiencing a problem I've encountered with a MacBook Pro laptop due to some neighbor's router using a different country code. Some routers will advertise a country code in the information they provide to nearby wireless devices. Windows and Linux devices don't seem to have a problem if a router is advertising a country code that conflicts with a country code advertised by another nearby router, but Apple OS X systems may intermittently drop Wi-Fi connections in such situations. You can check for such a problem by running Apple's wireless diagnostic utility. To do so, click on the WiFi icon at the top of the screen while holding down the option key then select Open Wireless Diagnostics. If that is the source of the problem, you will see "Conflicting Country Codes" listed in the results summary. If you click on the "i" to see further information, you will be informed:
On an OS X system, you can view details on a WiFi connection from a Terminal window using the command /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I. You will see something like the following:
The agrCtlRSSI value is a measure of the signal strength - the "RSSI" stands for received signal strength indication. The closer the number is to zero the stronger the signal; weaker signals are indicated by numbers closer to negative 100. The agrCtlNoise value provides an indicator of how noisy the signal is; less negative values are better, so in the above example the -95 is not good, though the signal strength level is ok. The numbers may give you an indication of whether the iMac is experiencing some issue related to the Wi-Fi signal.
