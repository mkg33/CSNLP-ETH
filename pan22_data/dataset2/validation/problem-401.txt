Besides the marquee features (ZFS, Zones, DTrace) people mentioned above, (Open)Solaris also has great observability and management tools. Some things that I like:
One thing that has long frustrated me with Solaris is the antiquated packaging/patching system.  This is being fixed in OpensSolaris with a new package management system.  I think there is still some work to do, but it is coming along fairly well.
If you are serious into software that you want to run and support for 10+ years, this is the first point you look at - API stability and known lifetime management.
Solaris thinks very much on how to implement new solutions so that you're not forced to update or force to change apps when upgrading.
Others have already mentioned ZFS/Dtrace. Other benefits are Zones (lightweight virtualization - good enough for use in production), and SMF (init scripts done better - automatically restart a service when it dies if possible and other benefits).
For me the first platform requirement is stability. Not long uptime, but APIs that don't change overnight.
Solaris loves threads and scales very well.  Prime platform for heavy multi-user/multi-threaded applications on any server, but really shines on bigger servers.
Sadly, but understandably, Linux fails this. Every release is different. Stacks change, APIs change, ...
No one has mentioned LiveUpgrade yet.  LiveUpgrade gives you a way to install patches, or even upgrade the OS to a new release, but gives you a recovery where all you do is reboot, and you're back to the way you were.  Using ZFS and cloning gives you even more possibilities.  I recently took a Solaris 9 box with an SVM mirror and upgraded it to Solaris 10 with a ZFS mirror with less than 10 minutes of downtime.
