There are unfortunately over 7000 chunks within your 12 chunk sight range.  However, I would expect few locations to have more than three vertical chunks that actually need to be rendered using this approach which cuts the chunk count to probably no more than 1500.
I don't believe you can do this with simply loading certain layers because of the problem of transitions.
I would apply the same sort of logic within a chunk--when you load a chunk calculate what junctions are transparent and what junctions are opaque touching opaque--you only need to actually render faces where someone can see them.  (Note that in Minecraft you have three types of block--transparent, opaque and vision-altering--glass, doors, fences etc.  You can only skip transparent-transparent and opaque-opaque.)
2)  For each face of the block is it opaque.  An opaque face means you do not need to consider the next chunk.  (Note, though, that depending on where the chunk is there could be as many as three faces involved--a chunk must be rendered if any of the three are not opaque.  I suspect this is best pre-calculated--render so long either b1 is visible and has a non-opaque face f1 or b2 is visible has a non-opaque face f2 or b3 is visible has a non-opaque face f3.)
