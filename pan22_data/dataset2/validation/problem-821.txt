This is a micro-optimization. The point is that there's no reason to do it, in anything resembling normal operation. It could easily hurt you if your usage pattern changes.
XP can only see 3GB of memory. When my machine already has that, what's the point of a page file? It's reserving disk memory which it can never access. Unless it disables some RAM. So you've spent your hard-earned, on top dollar memory, only to find that XP is dating disk instead.
This might not bother you if you're not experiencing BSODs, and you can certainly recreate the pagefile quickly enough, but why not be prepared?
I run 32 bit XP with 4 GB memory (I know, XP only sees 3GB of that but it's interleaved and very fast) and would like to make two points:
Run a few progs, Word, Excel, Chrome, IE Ex, watch a movie, stream some music or TV. You'll soon get a message that you are running out of virtual memory. This proves that XP uses the pagefile even when it doesn't need to. Check the task manager performance tab (alt ctrl del). Peak will be well below total physical memory, so why is XP using the pagefile? And why does XP think you're running out of memory?
I believe that if you don't have a pagefile, then in case of a BSOD, Windows won't be able to write the minidump. This means that you won't be able to analyze the problem by using the appropriate tools.
The pagefile is an anachronism from the days of DOS and Windows 98. If you've got enough memory, get rid of it.
