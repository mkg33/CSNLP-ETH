I'm having this weird behavior: Firefox (4.0.1, Debian version) is showing the same exact page with two different font sizes if the page is hosted on localhost or a remote server.
Is it possible that the hostname isn't resolving from inside the network? Look at resources that can't be loaded in Firebug, you might find that your CSS isn't able to be loaded.
I had exactly the same problem - even to the point that some pages behaved and others didn't!  Clearing the cache solved it.
I run a bit of JavaScript that grabs the screen resolution from the browser and then sets the font size accordingly.  This allows text to remain legible with mega-resolution screens without it being ridiculously large on low-res screens.  Maybe I'm missing an easier way to do it, but redefining font sizes in em rather than points or pixels didn't work.
Is there any configuration variable that could increase font size based on host? Or anything else that might cause this?
According to Firebug, rendered font in localhost version is 14.3px while the remote server version is 13px. The size specified via CSS is 13px. Chrome shows both pages with the same size so it's not a server issue.
