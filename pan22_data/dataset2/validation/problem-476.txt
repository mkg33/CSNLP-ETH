Do a grep on your existing blogs and look for any iframes or eval method calls in your WP directory. Also check the DB. Once it's all clean, update your WP version and themes/plugins and keep it updated. 
Alex, unless you're a full-time security person, doing forensics on stuff like this is a waste of your time. Running WP 2.5, which is 3 years old, is just asking to be pwned.

You could spend days looking at CVEs and exploit code but the reason they got in there (assuming it was through wordpress) was through some bug in the code. This bug was probably found several years ago, widely published, and already fixed. There's probably nothing special about your wordpress install, it was probably exploited through some automated tool looking for old versions of wordpress. 
I used to have this problem with a few of my defunct blogs, but keeping them constantly updated fixed it.
That's your problem right there. Most of these attacks are carried out by automated scripts that look for known vulnerabilities in older wordpress systems. Since anyone can look at bug reports and changelogs, it's not too difficult to engineer a script to exploit a weakness.
Next login to Google webmaster and, if you haven't already, prove ownership and ask for a review of your site. The warning should go away after awhile. 
I suggest you either put some effert into your web sites or stop playing at being a webmaster and get someone who knows what they're doing to manage your systems and ensure all reasonable safety measures are implemented, including upgrading as necessary. There's more to a web site than just throwing a prepackaged version of software on it, typing some content and sitting back.
Do you keep your plugins up to date? There's exploits against them too, that could be the avenue of attack too.

Do you reuse passwords? Is your FTP password the same for that forum you maybe registered for 3 years ago that stored their passwords in clear text and got hacked? That's another avenue of attack. 
Welcome to reality. Your sites got hacked because you completely failed to take any precautions. Running such old and vulnerable versions of WordPress is simply asking for this to happen. Given the invitation you've created don't be surprised when people come to the party.
Do you keep your plugins up to date? There's exploits against them too, that could be the avenue of attack too. 
Unless you have the logs from the day it happened, there's probably no way you're going to know how it happened. There's tons of exploits against historical versions of wordpress like 2.5. Here's a few CVEs that might be how they got in:
