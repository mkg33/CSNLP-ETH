Firefox does resume downloads. The problem is that many servers refuse to resume downloads even if there's a break in connection - the time period differs from server to server.
And as pointed out by others, Firefox can and does resume downloads. However, resuming a download just means asking the server to continue sending data. If the server refuses, there's nothing FF (or any download manager) can do. In your case, the site probably provides download links which are only valid for a certain time. By the time the connection fails and you try to restart, the link has expired, hence the download cannot resume. So, definitely a problem with the site.
( TED's servers immediately comes to my mind, if there's break in connection for about 5 seconds, the download is ruined and I have to restart the download from start.)
That's become the download links are autogenerated, are valid particular combination of parameters ( perhaps some session id ? I'm not sure), and are not persistent. Once the control of the download has been handed over to the browser, the links expire, and hence you get the error message.
I have FF and I can resume downloads. Be aware that the server itself must be configured to allow resuming, so I imagine that's your issue. I'd also imagine that all servers that display countdowns or similar behaviour won't allow resume.
That's not correct. If a server doesn't support resume then download managers cannot resume downloads.
Few servers inspect the HTTP headers for the referrers, and block if the referrer is not a browser. I guess while transferring the download, the header gets mangled and the referrer becomes the download manager, instead of the browser.
This is definitely a problem on your end.  Firefox resumes downloads just fine from servers which allow resuming.  Try this out, go to some website serving fairly large files directly, with no redirects or countdowns.  Start the download, then close Firefox.  Reopen Firefox and your download will resume.  
The problem with your case that you're trying to resume a download from a server that doesn't want you to.  Firefox can't do anything about that.
Well, that's probably your problem. The download fails because your network connection drops, and Firefox runs into a timeout. You should probably try fixing your WiFi network problem.
 My suggestion: Try IDM. It's one of the better download managers that I've used. If the problem still persists, my suggestion is to use an alternative link to download, or maybe switch to a wired connection while downloading.
