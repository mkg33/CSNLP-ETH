I have mapped the drive to the same DFS namespace and the speed is fine this way, I've also tested by redirecting the folder redirection to the share name instead of the DFS namespace and this is also fine. So it would seem the combination of having Folder Redirection to DFS Namespace is causing the slowness.

Just start over again all from the console and make a schema in the paper of what are you doing before implementing this is really helpful.
During low network latency, we have faced slowness, we didn't observe it clearly at first. But when we look at the logs, we have found that the problem is the latency.

Having a strange issue at the moment whereby users redirected folder Documents is really slow (locally) even browsing through folders can take several seconds just to populate the list of files.
Currently performing a project to migrate all users from mapped drive home folders to redirected folders (Documents).
the do the test from any computer in the domain if the resource is accesible using the \domain.com\namespace\resource then do the replication by adding the other resource and accepting the options.
