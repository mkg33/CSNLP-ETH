I ran into quite a few other errors (A plethora of "Invalid Credentials," "Access Denied," and other access related errors). I will update this later to cover them as well.
This is why I added the LDAP group on my server and the obMemberOf attribute. I then used it on the sssd client as my ldap_access_filter (i.e., anyone who has attribute obMemberOf set to the DN for the development group has access to the system.
I wonder whether you can configure sssd to use a flexible ldap filter and lookup different (non-default) ldap attributes in this case.
Running 'cacertdir_rehash /etc/openldap/cacerts/' seemed to fix things. It created a symlink (the certificates hash with numeric suffix) that points to iRedMail_CA.pem
I have a few servers set up and I'd like to centralize access for users using LDAP. I have my primary server that is hosting email using iRedMail, and there already happens to be an LDAP database that was set up with iRedMail. Now, I'd like for my user accounts to be tied to their email accounts (for example, changing their email password also changes their password on servers they have access to). I've done some searching (DuckDuckGoing?) for how to use iRedMail's LDAP database as a user authentication database for UNIX accounts, but I've yet to find anything remotely helpful. Anyone ever done this have any tips?
If you modified iRedMail LDAP schema file, you should pay attention to sync this schema with upstream.
