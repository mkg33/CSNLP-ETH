The layer is set as visible per the layers window/list.  Is there a faster way to locate where the missing layer is?
I finally realized this happens when I duplicate a layer from one canvas size to another, where the first canvas is larger in a significant way. The above answers were correct, zooming out works, but I wanted to clarify what the cause is, at least for me. Also helps to pay attention to where on the canvas the layer being duplicated from is located. This way you know which direction to drag from ;-)
I restore the "layer" view by going to "Essentials" at top right hand corner, and "Reset Essentials".
I use the "Edit --> Transform" method myself. Have also found out that if doing that doesn't show the bounding box, select "View--> Fit On Screen" to rectify.
I've had this issue too. Check to see if your workspace is in "analysis" (upper right hand corner). That's the workspace I use most often. Good luck!!
This happens to me quite often, where a layer will "disappear" off canvas and I spend precious time trying to "drag" it back into view.  Its swimming around in the vast gray expanse somewhere.
