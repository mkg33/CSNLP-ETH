Otherwise, you just change cygwin.bat to run zsh -l -i instead of bash --login -i and it will run as a login shell.  
I was able to set the SHELL environment variable in Windows to /usr/bin/zsh and it worked without any other changes.  I just changed it for my Windows user, not globally.
Just thought I'd add this answer in case it helps anyone who's looking for it. If you use chere (which adds a "Bash prompt here" option to the right-click context menu of any folder), you can set it to zsh ("Zsh Prompt Here") with:
Assuming you're interested in changing the shell used in mintty/Cygwin Terminal, it first checks the SHELL environment variable, then the (now nonexistent) passwd file, then falls back to /bin/sh, which is what it seems to be doing by default.
If I read your question right, you're looking for something else than what  chere  supplies (which, granted, is pretty cool in its own right).
The current version of Cygwin doesn't have an  /etc/passwd  file, and the system I'm working on has Windows account information in a domain database out of my control. Consequently,  chsh  is no longer supported.
Of course, if you want to run multiple shells from startup, just create a set of .bat files to load different shells. (sh, ksh, csh, fish etc)
I also found that bash is not hard-coded into the  startxwin  script, nor is it hard-coded in any .bat file. Turns out you don't need to fiddle with .bat files at all.
Unless you're using cygwin as a multiuser environment (in which case use chsh as you would under a standard environment.)
If you want to use Cygwin shell inside the IDE Intellij, then use following setup inside settings/tools/terminal
I felt I should update this to provide info on doing this without chsh but still doing it on the Unix end. Edit the /etc/passwd file and replace occurrences of /bin/bash with /bin/zsh. (This is effectively what chsh would do, but this way you'd do it for all users in one go.)
Setting an environment variable probably varies for different versions of Windows.  Try searching for "environment" in your Windows Control Panel.  For me, under Windows 7, it was Control Panel → System → Advanced System Settings, which brings up the System Properties control panel/dialog, then the Advanced tab, then the Environment Variables button, which brings up the Environment Variables dialog, then create a new user variable named SHELL with the value /usr/bin/zsh.  Then OK back out of all of that and start a new mintty.
