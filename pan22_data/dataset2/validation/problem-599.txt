I have been searching for a solution to this problem for over one year, including using the older XP drivers from Creative, using the KXProject drivers, and even modifying drivers from other sound cards (e.g. the Audigy series).
I know this is not the answer you want to hear, but after searching for a driver for this particular sound card from the Windows 7 Beta, I still have found nothing, and decided to purchase something new.  As a warning to yourself, if you do decide to continue with Creative's products, ensure that the new card is from the X-Fi series (or newer).  I found compatibility issues with the Audigy series under Windows 7, and was forced to upgrade again (after which I decided that I would not be getting another Creative sound card).
The two main problems are that there are no drivers compatible with the sound card, Windows 7, and over 2 GB of RAM.  The only compatible drivers for the sound card and Windows 7 work with 2 GB of RAM or less, and even then, are still unstable.  The second problem is the lack of official driver support from Creative.
