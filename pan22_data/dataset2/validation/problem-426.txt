If you've copied files from a 2003 computer, you can't use that in order to create a virtual machine. The virtual machine's hardware is different, and so the Microsoft license in the old 2003 machine cannot be reused for the new one. You have no choice get a 2003 installation cd and use that to construct a new virtual machine, and only then you may copy the old files into it.
The problem is that a ISOs need to be made bootable, and even then, there needs to be something in the boot sector that can load the actual setup executable (after finding it in the file system). The CD-ROM drive and the BIOS have no knowledge of file systems or anything like that, it's all up to whatever is in the boot sector of the disc.
You should check out some guides on how to setup a virtual PC, including probably creating a boot enabled disc image from your Server 2003 dumped files.
The BIOS loads the boot loader (found in the boot sector of the disc) into a particular address in memory and jumps to it. If the boot sector does not contain valid executable code then the disc is unbootable.
