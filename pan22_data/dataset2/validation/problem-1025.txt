You could also try replacing SYSLINUX 3.86 with SYSLINUX 4.02; it is a bit tedious and you'll have to do it all again when GParted updates itself unless they upgrade to SYSLINUX 4.x. Leave a comment here and I'll write up some further instructions for doing that if you're interested.
In my tests and tries I had in the last 6 months, I found that some USB sticks did not work, until I actually deleted all partitions from the device. That was done using GParted or simply fdisk. I think this is related to some partition table that GRUB could not find, or something like that. I found that for a stick that never worked in the past, manually deleting all partitions on the device, rewriting the partition table fixed the problem. I then could install Ubuntu on the device, making sure that GRUB is indeed installed on  the right device, and it worked just fine. 
For a not-so-quick-and-less-likely-to-work-but-potentially-cleaner workaround, try manually telling SYSLINUX where to look by doing the following (assuming you're using Windows) -
it has never let me down yet and it gets a more specific configuration for the major distributions.... IMHO Unetboot simply guesses what would be done while the universal installer has specific methods built-in.
When you get that message, it means SYSLINUX can't find the configuration file, syslinux.cfg (or it is indeed not written properly - unlikely in your case). For GPartedLive, it is located in /syslinux.
It looks like it's found something on the USB stick and then something is wrong. From a quick google some things that might help are:
A quick workaround is to copy the contents of /syslinux (everything in it) to the root of your USB drive. SYSLINUX will always look in the root for syslinux.cfg. SYSLINUX 3.86 also seems to have some bugs with its ability to find the configuration file when it is nested inside directories - SYSLINUX 4.0 seems a lot more reliable and resilient.
