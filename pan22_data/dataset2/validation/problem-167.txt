My client is mac os x 10.9.5.  I have a bastion host (linux) that I am ssh'ng into.  I have agent forwarding working so I can ssh to the bastion host and then ssh into another machine without having to store my private key on the bastion.  
I have tried setting up a config on the bastion server to force it to use and identities file.  But since I do not want my private key out there, this fails.
My problem is I have hit 7 keys in my ssh store (ssh-add -L) on my client machine.  When I try to use agent forwarding for machines with the 7th key, it fails for "Too many authentication failures for '.  With -vvv on, I can see that in the send_pubkey_test that it gets to the 6th key offered and that is when it stops.  7th key is never offered up. Below is snippet of the 6th key and failure. 
In addition, I tried taking the public key for the pem and copied it to the bastion server in the .ssh directory.  Then used -i name.pub on the command line.  This did not work.  It seemed to treat the pub key as a pem.
My workaround is to write a script to load/delete the keys as I need them.  I keep thinking for ssh agent forwarding, there must be a solution that I am missing.
I have tried setting up the other servers in the client in the config file.  Below is the example.  When on the bastion server, I try ssh internal.IP and it fails "too many authentication:"
Why do you have 7 keys?  I've seen people do this thinking it's more secure but it's not.  If your client is compromised all keys are compromised.  Maybe you have a legit reason but just want to make sure you're not creating more problems than you're solving.
