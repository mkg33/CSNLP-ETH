Once that is complete you will need to create a Proxy that uses this credential. From the SQL Server Agent > Proxies > Operating System (CmdExec) folder you will need to right click and choose New Proxy... Use the credential you created earlier.
It looks like you need to configure the second step of your job to run as a domain account with permissions to write to the \KWS2-WEB-SERVER\Share\Reports\Uur share as well as read access to the C:\Reports\Energie\Uur folder.
You first will need to add a credential to SQL Server. From the Security > Credentials folder you will need to right click and choose New Credential... Fill in that information and click OK.
Basically your .bat file runs when you run it manually because you're the owner.  It trusts you.  When you run the .bat as a different user, the cmd will actually display a warning and ask you if you trust it.  Your job is hanging because the cmd is waiting for your answer.  Adding "--trust-model always" will skip this question and allow the .bat to finish.
Typically when a job like this hangs it is because the command execution is waiting for a response.  Because any command execution run from SQL Server is run as a shell, and you can't see the shell, it can't get a response.  If I were you I would try running the bat file manually and see if you are asked for a response.  If so correct that part (so that it doesn't ask for a response) and try again.
If running it yourself doesn't help then try running it through xp_cmdshell and see if you get any output back.  It may still hang though.
Now you can configure your second job step to use the Proxy you just created using Run As: drop down of the job step page.
