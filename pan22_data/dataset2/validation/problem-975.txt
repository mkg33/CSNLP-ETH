i have a Acer Aspire One D257. In this netbook the hard disk is defect so i bought a new one. Now i want to reinstall Windows 7. Im using an external DVD Drive plugged into USB. 
When i uncheck this checkbox i get a lot more drivers, and some SATA Drivers but the also do not work. I get the same error message as before. 
The laptop has the newest BIOS - 1.15, it is reset to factory default settings except that i enabled the Boot Menu prompt with F12.
When i select the SATA AHCI Driver it does not find any drivers. When i uncheck the checkbox "Hide drivers that are not compatible with hardware on this computer" it shows one driver: Acer HWID (path_to\1.inf). When i continue with this driver i got an error message that says something like: No new devices found. Check if the driver files are on the installation disk.
When i show him the Chipset Driver it sees a lot more driver. When i uncheck the checkbox "Hide drivers that are not compatible with hardware on this computer" it show some drivers:
The Windows 7 DVD is staring, Win7 setup is starting and when it comes to Hard Drive options it says that no drive was detected and i should try search for drivers. It shows me this window: Screenshot from web 
From the Acer Support Website i've downloaded the SATA AHCI Driver and the Chipset Driver. I unpacked both to a USB flashdrive in seperate folders.
