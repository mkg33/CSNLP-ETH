An idea not yet mentioned is to reject the backscatter. All of it that I've seen comes through open mail relays, and there are two blackhole lists which you may find useful for reducing the amount of backscatter you receive.
Having said that, if you establish SPF records for your domain, there's a better chance that receiving systems will recognize the forged email as spam.  An SPF records identifies systems that are allowed to originate mail for your domain.  Not all receiving systems pay attention to SPF records, but larger email providers will use this information.
In summary, you can use SpamCop to report the senders of these bounces. It doesn't (directly) stop the initiators of the problem, but it may reduce these bounces.
Adding these in (along with several other more traditionally focused BLs) reduced the amount of backscatter that I receive by over 90%.
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) can help. It is an email validation system designed to prevent email spam by verifying sender IP addresses. SPF allows administrators to specify which hosts are allowed to send mail from a given domain by creating a specific SPF record (or TXT record) in the Domain Name System (DNS). Mail exchangers use the DNS to check that mail from a given domain is being sent by a host sanctioned by that domain's administrators.
It is the nature of SMTP (the protocol used to transfer mail) that no validation is done on the sender address listed in an email.  If you want to send an email that appears to come from president@whitehouse.gov...you can go ahead and do that, and in many cases there's nothing anyone can do to stop you.
They're using spoofed sender data to generate an email that looks like it's from your domain.  It's about as easy as putting a fake return address on a piece of postal mail, so no, there's really no way to stop it.  SPF (as suggested) can make it easier for other mail servers to identify email that actually comes from your domain and email that doesn't, but just like you can't stop me from putting your postal address as the return address on all the death threats I mail, you can't stop someone from putting your domain as the reply-to address on their spam.
As the other answers have mentioned, you're receiving bounces from someone else's emails. SpamCop has previously not called this spam, but these days it accepts reports for this. E.g. I copied the message you quoted (and I've included my Gmail account to  determine my mailhosts) and got this result (which I cancelled).
