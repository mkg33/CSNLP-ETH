I think you described the job of a Network Administrator.  Not a System administrator because you never mention any type of system that you would administer, except for your comment that you "patch security holes" which is a pretty vague statement.  I really wouldn't consider you a consultant either because consultants typically are hired on a short contract or temporary basis, where you specialize in a specific area (HP hardware tech, Dell hardware tech, Terminal Server tech, VMware tech, etc.), and you didn't describe anything in your job which fits you into that position.
A consultant is, in my view, someone hired by the company to accomplish a specific task, where as a full time position of monitoring and maintaining the infrastructure would be considered outsourcing. 
The job you have described is that of a sysadmin. A consultant is usually someone with a large amount of expertiese and experience who will advise a client on a particular task or project. The consultant may do the work, but often is just there to advise and provide a high level overview.
I call myself an IT Administrator, because I do servers (~100 total) and networks (~6/7 WAN links) across 4 physical sites. 
I'm not sure how big of an IT department you have where you are, but typically in larger environments IT is broken up into multiple areas Network Admins, Network Engineers, System Admins, System Engineers, Help Desk, etc. But when it comes to smaller environments you can play the roles within IT, for example the Help Desk, Network Admins and System Admins could be coupled into one job.  Where I work at we have around 30-40 IT guys so we are broken up into the different titles that I listed above, which keeps us focused on certain specialties within our infrastructure.
