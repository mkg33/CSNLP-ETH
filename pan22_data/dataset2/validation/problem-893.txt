NLB is a load balancer, not a reverse proxy. IIS has it's own ROUTING mechanism that can do the rest (but would require a balancing server in front to do the routing).
I am wondering how NLB compares in terms of features with a reverse proxy such as nginx. I do appreciate that they are implemented very differently, however nginx can route requests to web servers based on factors such as HTTP methods, headers, etc... So I am wondering if such a thing is possible with NLB.
If you need to balance based on higher layer information like request-type and whatnot, you are better off with haproxy or some other dedicated load-balancing software... far more flexible and nicer to your network.  NLB is useful, but only within a narrow band of applications.
I am currently investigating Windows Server 2008 clustering features (for fail-over and load balancing purposes). I am thinking of using NLB to balance HTTP requests to 2 or more web application servers. Is it possible to configure NLB to route traffic based on the type of HTTP requests or does it only operate at the IP address / port level? 
NLB is a hairy beast and has some unique network requirements that can drive a switched network into the ground if you don't organize things correctly.
