The purpose of having two PSU is not really to protect against one of the PSU failing. It is to protect against one of the two power sources failing. And you lose all of that if both inputs are connected to the same power source.
It is also possible for a failing PSU to take down everything connected to the UPS, though in principle that can be prevented if the UPS has separate fuses on each output.
Connecting both PSU to the same UPS can keep the machine running in case one of the PSU fails. It does however depend on the exact circumstances of the failure. It is possible for a PSU to fail in a way that takes the machine down even if the other PSU is still in operation.
So connecting both inputs to the same power source will lose you almost all of the benefits of having two PSU.
If you only have access to a single UPS it will be slightly better for reliability to connect one PSU to the UPS and connect the other PSU directly to mains bypassing the UPS. If you can get a surge protector for the PSU connected directly to mains, that will be better.
