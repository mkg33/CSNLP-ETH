Despite the fact the oficial repositories are sometimes behind the cutting edge, install software from YUM or other package manager is fast, clean and more secure.
The Debian New Maintainers Guide is pretty helpful in this situation, specifically Chapter 9 - "Updating the package". - while it may seem scary at first, it can be as simple as
I know I can think differently sometime ahead but right now I think this is the best choice for a regular guy like me.
I don't believe you can't automate much further. There's a definite overhead that will only make it worth it for a respectable amount of servers.
Instead of compiling from source and deploying, build (or find) Ubuntu packages for the newer versions you need.  Often you can take the build files from an old version and just use the newer source.  You can then maintain your packages like any other, and only worry about tracking configuration files.
I came from 15 years of Windows and made a lot of research in order to discover what Linux flavor I'd choose to work with. I have just upgraded Fedora 13 to 14 and something I have to say is: mantain software installed from source is a real nightmare.
The core problem you've got is that rather than having the distribution track security updates and apply them for you, you've got to handle that yourself.  You can make life a little easier, though, by subscribing to the security announcements list for your distro and filtering it for the updates you care about.  I have a procmail script that it kept automatically up-to-date by my package builder (any package in there goes on the "let announcements for this package through") and anything that passes the filter (meaning "I need to consider a manual update for this") drops into the todo list (ticketing system) for further handling.
As others have mentioned, you should build your own packages. In order to keep up to date with the upstream sources, subscribe to their mailing list(s). Some have a low volume -announce list.
