Alternatively, you can also turn off the UAC through the registry. For instructions, you can check this article. This article is about Windows 8 but this method works with Windows 10 as well. 
I believe C: is locked by default since Windows Vista. So this type of behavior is normal. You will need to take the ownership if you want edit this folder while user account control (UAC) is active. To do this press Win+X keys, select file explorer, open computer, find drive C, select properties, go to Security Tab, select your user group that you want to have access and finally click "Edit" to change the permissions. 
So, all I am trying to do is to change my cursor files to cursors I want. I did cursor schemes but I have to go to settings and re-change them upon every restart of my computer. So I am trying to replace the cursor file in my windows folder instead. However, I can't edit anything even though I am admin. I tried going into the properties of the folder, but all of the permissions I should be able to change are greyed out. How do I fix this?
Keep in mind that this will not work if you have full-disk encryption (such as Bitlocker) enabled on your Windows drive. 
If changing permissions or disabling UAC (as outlined in Neal's answer) don't work, you can alternatively try booting into a live OS (such as Ubuntu), and then modifying the required files on your Windows disk.
