All of that aside, you need to remember that even if you can get signal to your clients, your clients' signal still needs to get back to your access point, which will be much more problematic of a problem to solve than we cover in the first paragraph. If you only had a single client, you could install some directional, high-gain antennas to solve the problem, but that doesn't scale beyond a very small number of clients sharing a very small physical space.
You're fighting physics here, and you're not going to win. Various regulatory bodies limit the Tx power of wifi gear, so there's not a whole lot of room for improvement there. Remember that RF power drops off according to the Inverse-Square Law, so even if you were able to double the Tx power of your AP, it's going to make very, very little difference in the RF as received by your clients. And that's ignoring the fact that it's going through stone, not clear air.
So, what's the answer? Install cabling. You've tried power-line networking, and have found out what nearly everyone else does: it's a nice toy, but is horribly unreliable. You're just going to need to bite the bullet and install cabling from room to room.
