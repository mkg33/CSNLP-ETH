A file is simply a seqence of zeros and ones and it dosent matter if a file is encrypted or not and when you change a file the file will only change some zeros and ones but not all.
Google drive should be able to only upload file changes and not the whole file. I use dropbox with an 500mb true crytp container and when i did some testing the file wasnt uploaded in full size when i changed something in the container. There a different methods and file hashes so that the programm hasnt to upload the whole file when you change something.
What 'doesn't work'? You've given nothing to go on here, so I'm going to have to guess to try to help you.
Taking the psychic debugging route (warning: prone to just as much error as any other psychic), I'm going to guess that the Google drive app is upset about the fact that the place it's supposed to put it's stuff is missing. IF that's the case, then you'll probably want to disable auto-start on the Google drive app, and start it manually after you've mounted the volume or whatever where you want the drive stuff to land. You could also try just killing the drive app, then mount, then restart the drive app.
