Works great for me with smaller numbers of tabs, but there is no reason why you can't have many many folders saved
Take a look at Session Manager. It may have the options you need. Maybe not exactly the way you want it, but pretty close.
I bounce back and forth between three to ten projects on which I am doing research, and I often have 20 to 50 tabs open on each project. As a result I usually have 100 to 200 tabs open at a time. This is a major drain on memory and creates instability. I would like to find a way in Firefox 3 or 4 to quickly and easily save all the tabs in a single window without saving all the other tabs, assign that group of tabs a name, and reopen named groups of tabs in a single window - as if the tabs in a given window were in a folder that you could save and reopen. Ideally, I would like to be able to open and close tabs in a window and then save the group to the same name and have the altered group open next time. And it should not interfere with the ability of the session manager to save and reopen all my tabs in every window when I quit for the day or if the session crashes.
If the dynamic session requirement can be worked around, saving all Tabs to a bookmark folder, and then re-opening them with "Open All in Tabs" is a no-extension alternative.
Is there any way to do this in a standalone copy of Firefox 3 or 4? If not, is there an add-on or extension that allows you to do it?
