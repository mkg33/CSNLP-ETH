You say there's an onboard video aswell? If the ati card does actually cause trouble consider just taking it out for the first few weeks till you get a bit more comfortable with the system, and then try working out how to fix it.
The first two don't apply to you, and the third probably doesn't either. If the ati card you have is as old as the rest of the computer it should work fine with the default free drivers (in fact, it may not even be supported by fglrx)
These days ubuntu is definatly the way to go for starting with linux, it has the best support community for new users, and some of the best hardware support (ubuntu aren't too fussy about including stuff that other distros wouldn't consider free enough)
You don't mention how much ram you have, but the machine doesn't sound that powerful, so I'd consider going with xubuntu - this has all the same stuff as ubuntu, but uses the xfce desktop instead of gnome, which is a little less resource heavy.
As a general rule of thumb, if you get a computer that's a few years old with fairly standard hardware it should "just work" out of the box with any of the major linux distros.
