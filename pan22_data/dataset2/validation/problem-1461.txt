The reason for this is that due to me hosting files that people can download I am with the low internet connection sometimes hitting that cap, and I want to be able to monitor when / how offen I hit that cap.
I've tried different kind of tools such as Zabbix, Nagios and ntopng(ntop), all useful tools but none of them seem cable of logging the actual server speed / usage of the speed. Currently I still have Ntop(ng) installed but I am unable to get it to do what I want it to. (it is vital that the data is logged 24/7)
I've been doing a lot of searching around for a tool to monitor a website's "bandwidth" usage, and I'm not talking about how many MB/data is being loaded but the servers actual output speed, to clarify what I mean I'll use an' example,
The last element is the bytes transferred to the client. You need to keep adding this number and print or log at a regular frequency to produce the total bytes transferred to the client from the last run till that moment.
My server is a Ubuntu 12.04 running with Apache 2.2, I don't know whether it's needed but in case: My domains are setup with Virtual hosts for each domain.
It sounds like you are trying to monitor full network bandwidth by measuring web server output as noted in its logs - this would not be sufficient as that not include any TCP/IP protocol overheads or other traffic (any SSH, FTP, database, or other traffic that the server might take part in).
What you need to be watching is interface statistics. Any server monitoring tool such as Zabbix and Nagios will have a function for that, for instance with collectd you would use either the interfaces module (https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Interface) to monitor all traffic on a given interface or the iptables module (https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:IPTables) to monitor traffic that matches certain filtering rules (so you can analyse the bandwidth used in more detail).
