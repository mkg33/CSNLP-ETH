Still, it’s better to have another NAT router behind the phone, because they can’t handle multiple clients very well IIRC.
But why even bother with two routers? OpenWrt can do it all and you can just use a switch at the second location. Or set the second router to be a wireless access point, if that’s your goal.
So you can of course still talk to the router. Even in regular WiFi routers, the WiFi AP interface is bridged to the wired network, so it would be fatal if this wouldn’t work.
(Please note that the diagram above is tremendously oversimplified. There is actually more going on.)
The subnet 10.0.1.0/255.255.255.0 (or 10.0.1.0/24 for short) has 10.0.1.255 as the broadcast address. Setting it is not required, because it can (and will!) be calculated. The docs also confirm this. It’s not related to bridging at all.
The firewall is already not effective because the bridging firewall is disabled by default. Also, the resulting br-lan interface is in the LAN zone. You don’t even need any firewall at all, because the Android phone is already acting as a NAT router. And the mobile ISP is most likely also doing Carrier-grade NAT.
You also seem to have a slight misconception of how bridging works. It’s implemented in software. The bridge appears as a network interface to the host OS. It’s somewhat like this:
