I've done this successfully. You need to move your machines from 192.168.1.* into the 192.168.0.* subnet. If they are all on DHCP you can reboot, but it is a lot quicker and easier on Windows to use the connection repair function, or from CMD:
I changed the IP address on my bt home hub 5 router from 192.168.1.254 to 192.168.0.254 because I was trying to connect to an IP camera - big mistake.  Now I can connect to the router but there is no internet available and I can't get the web interface to put it back the way it was.  I've tried resetting the router but this doesn't seem to do anything.  Can anyone help? Ta
After power cycle you should be able to access its web server with the login and password as they are described in the Manual by default.
The procedure is described clearly in your router Manual. It requires you to follow the instruction step by step exactly. Because the process is capricious. User is supposed to be holding button down in some specific time period, and the process may rely on some particular duration (all as it is in instruction).
If the interface has been set manually, you will need to change the assigned IP and gateway within the interface's TCP/IP properties.
Hardware factory reset of the router is a fundamental procedure and, at the same time, is very easy. It is recommended to be sure it is doable until you stuck with other issues.
