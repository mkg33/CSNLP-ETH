Zenoss will let you watch the server running tomcat, the tomcat process and monitor it via JMX as well.  There's a fair amount of documentation and it's open source.
You didn't mention what monitoring system you're using; you'll probably have to set that up to be able to talk JMX as well. Zabbix has Zapcat, Here's some OpenNMS instructions, and here's a Nagios plugin.

Try using JMX. Enabling this should be as simple as adding the following line to your startup script:
As you can see, there are options for encryption and authentication to satiate your local Manager of Paranoia.
