You are probably experiencing this on a server that is only infrequently accessed, and with a lastlog (/var/log/wtmp) which should be rotated less frequently.
This will most likely be the action of logrotate If you look in /etc/logrotate.conf you'll see something like
Now when you use the last command, you will see a longer list of logins, over a longer time span, and you will feel better !
Which says rotate the /var/log/wtmp file monthly and keep one previous copy. If you want to keep more then increase the rotate count
This issue involves some odd psychology involving "paradigms", belief systems and expectations based on conditioning through repetition.  I have a proxy server which is not accessed much, and every time I execute "last", the very short list always causes me to feel suspicious.  The feeling that something is wrong is merely the psychology of the paradigm that "you are accustomed (thousands of times) to seeing a much longer list of logins on your other servers", therefore you expect a long list !  A paradigm will cause a person to make a mistake over and over, all the while thinking that they did it correctly.
