The issue isn't the SSD itself.  Rather, it's how the SSD driver, BIOS, and Windows power management compete and are often misconfigured for low-power states like "sleep".  It's really inexcusable that the vendors haven't figured this out yet.  It's been known for a decade.
If THAT doesn't work, experiment with the BIOS SATA options for the channel your SSD is connected to until you find the right one.  Usually AHCI default settings are fine, but sometimes the link state power management settings need to be adjusted.  You can also try using  IDE mode, but Windows won't likely like that.
If your system is a desktop PC, first try disconnecting the power supply for a few minutes like above.  If that doesn't work, remove the CMOS battery from the motherboard for a few minutes, replace, and try to get into the BIOS.  Reset the settings to the BIOS default, and make sure that the SATA controller (assuming your SSD is on a SATA channel) is set to AHCI and that boot options are set for UEFI boot.
tl;dr: Your SSD is fine.  It's the idiotic software combination between BIOS & Windows10 that screws up sleep.  As you can see from this search, it's a ridiculously frustrating and common problem: Windows 10 won't boot after sleep
As to resolving your problem, you should be able to boot (at least in safe mode) by clearing the current power state.  If your machine is a laptop, remove the battery for a few minutes, put it back, and then try to boot in safe mode (In Win10, the only way to boot to safe mode is from the Troubleshoot screen that you mentioned.  See How to boot in safe mode in Win10)
