I have a distribution list. If a message bounces back, the intended recipient is flagged. If they get flagged 3 times consecutively, I stop sending them mail. The purpose is so my server does not waste resources constructing and queuing emails to bad addresses, while they sit and gum up my mail queue.
I want to make the ban "probationary," where I test the address in the future to see if it still bounces. Maybe their inbox was just full, and now it isn't. Or maybe their server was blacklisting my IP, and I have since been whitelisted. 
When you send an email that gets rejected by the server for some reason, you may get a bounce-back message with useful information about why the email was bounced, such as an RFC status code.
Is there a way to get this same information without actually sending an email, like some kind of ping? So that, I could say: If I were to hypothetically send an email to address@domain.com, can I know definitively if it will bounce? And if it will bounce, what would the bounce-back look like?
Is there any way to determine this without actually sending them an email? If it bounces again, it could then potentially continue to gum up my mail queue and waste server resources, which I am trying to avoid.
