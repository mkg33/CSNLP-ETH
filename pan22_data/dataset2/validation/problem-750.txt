However if that was that case you would probably either know the answer to, or how to find the answer to your own question.
Is it possible to know the gateway address of a wireless AP that I'm not connected to through sniffing? Airodump-ng can show MAC addresses of the AP and the clients associated but doesn't show IP addresses.
If the network is open (unencrypted) then yes; you can capture the full packets of connected clients and see the addresses in IP and ARP packets.
Despite the fact I've only just joined the site yesterday - I have to say coming on here and asking this without putting anything in doesn't look impressive - if you had a heap of questions/answers relating to network security then I could believe you with to increase your knowledge to help protect your own network by attempting penetration testing.
If the network is encrypted, then no; all of the layer 3 communication is encapsulated in encrypted packets at all times, and the MAC addresses on the transmissions is all you can get without breaking the encryption.
