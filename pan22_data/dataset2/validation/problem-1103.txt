However, there is an extension to BGP, typically known as additional-paths which puts an identifier on each route sent to a peer and thus enables BGP peers to exchange multiple routes to a path, thereby giving you not only a greater scope for traffic engineering, but also a reduced convergence time in the event of path withdrawal since the non-bestpath prefix(es) can be installed in the FIB as a backup route(s) that will be used the moment the bestpath gets withdrawn - this is particularly significant if you're running full internet tables as the BGP scanner on a Cisco router will run every 30 seconds at best and walking over 300,000 routes takes its toll.
Since it is an extension, both routers must support it and negotiate the feature at connection time (or alternatively, have negotiated dynamic capability). It is usable with both eBGP and iBGP.
For EBGP if you have multiple sessions to the same peer on a single router you should be using BGP "multipath" to allow ECMP. Depending on how and where route reflection is done in an SP network this can result in using all sessions quite evenly.
There's so much filtering between you and the LG (looking glass) that can get your prefix removed from on path or another.  What's the length of your advertised prefix?  Do you have PI or PA space?  Since the bestpath is advertised to peers, you two paths can be competing with one another upstream and only one is making it to the LG.  If you shutdown one of your paths, does it then show up in the LG after convergence?  That will tell you you're losing one to bestpath.  Try LG's with your providers to confirm your prefix is there first, then try to work your way up to the next SP.
Note that BGP additional-paths has nothing to do with ECMP since obviously, we're talking about receiving multiple prefixes with the same next-hop - with the only exception being cases where you're running iBGP and not using next-hop-self (or doing dirty things with eBGP where the nexthop is preserved)
Typically, BGP peers can only send a single path to eachother, with any updates for that path replacing the existing one.
One aspect not yet covered by these answers is BGP "add-path" which lets a BGP peer send not only their best route, but some or all of their alternates as well.
Trying to look for your own routes in looking glasses does not always work the way you expect, particularly if you buy from someone who purchases a lot of transit. For example, Internap buys transit from many other large ISPs. If you buy from Internap and then someone else, there is a good chance that your route on the other provider would be hidden by virtue of not being best. Most ISPs prefer their own customer routes. Seeing or not seeing your own routes in a looking glass has very little to do with if your route is propagating correctly or not.
