I am fixing a computer for a friend, which has a Windows XP Home Edition installation that will not boot. I think there's corrupted system files; I was able to boot from a Windows XP Pro disc, tried fixing the MBR and everything else I could. I've determined that the best course of action is to re-install Windows. I have her genuine product key, but I only have a Windows XP Professional disc, not a Windows XP Home disc. I don't think Microsoft offers any OS downloads on their website and I can't see any way to fix this computer without actually having an XP Home disc.
The computer is a Dell Inspiron 6000, is there a way I could get it from Dell? I know some Dell computers come with recovery partitions (as this one did) but when those are gone... well, they aren't much good.
2) Call the folks at your local high school or community college.  Chances are, if they have Dell systems, they have CDs to spare.  Or, they may make a copy for you.  Any Dell OEM XP cd will work for you.

1) Go on Dell's support website.  They have live-chat available with their tech support people.  They can tell if you they can send you a new CD.  It may cost a few bucks, but it would be worth it.
