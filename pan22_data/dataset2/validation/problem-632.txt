It's fairly unlikely Google Bot will run any Javascript on your site that will track it arriving, so the best hope is to look at the site logs themselves - either in webalizer or the hundreds of other log file parsers, or just open them up in a texteditor and run a regex to extract the Google Bot user agent.
Just check the webserver logs if the visitor's User-Agent request header matches/contains Googlebot. There are lot of webserver log analyzer tools, either free or payware. Most of them are also able to categorize bots. From them all I've had the best experience with Google Analytics.
You should see then how many hits it makes in a space of time. If it's too much you might want to look at using an XML sitemap
AWstats is a good, free utility to use for log file analysis. It'll give you a lot of interesting statistics in addition to the Google crawl info.
I would recommend Google analytics, it covers all visits to your site and you can work out whether a visitor was a bot or not.  It is also excellent for SEO on your site helping to increase visitors.
Signup for Google Webmaster Central, aka Webmasters Tools, verify your site, and wait for the stats to appear.
