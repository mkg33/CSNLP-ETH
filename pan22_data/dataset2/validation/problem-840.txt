Usually, you set some threshold (e.g. I want to redistribute 85% if all energy) and before processing the next Shooter patch, you do a simple check for the running total of the distributed energy (and quit the loop). This is usually few orders of magnitude faster (for a very minor implementation cost) than the reference brute-force method.
Also, contrary to popular misconception, you do not have to distribute all energy to get great results. Look into Progressive Refinement method, which only processes the largest emitors, thus allowing to converge to 'close enough' solution much sooner.
Of course, to get true benefits of Radiosity (e.g. color bleeding) it's best to redistribute as much as possible (given the resources available).
Radiosity, by definition, handles only the diffuse component. You cannot 'limit' Radiosity to diffuse, because it already is handling just that diffuse component (remember - the diffuse lighting is just one (albeit popular) application of the energy distribution).
