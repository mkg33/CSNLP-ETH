If your DNS servers fall into PCI DSS scope, you may be forced to run AV on them (even though it's downright silly in most cases).  We use ClamAV.
This could've been a knee-jerk reaction to the shellshock bash vuln, it was suggested online that bind could be affected.
There are a lot of DNS security vulnerabilities and issues that should be addressed in an audit.  They will never get to the real issues if they are distracted by bright shiny objects like "antivirus on a DNS server" checkbox.  
The first thing you need to understand about auditors is they may not know anything about how the technology in scope is used in the real world.    
I would speak to the auditors and ask them to clarify the difference in their requirements between PCI and PCI supporting, just to make sure that this requirement didn't accidentally sneak in. We did need to make sure that our DNS servers met hardening guidelines similar to the PCI environments, but anti-virus was not one of the requirements we faced.
The important thing to recognize is that while DNS servers do not handle sensitive data, they support your environments which do. As such, auditors are starting to flag these devices as "PCI supporting", similar to NTP servers. Auditors typically apply a different set of requirements to PCI supporting environments than they do the PCI environments themselves.
