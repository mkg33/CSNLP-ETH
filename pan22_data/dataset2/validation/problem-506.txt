How can I unlock these files? As this is a FAT file system, taking ownership in Windows 7 doesn't have any effect. I tried creating an image and writing the image but that makes the partition only 2 GB big - and doesn't really fix the problem of me being unable to copy (e.g. backup) the files.
Can you run chkdsk on the card, or a similar tool, to see if the operating system is rejecting reads from them because of corruption?
Unless you skip those that are denied and then you can pinpoint an actual file as having be one of yours...
Since you've tried the .iso (creating an image) approach, why not mount the .iso in Windows and copy it out of the image to the new card? Directions for this process: howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/â€¦
If you just tried to mass copy everything on it, your phone has likely placed some files on it that are locked for it's use only, and you wouldn't want them anyway.
I just got a new phone which is supplied with a 2 GB SD card. I bought a bigger card to replace it and I want to copy the preloaded data to the new card.
When I'm trying to copy the data from the default card, I receive an access denied error on some of the files, the system won't allow me to read them.
