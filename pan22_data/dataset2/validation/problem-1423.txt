It sounds like you are using integrated security for your SQL Server connection string. If that is the case, you will need to add the Network Service or E-SOFTIND\$MAGNUS login to the SQL Server in question. That new login should be a Windows user and mapped to the database in question with appropriate rights to read/write/delete/etc. as needed in the database.
Note the user name is the domain, a back-slash ("\"), the dollar sign ("$"), then the name of the computer the web server is installed to.
The issue is your Sql configuration is using the default windows integrated authentication method running in the context of your web app (E-SOFTIND\MAGNUS$) and said user isn't setup on the SQL instance on your database server so the credentials are getting rejected.
If SQL Server is installed on the same computer as the web server, use the local Network Service account. If it is on a different computer within the same domain, use E-SOFTIND\$MAGNUS as the Windows user (this is a map to the Network Service account on the MAGNUS computer, on the E-SOFTIND domain).
