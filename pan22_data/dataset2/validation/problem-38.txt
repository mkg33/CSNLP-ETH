If you're trying to detect actions of a malicious software, chances are it's smart enough not to leave traces. An aware user could also try to hide his activity by disabling and reenabling the feature or overwriting the Last Accessed timestamp with an old date post factum.
I just found out that someone went snooping through my computer a few days ago. I want to know if there is a way to see exactly what files (documents/pictures) that they opened.
Windows DOES by default keep a log of every time a user logs in, unlocks the computer, etc.  It would be under the Event Viewer's Audit Log.
Another possible solution which I tried was using RecentFilesView. This program does what I need but it only lists up to 138 files.
As an alternative, SwiftSearch can give you a list of all files on a disk in a matter of seconds, then you sort by clicking on the "Accessed" column and scroll to the needed time.
Well, if they were just browsing your computer, then you are out of luck. NTFS has a "last accessed" attribute, but it is disabled by default on Windows 7.  If they changed any files, they would be located under the Date modified.  Where were these files located? What kind of permissions are available (ACL)?  
I tried adding the "Date visited" header in windows explorer but that doesn't have any data. The "Date Accessed" header only seems to store the time when the file was created.
