Let's take the Intel Core 2 Duo P7350 and P8600 for an example. Both have a 3MB cache and a 1066MHz FSB, but the P7350 runs at 2.0GHz, while the 8600 runs at 2.4GHz. Is there a tradeoff between heat generation and performance?
For example, a last few P4s are the hottest processor ever made, but they are much slower than your standard C2D which runs much cooler.  In a few generations the same might occur.  While improvement in manufacturing technology will generally reduce heat output, it also allows companies to fit more dies in the same area.  What this means is the heat output might actually stay the same, but we'll definite have faster and faster processors.
Something to consider is the advances in materials science over the last 15 years.  Much effort has gone into packing more transistors per cm on the chip, reducing power requirements and increases in efficiency which also reduce waste heat.  So that being said, know that all processors are not equal at all.  
Sometimes manufacturers can redesign a processor in a more-efficient way, or move to a different manufacturing process, or other factors can influence how much waste heat is generated such that faster processor could even use less energy.  But, given the critical "all else equal" condition, a faster processor runs hotter and there is a tradeoff between speed and heat/energy use.
In fact, there's a growing market out there for processors that are intentionally underpowered to serve as cpus in computers that don't need great performance.
Yes!  All else being equal (that's key), a processor with a higher clock speed will use more energy and therefore also produce more waste heat.  
If you are comparing the processors using the same manufacturing technology and architecture, then yes.
