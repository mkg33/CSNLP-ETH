CBL's software is a bit pricier than similar competitors at about $100, but the only commercial one I've seen with that much granularity in the controls and decent support available if you need some help getting the settings worked out.
1. If a drive is failing, reading it at all is very likely to make it fail worse. So it is quite possible (some would say "close to certain") that some/many/lots of sectors that were good before you read the disk twice via the procedure are now bad. The smart thing to do would be to have a good drive and do both steps above actually recovering data. IF you do this, of course, you might want to use ddrescue's ability to try extra hard to get the data off of hard-to-read sectors.
run chkdsk /r in an elevated cmd prompt to locate bad clusters and recover readable info. This may improve your backup attempt reliability. Backup your files using simple copy afterwards. If this fails you can try data recovery methods that retry the read, however if chkdsk could not read the bad sector, you could repeat the chkdsk /r and try again. Multiple chkdsk /r and attempts to copy data is a good way to repeat attempts at bad sector data recovery. If chkdsk manages to read the bad sector once, it will write the data to a good block. Repeated chkdsk /r will continue to improve file integrity as long as the bad block can be read just once. If the data is gone, give up!
I realize that the original question is very old, but I had this problem recently and thought that others might want to know the answer to the original question.
It may be a good idea to copy all your data from the drive as much as possible then do a low level format followed by a repartitioning and slow/full format to allow bad sector re-allocation within Manufacturer system and NTFS bad sector list. Quick format won't mark bad sectors as bad.
When this tool encounters bad sectors, it keeps track of them in a separate text file (one bad sector per line, so you can simply count the number of lines in the file to determine the total number of bad sectors), which is also used as a cross-reference to find out which files used those sectors.
If the drive continues to give you problems, drop it from a very high location, this will prevent you from wasting any more of your precious time on an obtuse hard drive.
As per usual, your mileage may vary, but based from various user testimonials, it works as advertised. I use it personally to maintain my disks.
As no one ever actually answered your question, the following not-exactly-lightning-fast method may be the quickest way to get what you are looking for. 
You may want to control and monitor future bad sector increments by periodically running chkdsk /b and monitoring for dangerous bad sector increment rates using sector scan software.
Alternatively after the first pass you could try spinrite as suggested by happy_soil to see if it can refresh the bad sectors but get the bulk of the data off quickly first as this level of failure is often caused by failing heads, pre-amps or cache in the drive circuitry.  f this is the case and the faults aren't in the media, every second of ru time counts. 
Once you have recovered data or given up and written it off, you could restore the drive to normal use again, but keep important data backed up somewhere else.
In a case like this you can set it to 3 retries instead of the default, 20 or 30 I think.  By adjusting this down to 3 you should still catch all data on weak portions of the drive without wasting crucial time on files that may already be beyond software recovery.  Then when you've captured that round go back and select only the files that failed in the first attempt and retry a few times gradually increasing the number of retries to 10, 20, 50 until you get everything or the drive goes completely flat lined.
If the drive shows signs that it's stable, it could continue working normally again for a long time.
I recently reviewed CBL's new data recovery software and although this drive is technically still running, one of the features it had that I found worthy of mention was the ability to select the number of retry attempts for bad sectors.
ddru_ntfsfindbad's manual says that you CANNOT run it on the original bad drive UNLESS the file system is/was NTFS. So you're ok in your case, but it will almost certainly be faster if you run it on a ddrescue-recovered drive and not the original.  And if the bad sectors are in certain filesystem metadata, you really will need to do this.
chkdsk /b clears bad cluster list and rescans/updates bad cluster list. The bad cluster increase rate may remain stable and the NTFS bad cluster list should keep it under control, the drive may be safe to use again. Remember though that if all the hard drives factory allocated spare clusters have been mapped to bad clusters, then the drive can't map clusters in future and may be heading for eminent failure. Remember though that NTFS monitors bad clusters independently though, so this may not be the final end for the drive. 
While SpinRite won't exactly do what you want, it will try to fix and recover data that are situated on bad sectors.
When it comes to bad sectors on a disk, if there is no backup then what I do is get a backup image of it using a tool called Drive Snapshot:
