I have been using iTunes on a Dell running Windows XP to sync about 60 gigs of songs with my old school iPod. Well, the Dell's hard drive died the other day, and the only place that I have my music is on the iPod (I do have the CDs, but really don't want to have to re-rip 60 gigs of music).
Has anyone recently gone through this process?  Please provide suggestions for copying songs from an iPod formated to work with Windows onto a MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard.
I have used Yamipod in the past with success. It runs on Windows, OS X, and Linux and can even be setup to run directly off the iPod. It allows you to play and manage the songs on your iPod which includes copying songs off of the iPod and onto your computer.
Ars Technica has a whole guide on this. They recommend PodWorks for OS X, iRip for Windows and gtkpod for Linux.
You could use the program SharePod to pull them off the iPod onto another Windows machine. Then import those songs into your Mac's iTunes. Once you're sure all your music is there, you can let your Mac format and sync your iPod. 
So, now I have a shiny new MacBook Pro.  Is there a way to get my songs off of my iPod and onto the MacBook?  I googled, and found Senuti.  But, I'm leery of accidentally formating the iPod and losing my songs, and I can't tell if it is Snow Leopard compatible yet.
I have used PodsBlitz in the past, and I have sung its virtues for years now. It is written in Java and I have tested it personally on Linux and Windows, but I know that it also runs under MacOS without a glitch.
It is safe, very fast and very simple to install: just dump a .jar file in the root of your iPod. Double-click on its icon, choose the songs you want to copy and a destination folder, and voila: instant backup.
