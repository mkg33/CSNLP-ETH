If you have physical access to the server, you can always boot from a rescue disc, or even a liveCD and mount the old filesystem to copy the important stuff off.
Reboot your computer to get to the grub boot screen, press e to edit one of your Grub boot configurations and edit the line starting with kernel. Append init=/bin/sh and boot the modified configuration by pressing b. When you arrived in your shell (without logging in this time) remount your file-system so it's in read/write mode: mount -o remount,rw /. Now you can start changing passwords with passwd now :)...
this will drop you in at a shell prompt, you can then change your password via passwd command or bring up network manually ( ifup eth0 ) and move the files off the machine from single user mode.
Booting in single user mode won't work for Debian and Ubuntu because you still have to enter the root password for maintenance mode.
at boot time press esc to get the grub menu to appear ( just bang on esc key as it begins boot )  and then edit the menu line to a ' single' to the end of it. Or you can choose Rescue mode, this will also let you do recovery as well.
