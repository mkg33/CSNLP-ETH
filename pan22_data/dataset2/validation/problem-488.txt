Be aware, however, that we're talking analog signaling here.  Cable quality is a very significant concern as is the length of the cables and the amount of ambient interference in the environment.  Also the equipment quality plays a big factor.
S-Video was even better because of the same principle, separating out the video components onto their own carriers as well.
In the analog days of yore, component was always the preferred method of connecting video equipment simply because the video and the two audio signals all had their own separate carrier and thus would not interfere with each other.
For the best possible quality, use very short, high quality S-video cables, and do the capture in a room that's as far away from your WiFi, microwaves, cell phones, etc. as possible.
From my short experience it's very rare that you get worse signal in RCA, only in cases of bad grounding.
When capturing old VHS(or cable) to PC, which jacks to use for the highest quality? RCA(composite) or RF? If the PC card supports it would S-video/component be better? Is there a general signal strength comparison between these different connectors?
