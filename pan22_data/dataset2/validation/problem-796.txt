In the cases I've had of this (i.e. "I never got the message!"), I've always stopped at "I can see on the server that it was delivered to your mailbox.  There are things that could have happened at that point, but I can't be sure what might have happened if you didn't see it."  
We had the company president "storing" messages in his Trash folder once...  Right up until the day his assistant emptied the Trash.  Then we spent some time with both of them helping them figure out a folder structure that they could both live with.
If that's the case then I personally would probably just stop at this point and show the email was deleivered to the server and leave it at that.  Trying to prove users are lying never ends up good.
Their response... "Well I don't know if I was FOR SURE sitting at my PC between 4:45pm and 5:00pm... someone could have come along and deleted it!"
Aside from the obvious (DON'T save things in your TRASH folder) I was able to prove it was NOT conspiracy by grabbing screen shots and the proxy log for that computer.  The user CLEARLY (accidentally) deleted their own Trash folder. (web based email client)
One last anecdote: the Vice President's assistant at the time didn't trust her boss to keep the right messages, so we set up a mailbox that duplicated all his messages for her to work with.  She'd keep everything, even if he deleted stuff.
If your logs are showing the mail was delivered to the SERVER then I think the only step beyond that (if you choose to do so) is to look in the user's mailbox, etc.
At this point its very important to just "state the facts".  I'm not saying YOU did it... I'm saying that YOUR PC issued a deleteFolder command at exactly 4:47pm.  So, whoever was sitting at your desk at 4:47pm did it.
I recently had a case where a user "stored" emails in their "Trash" folder (don't ask why) and then lost over 600 of their "stored" emails when the trash folder was deleted.  They INSISTED someone logged into their email account and emptied the trash.
One thing you need to check is if the user has any Outlook rules that automatically moved or deleted the message.
