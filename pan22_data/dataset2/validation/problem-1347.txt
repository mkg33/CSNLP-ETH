If you want static rather than dynamic data you can copy column c afterwards and paste special(values).
none of these answers will work.  what WILL work is to take the destination sheet, filter what you want to insert, put a color fill into the selection, un-filter, then sort (not filter) by color.  you can paste your information on the sorted by color cells, then change the color back to the original color and re-sort by whatever method you had before.
A better approach might be to use an IF formula something like =if(A2='filter criteria',B2,"") in column C. 
You have to do it the other way around. Copy/paste everything, filter out what you want to keep then delete the contents.
You can also do this by copying as normal and using the paste special "values" function.  However, you must paste on to a completely separate excel session for this method to work.  You can then copy from the new session back to the original session.
Yes, I agree this is stupid. You can do it using the 'fill handle' - select the cells you want to copy and drag the fill handle across to copy them into the next column. This only works for a contiguous selection, and only if you're copying into the adjacent column. But presumably you could always move your column temporarily. I can't see any other way to do it without recourse to VBA.
