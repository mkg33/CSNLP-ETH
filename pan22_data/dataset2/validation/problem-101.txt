Tim Berners-Lee admits that this was intended to separate the protocol for the address, but turned out to be unnecessary.
It think it literally means "Whack! Whack!", from the really early times where actually getting a connection to a site demanded some voodoo and you had to sacrifice (whack) not one, but TWO chickens to please the WorldWideWeamons.. :)
xx:// is used to specify the protocol used, it's a double / so it can't be confused with just being a subfolder.
I use URLs all the time typing them in with and without "//" after the "http:" but what does the "//" really stand for?
There is an answer for that in Tim Berners-Lee's FAQ (link found in the slashdot discussion mentioned at @Evan Anderson's answer). Basically, he copied the filename syntax from Apollo Domain, where starting a path with a double slash followed by the name of a computer was used to transparently access files in other computers (a single slash is still the root directory). He simply prepended it with the protocol, in this case http.
That special case still exists in the Unix standards, where two slashes at the beginning of a file name may be interpreted in an implementation-defined manner (three or more slashes are equivalent to just one). And the same convention is widely used in Windows, only with backslashes instead of forward slashes (it is called a UNC path there).
