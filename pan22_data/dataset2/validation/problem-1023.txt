Our MX record points to a frontend SMTP server, which contains aliases for actually routing the mail.  No alias, no access to the backend storage server, which is what our clients connect to.
See http://www.postfix.org/ldap_table.5.html and http://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html for more information (and what you need to put in ldap_virtual.cf).
I'm upgrading the backend email server.  Currently, a user is created for every email user on the server, which creates the mailbox.  On the new server, everything autheticates through PAM to an LDAP server (all of which is working properly).  My goal is to get Postfix to create the Maildir directory for the user automatically.  This works fine when I have the /home directory with 777 permissions, but for obvious reasons, this should be avoided.  I would like to do this with 775 permissions on /home with a group owner of whatever user Postfix is running as, but I can't seem to figure out what user to use.  With the 777 permissions, the /home/$user/Maildir directory is created on message delivery.  Does anybody know how I can do this without 777 permissions?
Add your domains to virtual_mailbox_domains. Create a virtual_mailbox_maps map which takes in the username as input and returns username/Maildir as output.
I've been beating my head against a wall for a while now on this one.  Basically, here is the rundown:
In LDAP, create your mailbox path relative to $HOME for vmail (so the maildir becomes /home/vmail/user/Maildir/).
The answer to this varies depending on how your Postfix system is configured. You mention pam and LDAP, so I assume you have all your domains in $mydestination, or you use only one domain (example.com, for instance)
You create a single system user, without login privileges. I shall assume a username and group of vmail:vmail here, but the specific name is not important.
The general permissions for /home are 755 with owner and group both root, but the user can write within ~user. Hence Postfix will happily deliver to ~user/Maildir/, but will not be able to create ~user. Using virtual users will sidestep this issue by granting access to all mailboxes to a single uid/gid, which is then accessed only by your pop3/imap software.
FWIW, Postfix runs the local delivery process as the uid/gid of the system user you are delivering to. 
It may be easier for you to configure virtual_mailbox_domains with LDAP maps instead of mysql/pgsql maps (the logic is exactly the same though).
