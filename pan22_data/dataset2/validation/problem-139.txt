The other possibility is that you are using a corporate PC and your company doesn't want you wasting bandwidth listening to music on their dime.  If so, get the Pandora app for your cell phone--I use the BlackBerry app at work all the time and it's great.
Chances are something is redirecting pandora.com to 127.0.0.1, which is your local machine. Is this a work computer? Sometimes primitive content restriction systems handle blacklisted URLs this way.
Someone had (I would bet a small amount) edited the %windows%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file.  (Path will vary on 64-bit systems.)  Remove the line that refers to pandora.com.
I encountered this via my IPhone 6 Plus. You can try to go to Setting & clear your History & Mobile Data. It's works for my case. 
On our work homepage there is a link to our marketing studio. When we are on the wifi at our office we have no issues opening the marketing studio through our homepage. When we open the marketing studio while on a different wifi server, whether that be home, hotspot, etc it redirects us to the IIS7 page. IF you all could please help in any way it would be greatly appreciated. 
You are probably running IIS7 on your machine. I would start by either diabling the world wide web service on you computer or uninstalling it. Then try to get to pandora.com and see what happens.
