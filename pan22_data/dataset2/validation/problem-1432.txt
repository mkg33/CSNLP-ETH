If using Google Apps, the gmail server creates a sent mail label for every message.  Sync then copies this to the sent items folder in Outlook.  It is smart enough to handle duplicates if you have Outlook set to copy all sent mail to Sent Items but not smart enough to handle the above rule, so you end up with duplicates of every sent message.
1) Create a rule to make a copy of every message that is sent in your inbox and then switch off saving of mail into "Sent Items".  Your sent messages will then be threaded in your inbox and you can just move the entire conversation to wherever you please.  However, this method is problematic if using google apps sync (as I am).  See below.
This issue has driven me nuts for almost a year but today I finally figured out a work around after 4 hours of trying (yes I'm a bit ocd).  There are two workarounds:
2) There is a simpler way to move all messages in a conversation including those in sent and that's what I've just found.  Expand the conversation completely.  Highlight all the messages by click the top one and shift clicking the bottom one.  Drag to desired folder.  Done.  I've trawled the net for months for a solution and haven't seen this one anywhere.  I'm just relieved I finally got a solution - the problem almost drove me out of Outlook to Googles awful web interface (gmail concepts are fantastic - the UI is just awful.  I wish they'd implement a stand alone email client so that all the problems of being in a web browser are resolved).
