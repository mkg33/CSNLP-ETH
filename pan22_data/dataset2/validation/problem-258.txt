I don't see where routers come into it. Because you'd have the same question if there was just one router.
Then R1 and R2 have to bqe doing NAPT. (NAPT is NAT but also one to many).  So the SSH server communicates with R1's IP address and R2's IP address. Each connection is at a different port..
And if one computer can initiate multiple connections, then you can say each connection is distinct by being initiated by a different IP:PORT
So each sSH session, from the SSH server's perspective, which is a good perspective to be looking from.. as it sess all the connections to it.  Each ssh session can be identified by IP:PORT  where IP is R1's IP or R2's IP. And whatever port.
If you have multiple computers behind a NAPT router and they're accessing the Internet, that doesn't require port forwarding, but it does require port translation. The website just sees the NAPT Router's IP. The NAPT router distinguishes each connection, as it opens local client ports up to communicate with the websites, and any local client port it opens up is going to be associated with one of the private IPs connected to it.
