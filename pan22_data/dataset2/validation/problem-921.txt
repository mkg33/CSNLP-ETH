Single user will kick everyone off but then you will be the first one back on with the backup. Then when you are done set it back to multi_user.
I write Minion Backup and this kind of thing would be very easy to do.  We allow you to run Pre and Post code before each DB, so for your SharePoint DB, you can just put it into single-user mode and change it back when it's done.  However, we can't guarantee that you'll be the one to get that connection.
SQL does not allow to backup a database when in offline mode. You can also create maintenance plans in order to automate the job. So the first step of you job can be setting the offline databases to online mode and then the maintenance plan will do is work and then the third step will be to set your databases back to online.
Second you might consider using Minion Backup.  It's a free automated backup script that is supposed to be both very powerful and easy to use.  The writers may very well have a config specifically for SharePoint or at the very least you can ask them.  http://minionware.net/#miniontabs|2
