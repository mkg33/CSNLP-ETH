Depending on your OS you might have the '/srv/configs/apache/sites_enabled/default' file active. Remove (rename) it, restart the server and you should be fine. Like Dom mentioned check the folder. I tend to not delete files. but rename it like default.c__onf. This excludes it from the loading process.
I had to convert my httpd.conf to Unix line endings (\n) even on Windows (ordinarily \r\n); otherwise I would receive this error.
Apart from that you load every module available to your distribution. You should remove those not required.
Rename, or remove index.html or index.php from /srv/www  - Directory lists will only show in the absence of an index file - which is present and showing the 'It works!' message.
Are you browsing to the server ip/hostname or the virtual host hostname? (Can use a hosts file if it isn't in DNS). Virtual hosts will only work when the specified hostname (in this case projects.com) is called. Check your apache log to see what is being called.
Please note that you are  getting the " It works" page because the apache is showing its default page.  You need to give the correct permission for the /srv/www/ folder  so that apache can  show the contents.
