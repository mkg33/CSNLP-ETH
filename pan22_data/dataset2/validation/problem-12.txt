The majority of the biggest computers on the planet are large clusters of many individual nodes, each of which is often ver much a standard server.
Without knowing the nature of the video "transformation", what software you are using, or the level of scripting/programming at your disposal, it will be impossible to comment further.
See http://www.top500.org/, specifically the breakdown by architecture: http://www.top500.org/stats/list/33/archtype.
In your specific case, you have many files to transform.  if each file can be transformed independently of the others, it's almost easy: distribute them among the machines and put them all to transform their own files.
Given that you describe the problem as "a large number of video files to transform", yes, this would work on a cluster.
It's possible, but there'd be a fair amount of work involved in building a cluster. It's difficult to say more without more information
Can I have someone sit at each computer and do part of the problem, and will that speed things up?  In other words, can the problem be split into chunks that are basically independent?
IOW, what you have to do is to create some program that runs on each of your computers, and performs part of the problem.
Adobe After effects has a sort of clustering mode they call "network render" but it isn't an ideal solution. (last time I checked it involved rendering your video out to an imagine sequence, which would then presumably need to be recombined into a video for your use)
The answer to your question depends largely on the software you are using to "transform" these video files, and what that entails.
The master computer runs a script which looks in each of the shared folders.  If they have nothing in them then put one file to be transformed.  If they have a file named done_yourfilenamehere then move it to the done folder.  Loop until nothing is left in the master folder.  
Basically all the clients should be kept as busy as possible, with each client taking what ever time they needed to transform each file.
what you're "creating" is not "a faster computer", but a cluster.  which is nothing more than a group of computers used together.
every so often, and, if something is in the shared folder, renames it to work_yourfilenamehere and runs your transform.  When it's done it renames it to done_yourfilenamehere.  If not, just wait for 60 secs or so.
