what you want is a NIC Team or Bridge.  Both technologies basically allow both your adapters to act as a single unit.
Will this effectively cover myself so that if one method hiccups or momentarily drops, the other will maintain a constant connection? or will it still drop connections while it switches from one NIC to the other?
This would definitely help you in the event that one NIC has a minor problem, however - be aware that this obviously wouldn't help if your internet connection or router has a hiccup.
It is definitely worth googling to see if your hardware supports teaming - if not, setup a windows bridged connection.  This short guide will talk you through the process
If you really needed redundant connectivity, you would really want to run the two nics on separate wifi networks on separate frequencies.  Perhaps you would connect one to a 5ghz network and the other to a 2.4ghz network, that way interference on one interface is not very likely to affect the other.
Of course this all assumes that your problem is something about your wireless link.  If problems you have are upstream from the wireless ap/router, then the above would be wasted.
In any case, if you are using wireless as your tags suggest, the far better solution would be to run a piece of wire.
If you just added to identical wireless nics and connected to the same AP, then the issues that cause loss of connectivity are just as likely to connect both the radios on your client.  You wouldn't improve anything
Given your tags I you are talking about a wireless network.  I suspect this will not help as much as you are hoping.
Your next challenge is that most desktop versions of Windows don't support teaming natively, and very few drivers support any kind of teaming of wifi interfaces.  Without bonding at layer two, this would all be pointless.
