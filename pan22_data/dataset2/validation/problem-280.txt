Download a hardware monitor (HWMonitor, HWInfo, Speccy, etc...), check your temperatures.  If they're too hot, get a new heatsink.  "Too hot" depends on your CPU, so look it up on the manufacturer's website.  There you will find the maximum operating temperature (either on the spec sheet or datasheet).
Heat sinks will get hot. Heat is relative. If your computer is running fine with no abnormal reboots and shutdowns then everything should be ok. And as long as there is thermal paste between the cpu and heatsink. You can use a cpu monitor to check the temperture of the cpu. There are widgets if you are using Vista/Win7 to keep an eye on cpu temps too. With a monitor you can make sure the cpu is running within the correct temp range.
Again, if the heatsink wasn't working (read: not attached to the CPU anymore), it wouldn't get hot at all.  All that heat would be trapped in the CPU die instead.
My computer gets extremely hot where the fan and heatsink are. The fan works, so I think the problem must be with the heatsink, even though that seems very unlikely, since it's passive.  Thought I'd see what you think before I buy a new heatsink/fan unit.
And indeed it should.  If it didn't, I would begin to worry where that heat is going.  Your CPU generates a finite amount of heat, so your heatsink can't magically "get hotter" then normal.  It does, however, get colder if it doesn't work.
