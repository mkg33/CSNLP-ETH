If you're bridging IP traffic over to your own router, then the previous modem/router(called a home gateway) just hands all traffic through to yours, so its attack surface is essentially nil. It will only talk to local addresses as private IP space wont be routed by your ISP. As long as the new router for the network has firewalling in place you're just as safe as any other user, possibly more if the original is ISP supplied.
I have a router that I want to plug into a  modem/router too (the latter is a poor router) and the advice I'm getting is to set the modem / router to full bridge mode, like so: https://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/adsl_modem_router_bridge_mode
With the detailed advice I've been given for my model, this involves turning off the firewall on the modem/router (I think essentially it's just acting as a modem).
Or, is it unimportant (because working as a modem, it only looks at layer 2 header while the firewall process looks at layer 3 header - apologies if I'm way out with this)?
