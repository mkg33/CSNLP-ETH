All of these are free, and some are more integrated than others. Zenoss has the benefit of tying together a lot of things out of the box, and the option of enterprise level support. Being based on Zope, it's a little more resource intensive to run than the others, but very easy to hack on if you know Python.
Zenoss does everything you want out of the box and can work over either SSH or SNMP. I've also previously used Zabbix as a full on monitoring system, and previous to that Cacti for trends and Nagios for alerting. 
There are various methods for collecting information from machines being monitored. Whichever monitoring solution you choose, I recommend collecting information from each system directly by SNMP. If you're unfamiliar, it'll take a small bit of learning. In the end however, it's the standard solution that Just Works.
What's your suggested tool to monitor multiple Unix (Linux and OSX specifically) based systems at the same time?  I need to monitor the utilization of the CPU, memory, and disks in real time and would prefer a single tool to do so.
The key for monitoring multiple linux/unix hosts with nagios is creating a tarball that can sit on all of them.  Spend a little time on the front end, and your life will be a breeze later on.  Just unpack it annd you are good to go.
Nagios is free, popular and open source. There are a lot of monitoring plugins availble (for different devices and services). Unless you use a separate GUI, configuration is by text file. It sends alerts notification e-mails, which is how my organisation traps and responds to system problems (alerts into a ticket system).
If you're willing to set up SNMP, MRTG is quite good. It's quite complicated, unfortunately so requires a certain amount of work to setup. If you're not looking for trend graphing specifically, nagios is reasonably good, as recommended earlier. It's also got several plugins which allow it to do trend graphing (Nagiosgraph is what we use.). Munin is ok, but its graphs are in my experience more than a little overcomplicated. Bigbrother can do monitoring, but I'd avoid it if at all possible. It's more than a little bit of a train wreck.
