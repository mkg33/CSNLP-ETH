Backing up in depth is quite important, simply because you have to ask yourself when did this file get deleted, or damaged?  A week ago?  Two days?  Two hours?  Two months?  If your backup doesn't extend more than a day or two, you might as well not be backing up.  A week?  Or two weeks?  Certainly, but what if the file was damaged a month ago? 
With TimeMachine, it's expensive, but typically not that expensive to go further...My Timemachine backup at work goes back to May...  It's almost 3/4ths full...  But it's available as I need it, and I'm storing other data on the drive as well...  
A reasonable backup should give you at least 90 days of backup, why?  For the backup in depth, but because with most backup systems, it gets too expensive to build the storage pool further...  Tapes are typically around $30-75 (or higher) for around 60 Gb (compressed).  
For any backup solution the bigger the better.  You can purchase 1 TB external drives with Firewire & USB for $125 - 150...  And while that can be considered expensive, consider what the purchase price was 1 or two years ago.
