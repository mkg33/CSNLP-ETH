You can perhaps try this to reinitialize your TCP/IP stack: http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/299357. If still not successful, you might have to reinstall Windows.
You definitely have a DNS resolution problem according to wireshark (see http://www.wildpackets.com/resources/compendium/tcp_ip/unreachable for descriptions on the errors), and your virtual switch only has default IPv6 DNS servers and your physical adaptor only has google IPv4 DNS servers. Do you still get the same behaviour when DNS is working correctly?
This sort of broken IP stack is usually caused by a firewall. Assuming the trace was produced on 192.168.1.5 itself (which seems like the case based on timing of the packets), then the broken firewall must also be on 192.168.1.5.
You probably have some kind of firewall installed on your system, that blocks the outgoing icmp packet.
Disable the "Carte Ethernet vEthernet (Internal Ethernet Port Windows Phone Emulator Internal Switch)" adaptor (Run ncpa.cpl, right click) and try an IPv4 ping again. If you can ping correctly, it's probably the configuration in your vEthernet adaptor. Re-enable the adaptor.
This is not standards compliant. First of all ICMP is a mandatory part of IP, so not supporting ICMP is not valid. Secondly it makes no sense to be sending ICMP packets and simultaneously saying you do not support ICMP.
As it appears that you can't ping your own computer, the problem seems to be purely software, as the loopback interface is not passing through your network card. Either Windows has a corrupted TCP/IP stack or configuration for some reason, or something is preventing TCP/IP from correctly working (this can be a legitimate software, like an anti-virus, that for some reason is not working as it should, or it can be a malware that has severe side-effects).
Perhaps it's worth verifying if it's enabled.  If it is, try disabling it and then seeing if that helps your problem.  It's helped me in the past with funky issues with VM's and vpn connections.
Try disabling IPv6 and enabling IPv4 on the vEthernet adaptor. If still not working, under Advanced set your metric to 1.
