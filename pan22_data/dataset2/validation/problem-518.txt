I need to modify my development environment, a virtual image using Windows 2003 SP2, to install the SMTP service under IIS (6.0).  The virtual image is a corporate build, and I do not have access to the installation disc (and going through the corporate channels, this may take several days).  Is there any way I can add the SMTP service without the install disc?  
I've been able to successfully install SNMP, for Windows 2003 Server, which requires the "second CD" or "i386" folder to complete the installation. Rather than finding and transferring that large amount or finding a way to mount it from a remote location. I've now just packed up my own SNMP requirements folder for when installing SNMP for Windows 2003. The required files, found in the i386 folder, include:
I Agreed with Sam, if you don't have the disk or i386 folder, then you'll probably have difficulties.
You could try downloading Sp2, and extracting the i386 folder from it (it's a while ago when I tried that, and can't remember if it worked).
I have had some good luck with and extracted SP2 i386 folder in the past though, and - if memory serves - it worked fine one time with IIS.
IMHO, the easiest way to do it is to pay a visit to your sysadmin team, and bring along cookies. Or beer, beer is good too.
If there is alternative way of having an email service working on the virtual image, that also would be useful. 
The only one I was not able to find was apver.vbs. I had to track that down online. I zipped it up and shared it to myself for easy access/deployment when needed. It's roughly 500KB compared to the 600MB I would need if finagling the "required" CD.
