On the server end I configure the server correctly, and then locally I use the 'ghost' rubygem to modify my hosts (well the OS X equivalent), so I can test all is correct before flipping over DNS
Finally, you can setup a domain in your local hosts file, and point it to your server's IP, and use that domain to hit the server.
However, I do not yet have a domain pointing at my server, so I'm not sure what I should put for the ServerName parameter.  I have tried the IP address, but when I do that, restarting Apache gives
You've got a few options.  First, can you just browse to your server hostname, ie:  http://efate/ ?  If so, you're set.
I might be wrong in thinking that the reason I have been unable to get this to work is related to not having a domain name.  This is the first time I have used Apache directly - any help would be most gratefully received!
The versions of Ubuntu I've been using have the virtual server config files in /etc/apache/sites-enabled. I suspect that the "It works" page is being served from /var/www/htdocs and is specified in the /etc/apache/sites-enabled/000-default file.  Once you've edited this config file you might be able to access it just by using the machine name.
I sort of had a similar problem with my rails, except that in this case, I didn't need a domain name. What I did was to setup my vhost contain on a different port all together:
The Passenger installation instructions say I should add the following to my Apache configuration file - I assume this is /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.
where "efate" is my server's host name.  But now pointing my browser at the server's IP address just gives a page saying "It works!" - presumably this is a default page, but I'm not sure where this is being served from.
