What about data? According to this page, the TSA can take a copy of all your data for any reason without suspicion of wrongdoing when crossing the US border. The data may be shared with other agencies.
Mobile 4-post racks, yes.  Expensive, but if you do a lot of travel, it might be worth it.  And you can certainly mount a 1, 2, 3, or 4u box.  If you're willing to pay the price for this, be sure to include a UPS unit in it, there are several to be had that are rackmount-ready.  Do this because you don't know the power situation ahead of time.
Unless you cook up a homebrew setup of some kind (dolly cart, etc.) you're probably going to have a hard time.  I certainly wouldn't put a server though luggage, that's a sure-fire way to end up with a box of broken contents.  Maybe look into packing a powerful, high-end PC class board into a portable LAN party case that doesn't have blazing dragons and etched tattoos on it?
If you are shipping servers around, are you carrying commercially sensitive data that could harm your business if it got into the hands of your competitors?
I suspect that it may be cheaper to buy a ATA-approved shipping container and send the computer via UPS/FEDEX.  I've sent computers overseas this way before.  I think we got our shipping container from Time Motion Tools -- or one of the other tool vendors.  Try Google with "computer shipping containers."
Pack a regular bag if you can, and unzip it for them to look around.  If it looks suspicious, then it is.
Try to act like a terrorist.  Then they'll know you're not really a terrorist, because no real terrorist would actually act like a terrorist.  Real terrorists would act like they are not terrorists, and the TSA knows this, so if you are trying to act like you are not a terrorist they will naturally assume you are one. :)
Does it look like a bomb?  Is it clearly accessable (openable)?  Can it hide a bomb?  I've seen CPAP machines receive swabs for explosive chemical tests because the TSA can't open it up to look in it.
NOTE: After every trip and before you power anything on, open up the servers and ensure that nothing has wiggled loose.  I don't say this from experience but from paranoia.  There may be some big bumps on the ride.
