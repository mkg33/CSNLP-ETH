The issue here seems to be that you don't have root access on this host to change the system startup scripts like /etc/rc.local.  The idea of using a @reboot line in your user crontab is worth exploring.  I haven't tried that as a normal user but it should work.
The other idea is as you say to run something in your user crontab every few minutes, check if your process is running, and restart if not.  For example:
I guess I could have a cron job run every minute, or 5 minutes, and have it somehow check if the process was already running (not sure how to do that).
I am assuming you have no access to sudo. These leaves you with just one option, adding a script in crontab that checks if the process is running, and if it not, then start it up. You also gain a kind of availability enhancement (eg. if your process crashes, it is started up again).
be very careful with this sort of thing - if you make a mistake you will end up starting an extra copy of your program every 5 minutes which could eventually cause a lot of problems.
Depending on your distribution (you did not mention it), you have a pretty wide area of choice: chkconfig, rcconf, /etc/(rc.d/)rc.local, symlinking startup scripts in init.d\rc.d - but all these require root privilege.  
Would that be the best way or is there another like .startup script in my home directory that I could put a script in?
