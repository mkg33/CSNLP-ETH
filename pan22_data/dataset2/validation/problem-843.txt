So one of the things I tried was installing from the recovery mode. And it took about 2 hours to get this message:
When the update started the screen went completely black, so I thought it needs me to press the power button, which I did. After a few minutes the log in screen showed up, which was absolutely unexpected of course. So I tried to fill out my password, but it did not take it. I tried it about 20 times, and I am pretty sure the password was right, but it did not let me in. I tried a lot of stuff to fix it and install the update, but nothing worked.
I also have an external hard drive with Catalina installed. And it works fine when I connect it to the Mac via USB. I also tried to replicate it from the external drive to internal. Well first of all it posted a lot of errors(which I do not remember), but after I somehow managed to copy the drive Mac failed to boot from the internal drive. It boots from external drive, but the same copy does not boot from the internal.
You may think that the drive is corrupted, but I checked it with diskutils, and it shows it as a completely healthy drive.
