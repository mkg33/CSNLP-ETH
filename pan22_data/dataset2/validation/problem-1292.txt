/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches does not have a use in system operations. Don't use it, only makes things slower. 
One guess at how much RAM would be enough is from the kernel, Committed_AS. Enough to not page out. Which can be a problematic metric, but it is one of the few that directly estimates physical RAM usage.  From your meminfo output, about 23 GB, or 150% of MemTotal. Half again what you have might be fine for some workloads, but I would be uncomfortable on a system with no swap and suspected memory capacity issues. 
Since I've found discussion of buffers/cache on that site, not Unix of SE, I post my question here. I've read In Linux, what is the difference between "buffers" and "cache" reported by the free command? and Meaning of the buffers/cache line in the output of free, where it is written:
Even ignoring Cached as if it were zero, this system already has relatively high memory utilization. AnonPages + Shmem is 14 GB and changes, alone only 1 GB less than MemTotal. And indeed, add in other stuff and MemAvailable is 0.5 GB.
Currently free reports 8Gb of buffers/cache, however, system when approaching zero free memory becomes unresponsive for long time and sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches does not change much. Why? I post output of free -m and also more detailed output of cat /proc/meminfo:
Some totals add up to more than 100% because the virtual memory system is being both lazy and clever. But only so much it can do. Shared memory (presumably a database) and apps anonymous memory adding to nearly as much as the host risks miserable performance.
Well, it does have some uses, but they tend to be corner cases. Testing storage with a cold cache, unusual virtual memory workloads.  See previously on Server Fault: Why drop caches in Linux?
