Just changing the name will make a cosmetic change only and not affect the underlying files/folders in the profile. You have to make a whole new user account named the way you want. Then you can copy your old profile to the new one. Note that the user account for your daily work should be a Standard account, not Administrator. Here are instructions for doing that (assumes you don't already have an extra administrative account made and are using a single administrative account for your daily work):
Let me know if you want any more details about this. Of course you don't have to copy the old, incorrectly named account if you don't want to. You can just copy over the data using Windows Explorer.
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).
In that view you can change the account name simply by right-clicking on the relevant account and selecting Rename.
It looks like the answer is no, not through the menu - but you can manually change the values by editing the registry values described in this KB article.
