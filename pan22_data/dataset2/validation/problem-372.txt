Make sure not to add too high of a degree to your polynomial or you will be overfitting!! This means although you characterize your training data perfectly, it will not generalize well to new instances. Thus this will be a useless model. That is why you need to split your training and testing data, that way you can verify if the model you build using your training data can generalize. 
Let's convert these to matrices. We will also add a column of 1's to the end of the $X$ matrix. This will be used to train the bias value.
Look at the dimensions of our weights vector. It only has 2 values. One value associated with $x$, the first column of our $X$ matrix, and a bias, associated with the 1's column that we added. The equation of this line is described as
In this case your feature matrix $X$ has a single dimension. Each point in your graph has a $y$ value that depends only on 1 value of $x$. 
Just to add a little, you stop when you see that your loss isn't improving any more as such or is improving at the 5th decimal place..
