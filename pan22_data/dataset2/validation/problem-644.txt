All in all, groupware in OS X Server is a collection of loosely integrated pieces. It doesn't offer very much, but what is offers is mostly easy to use and administer, and might be just enough for what Apple appears to consider it's typical server customers: Small creative agencies and the like. If you want more, every major groupware suite (Exchange, Zimbra, OX etc) will put Apples solution to shame. 
There are more but most of them have already been mentioned. Remember that hosting websites and being email servers is not the only thing servers do.
I don't understand why people think OS X server is more expensive than Windows.  You have to compare feature for feature what you're getting to get a fair matchup.  Windows does one thing or the other out of the box and requires additional licensing for extra stuff; Mac OS does it all.
I have two Mac OS X file servers that have ~40TB capacity combined.  I use these in the Golden Triangle approach in our Active Directory environment, and it's definitely my server of choice.  With ZFS coming soon, it will be a no-brainer to use OS X server as the platform of choice.
This is still a very new development, and honestly something I really don't understand where Apple is heading with. 
Other major advantages of using Mac OS X Server (at least for Snow Leopard Server) are the following:
First, I have to admit that I don't yet really use MacOS iCal server, and also have very limited experience with any other groupware solution, both as user and admin. Nevertheless, my impression from toying around: 
My former employer bought one to support some Macs in infrastructure. In the end, it was a miserable failure, after a year of below-bar support, broken features and instability we scrapped the whole mix-in-some-macs project and sold all the Apple hardware we had.
The primary reason I chose OS X over Linux is AFP, which is faster than SMB.  Yeah, I can use netatalk on Linux, but it makes a mess on the file system.
We have one where I work, installed before I started there. It's used only as a file server for the graphic artists, who of course use Macs. While it's a magnificent machine it's also a complete waste of resources as there is no reason the files couldn't be stored on the main Windows file server (I've been overruled). I'm sure there are those who use a Mac server to advantage but I'm sorry to say we don't.
