What devices/software can you recommend? We need to have fully working ~1000mbit/sec link with the minimal system load. For example, if the offices will be connected with OpenVPN or similar software, will it be able to handle a gigabit connection? What server load should we expect? All servers are equipped with a similar CPUs - Core Quad 9440 but of course I don't want to use the whole CPU for VPN.
It may be that the CPU cost of a VPN solution is too high, but I highly recommend at least trying it out.  It's the simple, low-cost solution, and it's very likely that performance will be fine.
We have 2 offices connected with a fiber optics cables. On both sides FO is inserted into the fiber ports in the switches but we can install fiber pci-e cards in some servers if required.
The fiber cable goes about 500m thru a public areas, it's easily accessible and could be used by someone to get access inside our LAN.
Worst case, do exactly what you suggested: get a machine at each end to act as a router and forward packets over an openvpn link between them.  No extra load on any other machines, and openVPN is pretty light, so it should be reasonable even on the routers.
I would definitely recommend a hardware firewall device at each end with a persistent VPN connection between them, if you are worried about fiber splicing.
Having some separate device would be better, especially if the bridge will be transparent to TCP/IP.
A slightly better case would be to check out what Cisco or Juniper has in the way of a small office router that can handle gigabit.  A quick google shows up SafeNet as having a product that claims to be able to handle up to 10gE, but it's hard to find a price for it online, so YYMV.
The offices are small, all people generally trust each other, the LAN is insecure inside and we would rather leave it this way than building a strong security.
Have you done any testing with common VPN solutions?  Try it.  I think you'll find that the performance impact of the encryption is acceptable.  Modern block ciphers, like AES, are very efficient, and modern CPUs are very fast.  For example, one core of my 2 GHz (Intel T2600) laptop can encrypt 120 MBps.  I expect that the CPU cost of encrypting a gigabit per second on your 9440s would be less than 50% of one of your four cores.
You don't need to buy fiber cards for the server, see if you can't create a VLAN on the switches which includes the fiber link port and a port to a secondary ethernet card in the server.  Then set up a VPN between them and route internal traffic over it.
The offices have no dedicated server rooms so we would like to avoid installing any loud industrial switches/routers.
