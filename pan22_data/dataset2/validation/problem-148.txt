Most files will be consolidated into one block each. That's the minimum requirement and definition of "defragmenter".
More advanced defragmenters will move directories first (since they are, on a per-megabyte average, accessed more frequently than ordinary files), followed by files accessed recently. Files which have not been accessed for a long time (typically 90 days) are sometimes actively placed closer to the end, to allow for shorter seeks for files which do get accessed.
The "seek" times on SSDs are minimal, on the order of microseconds. You're looking at the wrong places if you defrag SSDs for seeks. (An intelligent SSD controller could merely update WHERE the data are moved, rather than moving them, each time it detects the "read old data + wite same data + TRIM old data" pattern, economizing on both write cycles AND defrag runtime. Not sure if any controller does that yet.)
NTFs seems to fragment only slightly less than FAT but to degrade more slowly if it is. Some of the important file are not at the front of the partition but near the middle, obviously to cut the worst case access time in half. Not sure about it, though.
On a second thought, yes, SSDs distribute writes across chips on purpose, because that's how they are faster, and heavy fragmentation might slow the write patterns by making the writes LESS scattered. That might be a factor to consider if it's true.
Always, and regularly, do your backups. If you defrag disks for ease of data recovery, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!
