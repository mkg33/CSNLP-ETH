This can also be caused by having both click-to-run (e.g., Office 365 downloaded) and MSI (regular installer) installed Office applications on a computer at the same time. For example, if you install Visio from a volume license ISO download and then install Office 2013 Pro Plus using an Office 365 E3 license by downloading it from the portal, you can get this error.
My user had this issue because they had both Office 2013 ProPlus and Office 365 installed.  We fixed it by uninstalling both Office 2013 and 365 and reinstalling Office 365.
To resolve it uninstall the stand alone OneNote 2013 install and then reinstall OneNote from the Office Suite in Programs and Features (in my case Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013).
Recently OneNote 2013 was made free, on a new Development Machine I had installed OneNote, however a few months later I realized that I needed the rest of the Office Suite on this machine. Installing from Media I opted not to install OneNote (because it was already installed of course!).
