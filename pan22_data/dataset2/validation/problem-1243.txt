Now wether that's unsafe or not, i don't know, but i'd simply leave only up to the max in to be safe.
In general, it will depend on the BIOS and hardware. It won't be able to handle the big modules but if there are still smaller modules available, the system might decide to just start up with the memory of just the smaller modules. But in general, the BIOS won't be able to use it thus your system would have no free RAM to use.
Assuming that you install the correct type that this motherboard accepts, anything above 2GB won't be addressed and will be ignored.
This really depends on your MotherBoard.  I have seen some cases where the system functions as normal but will only recognize the 2gb, and I have seen some that will not start up and throw an error.
I've done it on an older computer, and the computer booted just fine - however the BIOS / start up scrolling list only reported what the maximum for the motherboard was, so it was presumably ignored.
Been there, done this. The BIOS complained about the RAM and refused to start up. I had to downgrade again. But this was an old Pentium 133 from Dell and about 4 PC's in the past.
