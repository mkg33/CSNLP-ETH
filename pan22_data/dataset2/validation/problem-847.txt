Someone is hosting the DNS for the domain now.  If you look at the actual registration for the domain, name servers must be provided.  When you register the domain, generally the registering company assigns their own name servers.  There should be some way for you to add the CNAME entry using that mechanism.
That being said, you'll have much more flexibility running your own DNS server - you can create your own subdomains for example. Depending on your name registrar you might want to park the domain with them since they might offer tools for that.
For real-live, actual DNS hosting, I have been loving ZoneEdit for more years than I can remember.  Your first 5 domains are free, and the next are a small one-time cost.  You can manage everything over the web and they do basic email and web hosting.
I'm starting a small web design shop. We does not have much money so we would like to keep our costs as low as possible.
So we are looking at free DNS services like zoneedit.com and such... which seems promising but we are concerned about security/reliability issues. So I thought I'd ask here first.
I suggest the NS FREE package from Zerigo. It should be sufficient until you are profitable enough to upgrade. We use their more expensive packages with much success. 
All we need is a @ourcompany.com mail address and a few web pages to showcase our work and we are looking at Google Apps which gives enough functionality for us. However, to verify ownership of the domain to google apps, there are 2 possible ways:
DynDNS has been rock solid for me for years. I have had no reason to complain and I recommend it. Their documentation is excellent, and there are tons of clients there, both for Win32 and for unixy OSes. The way I read their Acceptable Use Policy, usage in your scenario (which is commercial usage) is OK with them.
