Another way we reduce energy consumption is to not run old hardware. The servers we bought over 5 years ago consume more than twice the power, and output nearly twice the heat of low energy servers today.
Here's a good article on virtualization and going green, and the use of Solaris Zones compared to VMWare (disclaimer: I work for the guy who wrote it).
The size of your business and how you do accounting matters too. If you buy & depreciate servers, buying fewer servers + VMWare licenses will result in tax savings and reduced capital costs. But if you lease servers, those savings may be less. If you're a government agency that receives Federal funding, VMWare will save you a fortune because you won't need to run multiple servers dedicated to particular Federal programs or grants. (The Feds don't like it when you co-mingle services on hardware they fund, and expect money back)
Virtualization will reduce the size of your physical server footprint, so you will get some power and maintenance savings.  We saw a 62% reduction in physical servers.  You will obviously not necessarily get reduced administrative savings because your just moving server images, not reducing them.
I have to admit that I'm not using this feature on the arrays that host the Vmware OS-VMFS volumes, as I dont want them to lag. It's possible to just select head parking and spindown, and always let the disks run.
But I think the power savings of simply replacing old physicals with new are highly overrated, unless you're a super dense shop.  For example, IBM claims their new x3650 M2 class box saves $100/yr in electricity. Yawn. I can't get excited about spending $3K+ to save $100/month.  I suppose you could say it pays for itself in 3 years, but don't underestimate the soft costs of doing a migration to new hardware. And, new hardware tends to become more power efficient all the time without our asking for it, so my strategy is to buy new gear and virtualize when it makes sense based on business value, not just to be green.
VMWare isn't the only way to save energy and dollars in a data center. You need to think of your compute resources as an single system and tweak/refactor to improve the systems performance and efficiency. That's the difference between engineering and goofing around with computers.
Decommission servers fully once they are no longer needed (i.e: remove them from the data center entirely)
We have a Nexsan SATABeast as primary storage for our SAN - it can automatically park heads (~20% power savings), spin down the SATA-disks to 4000rpm (40% power savings) and eventually shut the disk downs (yep, 100% savings). The feature is called AutoMAID.
There's no magic number that makes a particular scheme for saving energy or other resources right for you. It depends on all sorts of different things. If you're in New York, for example, power rates will make the ROI for each saved watt of power return 3x more than South Carolina. Automating a manual process may save you money, unless some employees are in a union with a 3 year, no-layoff provision.
Another thing we've done is to run a heat inverter (instead of A/C) in the server room. It's like Air Conditioning, except that it's two-way airflow. It keeps the server room around 20C, and pushes the hot air down to our basement (where it heats up the basement and keeps our floors in the 1st floor a bit warmer).
Look for the BTU ratings of servers before you buy, try and use efficient power supplies and low thermal-power CPU's.
