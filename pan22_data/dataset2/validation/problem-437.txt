I ran this command and could get it to work with RealVNC Open/Free edition viewer. Ensure that on the client, the color level is set to Full [Options->Colour & Encoding->Colour Level]
To answer the other question:  VNC is the Mac answer to RDP, actually.  Even the commercial "Apple Remote Desktop" package ultimately uses the VNC protocol.
I've also found that the VNC viewer will konk out when connecting to the Mac if the viewer is not running in millions or full color mode.
Make sure that its configured for VNC access with a password.  Then try to connect to TCP port 5900 with a VNC client on your PC.
From memory you'll need to either use a v3.x viewer or configure the one you have to use the version 3 protocol. How depends on your viewer but it should be covered in its help file or web site.
Although performance was clearly lacking. It's using ZRLE compression; perhaps JPEG or something else is superior, and perhaps professional RealVNC is optimized.
The free version of RealVNC (v. 6.17.1113, Nov 2017, x64) works smoothly for me. In particular from Windows 7 Professional to OS X Yosemite (10.11) and to OS X High Sierra (10.13 w/ latest updates), the "OS X Authentication" that Mac OS builtin VNC requires, with username and password and no tweaks to the VNC server side, posed no problem.
