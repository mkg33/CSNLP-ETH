So, what I'm thinking is to create a subdomain for each one of this server instances. The only issue here is that I need the subdomain to be available super quick, and I don't know if I can trust the DNS propagation times for this.
I did a simple API that modifies the configuration file and it has some good features like requesting SSL Certificates on configuration 
Is there any solution to this? Like having my own routing server that have a Wildcard Subdomain and then route the traffic based on that? I think I can't use Apache or those kind of solutions because it's not only HTTP/S traffic that I'm handling.
My team and I are creating a service that when user request, it creates a new server instance on the fly, with a different IP for each new instance. The issue is that I'm connecting from a client via WebSockets to that newly created server. But I need it to be SSL certificated. So I can't use just the IP.
Probably you know the IP address range in advance? You could create some xxxxxx.dyn.example.com. IN A pattern for the network in advance. That enables you to use *.dyn.example.com wildcard certificate for them all without any issues caused by DNS caching.
