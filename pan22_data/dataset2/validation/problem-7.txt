I was wondering if I could leave my monitors turned on after I’ve turned off my pc, here are some other questions I had:
Does the yellow status LED always suggest the monitor is in standby mode? Every time I turn on the monitor without turning in my computer the light is yellow instead of green or blue respectively. Does that mean it automatically turns into stand by?
When the power is supplied to the monitor, and it is on but not receiving video input, the status light will be one color or flashing pattern. In your case, these colors seem to be a solid orange and yellow. 
i have one 144hz BenQ led lcd monitor which lights up green in use and yellow when my pc is turned off and an old lg lcd with a mercury containing ccfl tube which usually lights up blue I think and if my pc is turned off yellow, not sure If that’s important
When you turn on your PC, or wake it, your monitor will receive video input and the LED will turn a different color, or stop flashing. In your case this seems to be green and blue.  
Yes it is normal. The Monitor operates normally upon operating the PC device itself. Usually LEDs have a living time of 5 years before starting to mis-operate and die !!!
The different colors are used to help troubleshoot problems, if something occurs. The one color shows it has power, but is not receiving video input. The other is when it is powered on and receiving input. 
The LED color or flashing pattern is unique to each monitor. I have one that has a flashing red when in standby mode, and a solid red light when it receives video input. My other monitor has an orange LED when in standby, and a blue light when it is receiving input.
