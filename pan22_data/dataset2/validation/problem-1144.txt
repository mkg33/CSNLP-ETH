If you right click on the Mint Menu applet, and select Preferences, then on the first tab, you can select another hotkey to replace <Super_L>, or if you just want to remove that hotkey at all, you can press backspace.
Now I can still open the start menu if I want to via Super+M, but the Super key does not interfere with Super+T anymore. (If you don't need a shortcut for the start menu at all, just remove the entire line.)
The shortcut works every other key press which is very annoying. Is there a way to reliably use such shortcuts?
Now I want to use for example the shortcut "Super_L+1" to open a terminal window. I went to Menu->Control Center->Keyboard Shortcuts and assigned the proper key combination to "Open a terminal window". It shows up as "Mod4+1".
I'm using Linux Mint 15. I'm using the keyboard shortcut "Super_L" to open the Mint menu of the Mate desktop.
I don't think you can do that. What I've done is mapped the Menu key (the one that opens context menus) to open the Mint menu. I don't use that key anyways, and you can always use Shift + F10 to get the same effect.
This problem was annoying me as well. I never use the Super key for the start menu, anyway, and opening a terminal is much more important to me. I solved the annoyance by opening the following file:
