Yes they are, most days "HR" is nothing more than an OCR machine looking for keywords. If it can't OCR your resume, you don't make it through.
A resume is like an executive summary of your experience. We can drill into the details later with a phone interview and a face to face interview. 
Don't get cute, this is a document you are using to introduce yourself to a business. You should be professional, and concise. 
When I'm looking though CVs/Resumes/Whatever, I'm not interested in how 'cute' or clever you can format a document, instead I'm trying to solve a problem.
Be careful with "clever". Things that are "clever" often make it difficult to see the real information underneath. 
When I receive your resume, it's usually part of a pile of 30 other resumes or more. I sadly don't have a lot of time to read over each resume, and reading resumes can be draining.
Many sysadmin resumes are very poorly written, which is frustrating. I don't care about your height and weight. I don't really have time to read 2 paragraphs which describe what you did at the previous job. I also don't want to read a 5 page resume. 
Don't be 'clever', just try to understand the problem the people doing the hiring are trying to solve and then make sure everything you send them is geared towards making it very easy for them to understand how well you can help them solve that problem.

If you can't clearly and concisely demonstrate why you can solve the problem I have better than the other applicants then I'll put your application in the reject pile.
Last time I was going through resumes it annoyed me when someone got creative with their presentation. I want to be able to quickly look at your resume, see your skills and your experience. So No. I'm in it, i'm impressed by straight lines and facts :)
I'd put focus on your experience and achievements.  Who you worked for and how did proved your worth to them.  I don't consider qualifications to be a great turning point, they're all theory rather than practical, experience far outweighs them in my view.
Boiling your experience down into 2-5 bullet points is a skill. It takes practice, and you'll need to go through a few iterations.
