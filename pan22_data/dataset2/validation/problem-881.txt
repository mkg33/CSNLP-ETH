For Windows XP there is a PowerToy allowing different Desktops which could be populated with different Program Windows. I would be surprised if there is no solution for other windows versions. In Linux this is pretty standard. You could switch between the Desktops by an hotkey which is pretty convenient. I would say this is the best solution i know about.
Both AMD and NVIDIA have Virtual Super Resolution (or Dynamic Super Resolution) configurations now in the latest drivers.
Many monitors support many resolutions.  If your monitor is capable of doing that resolution, then you might be able to get it to scale up a bit.  But as far as exceeding a maximum resolution, the answer is usually no.  The hardware generally lacks the ability to sync to a resolution that is not supported. 
If you are looking for an possibility to show simply more Programs virtual desktop_s_ are the solution.
It's not the size of your monitor that determines its maximum resolution, but the technology built into it. I would recommend finding the latest drivers and utilities for your existing video card, which may have desktop stretching or other capabilities. If that doesn't help, you'll need to get a new card and/or monitor.
You could use a virtual desktop; this would allow you to scroll around to support more virtual resolution.  But apart from that, no.  Your LCD has a maximum resolution.  By definition, that means it cannot support a higher resolution.
