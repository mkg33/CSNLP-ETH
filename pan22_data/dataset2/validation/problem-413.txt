There is an IMAP extension available for PHP which can get email messages from the server, as well as move them around on the server or delete them completely when you've committed it to the database.
While you could poll a POP mailbox its a very inefficient solution. Assunming you can route the mail to the target system, a better solution is to handle the request sychronously. While you could just use the .forward mechanism, I'd recommend using procmail as the MDA - it allows you to script complex behaviours like running programs, forward copies, conditional replies and more.
Dependant on your mail server, you could write a PHP script that will poll a mailbox on the server with IMAP and take actions accordingly.
The way I've done this frequently in the past is to run fetchmail every X minutes via cron. Fetchmail will  retrieve the mail via IMAP or POP3 and can then pipe the mail through a handler/parser script of some type (usually written in perl, python, etc.). The parser script would pull out any data you need out of the message and then insert that information into the appropriate places in your database.
