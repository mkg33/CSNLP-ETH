According to the following KB, This error occurs because of an issue with the Intel storage controller driver that's included in the released versions of Windows 7 and of Windows Server 2008 R2. This issue is resolved in Windows 7 SP1 and in Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.
Probably a silly suggestion you have already tried, but... are you formatting the partition or installing on top sort of? You say
What fixed it for me was essentially bypassing that error, dropping to command line and completing the out of box experience:
Other suggestions I agree with is upgrading the BIOS if possible, resetting it and of course making sure that you in fact have a 64-bit CPU.
If you format your partition it shouldn't be any state at all. If you have several hard drives I would disconnect those.
win8 and windows 10 would both install if I did not format the drive first, but installing windows 7 64 would fail at the "Windows Setup could not configure Windows to run on this computer's hardware"
Consider resetting the BIOS to its defaults. Also, make sure the configuration in the BIOS is set to use AHCI.
Fixed mine on my XW6600. I had changed the SATA mode from SATA I to SATA II whereas apparently my WD Green drive is SATA I. Once I flicked it back to SATA I installation resumed perfectly.
