I want to know where Google Chrome stores its search engine settings for the Windows XP platform. The reason being; my search engine keeps being changed to SpeedBit and I've thought of just locking up the file to prevent Write access to it. It would only be read-only, on the system level so hopefully that should prevent the annoying search engine change that's happening.
Under Ubuntu Linux, I found the search engine settings stored in "~/.config/chromium/Default/Preferences".
Under Windows, it should be " C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Preferences"
I don't know what version of chrome you are in. But in the latest version of Chrome, open a new tab and enter
you can create a folder with a shortcut to this folder and set the browser how you want and then save the folder User Data in the folder with the shortcut to the chromium folder and then copy and paste each time you want to restore your settings back. Works for me after I use cccleaner with Iron
C:\Documents and Settings(your windows account name)\Local Settings\Application Data\Chromium"  and folder called "User Data" this is were it is located. 
The command opens up your search engine manager. Find the speedbit search engine which must be listed there. Then hover over to the right of the window and you should see an "x" symbol. Click on that and it should remove speedbit from being your default. Then find Google,Yahoo or bing and hover to the right again. Before the "x" symbol you should see "make this default" button. Click on that and it should reset your search engine back to the one of your choice. I don't know whether this helps you or not. But this is what I was able to understand from your question.
