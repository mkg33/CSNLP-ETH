My biggest issue was coming mostly from the GUI world of Windows and OS X... and thinking I could do what I needed from a GUI in Linux.  In this first I try failed miserably.  My second try was setting up everything from CLI, and that was actually WAY better.  Right now, I still don't think I can do everything I want from the GUI.  
Same with understanding drives and partitions. In windows, a hard drive is a hard drive, where in linux, is it a scsi device? IDE?
I ran Ubuntu Linux for a couple years before recently switching to Windows 7 on my primary laptop.  I found the learning curve to be fairly time consuming but also rewarding as I love to learn new technologies.  I had to run XP in a virtual machine due to my addiction to Outlook 2007 as well as some Win-only gui mgmt tools.  Working between the two OSes was a bit tedious, especially when I had links or attachments in Outlook that I wanted to open on the host machine.  On the other end, it was nice to have both systems running concurrently for testing of anything that came up. In the end I decided to switch back to Windows with a Linux server available for testing.
1- Working from the command line and config files - many Windows folks struggle with it, because it is so rarely necessary in basic Windows installations.
Setting display settings. xorg.conf, window decorators and changing settings in cde, kde, gnome were all different from Windows, and confusing since each distro is different. Remote displays, display redirection, etc.
Windows abstracts away a lot of things, and those abstractions are taken for granted by Windows folks.  This starts with the alphabet soup of *nix flavors and distributions.  There are lots of decisions in *Nix that Windows has made itself.
In Windows, I can see all the devices and files associated with it's driver. I can easily diagnose problems. In Linux you have to know what you're looking for in /dev or forget it.
As a Windows administrator, what were the issues you encountered with trying to learn ANY linux distro?
Condescending people, some of whom were not even born when I first got exposed to *nix, patronising me with talk of "this linux thingy" is one of the biggest problems I've found. Kinda puts me off the whole thing really. Well that and the whole "read the source code and figure it out, wintard" attitude I've encountered in the past. 
In Windows, I can pretty easily figure out what's starting up when the machine comes up. It took a while to find that equivalent in Linux.
2- file system permissions, chmod, the numbers, etc.  Linux permissions often just don't compute initially to Windows folks.
