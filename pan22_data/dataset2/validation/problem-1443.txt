I've seen this happen in Vista when the users profile was corrupted causing it to build a temporary profile every login. Just removing the profile folder from the Users folder corrected the issue on the next login when it created a new user profile correctly. 
Look in the C:\Documents and Settings\ folder to see if the new users profile directory is being created or might be duplicating with a number in the directory name or is it duplicating with a .machine/domain extension. Knowing what is or isn't happening in the profile directory should help in determining what the problem is.
Now, it's true that I set them up to be in Power Users on the PC in question. However, they're a member of "Domain Guests" vs. "Domain Users" (or a more specific group) according to Windows Server 2003's AD.
Just as a brief overview... When a new user logs in, Windows first looks to see if they have a roaming profile to copy locally. If not found it then builds the users initial profile by copying a default profile from one of two locations; first it looks in the directory "%LOGONSERVER%\NETLOGON\Default Profile" if this is not found it then uses the local default profile "C:\Documents and Settings\Default User". Once the directory is copied, it then runs through a task list that various applications may have added to, stored in the registry, for tasks that need to be done to a new account. The Internet Explorer setup wizard is an example of this. When the new user process is complete the logon continues as normal. If this is a roaming account, when the user logs off Windows will synchronize the remote directory with any local changes.
Have you tried getting the user in question to log on to another machine to see if the problem is replicated there?  This is the FIRST thing I always do when troubleshooting issues like this, and it will tell you if the problem is with the user account or with the machine.
