Also, is it safe to keep both the interfaces enabled (USB wifi + onboard wifi) on static IP address connected to the same ssid.? Will they create any clash.? I was planning to keep both the interfaces enabled, just in case if one fails for some reason, another interface can keep the things going.?
To use two interfaces for failover it isn't done to give both an ip address. Wifi will not switch over automatically. You have to reboot. To avoid this you must use bonding. Here is a suggestion to use dynamic failover.
I have a raspberry at a very remote site where the wifi range is not that great. I am using a USB wifi with the antenna to connect to the wifi. Should I disable the onboard wifi in this case as I am using external USB wifi.?
It doesn't matter if both interfaces are activated when then build in isn't configured in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf. But to avoid possible confusion I would prefer to disable the build in wifi interface with putting this into the /boot/config.txt:
