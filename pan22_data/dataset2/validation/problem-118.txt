Finally got a call with Microsoft over this issue, and they found a solution for us.  We were having this same issue - on Win7, we had the monitor set to turn off after 5 minutes, but screen saver after 15 (which is what would lock the screen).  In Win10, it was locking after the screen turned off, at 5 minutes. This only occurred on domain-joined machines.  
On a related note, it is possible to disable the Windows 10 login screen so that you don't have to enter a password after booting your PC, but that subject would warrant a separate tutorial, and it comes with one big downside: If you disable the password prompt and login screen on Windows 10, you'll lose the ability to sync settings and data across all of your Windows devices. Hopefully this process becomes a bit more stable in future builds, and we'll cover it at that time.
I got the same issue in windows 10 go to cortana and type secpol.msc then go to Local Policies folder, then Security Options, then find Interative logon: Machine inactivity limit click twice to open it and change the number in seconds for example 57600 will give 11 hours or you can set it to the highest 599940 after this  go to cmd and type gpupdate after is done re-start your pc and enjoy no logout from your account :) 
In Advanced slideshow settings - there is a setting: 'When my PC is inactive, show lock screen instead of turning off the screen' that was set to ON, change it to OFF.
I have taken it from here: https://windows.gadgethacks.com/how-to/disable-lock-screen-windows-10-0162965/
You say that you "use the blank screensaver for a couple minutes, and then just have the monitor turn off a couple minutes after that".
If the new account solves the problem, you wonâ€™t need to do a Reset, Restore, Refresh or reinstall of Windows.

There is an obscure policy that affects this.  To get your Win10 machine to behave like the Win7 machine did (stay unlocked after the screen turns off), Enable the following policy:
