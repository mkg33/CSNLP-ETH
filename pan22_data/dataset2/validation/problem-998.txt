If other people are spoofing your domain to send spam, your domain can end up on blacklists or with a poor reputation at reputation services such as SenderBase.  SPF and DKIM both work to prevent this kind of spoofing, meaning that your domain's reputation is only caused by you.
But spammers can publish their own SPF and DKIM records so mail providers won't use the presence of these features as a whitelist.  The large mail providers all either maintain IP address and domain reputation services or use commercial ones.  Hotmail uses SenderScore.  Your IP and your domain have neutral reputation with them however you may notice that they still list your domain as not having SPF records.  This may be due to DNS caching but it could also be because your SPF record is published using the SPF record type but is not also published using the more common TXT record type.
Bounces are important.  Failing to unsubscribe bounces is one of the primary reasons for low IP address reputation.  Different kinds of bounces require different actions.  "No such user" should be treated differently from "Inbox is full" but even "Inbox is full" should result in an unsubscribe eventually.  When accounts expire at Hotmail, they go dormant for around 6 months and are then brought back to life as spam traps.  Anyone who ignores bounces will end up blacklisted by Hotmail when those bounces becomes spam traps.
The simplest solution is to force your SMTP sender to use IPv4. Otherwise, you will need to add the IPv6 version of your MX to your SPF and make sure it has a valid PTR record.
In your DKIM header, s=mail means that receivers will look up TXT records from mail._domainkeys.afspraakmanager.be to find your public key.
You should either change your MTA to use s=default or add a TXT record at mail._domainkeys.afspraakmanager.be with your DKIM record.
DMARC is useful for getting feedback on what IP addresses are sending mail claiming to be from you.  Even in small environments it can be common for mail to come out of two or three IP addresses.  Once you are sure your SPF records are covering all of the IP addresses that send legitimate mail, you can switch the policy to -all.  DMARC is simple to set up and, when I did so, I got my first reports within a few hours.
FBLs give you feedback on how well your recipients are liking your email.  When they click their "Spam" button, the provider sends you a copy of the email to let you know to unsubscribe that user.  It can also work as an early-warning system that someone has compromised your server and is using it to send out spam.  Hotmail have an FBL program (which they call JMRP) however I have never managed to successfully sign up for it.  Hotmail also have the SNDS program which is very similar but purely for IP addresses.  AOL and Yahoo and many other places have FBL programs.  Failing to have a working unsubscribe link or even having one that's confusing and difficult to use can cause your recipients to use the spam button.
Lastly, the best thing you can do to improve your IP address reputation is to send lots of email that people want.  Greater volumes of email with low incidents (such as a spam report or triggering content-based spam detection) will improve your reputation faster than the same ratio with a lower volume.
