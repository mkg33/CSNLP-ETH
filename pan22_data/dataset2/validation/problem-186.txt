Then install Parallels 7 again, and during the installation insure that it downloads the latest version of Parallels. Once installed, double click the VM file and the error should be gone. 
If the error still exists, I think the problem is not related to Parallels, but something on your specific machine and OS specifically.
After a long session with Parallels' support the solution is to drop the Network from the VM's hardware configuration, recreate it, and restore default networking configuration. The last step would be to manually load the network extension.
In the past, I have gone into the System Preferences -> networks, and removed the Parallels network adapter....
Then simply running the installer for Parallels should resolve the issue.  (A reboot maybe required....)
Make sure you remove all traces off Parallels apart from the VM's themselves. Then using Software Update to ensure you have the latest OSX Lion updates loaded.
I suspect that something corrupted or an update has removed some of the required files for Parallels. My best suggestion would be to completely uninstall and remove Parallels 7 following the instruction at KB112189.
The complete uninstall may be overkill, but it is a safe method of doing this...  (It may just take a few extra minutes...)
