Look at http://www.techsoup.org/. They serve non-profits by selling software extremely cheaply. The software is donated by various big companies and a valid non-profit can get things for almost nothing. In this way, you can have a "big boy" solution for peanuts.
I don't think it's worth implementing a centralised server for your AV if you have 25 clients and are a non-profit with low budgets.
Check out Microsoft Forefront client security.  Microsoft has a pretty good non-profit program under the open license charity program.  unlike symantec Forefront is licensed per user, not per client, so as a side benefit your users can use it at home as well. I've tested it it vs symantec in my environemnt and it's far simpler to admin and deploy.
I would argue that using ClamAV would be a good solution. I have deployed this on a 100+ clients on a Windows/Linux network with pfSense acting as the edge protection device for network firewall IDS/IPS with snort.
Apologies for answering somewhat off-topic. Lately though, I cringe at home and small business folks talking about paying for AV. I really don't think it's justifiable any longer.
