As long as you don't need to push too much data back and forth it would allow you to keep your "program" isolated from something they control.
I've previously been tasked with sourcing tamper evident seals and have not found anything I could recommend. In all cases the adhesive could be softened, usually with either turpentine or kerosine, the label removed and later reapplied. Done carefully you would never be able to tell the seal had been removed.
Make sure you set the BIOS so it can't boot a USB stick or PXE boot or boot from anything BUT the installed HD.
If you can't do that, you could have your program check in to a central server over the internet.  If your program can't reach your server it disables itself.  Basically it could check in and respond to a challenge algorithm...   (you want to prevent the server from being spoofed)
Physical access is tantamount to simply handing it over on a silver platter. But if you have to, you have to.
If you machine has TPM then you can have ultimate protection. You can use trusted GRUB with encrypted partition for your program. This will give you protection even if hard drive is physically removed and connected to another host - the OS cannot be booted from it and encrypted partition cannot be read. You wouldn't need to even lock your chassis. Obviously, user should not be given 'root' access under any circumstances.
There have already been some really good ideas posted by others, so Ill just build on the physical security.
I suggest you use physical seals instead. I prefer the old fashioned type consisting of wire and a crimped lead seal. Primitive, yet surprisingly effective, which is why they are still being used for many security situations.
