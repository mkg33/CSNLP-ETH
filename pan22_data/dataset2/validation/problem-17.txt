is being displayed whilst trying to connect to github using SSH. I've also tried using https:// as the remote path but to no success.  
go to your home directory and create a folder called .ssh, and a blank file called known_hosts inside of it.  then set the permissions on the file to 644.
In your Documents and Settings folder of your local machine, create the folder home\. For some reason, cwRsync won't create these folders for you. I didn't change my cygpath, so I created mine in C:\Program Files\cwRsync\home\.
Use Sysinternals Process Monitor to log the file system accesses that take place when you are trying to do this. 
then try ssh again and see if the result is any different.  (note: you'll have to say yes when asked if you want to continue connecting the first time.  then that server will be added to the known_hosts list and you shouldn't be prompted anymore after that.)
maybe the permissions to your home directory are interfering with ssh's ability to create the known_hosts file?
