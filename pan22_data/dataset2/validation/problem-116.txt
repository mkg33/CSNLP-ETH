There is another alternative that has not been discussed here.  SomeClown has alluded to it but did not specifically recommended it.  This will be not only the most expensive option but far and away the simplest and most reliable.  I simply use a separate "box" for each OS that I use or play with and use a KVM switch to swap between them.  While this requires a much greater footprint and greater initial expense as well as the stand-by use of power for each box involved, it is clearly the simplest and most reliable solution.  Not even Windows 7 XP Mode works as well with legacy hardware (HP Photosmart P1100 printer) as a dedicated XP machine.  With this setup, you can leave a program in one OS running while you work on a program in another OS and have no delay or slow-down as a result of switching between OSs.  This just works much better for me.
You do not need any special hardware to dual-boot, but I would recommend searching for the computer you are thinking about in the context of Linux issues to see if there are any common issues with it.  Even brands that (at least in my experience) provide decent enough Linux support (in my case, Toshiba), you could still end up wit a laptop whose ACPI won't work with Linux, effectively preventing you from using it as a laptop.
I know you can get virtual linux in things like cygwin, or you can get two whole operating systems installed on the one machine ("dual boot"?). 
One more option you have is to install linux in a Virtual Machine in Windows using for example Virtualbox -- this is nice in the way that you can run both windows and linux "at the same time"; however, in a VM the performance will always be a little decreased, so if you need to run programs requiring a lot of CPU/memory, this solution might not be for you.
It seems you don't need any specialized hardware for it? but does separate drives or something like that help?
As @houbysoft mentioned, partitioning (meaning breaking up one drive into two segments that will appear as different drives on your computer) is the most common option for dual-booting, but the Wubi Installer for Ubuntu provides an effective alternative by creating virtual partitions on your disk.  It also uses the Windows Boot Manager rather than the GRUB Menu that most distributions default to.
It is therefore not even comparable to installing both linux and windows side by side. You don't need to have any special hardware, not even separate drives : you will simply divide your (one) drive into two or more partitions and install linux on one of them. Note that for some of the more newbie-friendly linux distributions such as Ubuntu, this is usually done automatically and is really simple.
Dual-booting will provide you with faster Linux than a true virtual solution (which Cygwin is not) because you will be dedicating your computer's entire processing power, etc to it.  However, you will have to put up with the time it takes to shut down one operating system and boot the other whenever you need to switch.
Running Linux in a virtual machine (such as VirtualBox) will typically result in fewer issues simply because your hardware will be emulated so you will not likely have any driver incompatibilities.
Cygwin is not really used as a "full linux" in windows, rather, it is usually used to compile linux software under windows, hardly like a full linux replacement.
I'm a genetics PhD student. The word-processing and referencing software available for windows is more suitable (and more compatible with computers in the library etc.), but there's some genetics software that runs better on linux. (Currently i'm shopping for a laptop.)
