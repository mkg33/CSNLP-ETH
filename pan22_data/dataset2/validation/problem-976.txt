I have been using Symantec Corporate edition for years, and finally just updated to the latest version of Endpoint Protection, and I'm loving it. Its reasonably priced, and does very well, and isn't a resource hog either.
We're currently using McAfee for our Windows desktops but to get updates and alerts with the latest version it looks like you need to be running their EPO server software. I'd like to avoid the cost of hardware and Windows licensing, and if possible to run just client-based antivirus.
CA ETrust Enterprise AV you can purchase and run as few as one individual clients that download from the vendor's servers over the internet.  Cost is about $40 per client per year.
Are there any desktop antivirus products suitable for use in an enterprise environment without a Windows server?
Internal updates/redistribution mechanism is very simple.  Configuration is also customizable and very simple.  They have a free 30-day eval you can download.
If you do, then any AV that gets its updates over the internet should be fine. If you were to set very aggressive caching for their update site (should be easy to track down with some basic logging), then the updates only need to be downloaded once, and can then be grabbed from the cache of the proxy server.
I think it may be worth you while to grab eval copies of some likely looking AV products and install them on a test (virtual?) machine. Then have a look to see if they can be configured to grab the updates from a specific source. If they can, it should be easy enough to determine where their default downloads come from, along with whatever connection strings are sent to the source. Once you've found one you can work with, set one machine up to download the updates and configure the rest to get them from that machine. In all likelihood the download source settings will be stored in the registry, making it simply to use GPO or a script to propagate that information. It's a fair bit of fiddling about but the end result may be worth it.
