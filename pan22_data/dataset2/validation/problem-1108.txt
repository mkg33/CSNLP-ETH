Admittedly, xslx files really are zip files, but we don't want that behavior. Just open in Excel, please.
I doubt it's an apache config issue.  Internet Explorer has it's own MIME Type Detection algorithm.  You can circumvent this behavior by right-clicking and selecting 'File  -> Save As' or just use MS 2003 .doc format.
Background: For some reason, whenever a user tries to open an xslx (excel 2007) file from our intranet using MSIE, the file download dialog interprets it as a "zip" file. 
Firefox, OTOH, opens the files normally. Is it possible that the fault is my apache configs? or is this a client-browser-only issue?
You can indeed fix this in Apache's configuration.  Add the following lines (and ensure that mod_mime is enabled):
if its an apache config issue then there is the file that contains the mapping of extensions to mime types that you can quickly examine to rule out this possibility.
This will ensure that Apache sends the appropriate MIME type to the client, and IE will understand that the files are Office documents and not zips.
