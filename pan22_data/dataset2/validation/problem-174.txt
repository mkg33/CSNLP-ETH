2.The fn_dump_dblog function is used to read transaction log native or natively compressed backups. The result is similar:
Unfortunately, no official documentation is available for fn_dblog and fn_dump_dblog functions. To translate the columns, you need to be familiar with the internal structure and data format, flags and their total number in a row data
1.Here is an example using fn_dblog to read an online transaction log, with a result of 129 columns (only 7 shown here)
3.DBCC PAGE is used to read the content of database online files – MDF and LDF. The result is a hexadecimal output, which unless you have a hex editor, will be difficult to interpret
There are several SQL Server functions and commands (e.g. fn_dblog, fn_dump_dblog, and DBCC PAGE) that potentially provide a way to view the transaction log file content. However, significant knowledge of T-SQL is required to use them, some are undocumented, and the results they provide are difficult to be converted to a human-readable format. Following are the examples of viewing LDF file content using SQL Server functions and commands:
So, there are different ways to open a transaction log file, and most of them do just that – opens it. It’s tricky to get any human readable information and make a use of it though
