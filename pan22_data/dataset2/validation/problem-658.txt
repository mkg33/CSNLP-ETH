I don't think this is possible. Even in my home pppoe account I have set up a static IP while only being provisioned for dynamic ip. Only problem is ip conflicts.
Lacking such hardware, the best you can do is MAC filtering and block traffic coming from an IP which is not associated with the MAC. This is doable using iptables on Linux. Be aware though that faking a MAC address is quite easy.
Locally, its a little more tricky. It may be possible to block non DHCP clients, but really you just want to VLAN out guest machines so they cant cause any trouble. 
Imagine you got a network to which other users can connect with their PC's, you have set up some rules, for example there is a DHCP server that gives addresses 192.168.2.100 - .254 and first 100 addresses are reserved for people who want static IPv4 address.
How is it technically possible to prevent someone from taking some other IPv4 address? How could you restrict someone to use only a specific IP?
This won't prevent the computer from 'taking' the IP in that it can still be set statically on the interface, however all packets using that IP will be dropped, so it's not very useful.
How do for example ISP enforce people to use only that public IP they got assigned? For example I have a server in server room and I was granted N IPv4 addresses, I received a list of all IPv4 addresses that I am allowed to use (they are all public IPv4 that can be accessed over internet). I didn't try to take any other IP than I am allowed because that would likely violate some rule and they might shut the server off so I am not even going to try that, but just out of curiosity, is this even technically possible to restrict somehow? How?
On an ISP level you can give yourself any IP address you like, but only ones actually assigned to you will route, the rest will get no return traffic. They wont ban you, it just wont work.
With the appropriate hardware, this is quite easy to do. A managed switch will allow you to assign one or more IPs to a (physical) port, and will block traffic coming from any other IP on that port. You can also use a different network interface per computer on your server, though that may prove quickly more costly.
