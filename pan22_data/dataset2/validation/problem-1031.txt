Have all changes accepted, switch off tracking changes and remove hidden data and personal information by inspecting document (Click on File, Info, Check for Issues).
The ONLY way to get rid of the track changes is; on the right-hand side of the document click onto the change, then a drop-down will appear, then choose delete changes. You have to sadly do this to all/ever highlighted change listed in the document. Then save the document as a test first, all ok then safe as Master Document. IT works 100% Neale
The easiest way is to copy the whole text to a brand new Word document and then save it as a new file.
This remains an issue 5 years later in Word 2013. The answer commonly given is, "you must accept the changes". My preferred solution, however, is to use Word's Document_Open event to change the initial view setting as desired:
Have you ensured you 'Accpeted Changes' for these existing docs?  I had the same problem as I kept opening a doc where I turned off Track Changes, only to have it re-appear.  If you accept those changes the Track Changes setting you select will take place.  If you do not, the setting that was put in place before will persist each time you open the document.
It happens because once tracking is turned on in a document you cant turn it off - you can only accept the changes but they are still there
