so i have old MSi GE60, its already +-6 years, monitor breaking up and what not, but the internal hardware still very much working great
It depends on where you are planning to draw current from. Likely, your laptop power supply is not 5V but something like 19V, so 5V line on the PCB is fed from DC-DC step-down converter mounted on PCB. It's not safe, nor is it convenient to feed from that line. And it's especially non-efficient to connect a step-up converter to the line fed from a step-down because each conversion has about 80% to 90% efficiency and the whole chain will be losing about half the power.
i already post the question notebookreview forum, but theres no conclusive answer (with reasons) as of yet 
my plan is to gut all the hardware and convert the laptop into a family media center, i already planned everything , the custom case etc, the problem is, i want to put another fan on the case, and take the power for the fan directly from the mobo
MSi GE60 mobo : https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1qgTqMVXXXXcXXXXXq6xXFXXXd/MS-16GA1-For-MSI-GE60-Laptop-Motherboard-Mainboard-100-Tested-fully-work.jpg
since MSi GE60 have unused PCie SSD, i'll buy the PCie to USB module, BUT, since almost all fan in market is powered with 12v , i also planning to buy the 5v to 12v step up module to put on the PCie to USB module
i'm not a tech savvy, nor an electrician, barely know anything about pcb and such, thus having this question, it'll probably noob question, but please stick with me, and also i'm not sure if i post this into the correct forum
Much safer way would be to take 19V straight from the power connector and use a step-down converter to get 12V you need.
the step up module i'm speak of : https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/Universal-2-1x5-5-mm-Micro-USB-Cable-DC-5V-to-12V-Step-up-Boost-Line/333670_32679700740.html
my problem is, i don't know if such setup is safe for the laptop motherboard, anyone can enlighten me?
