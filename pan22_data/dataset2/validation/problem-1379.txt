If you're distrusting whether wget is functioning right, there are multiple variations of wget, as well as other programs like curl that could be tried.  They'll probably act the same way, but if they don't, then you'll apparently have your answer.
(Some small changes...  I converted one back-quote to an apostraphe, and tabs aren't showing up quite right...  my main point of showing some sample output is, it worked fine.)
Anybody here can point me to the right direction?  I'm not a programmer or someone with great knowledge on that field but I'm knowledgeable enough to learn and understand.  TIA.
I'm working from my office and we have a proxy server in order to get into the internet.  I'm not sure whether this affects my command using the wget.
If it isn't working for you, my guess is that it's an issue with your Internet connectivity.  You might have a content blocker that prevents the HTTP connection.  Maybe an HTTP proxy needs to be used.  However, the wget command works fine.  So, from my test, I would say that the thing that you need to try fixing isn't your basic wget syntax.  If you do need to change the syntax, like referencing a web proxy, you may need to identify the settings another way (troubleshooting elsehow).  Can you visit the jpg file in any other web-grabbing software?
I do have a command using powershell -Command and it works fine but could not run under task scheduler and so I opted to use the wget as most recommended this.  However, I could not seem to get it going when test trying it.
