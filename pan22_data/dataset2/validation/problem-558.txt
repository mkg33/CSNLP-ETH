The KACE appliances aren't perfect, but it's by far the best option we found and it seems like they are working hard on improvements.
I'm not a system admin (I'm a programmer) and managing the 70 PCs in our company was becoming more than a side job for me.  We bought the Dell KACE 1000 and 2000 appliances and I've been very impressed with them.  It takes a lot of the complexity and ugliness out of systems management.  It has a simple, intuitive UI and makes a lot of tasks trivial.  There is a learning curve at the start, but they have a kick start program where you get 4 hours of training up front to help you set up each appliance.
After you plug the K1000 box in and install the KACE agent software on each PC, the K1000 starts to collect data on all the machines.  Within a few hours you can see every piece of installed software, outdated drivers and missing software patches.  You can then use the K1000 to push out missing software, install missing drivers and patch outdated software.  All our PCs now have the latest BIOS, drivers and software.  We also applied all the patches, so Windows 7, Adobe Reader, Flash, Firefox, etc. are fully up to date.
I'm using (Microsoft) System Center Configuration Manager to do this + operating system installation (images).
there are quite a few commercial offerings in this space like KACE from Dell (I believe there is a Microsoft specific offering in the field as well)  With the size of your network it may be worth deploying one of these solutions.
Secunia integrates with SCCM and or WSUS to identify, prepare packages and deploy updates for any publicly available software.
Maybe Windows Package Manager would be useful for you. There is a default repository under the Apache license with more than 100 applications.
