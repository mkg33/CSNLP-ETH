Programming skills, or at the very least scripting skills, are needed for the most visible of contribute-upstream roles in these projects. A lot of work goes into making things like startup run faster or more efficiently, and that requires no little bash-scripting to make happen. 
To find projects that need this, perhaps you could start by looking at the programs that you use that are open source. Approach them and see if they are interested. You can also do some searching or ask around, I know that the Drupal project might be able to use another testing server. 
You can also help some OS projects by throwing in server resources. There are tons of projects that don't have access to a build server, CI server, testing server, etc. You don't necessarily have to become a webhost, just provide even one of those and the people behind the project will love you. 
To actually run the server the project needs, find an underutilized VM server and put it there, being sure to provision it so that it doesn't kill the other functions of the VM server. 
I also recommend github.com, it's much newer but has some very innovative and active projects on it, and is geared towards connecting people involved with programming open source.
Another area is to participate in testing development builds. This will require some hardware or at least VM space, but provides very needed feedback to development about what's working, what's not working, and provides you a lot of troubleshooting experience. That kind of troubleshooting is a great way to get to know your project better. Do it long enough and you'll get your skills honed enough to start contributing patches to fix problems, or maybe even pick up a somewhat rare but very useful (to the community) skill like manual RPM packaging.
You can volunteer as a tester and documenter.  You'll need sysadmin skills to set up testing (and you'll probably learn scripting).  A sysadmin viewpoint can be very helpful in writing documentation for system utilities, services, and applications.
These are all great perspectives on what type of contribution you can have as a sysadmin. A good first step to finding an open source project to get involved and contribute to is sourceforge.com. Its one of the more popular communities for this. 
One area where sysadminly skills do come in handy is in support forums. Get good at these areas and start helping other people. This is contributing to the community, it may not feel like it, but it does make the entire ecosystem nicer to live in.
