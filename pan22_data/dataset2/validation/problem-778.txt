Does your server support remote ISO mounting such as HP's iLO? if so then I believe that'll be the simplest method, otherwise a PXE/kickstart is the the way to go.
FAI (Fully automatic installation) for "large" unattended installations. A little setup has to be done, but worth it. FAI uses PXEBoot with DHCP, TFTP, NFS on a debian/ubuntu system. You can customize the install for every machine in the network using a class concept. It also integrates with CFEngine (and possible with toher management tools like puppet. I didn't try it yet).
I think what you're searching is TFTP. Many BIOSes allow you to boot via TFTP. All you need to do is setup a TFTP Server and provide and image of your distribution.
If you're wanting to install lots of machines over the network you should also investigate kickstart.
Look into PXEBoot as the others have mentioned, but if you're looking to do the network installs on a larger scale and a good system to maintain all those machines (updates, installs, etc.) then take a look into XCAT (http://xcat.sourceforge.net/).
