The best way I've found to combat this problem is to run ethernet down the center of the rack, rather than the sides.
Most of the frequently cited bad issues with patch panels can be mitigated through planning appropriately.
Label both ends the same, and ensure there are no duplicates.  This makes tracing cables a whole bunch easier, and alleviates much of the concern of bundling a bunch of cables together into a neat run.  We even label our short (1 foot) cables, and then bundle them into bunches of 10-20 - and it makes it MUCH easier to identify which cable is which.
As far as what to label the cables with - I would stay away from anything specific like hostnames or mac addresses, since the cables/switch ports will likely be re-purposed over time.  
This is dependent on your site, but the worst cabling disasters I've dealt with are when people slavishly run power cables and ethernet cables up and down the sides of the rack. It seems like a great idea in theory, but the practice is a giant knot of either power or ethernet inside the rack post.
It is a fact of life that servers move frequently comparative to other datacenter equipment. All your old cable drops just add to mess you have to deal with. Since power cables are confined to the rack and can always be reused, this keeps the clutter buildup down.

For LAN wiring, I've used a method of bunches of 8 cables, each a different color going from patch panel to switch.  48 port patch panels to 48 port switches.  With the different colored cables, it is VERY easy to trace a single cable without pulling it out and makes everything look very very nice.
Can still be a good thing in some cases. NEVER put network drops under a raised floor unless you hate your coworkers and plan to leave soon. If you have a raised floor only use it to run power cables.
These are your friend. If you have a separate networking group and they don't use patch panels, it is because they don't know how to use them.
Good luck!  I think excellence in wiring is a strong trait for any sysadmin.  Presentation is a big part of any job and having well dressed racks goes a long way to showing non-technical people that you're on top of your game.
Overhead cable runs are the only way to preserve your sanity or blood pressure. This is especially true if you don't use patch panels.
Yes, they take up space in your rack, yes they limit the amount of available ports per rack. Putting them in is more work. I will also admit they are not appropriate for every site.
Tracing cable runs of 6 feet or less is exponentially easier than tracing cable runs of 12 feet or more. Adding in new equipment is easier, no more fishing cables through 15 different runs. This can limit the amount of crap that gets shoved into one rack (sometimes this is good).
One thing I forgot to mention before is that ethernet cables and power cables are different.  That means they are run differently, have different lifetimes and different uses.

The general good practice seems to be to identify port numbers on each jack endpoint, use bundles of short cables to patch between panels, and keep a database / text file of computer-port number assignments.
