As the general tool for this job I would use Windows Device Console (devcon.exe) which is kind of a command line version of the Windows device manager.
It's difficult to give exact instructions, not knowing all the devices you had attached to your system. 
If you want a shortcut you can then drag the icon in the address bar at the top of the screen to your desktop or wherever you want it.
To remove usb devices I use removedevices.js (which uses devcon) from https://github.com/kevinoid/remove-nonpresent-devices
However there will not be a remove all the ones I don't use anymore switch. You most likely have to list all devices, filter them somehow and then remove them. 
That will bring up what is basically the old printer view and you can highlight multiple devices and delete them. I have no idea why they removed that from the Printers and Devices view. This even works in the Windows 8 Metro interface. You just start typing and it will bring up the app search in Metro. It will then launch the Printers folder on the desktop.
You have to play a bit with the command line, you can list devices and remove them from the system. 
To remove bluetooth devices I use btpair -u from http://bluetoothinstaller.com/bluetooth-command-line-tools/
