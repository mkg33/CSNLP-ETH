Of course, if you have Word installed you can use it as well (even automate it using a macro or VBScript), but don't expect great things in terms of HTML quality.
I edited a document, made all my styles now I want to save it as HTML, is there anyway (add-in or extension?) to save it as HTML right from wordpad instead of looking for an online free tool that does it?
Try downloading RTFConverter, then use using the command line application Rtf2Html.exe in the bin\release folder.
I have found that a good way to code and save files is the Cloud 9 IDE. It is internet based easy to use with live preview options. The files are saved on the cloud therefore be used on any computer anywhere and can be saved to your computer.
If you are on a PC the best option is to just copy and paste all your code into 'Notepad' that allows you to save the file as .html
You should be able to mass convert your files easily this way, although as with all automated conversions be sure to visually confirm that the final results look similar to the original sources.
