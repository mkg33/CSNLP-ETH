We found that changing the printer to a different model and then back again seemed to fix the issue.  
Changing the size fixes the problem, changing the font fixes the problem. Unfortunately, as our outgoing documents have a standard format, neither was an acceptable solution. 
The expected result is supposed to be normally-displayed text. In the picture below, the text that is circled contains approximately 35 characters when rendered correctly. It is squished together to the point of being illegible in the incorrectly-rendered scenario.
I found that if, in Word, you select "Font", and then in "Character Spacing" select "Normal", rather than "Condensed".TextCondensed
Further, the Word install on the users' actual machine worked fine (as opposed to the remote desktop to the server). 
Read the Answer to this question to see why this occurred in my case, and what I did to diagnose and resolve it.
The problem is related to the graphics rendering subsystem, because disabling hardware accelerated graphics in Word resolves the problem. We also know that the problem is related to the interaction of the rendering changes that occur when transparent objects (such as a "Draft" watermark) are placed on the page, and the rendering that occurs for the Times New Roman Bold font.
I had this problem with text in a table. No font modifications affected it. I had created the table from a document scanned in as a pdf. 
I have found that clicking into the header or footer will fix the squished text, or exiting and going back in.  However, I have not found a way to prevent it from happening.
Finally solved it by highlighting the offending text, browsing to home\styles and clicking to select 'normal'. This corrected the squashed text.
