At the time of writing the latest BlueZ release was v5.50 back in June 2018 whilst v5.43-2 is available in the Stretch repositories. Installing the bluez package should have installed 19 or so man pages along with the usual Debian README.Debian.gz file, you can see the list of files installed by the package on it's page on the Debian Packages site. 
You can also view the man pages online at the Debian Manpages site. Unfortunately the btmgmt tool you're interested in does not have a man page but it does offer some built-in help with btmgmt <command> --help.
As you've noted, the documentation in the supplied man pages is quite sparse and (to me, anyway) feels like there's a missing "overview" document somewhere that should be read first. You may have more luck going straight to the "source" and looking through some of the files in the code repository at https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree, the "doc" directory contains several text files but from a cursory look they seem to be more about the kernel API than using the userland tools as an end-user.
