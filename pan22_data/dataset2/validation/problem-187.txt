You may find it helpful to enable the Administrator account (disabled by default).  From an elevated command prompt run the following command:
I'm surprised how often this happens. There is a reason why Microsoft makes the effort to block user's access to their own drives. . .
I was recently modifying the security settings for my drive C. I did not notice that i was logged in as a user and changed the permissions for users to "read". Later i realized that there was no admin set up on the pc (when switching user). Now with the security settings changed  I can't do anything on the computer. I can only read the files that previously existed. And this applies to every drive on my computer. Now the user accounts do not have the privileges to change the permissions. How can i allow users to have full control without having admin on my pc 
What you can do now it to use another system to change the permission, e.g. a Windows PE CD or another Windows installation. You might also use some tools like ERD Commander to create an admin user.
edit  Specifically, you need an admin account to take ownership of files.  Only with ownership can you grant other accounts permissions.  /edit
If there's really no admin user on your computer (I don't think that is possible?), you will have no way of changing that permission back under your current Windows installation, because if you can the security model of Windows will be a complete failure (M$ had it certified, so it's probably sound).

change windows registry to derivated 43 hex on default registry settings under the bios reconstructor, there you could get spicy and add some new windows 7 features at least the trigonal methods for registry ascii mode binary down-loaders, on windows registry bios relations.
