I'm tired of all these corporate friendly looking desktop themes. Any cool ones out there that look like the ones we see on TV? I already looked at several of the top theme websites, and all the cool themes were either outdated or not very techie.
Hackers on TV, you know, the kind that hack government networks by mashing keys, always have this super cool over the top desktop themes, that unlike their button mashing hacker skills, I hope the desktop themes actually exist.
Well, if you run vanilla Enlightenment as your desktop environment, you're already pretty close. ;-)
The sawfish window manager which used to be in Gnome (before metacity came along and made it all corporate and boring, or imposed some sanity, depending on your point of view) was great for themes.  I used to run a bunch of green-on-black xterms/emacs decorated with a spiky metal theme and it looked great (for it's time).  What eventually killed it for me  was the increasing likelihood of having a black-text-on-white-background web-page open on the desktop; these just do not look good in a dark desktop theme (way too bright).  What you really need to be able to do is theme web content too to match your dark hackerish look (OK probably possible through CSS overrides, and some sites let you pick a theme, but there's no standards.  Wonder if anyone's done a firefox extension ?).
And yes, I'm talking real desktop themes, I'm not asking for a GUI to one button trace an IP to someone's exact location or zoom and enhance programs ;)
