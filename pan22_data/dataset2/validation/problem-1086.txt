Now connect your device again manually. Then in Credential Manager click "Add a Windows Credential": enter device name (LS-CHL, in my case) as internet/network address, user name (without domain name) and password. Save.
If you are like our company, some internal sites cross boundaries, and it will always prompt for credentials when crossing boundaries like firewalls, because windows authentication credentials are not being passed automatically across the boundary.  
If you are on a company Intranet, check to see if you are in the correct OU , and make sure that Group policy is set up correctly
Let me know if this works for you. I've used it on about 5 workstations and it has worked for me, but I forgot the solution, which turned out to be easy.
Log off from you Windows account and then log in again. Windows will again say it cannot connect network drive. Open Credential Manager again and you will notice that your device is not there under windows credential.
Is it possible that you already saved the wrong password for this account? (Maybe the password changed?) Try going into the password settings and deleting any saved credentials for the account and starting over:
We are working too hard to fix this... after exhaustive searches, I ran across my note where I have fixed this problem multiple times. It's real easy.
I think this has been everyone's problem including mine since we think the syntax that windows creates must be the right syntax. It doesn't need the machine name, only the user. 
If I try to log in (simply log in Sam and then my password) and check the remember, it saves in the credentials as:

You may or may not get the network guys to update this.  If not you can use a browser that remembers credentials independently.  I have the same issue in chrome, but at least chrome remembers the credentials, and I just have to submit them with a button click instead of entering them again from scratch.
Go to Credential Manager under Control Panel-User Accounts. Look for your network storage device under windows credential and open it. Then select Edit. Replece the domain name in front of your user name (LS-CHL, in my case). Save.
I had the same problem for a long while, but tonight I seem to have solved it. This is how I did it. Hope it works for you and many others. My network storage is Buffalo Linkstation LS-CHL (I will call it LS-CHL below).
