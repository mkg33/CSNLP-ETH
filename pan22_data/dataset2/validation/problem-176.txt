With a method like this, you could calculate these values on the fly, for whatever percentages you want and with whatever name that you want. You could still save the percentages that you want as consts, or you could load that information from another source such that you may not need to recompile the calculator if you want to make changes.  I have recently begun using property lists to achieve this.
One step further would be to save these values together as a class, and pass an object of that class into the calculation method or class, and return the result in whatever format that you need.  
Definitely pay attention to nhgrif's recommendations, he knows what he is talking about.  I would like to talk about something that you might or might not be able to change, so please take it with a grain of salt.
What I do not understand is why you need to set things up in this inflexible way?  It seems to me like it would make more sense and also be more extensible if you could create these calculations on the fly.  I assume this is just a program for personal use, but what if you decide later that you want to calculate these values in another way?  You will have to go back to the code and add more properties or alter the const values that you are declaring, and recompile the code when you are done.
