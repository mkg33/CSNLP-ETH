The outer archive can be some custom format.  If you're a programmer, you can easily create a custom archive format.  Maybe your format simply reverses every 5th bit, which would effectively destroy 7-Zip's ability to make sense of the file.  Then, when someone runs the custom extractor you create, you flip every 5th bit, and run the resulting file (which is the 7-Zip executable).  Your custom extractor can also have a GUI and do whatever else you're seeking to have happen.
The only way to do this is to have the file extract the data in a way that 7-Zip cannot read.  If 7-Zip can read the data, then 7-Zip can show the contents, because that is what 7-Zip does.
The inner archive can be created with 7-Zip and provide desirable features like compression and keeping track of multiple files.  By using a standard format, you don't need to learn how to implement all of the quirks of a standard format, but you get the benefits provided by the common support of that format.
Consider making multiple archives.  One way you can probably achieve your goals is to place an archive within an archive.  Make the inner archive perfectly accessible by 7-Zip, but that won't matter because nobody can see the inner archive until they first crack open your outer archive.
