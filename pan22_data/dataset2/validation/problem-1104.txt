I don't want to answer definitively, as I'm not a hardware expert, but I've swapped PS/2 mice and keyboards hundreds of times with the power on and never had a problem.  One thing you may notice is that any custom settings for the keyboard may get reset; for instance, if you've increased the key repeat rate in the O/S settings, it will probably revert to the default.
I'm unclear whether there is a possibility of hardware damage (I've never done any damage, and it's just a serial protocol, so I THINK it's safe hardware wise). 
The problem that I've found is that when hot-swapping PS/2 devices, I often lose control. That is, I take one keyboard out, put the new one in, and it won't work until I reboot the device. I'm unclear whether this is an interface level problem (something gets out of sync in the protocol, or a resettable fuse trips somewhere), or whether it's a driver level problem (lost comms mid-packet and never re-syncs), but I know that swapping PS/2 keyboards is a very hit-or-miss proposition.
