I think Bluehost uses Plesk/cPanel.  On these systems, local email delivery is enabled by default.  
For email you will need MX records setup on the DNS server and they will need to point to an SMTP server to accept email for your domain.
On systems like Plesk, you can simple disable the email service entirely (it does not impact the mail() function).  On cPanel, there's an option for using MX records instead of local delivery.  If your host controls these, you may need to explain, that you do not want local email services enabled on your account.
As a result, email from your web form to your own web site domain will fail.   Email to external domains will work.  
What is happening is the web form email is being delivered locally since MX records are not consulted.
Basically, I have a PHP based contact form that utilizes mail(). Whenever a contact request is sent through with the recipient being an email address at the domain hosted with Go Daddy, the email never makes it through. However, when I have it go to a different email address, such as @gmail, the email is delivered without any issue.
With most MTA's, if the email domain is listed in the MTA's "local" delivery list, then DNS is never consulted.
