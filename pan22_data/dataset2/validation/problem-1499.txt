This way, you will see your ISP router's external IP (2.3.4.5) as opposed to your router's external interface address (10.0.0.2).
I'd assume you are talking about a network like this, and you want to know the ip represened by 1.2.3.4 in the below graph:
The method suggested above by others (to use a website to see your own ip address) had the advantage of being easy to use and simple, but this suffers when this network configuration occurs (NAT by ISP), where no public IP address was allocated to you:
Of course. You have an external IP address on the other side of your NAT + Router device. The simplest way is to actually look at your router's configuration or status page, which will display it. Another trick is to ask someone else on the internet what your IP address is - there are numerous websites which will show you what IP is accessing them. Note that this may not be the IP address on the external interface of your router, if your ISP is performing carrier level NAT or uses transparent proxy servers.
Does my wireless router have an ip address that's independent of my computer's ip address?  Is there any way to determine what that ip address is?  Note: I'm not talking about the internal router ip address: 192.168.0.1, but one that is visible from the outside.
The simplest method is to log onto the router and see the interface address (which I assume you should have the credential to do so. This is by far the best method.
