Shedding a bit more light on your storage requirements would help you get the most out of Server Fault.
Things are changing because many enterprises are putting rarely accessed data (archives) onto SATA drives on SANs, which are protected by using the appropriate RAID. But the critical stuff goes on SCSI/SAS, with the appropriate RAID. So - there's a balance to be had.
Depending on your design, you might be able to get away with both: faster, smaller SAS 15K drives in a RAID 0 configuration (or possibly SSD) for your data sets that require the most I/O performance; and slower, larger SATA drives in a RAID 5 configuration for archival, less frequent storage needs.
That said I'd ask you to consider whether these 3TB disks make much sense in a server at all, certainly if you're asking about performance and 7.2krpm disks in the same sentence anyway. In my experience you either need capacity or performance, if you want both you have to spend serious money.
SATA drives don't have the reliability of SCSI/SAS drives (the Mean Time Before failure - MTB), so generally aren't deemed suitable for most enterprises. 
In single-user tests SATA can actually outperform SAS but once things start getting concurrent then yes SAS proves itself. So it depends on load, you don't mention your use case, for busy servers that can't cache enough of the drives content then SAS may make a lot more sense.
