You can extend on tic-tac-toe to have a computer opponent, which would introduce you to very basic AI (even if the computer just places its piece on random squares)
So, I was thinking about working in some place else, while I study it. What I really want to know is, a good place to learn, and a country that developers are well payed to be able to pay my course and still have money to do something else.
After you're comfortable with 2D, start making simple basic 3D games. It doesn't have to be the next big shooter, or an MMORPG, it could potentially be 3D versions of the 2D games you've already made.
DON'T get caught up in all this talk of game engines and C++ and don't try and get ahead of yourself. When you're too ambitious when starting out, you end up getting stuck on a problem, get frustrated and give up on it.
Once you've made very some simple games like that, move on to 2D graphics. I'm sure you can find OpenGL wrappers for Java and use that. You could make Pong or (slightly harder) Tetris.
Personally I learned with this book: Sams Teach Yourself C++ in 24 Hours. it's in 24 chapters, and you can get through it in a week or two and have a good foundational knowledge of C++.
As for countries to learn game development, the United States, Canada and Europe have universities or art institutes that provide programs focusing on game development; I don't know any off the top of my head, but you can do a search for them.
Get some books on what you're interested in (Game Coding Complete is a good book that introduces all of the fundamentals you need to make games. Amazon Link: Game Coding Complete).
Of course when you do get stuck, you've got sites like this to help and places like www.gamedev.net.
Firstly, I would start very small. If you know Java, then use it. Don't worry about people saying you need to use C++, there's plenty of time that later. If you're comfortable with AWT or Swing, use it, rather than looking up OpenGL libraries.
For starters, you'll want to learn to program in general. Once you know how to write code, you can work on applying ti to games specifically. I would recommend learning C++, some think it's harder to learn than others, but I personally didn't find it too daunting and it is something you will need to be proficient in eventually.
Personally, I think this site is best for specific game programming questions that you have. Since learning game development is quite a broad subject, there are plenty of varying opinions on it.
The only way to learn and progress is to keep making games. You can use bits of reusable code in your later projects, but focus on making a playable game before you start refactoring code and optimizing.
I really think that the best way to learn is to try it yourself and learn from your mistakes (this is why you should make a mall game first). Once you finish you'll have a learned a lot and will have a whole lot of ideas on what to do better next time, so, make another simple game.
Start by making a simple word game (E.g. Hangman, Word Jumbles, etc). This will give you experience on the fundamentals of game play. Then a tic-tac-toe game, this will introduce you to very basic graphics.
You could also use C# and XNA for this. C# is very similar to Java and XNA is a fairly all-inclusive API for making both 2D and 3D games.
I don't want to be a downer, but I think that before you have learned game development and built up a portfolio, it doesn't really make much sense trying to think about what country has good game companies, because they will most likely not even look at you without proof of experience.
Thus, my recommendation would be to start building up your portfolio. If you still want to learn from an educational institution though, I would recommend in no particular order:
I'm brazilian and I want to learn how to develop a game in some college or something like that, but I don't know any place here to learn it. Here is not that good either to develop games, as we don't have many companies to do that.
Next, I would try to make a game. A small game. Make Pong, Tetris, Tic Tac Toe or something similar. Focus on making a complete game. Try to figure out everything that the game will need, graphics sound, pause menu, controls, etc, and do everything. I wouldn't completely re-invent the wheel, try using an open source library, I think SDL is great. 
Sloperama - good, sound advice, geared more towards the business and design end but stil very helpful.
I don't know if you have thought about it, but I wanted to make sure that you are aware that just moving to another country is not that easy. For someone that has had the privilege of studying and working in the U.S. for around 9 years before moving back to my country - Bahrain - there are a few points I wanted you to be aware of:
Don't get too ambitious, make something small and simple, and focus on finishing it. Here's the thing, you will probably do a lot of things wrong, that's OK. Don't worry about getting every little thing right or making it seem professional or polished, just finish it.
