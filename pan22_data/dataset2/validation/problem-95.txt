First, I open a cygwin bash terminal.  Then, I type startxwin and hit enter.  Two new tray icons appear.  One of them resembles the cygwin logo, but with a green X inside the black C.  I left click that tray icon and find Image Viewer on the Graphics menu.  When I click that, Eye of GNOME starts.  (And the 'auto refresh' feature works.)
Linux software cannot run on Windows. Cygwin provides a way to compile software designed for Unix into something that may run on Windows. I've never used it so I can't say what the limitations are, but given the existence of CyGnome I would assume it's possible.
And if yes, can I remove Microsoft's own apps(Windows Explorer, IE, Windows Media Player, ...) and replace them with GNOME 3 Apps?
Alternatively you might consider checking out GreenGnome instead. It's a port of Gnome 1 to Windows. The project is long since dead, and was from the XP era. http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl=uk&u=http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greengnome&prev=/search%3Fq%3DGreenGnome%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DhgC%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26channel%3Dfflb . A long time ago I used this for a bit, and worked nicely.
http://cygnome.sourceforge.net/ They started a Gnome 2 port project, but it died. http://cygnome2.sourceforge.net/
To avoid compiling yourself you could also check out CygWin Ports which says it has a Gnome 3 port, as well as Nautilus, and Empathy. ftp://sourceware.org/pub/cygwinports/portslist.txt . I've never used it so I don't know the specifics of getting it up and running.
Just install gnome-flashback and xinit from the cygwin setup, GNOME Flashback shortcut will appear in your start menu in the Cygwin-X folder.
I want to install GNOME Shell and its core apps and features (including Natilus, Evolution, Empathy, Multiple workspace, and more) on a Windows 7 platform.
I installed these cygwin packages (and their dependencies) and I am now able to use Eye of GNOME 3.18 on Windows 7.
