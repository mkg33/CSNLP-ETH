As far as recovery, I wouldn't trust anything shy of restoring from a known good backup.  Those edits are just the ones you found.  Who knows what else might have been put in there.
Make sure you keep Joomla up to date!  Keep on top of security updates and get them installed on all sites they day they are released.
My guess is that they got the password for your server with a Trojan. Check your computer asap, specially if you store the server passwords in any program (browser, ftp clients, total commander, etc.) Btw: I'm assuming you're using windows
Anyway, this sounds like an automated attack. Do a search to check if other sites (not in your server) had the same code injected to them.
You don't give us enough details to be able to help with the how, it was almost certainly an automated attack and trying to track it down will just waste your time.
Which seems to be a backdoor and the img src is just used to notify the attackers that the backdoor is there...
That statement is your first problem.  If you google for "joomla hacked" there are 280,000 results just in the past month alone...  
For tracking them down, you might want to start by reading this: http://kb.siteground.com/article/Joomla_hacked.html
In a nutshell I'd say your chances are close to nil.  However, they go up a few percentage points if you happen to have deep pockets or government backing.
There is no quick way to recover from this. Nuke from orbit and restore from a known good backup is the only way to go.
About tracing the hacker, its not going to be easy. First check the access-logs from the time this happened. You'll probably see tons of ftp activity there. Have a look at the IP of those logs. If all of them are different, then he's probably using zombie computers and its very unlikely that you'll get to him. If they're all the same, then you might be a little more lucky.
