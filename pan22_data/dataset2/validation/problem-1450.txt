You may use VMs or Docker or ...  These may confuse the issues of Ports, binaries, etc, since they chop up your machine is ways that sort of give you separate logical machines.
If yes, then how? I also want to understand the implication of using the single binary for running two instances. Does it affect the other instance in any way during recovery process or any other db intensive task?
You must have separate data trees and my.cnf files and Ports.  Your client(s) must pick the instance via the Port number.  That's about all you need to know.
Currently, I am only installing once and running the first instance using systemdctl whereas I am running the second instance manually using separate cnf files.
DO I need to create separate instances of the MySQL-server binaries for both instances? And do I need to install MySQL-server RPM for a second time into an alternate folder?
There are several questions on this forum relating to this, and they discuss details for what to do before 5.7.6.
I have gone through this link(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/using-systemd.html#systemd-multiple-mysql-instances), for installation of multiple instances on single machine but this support is enabled from 5.7.7 version whereas I am using 5.6.34.
I want to run two MySQL instances on the same machine. The reason behind this is, I will be needing two databases with entirely different configurations.
