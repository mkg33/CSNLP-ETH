I googled around looking for solutions, and found some sporadic anecdotes about similar situations.  The consensus seems to be that... seriously, this can potentially be solved by removing the 3ware card, blowing on it, and reinserting it.  (Apparently this solution was devised by Nintendo.)
Don't know if that's going to help anyone but on my side this issue was resolved by booting offline. I have no idea what could be the relation between the NIC and the controller but it's the only cycle that worked.
I have a RAID array using a 3ware controller which has failed - (not simply degraded, but multiple drives failed, so the array needs to be discarded.)
I rebooted the computer to try and get into the 3ware BIOS Manager.  However, when booting, the system says "Waiting for 3Ware Controller to Initialize...", and simply hangs forever.
Anyway, I actually tried that - I reseated the card and reinserted it.  After rebooting, I still have the same problem - hanging forever.
We were having a similar problem, but different in that the card was new and would not work with more than 5 drives. Happened to have a second card on hand used in a similar machine, that one worked in the same machine when swapping it out. Ended up needing to update/re-flash the firmware on the new card, this fixed the issue.
