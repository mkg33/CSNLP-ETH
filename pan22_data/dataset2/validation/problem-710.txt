One small thing to check; from the asterisk CLI (run using asterisk -r), do a "sip show channels" while the recording is playing to confirm the codecs you expect are being used on the problem channel. On my systems, I've also discovered duplicate recordings with .WAV and .wav extensions, where each worked with specific codecs. When I've had similar problems, I found that the recordings were created with a different codec than what was currently in use. (ie; recorded from a handset connected via g729, then copied to a system using ulaw.)
I have no idea why I can't hear the sound even though it's saying 'Playing'. The file (custom/Sales.wav) is present, the permissions are right, ownership is correct, codecs ulaw and slin are allowed in sip.conf. 
I'm setting up an IVR in asterisk. It was working fine but I installed some new hardware and the sound has disappeared. I can see this in the console: 
If your SIP phones hit the default context, then any incoming calls will play the "Hello World" sample sound.
Can anyone give some hints on how to debug this thing? (Btw, I'm using FreePBX for configuring the IVRs).
This will at least tell you if the SIP phones are able to register with the server and place SIP calls, and tell you whether your dialplan is being reached at all.
If you don't hear any sound, the most basic debugging tool is to setup a [default] context that answers the phone and plays one of the default Asterisk sound files.
