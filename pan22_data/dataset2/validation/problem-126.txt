Ignore Lucas Kauffmans post! For one, a 32bit processor can't run 64bit OS any way, but given the option 64bit OS will be able to map more memory and process more per cycle, giving better performance. 
I currently have 104 servers all running Ubuntu 12.04 Server 64-bit without issue. They consist of web servers (mostly), MySQL database servers (combination of stand-alone, master/slave, and master/master), mail, DNS, development, and various other needs. Haven't had any problems at all.
I will be building a new server for a small network of Windows XP and Windows 7 machines. The server will provide the following services:
According to me, Ubuntu server 12.04.1 64bit  will be smart choice, more stable, having latest security updates. You should use 32bit in case no hardware supported 64bit.
Our current server, is running Ubuntu Server 10.04.2 LTS. It is showing its age, that's why it will be replaced by the new one. But the overall stability and performance over the last 5 years was very good, so I want to stick with Ubuntu.
There is no reason to prefer the 32-bit version. Canonical even recommends the 64-bit version when downloading Ubuntu Server.
Although I've been running 64bit versions of 12.04 since it's release date I've not had samba installed on it - the pair of them (have 2) run web services - so DNS, web server, mail relays etc and all been stable. Only problem we had with them was when the UPS died .. oops .. learnt a valuable lesson that day .. redundant PSU's
I would not recommend downloading 12.10. The non-LTS versions often include more unstable software. For instance, in the first month after 12.10 came out, PHP-FPM would segfault at boot. The LTS is usually the way to go for a server, as it has been thoroughly tested.
32-bit should only be considered if you are running older hardware and the CPU isn't 64-bit capable. Once you get above 3.5GB of RAM a 32-bit kernel will need the PAE extensions in order to access the remainder of the memory, which just adds overhead. If your hardware is 5 years or newer you shouldn't question putting a 64-bit OS on it.
Also, I would like to continue using a browser based frontend for administration (currently we use Webmin and I like it)
