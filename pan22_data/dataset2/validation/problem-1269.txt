But if you really want to lower your CPU temperature, then I suggest you buy a new heatsink. Stock heatsinks aren't very good at cooling your CPU to "your satisfaction"

Yes, it could be the thermal paste, or even not quite a flush mount. I would suggest picking up some new thermal paste from either an online resource like Newegg, or from a local retailer like Fry's or Microcenter and follow the instructions provided with the product closely. Additionally, make certain the heat sink is flush, and mounted firmly with all 4 pegs. If even one is loose, the gap created could cause the problem you are having.
Thermal paste is VERY important for CPUs and GPUs...  it's not typically 24-degrees C different... but a must-have none-the-less.  It's more likely that you didn't seat the heatsink/fan combo correctly.  (sitting at angle... not all 4 posts are seated on motherboard... etc...)  As a tip... remove the heatsink/fan combo by turning the black pegs 1/4 turn then pulling them up.  they should pop up fairly simply.  (don't force them... )  After removing the heatsink/fan... apply a dab (1/2 pea-sized-ish) of thermal paste... (don't go for cheap white paste... get some good stuff like artic-silver) and spread it around.  Don't put gobs of the stuff on there... as you don't want it to go places beyond the CPU... you just want enough to cover the cpu and not ooze over the edges.  To re-attach the heatsink/fan... make sure all 4 posts are in their upright position... turn them back the 1/4 turn to the locked position... line up the white pastic bits with the 4 holes on the motherboard... and push down until they lock in place.  Make sure the peg goes through the hole... and the plunger locks in place.  It should be locked rigidly in place for each post.  (no wiggle room)
First rule of thumb. Always clean and replace thermal grease when you reattach heatsink. If your heatsink comes with thermal pad, besure to remove them before apply thermal grease.
