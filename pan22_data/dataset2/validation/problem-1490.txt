It won't tell you how much %age disk bandwidth you're using, since it doesn't know how much bandwidth your disk has.  In any case, your disk only has the manufacturer's quoted figure for large transfers of contiguous data.  
See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/iostats.txt and https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/block/stat.txt for documentation.
As suggested by sastanin in comments, you can process directly values given in /sys/block/sda/stat or /proc/diskstats.  This may be helpful when none of the other mentioned tools are available and you can't install them easily.
I would recommend taking a look at the nmon tool. It will show you live load on a number of system parameters as well as recording data to a file for later perusal. It's a free tool available here:
I think RRDtool should do what you want here it uses a daemon to dump system data and then allows you to process it however you like. I have often used it to produce graphs etc. to measure system load.
You should take a look at atop, which combines the power of iotop/top/iftop, all in one place, and highlights the critical parts on your system.
