I started to recover my /dev/sdq1 when I was not familiar with HDD recovery. Well, I was careful enough and recover 85% in about 500 runs.
I've found out that contents of /dev/sdq1 start at 32256 byte of /dev/sdq with fdisk. I dded these bytes at the beginning to separate file begin.raw and now running cat ./rescue/begin.raw ./rescue/fixed.vdi > ./sdq.raw to prepend them to recovered data from /dev/sdq1. 
Below is my script I use to recover data. Sometimes I had to detach HDD physically because my usb hub does not support complete power off on its ports.
P. S. I have Logitech USB 2.0 hub but it does not support full poweroff on ports either with uhubctl. Maybe there's other tool that can work with it?
Afterwards, I've found out that I need /dev/sdq (without 1) contents actually to convert them after to .vhd with VBoxManage convertdd z:\fixed.vdi d:\disc.vhd --format VHD and after I can attach and read that .vhd in Windows, because VBoxManage does not support partition conversion and requires full harddrive raw data as an input. That means I should have started ddrescue with /dev/sdq and not /dev/sdq1.
Is there an easier way to continue runs of ddrescue to that new ./sdq.raw with old rescuelog? I'm not sure that --output-position will fit here. (and how does it work exactly? -- This is not clear from docs how output-position will influence on rescuelog interpretation).
