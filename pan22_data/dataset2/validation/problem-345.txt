I'd love to be able to hibernate one Windows instance, boot into another, then switch back to the first instance and have it resume my hibernated state.
I think you can do this if you install both Windows versions on different physical volumes and then use the boot device selection of your BIOS to choose the one or the other. On my computer this can be entered by hitting F11 at system boot.
Is there some sort of hack or software product that would enable that, maybe by renaming the hibernation files based on the the instance I'm booting to?
Funny thing is you can actually do this when using one instance of Windows and one of Mac Os on a mac: hibernating your windows will basically shut off your computer, then you can boot it up again under Mac Os, and if you turn it off again and boot windows, you will restore your initial windows session as though it had never been switched off.
I've done this with Windows and Ubuntu. However you will need to fully shutdown the computer before installing the 2nd OS (If it is not already installed) But after than I could hibernate both OS's and switch between them.
So in the end, I guess it does have something to do with the bootloader. It would be interesting to know if you can reproduce the same behavior with some Linux and Grub or Lilo, and with multiple Windows...
I can't provide a detailed and simple answer, because I never multibooted more than one windows, but you have to options:
I understand the technical issues with why it's not supported - I could make changes to the filesystem while I'm running instance two that would cause my hibernated state in instance one, but I'm a big boy and don't need to be protected from myself.
Now I'm not sure if this will work on Windows, but assuming they are set on 2 different partitions, I don't see why it wouldn't work the same way as it did for me.
