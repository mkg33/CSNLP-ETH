I run Monit to keep check on processes on a Debian server. It's working as normal for all other services (Apache SSL, Postfix, SSH etc.) but Monit's checks on Dovecot are failing repeatedly. I think this may have started after installing some package updates, but I'm not sure when. 
Dovecot is working correctly for client connections as email is still working. I've tried testing with open_ssl s_client and all seems fine for SSLv3, TLS1.1 and TLS1.2 from there too.
Option 1 is the only real solution as the other two force the you to test something different that you were hoping to test, but they do at least easily provide a similar test while you wait for the update.
'dovecot' failed protocol test [IMAP] at INET[localhost:993] via TCPSSL -- IMAP: error receiving data -- Success
If you want to monitor dovecot in general, you might consider monitoring port 143 without SSL by using the following configuration:
The problem is caused by http://osdir.com/ml/ubuntu-security-announce/2014-05/msg00023.html as TomDogg mentioned.
I thought it might be something like this https://secure.kitserve.org.uk/content/ssl-tls-version-conflict-zarafa-monit but I've tried replacing 'sslauto' with all of these options in turn, but with no luck: SSLV2|SSLV3|TLSV1|TLSV11|TLSV12
