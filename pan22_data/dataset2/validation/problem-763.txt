Probably your IP address really isn't changing. Most times a "dynamic ip" is simply not static. For example, I have a "dynamic" IP address but it only changes every couple of days. The only way to have a true "dynamic" IP address is with dial up.
There isn't one central program or system for IP based banning.  Some sites will ban a single ip, or if there is an especially annoying trouble maker they will ban an entire IP range.  Most likely though if you have a truly dynamic IP and are still getting re-banned the moment you log in, it isn't your IP which is giving away your identity it's a cookie stored on your browser saying you are banned, or a flash cookie, or maybe something which was cached.
Unless you're connecting your computer directly to your internet, your home IP is different from your computer IP address. Your house will usually have an IP address dictated by your ISP while the IP addresses inside of your house are dictated by your router or switch. When someone bans you by IP they are banning your home IP address (which only changes when your IP wants it to, or when you re-lease your home's IP) not your computer IP address.
The reason for this, even when you have a dynamic IP address, is that DHCP (the mechanism used to request a dynamic address) clients and servers both remember the last IP address each client has been assigned.  When reconnecting, clients (such as your router) will typically request that they be given the same address again; servers will generally comply with this request if the address is available.  If the client does not request a specific address and the server recognizes it, the server will frequently offer the same address again anyhow.
If you haven't already verified that your external/public IP address is changing, then I'd tend to assume that it isn't.  Although there are exceptions (such as Om Nom Nom's ISP) where cable/DSL providers will assign a new/different IP address every time you connect, my experience has been that the public IP for any broadband connection will always receive the same IP address except in unusual circumstances (e.g., the ISP reconfigures their infrastructure) or after spending a long enough time disconnected that the address gets assigned to someone else.
They don't ban your numerical address, they (often) use the other form of address, which is more like a domain. As shown in the link below, the ip can be turned into an address, this is similar to what IRC does. IRC is the best example, a type 2 ban will include some * in it, but will generally only affect one person. Another type of ban will ban the whole isp.
If you've confirmed that your external IP actually is changing, then I'm going to have to agree with Daisetsu: Assuming web-based chat, you're probably being blocked based on a cookie that the site has set.
