However, I'm going to assume since you're a company not a home user you do want something which will last a few years.
This is an excellent demo of the Hyper-V server product (free) setup using Netapp NFS as shared storage. During the video Matt gives a lot of excellent advice and background on how to get a cheap HA virtualization environment working. Well worth your time!
In the "Microsoft Services for NFS" window mark all entries, ("Client for NFS" can be skipped) and press "ОК"
There's really only 1 NAS storage company totally buying into virtualisation, and that's Iomega, a division of EMC who owns a large chunk of VMware. They make the Iomega StorCenter ix4-200d NAS server which runs iSCSI and NFS, and is certified by VMware to run shared storage for their systems. Price is around $1000 for 1TB of usable storage.
Some of the "cheaper" entry level SAN type kit from Dell would be the MD3000i & the Equallogic PS4000 series but you're generally looking at the wrong side of $10k or more for those. Alternatively there are some pretty good cheap NAS boxes that are definitely good enough for small scale Branch office VMware type setups that could be a viable alternative but remember that you are planning to depend on this stuff so opting for a real entry level NAS would be a very bad idea. I would not personally build my own whitebox SAN although you probably can build a fairly decent high performance storage server these days for a couple of grand. The problem is that you will be the only person who will be willing to support it and that's really not worth it in the long term.
LeftHand Networks Virtual SAN Appliance is one route you can take. If I recall correctly they support up to 2TB of storage. Basically you set up local volumes, present them to the VSA and it will give you a virtualized iSCSI SAN. It's a bit of a hack but it does work. 
Download and unpack "Microsoft iSCSI Software Target and Management.iso" (WinRAR freely available from rarlab.com can be used)
Click on "Management and Monitoring Tools" -> "Details" -> "Storage Manager for SANs" and Install. Disk 2 will be asked for.
Whether it will give enough performance and reliability for your sites, I can't really say without knowing quite a bit more about your requirements.
You should be back at the previous window, where you have to click on the user and the group in the top list, and click on Allow -> "Modify" for both.

The cheapest of the cheap ways would be to take an old PC or server and run FreeNAS or Openfiler on it, and present the internal storage as an iSCSI or NFS share.
In the "Manage Server Connections" you can enter the names of the hosts allowed to connect to the target
Here you can either pick ALL MACHINES, or use the "Add" button to enter IP addresses of the allowed hosts. Give the hosts (or all machines) Read-Write permissions and click "OK"
We've got VMware as our enterprise VM solution using a SAN but we're looking into the possibility of using virtualisation in-branch.  This might mean ESX or Hyper-V.  As I understand it, to be able to do failover with either host, you need shared storage.  What are our options, given a pair of host servers?  Particularly, at the cheaper end of the scale.
