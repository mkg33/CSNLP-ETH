Never use except without giving it a specific exception to look for. If you made a syntax error like a typo then you'd actually not notice because of that except and you'd probably think there was a problem with the JSON. If you're looking for errors from invalid JSON, that raises a ValueError, so raise that instead.
You should read PEP0008, it's the invaluable Python style guide. One such suggestion is to structure your modules so that all the plain import statements are first, separated from the from _ import _ lines. It's neater and easier to read.
If you're going to have a comment under a function declaration, you should make it a docstring so that it can be useful to others reading your code (as docstrings are accessible programmatically through the interpreter).
