For just brute-force verifying your data, however, I think the best you can do is to manually mount the sparsebundle on your network drive, and use something as simple as 'diff -cr' to compare the bulk of the files from the 'Latest' version against your system drive (which is obviously going to throw up some that have changed since TimeMachine last ran.)
Another way is to use this tool to install Mac from Time-machine to another virtual Mac on HD. I have not tried this yet. Not sure if it is possible to make a virtual box with OSX.
The Time Machine command-line utility has an option to do this: "tmutil compare". Check "man tmutil" for all the various switches available.
Doing a Time Machine backup to a network-based share is known to be more risky and fraught with problems. So, if you really, really, do not want to run the risk of hitting trouble with your upgrade and then having further trouble getting back to where you were then I would strongly recommend temporarily using a local disk and a tool like ShirtPocket's SuperDuper! or  Carbon Copy Cloner
As per Mac OS X 10.6.4, you can initiate a verification of your backup by option-clicking the Time Machine icon in the menu bar. 
I'm not sure what exactly is verified, but when I did it, Time Machine recommended that I start a new backup to improve reliability.
You may try one application from Mac's utilities (Application->Utilities): Migration Assistant. With this tool, you may use one option to transfer information from your backup Time Machine to local computer.
