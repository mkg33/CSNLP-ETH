If you have single load balancer, it wouldn't help too much in terms of high availability, you would still have a single point of failure. CDN  used to be a way to go, but you might want to wait for few more answers...
[4] Maybe in you have to reestablish a new ssl connection after the beckend if you don't trust the backend network
[3] In fact the loadbalancer must do this if he doesnt want to route the traffic blindly by connection.
Everything what have been posted is fine and correct. However I can see a different approach to reach the described goal (fallback system hosted by a third party hosting company): 
[1] Of course the loadbalancer needs more bandwidth than the sum of the maximum bandwidth of the backend servers (this is not necessarily the maximum bandwidth of the interface depending on the application)
The loadbalancer stands before all backend servers ad proxies all request to the backend servers. A secondary loadbalancer stay online as well and checks if the primary balancer is reachable. If in any case the primary loadbalancer will go down, the secondary loadbalancer will take over his IP and start serving.
[5] You have to make sure that when the primary goes down, it stays down until you want it up again to prevent things like toggeling and IPs used twice
It all depends a bit on the situation. A standard way of achieving higher availability is indeed the loadbalancer. The problem is that you need at least two loadbalancers
I have two VPS servers from two different hosting companies. I want to make some fallback to second VPS if first is not available (preferably automatic). I understand that if I have a single load-balancer with root access I can setup it to switch between different backend servers. But is it possible to make it with VPS from two different hosting companies?
Even if you have a load balancer in a third location (you can configure them in HA active-standby) you're still prone to network issues. Since your two VPS are presumably located in two different datacenters you might end with bad network performance, as your loadbalancer would contact the VPS, make the requests and forward responses to the clients, thus if the datacenter containing the balancer goes offline or experiences network issues your  2 VPS are useless.
With this method the DNS provider checks the availability of your main system and switches to a fallback system in case the checked system doesn't respond properly.
But - this is not high-availability! In case of an outage it needs some time to recognize the outage and adjust the DNS. But maybe it's already enough for your requirements.
[2] This is not only good. If both backends are at or near their maximum capacity and the loadbalancer takes one down, the other backend  will get all the traffic and the whole thing ill fall apart. This requires good tweaking
There are quite a lot of suppliers on the market providing this type of service (Amazon Route 53, DNS Made Easy ...). Additionally you will get a faster DNS system (world-wide spread, any-cast listening DNS servers).
