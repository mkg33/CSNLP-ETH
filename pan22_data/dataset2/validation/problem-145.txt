I had the same problem, but, I found with having a lot of devices in my LAN, often a device would take the IP I wanted as static.
I had to make sure the assigned static IP was outside the range the DHCP could assign.  It was set to start at .101 with a maximum of 154 dynamic addresses so I had to assign higher than .255; or since I wanted to use .200+ range, I reduced the maximum number of dynamic addresses to 100. 
Try setting the IP at a higher number, I chose 8, had problems, but when I changed it to 250 I was ok.
Let Windows turn on DHCP.  Next, go to the Network and Sharing Center and press Change Adapter Settings.  Right-click "Local Area Connection" and select Status.  Press Details.
You should re-check the network settings; get in touch with the person in charge of the network and have them verify the settings for you and/or help diagnose the issue.
Type in the same Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, and DNS Server as you had before.  Your subnet mask will probably be 255.255.255.0.  If so, then the first three numbers in your IP Address must stay the same as the DHCP assigned address.  For example, if you had 192.168.0.100, you must use something like 192.168.0.xxx, where you can choose xxx.
The diagnostics tool wouldn't complain if it was able to make network connections, but since it cannot, it assumes that the reason is that you made the mistake of assigning an incorrect IP address on a network where your computer should receive its IP address using DHCP.  It may not be right about the last part.
