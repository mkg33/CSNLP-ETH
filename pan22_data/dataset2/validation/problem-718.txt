Of course, a single scan is not enough. You need to do it regularly in order to get a complete picture.
Once you have a reasonably complete picture, you'll have to start questioning which of the identified services are really needed. Check that the configurations are sane, according to best practices for each. Make sure everything is up to date, antivirused if Windows, the works.
NetFlow was designed to do exactly what you're looking for. If properly set up you can see all of the conversations on your network and discover each service in use. There are a wide variety of products ranging from cheap to enterprise grade, closed and open source. Some of the fancier products will derive dependent services (e.g. the front-end web server depends on the database, DNS, and LDAP servers.) and alert you when there are outages or performance issues.
In Windows you can run "netstat -a -n -o" to list all listening ports in numerical form and match those ports to processes.
Pull all the above together, ask around if somebody can tell you what is supposed to run on the targets, check with users what they use on the machines.
A combination of nmap from the same network (no firewalls in between) and local checks (as the answer by jeoqwerty or lsof/netstat/others on Unix/Linux), check what services are being started, check what is installed.
To use it you'll have to set up one or more collection points on your backbone (either active on your switch, router, and/or firewall or passive via a SPAN port or tap). Each collection point will feed NetFlow data to a collector.
Another possibility would be to scan SNMP information and check out the currently active TCP/IP connections via SNMP. Of course, for windows and Linux computers, SNMP is not sufficient and maybe other protocols such as SSH or telnet need to be utilized.
Once you have all that information, you can determine which server is talking to which client/other server.
Look at the ports open on the local firewalls of the targets, check the configuration of "Internet facing" firewalls, what traffic do they let go through to your targets/leave from them. Any special configuration there is presumably to allow some specific service.
