The problem is... The OS can answer only on the base of what the device itself answered. Usually both the device firmware and the OS drivers are closed source, so you have to rely on their documentation and on the License Agreements. The problem is that both sides are often valued considering their performances. They may rely on the fact that between the go-ahead of the system and the average human reaction time needed to unplug the device there usually is enough time for the modern devices to finish the internal operations in progress.  
To your precise question, no, it is not safe until the blinking stops. Normally I do not see any blinking, but sometimes (not often) I do and wait. That works. 
Moreover, the responsibility of each side is limited by the License terms. Limitations written to safeguard the company as much as it is possible, even if they knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages (see below for Windows 10, but you can find similar for the devices producers).
In my personal experience only a few times in several years (and specifically not with windows 10) I remember a data loss or file system corruption if removed quickly immediately after the go-ahead of the system. But it only happened with a second person ready to remove the USB and run away (immediately) after the go-ahead of the system and when writing operations were required at the very last moment.
You ask to remove this drive from the system. The OS stops/refuses the new I/O operation requests from its programs, waits the ending of the current I/O operations and checks if some lock is active on the device. When the device communicates that all the I/O operations are ended the OS will release the device declaring that you can safely remove the device.
So, since they discharge the consequences in advance and are valuated on their performances, it is up to you to decide to what extent you can trust them and you will feel safe. 
The blinking indicates some activities in the device, or at least an hardware (not OS related) communication to the user. The blinking of some Seagate models is an error code [avid] communication. You may check if, with your model, that way of blinking (short or long pulses) has a special meaning. Usually 8 short pulses mean the byte zero, and 0 is the exit code of the program with no error at all... 
Premise. In general the scope of the question is so wide that there cannot be other single universally valid answers: too many models and brands may be involved. You must refer to both the manual of your HDD and the instructions of the operating system and drivers, consider the most restrictive and yet you will not be able to be absolutely safe.
