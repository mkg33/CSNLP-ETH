Uninstall chrome and remove the chrome folder from ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/ and install again.
As soon as I saw "Keychain" in the above comment it was clear ...went to keychain ...typed the root word for the site with the incorrect and unsaved updated passwords ...opened the keychain for that site -erased incorrect password and replaced it with correct one ...clicked "save changes" -tried logging in to site ...new password was there.
The desktop is synced with icloud in latest osx update. If your browser icon isn't on the desktop it is going to adversely effect the browser. Open finder and drag the browser icon to the desktop and leave it there. Browser should be fine now.
Chrome does prompt and offer to save passwords. However every time I click Save, it doesn't actually save. The Manage passwords - Saved passwords is an empty list.
All within Mac OS and no need to get into anything potentially messy such as terminal or re-installing Google Chrome xoxo :) 
With an hour of search and trial it got fixed. Initially I thought it was an OSX issue. Because I recently had an El Capitan upgrade and it gave me a hard time with KeyChain. I have other devices, iOS and OSX, none of which has any problem of password syncing.
Shouldn't have stopped there. It turned out to be a problem of user profile after all. The right place to edit is actually here.
Clicking the X deletes the current user and apps. No worries, signing-in again reinstall them back in a blink. All my saved passwords in account got synced as well. Happy autofilling ever after.
