For shares, I can create a batch file that will NET USE the different fileservers we use here but that is a huge security risk as I will type my password as plaintext.
A Windows (&Samba potentially) domain will use a single sign on system called Kerberos to authenticate you when you log in.  Once you have been granted a Kerberos ticket you can access any "kerberised" service without having to type your username and password again - such as your file server. 
For some reason, the IT department at our company does not want to add Windows 7 and Windows Vista machine to the domain controller.
You may have some success by ensuring your local Windows account uses the same username and password as your domain account and for instance mapping the network drive.  Also you can frequently save your credentials in the applications - but this obviously a potential security issue and as anybody who has ticked Outlook's save password box can tell you it frequently doesn't work.
Is there a way to mimic the behavior of a machine that is added to a domain without actually adding the machine in the domain?
I hate to always provide my network credentials everytime I access a shared folder on a machine that is joined to the domain. I also hate to always provide my password when I launch outlook or Visual Studio (Team Explorer).
