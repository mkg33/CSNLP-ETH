Perhaps taking a look at the assumptions around the fog of war.  In my experiences with RTS games, the fog of war exists immediately at the start of the game.  But perhaps instead, put it to the players to create the fog of war.
There's a reason no-one made space games like this. It's so difficult to control. Even just catching up to a ship and matching speed with them is difficult. So the player would simply click the 'match speed with target at optimum firing range and arc' button and let the helmsman take it from there. The helmsman a.i. would attempt the maneuver, and would report back if they failed "sir, the enemy ship is retreating and they're too fast for us to catch up. Should we abandon the chase? y/n" or "they're too manueverable. I can try to get us a firing arc but we'll be outside of our optimum range y/n."
And, by the way, concentration is flat throughout the game. It's just that you focus less and less on planning and more and more on using your assets, but the focus doesn't increase, it just shifts.
There would also be default a.i. routines to allow them to react to surprises without input from the player. If they spot an enemy, the a.i. would decide to fight or flee, accelerate to a speed that allows evasive manuevers etc.
One question might be to ponder whether you actually want to make an RTS at all.  The "real time" part of the game encourages tactics to appear beneath the strategy, and tactics are always time critical.  You might want to make a turn based game instead.
I'd also point out that Poker meets most of your criteria, especially when played face-to-face.  You can't gain an advantage from betting faster than your opponent, so you have all the time in the world to study their face and try to figure out what they have without revealing what you have.
Considering that reason, would there be another way of reaching what you want without breaking the game ?
I'm going to attempt to address the lack of information due to the fog of war, and ways to mitigate that.
Or perhaps you want to make a hybrid.  Perhaps you can make a slow strategic game in which armies enter "battles" instead of actually fighting each other.  Then, on their own time, players join those battles and fight in them RTS style.  This would feel similar to how RPGs often have an overworld which then enters a "fighting mode" when you run into a monster.
Another assumption in your question seems to be that players will have no idea what the other player is doing. However, in games like Starcraft, some units exist with the intention of being able to scout for information. Or there are some other means of revealing information like scanning from a Terran Command Center.
The balance in RTS come from that basic relationship, which itself has been exploited for millenias in various pre-electrical strategic games.
However, it may be quite hard to apply that to RTS : it would imply that players are already met with various and complicated moves available right at the begining of the game, and that this complexity doesn't change through the game. Strategic games are about setting and using assets on a field in order to reach your objective against one or more opponents with their own objectives that are (often) mutually exclusive with yours.
There could be a way to regenerate these units automatically (a clone bay, in space) and to auto-repair the buildings. And there could be an automatic upgrade program which upgrades the units/building as time go by. 
At the begining of the game, you have almost nothing, so the variety of your moves is at its minimum of the entire game. Meanwhile, since the game just started and you haven't built anything yet, the variety of moves you can plan is at its maximum. Your strategies aren't yet limited by the options you would have sacrified by prefering others and not knowing what your opponent did - since he hasn't done anything either - don't guide you toward a path in particular.
Rather than making micromanaging easier, I intended to discourage the player from micromanaging by making it very hard. Like, impossible.
To answer your question, you could perfectly design a game which flatens the player's need for concentration simply by flatening the moves the player has : If the complexity of the player's opportunities is constant through the game, it's concentration will reach its maximum right after the begining of the game, which will also be its average. That's how FPS work, by the way, and MOBA in a lesser extent.
I can't recall or find it at the moment, but I believe one of the Red Alert games had a structure that created a black out on the other players map. This was a counter to players being able to launch something like a GPS satellite and have full map vision.
I started making a game a while ago (never finished it because I am lazy/terrible at programming), which was a deliberate attempt to make an a.i. that was much better at the tactics part of the game than a human would be, in virtually all situations.
Reshaping the battlefield to your own purpose so that you get the edge and win is the basis of strategic games. Remove that mechanic and you are stuck with something that looks like a RTS but isn't, like dummy food.
But if you start with the assumption of full map vision, and make it part of the early game to decide whether to build obstructions to that vision or build buildings and units that would be visible to the opponent. You could then cut down on the lack of knowledge in the early game, and provide some more meaningful options as well.
If you are interested in that aspect of games, look at Game Theory, that's the name of the mathematical field that study the behaviour of rational agents being able to interact with a system in various ways, which apply to actual games as well as more abstract situations like negociations, conflicts or parking your car.
Like reactives and products concentrations in chemical reactions, board games have two composants that evolve as time goes :
RTS are like board games like chess or go, except that your opponent's moves are usually hidden from your sight.
It was a space naval battle game. While I built the ability for the player to directly control the engines, guns etc, I also had (or at least started to develop) a.i. routines to micromanage those things for you. The idea was the player was the fleet admiral. They shouldn't be firing the guns, they should be issuing orders down the chain of command.
That RTS's increasing need for concentration is unnecessary, or even that the begining of a game is devoid of it is your assumption.
The problem is that with so much going on, many inexperienced and even experienced players may forget or miss information this way. So another approach might be to make that aspect of the game more approachable for novice players. Perhaps a easier to use scanning ability, or some form of automated spying.
You could remove the parts where the user has to create their base and their army. So when the player starts the game, the base and the army they have is all that they'll get for the rest of their play session. 
Secondly, I used actual Newtonian physics. Engines provide linear acceleration and rotation based on force x distance from center of the ship. There were no speed limits. Bullets were fired off with a muzzle velocity relative to the velocity of the ship they were fired from. Firing guns forwards propels your ship backwards. Getting hit by a bullet on the front right of your ship both moves and rotates your ship. 
What makes a non-twitchy RTS tricky is the limited interface that we have to our computer.  It's very good at making well timed decisive actions.  It's not so good at providing nuanced feedback.  If you have a non-twitchy game, it's going to have to have nuances or it won't keep the attention of anyone.  Nobody wants to play a murky game of tic-tac-toe at a slow pace.
Fair warning: if you don't find this sort of game play in the RTS world, that means there's a good chance that your market of gamers don't find value in this sort of game.  Always be careful with the "if you build it they will come" argument.
Either remove, or disincentivise the ability or need to micromanage tactics, whilst allowing and incentivising the player to focus on strategy.
The fact that your units stand under a bomber's path in TA unless you tell them not to is a flaw in the game. They should dodge even if you don't tell them to.
As time goes, you will make moves, these moves will give you opportunities. The more concrete means of interacting with the game you have, the less you will have room for planning, since each choice you made closed some of those that you didn't choose. Take the example of your first base : Once you've built it, you won't be able to build your first base again. You will certainly build others, but hopefully you will take the positions of your assets into account while deciding where to expand.
That's, I believe, why you can't think of a single game that works like it, or even how you would do it yourself.
