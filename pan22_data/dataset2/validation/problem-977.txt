This is the difference between the UI and the in world objects. Your main menu is a screen space UI, the rest of your objects are in world objects, likely sprites.
Now, in game, these will both look just fine. In the editor, it's going to display the UI using the UI size, except it's going to interpret those values as world units. In other words, it's going to convert pixel units into world units. That means your UI, which is 1080 pixels across, is now going to be 1080 world units across. That's more than 1000x bigger than your game objects.
The reason they're vastly different sizes is just how the editor displays their size. The main menu (UI) has its size based on pixels. Maybe something like 1080x1920. The world objects have their size based on world units. Probably something like 1 unit across for those little circles (wild guess, impossible to tell with the information provided).
So, what to do about it? You can change the scale of your main menu. This won't affect the on screen size, but it will change the in editor size. So, for example you could scale your main menu to .0075 on the X, Y and Z axes. It'll still be the same size in pixels, but will be scaled in the editor to be closer to the same size as your in world objects.
