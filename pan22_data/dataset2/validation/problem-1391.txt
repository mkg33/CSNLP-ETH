No. There is NO way to get the data back. You might have used RESTORE .. with REPLACE which REPLACES the data in the database with the data from the backup that you just restored. So there is no way.
Only thing can help if you have anyone of these like snaphsot, ,mirroring, LOGshipping or replication enabled for that database.
Perhaps the system sends email confirmations. If so, retrieve the emails (from sent items or from auditing on the email system) and hire some temps to retype the information.
I do have to say though, I did have a client recover a QBooks database that way once, and I was really surprised that we got the data back.  
it seems like your only option is a super long shot hail mary.  WITH REPLACE replaces the old DB but I'm not sure if it explicitly searches for those DB pages on disk and tries to overwrite the pages even if the DB is different.  If the data is only 'marked' for deletion from the OS then you can have a very expensive data recovery center look at it.  Sometimes, and I mean with a lot of money, they can look at the magnetic residue and rebuild something from there but the odds of coming out of there without any issues are probably slim.  
Perhaps the system exports data and sends it somewhere else. If so, get the exported data back from where it went and get those temps typing.
