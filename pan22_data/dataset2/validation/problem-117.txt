It's not a particularly neat/elegant solution, but it may just get the job done. I did something similar years ago when mucking about with ld.so and not wanting to mess up the entire system :-)
Things are going to be further complicated by the fact you need a modern version of GCC.  I don't have a decent solution for you, you're going to need to play around with running things with the alternate version of glibc in order to get your newer gcc to build properly.
I've only had to do this on CentOS 5, so you may be able to get away with higher software versions then I mention.
Ahh, welcome to the fun of super outdated libraries.  I've run into similar problems, and our solution was to compile a second version of GLIBC and explicitly use that when starting software.
You could install a newer glibc into ~/lib and install gcc in ~/bin and linking against the newer glibc. I'd advise to use that only for your application that runs on the supercomputer and to link everything (including libc) statically to avoid making a bigger mess than you'll have to make for this.
