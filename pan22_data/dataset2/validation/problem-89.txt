If you notice that another website hosted at a server at the same data center is loading faster, then perhaps bandwidth isn't the trouble.  Your browser could be rendering your page more slowly than it renders the other page.
For a large page, yes, it will show slower. X bytes take longer going through a 10mbit line than through a 100mbit line.
Deciding on speed by when a page is rendering isn't a good technique.  The content of the page affects the rendering time.  There are a variety of ways to actually time the transfer, but again, that's probably telling you more about your Internet connection than your servers.
Note that the transfer speeds that you notice are limited by the slowest link in the chain between you and the server.  If you are testing transfer rates by loading a page in your browser, you're probably being limited by whatever network speed you have available through cable/DSL/whatever.
For investigating the performance of your page, take a look at http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/, there are other similar tools available.
Lots of webpage requests are going to be small, so latency becomes a significant factor because it is the initial delay in the request and delivery of a page.
It is probably because the new line has higher latency.  I recommend you go read "It's the Latency, Stupid" (Not calling you stupid, that happens to be the title.)
That you use an average of 5mbps is irrelevant - you do not talk of averages here. The question is not so much the average, as the spikes, and the spikes can not be handled that fast on a 10mbit link than they can on a (reasonably fee) 100mbit link.
