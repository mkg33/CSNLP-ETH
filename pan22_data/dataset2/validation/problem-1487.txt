If you have the DRAC tools installed, it'll reset your DRAC to factory defaults. If it fails, you're stuck rebooting the server.
I make it a habit now to install OpenManage on all servers immediately after installing ESX as well as setting up the iDrac, just in case!
I know I'm resurrecting the dead here, but here is an "half-answer" for anyone who stumbles across this question.  (I know you've already sorted your issue, and no one wants to reboot their servers if they can help it!)
...as it does require a reboot of ESX after install, at least if you pre-install it, and if you have some unexpected downtime, when the server comes back up you can have all the access you want, as well as change the iDrac username/password.
(I'm not going to re-post the entire page contents - suffice to say if anyone comments on this that the link is broken, I'll update the link)
For one of our machines we lost our root password for the iDrac7 Enterprise interface. The machine is running many virtual machines and turning them off would be a huge task.
For anyone who would be searching for solution. The tool you want to install on esx is called "Dell EMC iDRAC Tools for VMware" 
So, my question is: Is there a way to reset the iDrac Password without rebooting the machine? It's running VMware ESXi 5.5 and I can connect to it via vSphere client as well as SSH.
Here are instructions from Dell, and supports ESX 5.5 to 6.5 - steps 1-6 tell you all you need to know to install OpenManage on ESX, just ignore the last step.
Solution:  push and hold down the glowing blue button labelled "i" on the back of the server for 15 seconds...
