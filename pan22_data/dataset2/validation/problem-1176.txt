As an example, I have a saved game right now in Dead Space where my health is incredibly low, and not 1 second after the save, a big boss monster attacks.  I've tried loading and fighting it numerous times, and basically have given up on ever doing so.  My only solution is to go back to a VERY old save, and frankly I'm not sure if I want to do that. 
It seems reasonable to assume that Mass Effect 2 is a state machine, and therefore, the internal state of the program at any moment can be captured and reloaded later.  This is basically a solved problem - games have been designed this way since the Half-Life era.  It also seems reasonable to assume that BioWare knew what they were doing when they made the decision not to follow this model - it's a tried and true system; BioWare wouldn't have done it the way they did without some good reason.  
Finally saving in other times apart from combat is by design. Again, if the fight you're in is a particularly tense firefight, the developers would want you to experience that tension every time (or something to that effect).
The first and probably the most important reason is to prevent really, really annoying the player. E.g. You're in a middle of a tense firefight, you save the game, leave it for a few weeks, load it back up and you're under fire from all angles without any room to breathe.
Another reason is that saving the states of the enemies at that particular time could potentially be problematic. Saving the game state is fairly simple since everything is fairly static (objects in the game world, position of the player, etc). You could save the enemies, but depending on how their AI was implemented it could cause some serialization issues.
If you save in combat, you run the risk of saving just before something is going to kill you.  Reloading that saved game just puts you right back into the game moments before that event, and it can sometimes be impossible to recover.
So basically, you never want to have the player save the game just before something is going to give them a serious setback.  And being in combat greatly increases the odds of this.
It gives the players a reason to really think about their tactics. With quick save you could just try it the same way over and over (slowly progressing forward) until you have "beaten" it. Without they have to rethink on how to approach the problem. (be it to be less aggressive, to make better use of the abilities or whatever)
So I've been playing Mass Effect 2 (PC) and one of the things I've noticed is that you can only save your game when you're not engaged in combat.  As soon as the first enemy shows up on your radar, the save button is disabled.  Once combat is over, save functionality reappears.
I don't think you should use arguments about being able to save right before you die as a reason why you shouldn't be able to save anywhere or in-combat. As the developer, you can implement auto-saves that kick in around areas where combat is about to break out. That way the player can always go back to before the combat started. You can also let the player have multiple saves, then they can go back to any point that they want if they're using that feature.
