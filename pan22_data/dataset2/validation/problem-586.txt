High-quality laptops come with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo modules that handle coexistence (sharing the 2.4GHz frequency band between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) well. Bluetooth can use features like Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH), and the combo radio modules can employ things like Time Division Duplexing (TDD; a fancy term for having the two devices take turns instead of both trying to transmit at once) to share the band effectively. I have no idea if your particular HP laptop has a good implementation or a bad one.
I just bought Genius HS-920BT BT headset. I've paired it to my PC on Windows 7. However, when I turned on the "Forward Voip calls to Handsfree" service, in order to use it as my Skype communications device, my wifi internet died. 
My PC is HP Envy 3270nr with all the drivers updated (which means little being that HP only published one version of those, with that showing how much they appreciate their premium model owners).
When I attached the headset as "Listen to Music" service, my internet kept running, so did my mouse, but sound became choppy on the headset in cases where I move my mouse and there's an active Internet transfer.
In past, I also owned LG BT speaker system. When the speaker system was paired with PC on "Listen to music" mode, and my BT mouse was moving, the sound on the speaker system would also become choppy.
Is this a driver issue? Is there a way to make all three BT devices (Wifi internet, BT mouse, BT sound system) work simultaneously?
