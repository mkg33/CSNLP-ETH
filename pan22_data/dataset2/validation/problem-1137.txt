I'd almost go the other route and redo the other server to only use one partition instead to solve both your path problem and the issue with tampering with a running production server? Or invest in a pair of extra drives for a separate operating system mirror array and wipe, reload them both ^^
Your best bet is to back up everything, wipe the drive and re-partition it, and restore data from the backup. 
Yeah, as Bart said, move the load over to the other server and then wipe and reload the first one in peace would be the simplest option. But I don't see much point either in having two partitions if they're both on the same RAID-5 array, fully extended - it's not like it will help performance or that inetpub is hard to find on the system volume.
Despite the foregoing, you haven't given a real reason for such an operation, which can cause downtime lasting anything from half an hour to whatever time it takes to restore from the backup. Even when it all goes well the amount of downtime will depend on a number of factors, mainly the size of the partition, the amount of data on it and the level of fragmentation.
First off, repartitioning is no big deal, with a number of readily available products to do the job, but there is always a possibility that something can go wrong. Murphy's Law ensures that the more you need this system up and running the higher the probability that it will all go pear shaped. You therefore absolutely must have backups that can be used from the cold metal state, as others have already said.
Downtime-it could take an hour, or if something goes wrong, anywhere from half a day to a day or more. You won't know until you find out if something goes kaput.
If there's no space to shrink (love Server 2008+ volume management btw, it's finally beginning to do useful stuff like extend and shrink system volumes) you're out of online options. Use a defrag tool that will move files to the beginning of the disk - perhaps the built-in defragger would help you enough. Then re-run the shrink check. Have a well-tested backup and do it during a maintenance window.
Better yet switch your standby server into your production server, then turn your production server into a standby and repartition it with the technique above.
The old idea of separating the OS and data into separate partitions, at least on Windows machines, is only followed by a very small number of admins these days, as most of us learned a long time ago that there are numerous disadvantages and no real advantages. If they must be separated do so on separate drives, not partitions on the same drive. The use of RAID doesn't change this in any way.
You might be able to use a Linux bootdisk with gparted to edit the partition, but you're still taking quite a risk, esp. with the RAID controller.
You would need backups. Tested that you can restore it from bare metal. I.e., you are playing with a partition. One mistake = lots of downtime.
Primarily I'd worry about migrating it off of being a production server before trying anything with it. You're kind of asking for trouble by playing with a live production server's partitions.
Switch your standby server into your production server, then turn your production server into a standby and repartition it, while it might be junk it only has to work while you are rebuilding the old primary.  If this is your bosses idea get him to approve what option he wants- use some planned downwtime and hope that the standby can be brought up if the server rebuild takes longer than expected or swap machines and take potentially degredated services while it's being built.  This shouldn't be your call per se- present the options to the business and let them decide
