But not only because of the download speed, but also because of the handshake that needs to be done between the browser and the server in order to start a new download.
This can be optimized by the browser's reusing one connection to the server in order to download multiple files, but not all website administrators allow keeping connections alive, so as not too have too many concurrent connections open.
Download speed is how fast the connection is from your house to your ISP. It is tested by downloading a file hosted right on your ISPs network to your computer (all speedtests not hosted locally by your ISP are testing latency). It is the physical speed of your "last mile," between your house and your ISP's gateway to its backbone. Also known as throughput.
Download speed was fantastic (for it's time), so if you started to download a large file (eg a service pack or cd image), then it took a few seconds to get started and then it flew.
Surfing speed is a marketing term, and is meant to describe how fast the connection is, subjectively, from your house to items on the Internet. It is always variable, and is out of any one entity's control. It includes latency (as explained above, basically 'how long it takes information from servers around the world to cross the Internet and render on your machine'). Also known as goodput.
Downloading usually involves only one file, but surfing involves many (html, javascript, images etc.).
In conclusion I would say that while download speed is well-defined, surfing speed can vary greatly depending on the above parameters.
Download speed is normally done at the maximum connection speed (at least after the first few seconds).
However, when you were browsing the internet, the same delay occurred for every section that you downloaded. A webpage contained five images means you are downloading six items and the delay occured six times. So the delays mounted up.
All of these things taken into account will give you your "surfing speed". It's really a slightly meaningless number given that it varies wildly depending on exactly what you are looking at.
Hence the broadband connection was 20 (maybe more) times faster than dialup when downloading files, but for browsing the internet it was a lot slower. 
Also a lot of ISPs cache certain websites to make them go faster.  This just means that the ISP which is pretty close to you holds a copy of a website hosted in a foreign country, you're request doesn't always have to go to that foreign country to get that website if your ISP is holding a local copy of it.  This speeds up surfing speed as well, though the same principle could apply to download speeds if your ISP chooses to cache any of those too.
Surfing is more dependent on response time.  Downloading has more to do with bandwidth. Suppose I have an internet connection that takes 150 milliseconds for a www.google.com to respond... If I have 50 of those internet connections, it'll still take 150 milliseconds, but I'll have 50 time as much bandwidth, so 50 times the downloading speed.  Surfing still depends a lot on download speed, especially when getting pictures or flash or movies.
Not necessarily the same thing. Your actual speed of downloading data will be constrained by the bandwidth of your network connection, so suppose you can get X kB / second then that's how many actual bytes of data you can slurp.
