If you are afraid of some changes done to the computer's hardware (like installing a hardware keylogger) that would compromise your privacy in the future, then the only solution is to never ever give the computer to anyone.
It's about compromise, if you provide no hard drive, are you willing to wait for the technician to find a hard drive and install it and the necessary OS and software to diagnose it? Will s/he pass the cost of parts/labor to do this on to you? If you anticipate it going back again, remembering you have an extended warranty, will the technician have to do the same each time? It may be worth the up front cost to you to avoid greater costs down the line.
How much effort and expense you're willing to go to should be balanced with the trust you have in the technician(s) and the sensitivity of the information on your hard drive.
All the other answers are only concerned with the privacy of the preexisting data on the computer, which may or may not be enough for you.
I'd recommend taking out your existing hard drive and replacing it with a cheap low capacity one that you either have lying around or can purchase for a minimal amount. Put your OS on it using the same key (if possible), as this hard drive won't be active in a computer at the same time as your original. You should be able to generate restore media from your existing hard drive. Then, put a simple password in place and keep it as free of personal info as possible.
