After 5 to 6 hard resets of my machine Windows would boot up quickly and properly with no errors. Some daysit would boot on the first try, and sometimes it would take up to 10 reboots.
I scanned the main Windows partition on the SSD with the "right click->scan drive for errors" feature in Windows and it found no errors.
I was tempted to say it is a problem with the SSD, but it is strange that my machine had the same trouble booting off of the USB stick as well. 
Now, after a brand new Windows 10 install on my formatted SSD, I am having the same issue - Windows still refuses to start properly, instead going into "startup repair preparation" about every 5 out of 6 times.
After reinstalling Windows and continuing to have boot issues, I updated my BIOS, which looks to have resolved my boot issues.
I tried to reinstall Windows 10 from a USB stick, but even the USB stick would be stuck on a "never-ending startup" until after 4 or 5 reboots, at which point the Windows 10 installer ran properly and without any issues.
Recently, when I boot my machine, Windows 10 would get stuck on a "Preparing for startup repair" screen. This screen would stay there forever, with the "spinning loading dots" animation.
