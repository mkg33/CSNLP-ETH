The observed behavior ("smooth" SSH immediately after adapter reboot and laggy after some time) suggested to look at power-saving options. Finally, the problem was solved disabling "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" option in Device Manager > Network adapters > adapter properties  > Power Management. The problem/solution was successfully reproduced after enabling/disabling this option (the result is seen after some minutes without adapter reboot). 
The described problem was very annoying too. I tried approach with disabling Large Send Offload and Jumbo Packet as was suggested above (as well as other options in network adapter properties > advanced tab). Unfortunately, the positive result was only "short-time": after adapter reboot, which is necessary to activate chosen adapter options, everything was fine, but then after some time (several minutes) ssh session became laggy/with freezes.
The approach was tested on the following software setups: SSH Secure shell on Windows 7 Professional 64-bit and Putty on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit both connected to different Linux servers.
