Sometimes it helps if you serve the images from a different domain name (say, static.yourdomain.com instead of www.yourdomain.com), but rest assured, the browsers are like Terminator 2, they'll be back sooner than you thought. A simple Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R is enough to force your typical browser to refresh EVERYTHING.
And if you have a dynamic web page, most likely your browser will still try to load the static images, too, even if the browser would have been told earlier that it does not need to come back for the images. In those cases the browser will try to request for an image, and the server will respond back 304 Not Modified. 
But don't worry, that is the only response your browser will get back. No more data is transferred for that particular request, so from the resource side of view that is a very light thing.
How web browsers ultimately behave, that's almost up to the web browser. Some browsers will not request already cached images at all, some will. Some will request them only if tuned for private browsing or something similar.
