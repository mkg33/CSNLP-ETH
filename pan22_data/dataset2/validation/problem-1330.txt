In the past, I've dealt with this kind of problem in a number of ways, the best of which will depend on your environment.  QoS is an option, though it's kind of a blunter instrument than you may want, as noted above.
Alternately, as suggested by Andres, you can install bandwidth-limiting programs on that PC, and depending on the OS and environment you may be able to apply bandwidth limiting settings natively.  If it's a specific user causing this disruption, consider using (or creating) acceptable network use policies to deal with it that way.
Finally, as it's a wireless router (and I assume the client at issue is connected wirelessly), have you considered trying to improve the performance over wireless?  Are you having channel interference or wireless congestion, can you maybe improve the situation by adjusting the antennas or moving the router, or eliminating obstructions, etc?  Looks like a consumer-grade wireless router, which would severely limit your options, in addition to the number of clients and amount of traffic it can handle without problems.
Similar solutions might include client-specific settings at the firewall (if you have one), or fun with routing tables... such as redirecting all traffic between that client and YouTube to nowhere, or just all traffic from YouTube in general to nowhere (again, in the example that YouTube downloads are throttling your connection).
If, for example, this one computer is causing problems by downloading a bunch of YouTube videos, using QoS to throttle it at the router would also throttle regular web traffic, which might not be desirable.
You might also consider setting up a 2nd bandwidth-limited VLAN, if your router supports that - I've had to to do this in situations where a large number of users' personal web activity on the corporate network were generating too much traffic for our poor pipes.  
Problem is that one of the computers on the network consumes a lot of bandwidth - due to constant downloads - severely limiting the network speed on other devices on the network.
A quick check of your router's manual reveals that it supports QoS (QoS Remarking based on IPP/ToS, DSCP and 802.1p).
There are several devices accessing the internet thru a wireless network. I cannot change settings directly on the client-computers, but can have full access to the router. 
Quality of Service is, in this context, essentially a mechanism for prioritizing different types of network traffic based on their destination port, source port, protocol type, MAC address, LAN IP address, connected ethernet port, etc.
As the other two answers so far mentioned QoS, I'll point out that this will only be effective if the problem client is, say downloading over a protocol the rest aren't, or you want to limit ALL downloading on a certain protocol, or prioritize other types of traffic.
You may also (at the router level) be able to apply MAC-address filtering so only authorized devices can get on the network (or so that specific devices cannot). Whether this is an option depends a lot on the router as well, and I'm not familiar with that particular brand.
It's very dependant on the router, don't know for sure if you can limit on that router itself. A better option would be to configure QoS on the router but it's router dependant too.
In your router's administration panel, look for QoS settings and see if you can create a traffic shaping pattern that works for you.
