I appreciate that you're a gamer. You must know that the number of possibilities are already jolly high! As a programmer, I have to say any game you choose to program for the RPi will run on it! As such the options are infinite.
I understand the Pi 3 graphics output on HDMI is superior to its predecessors, but what sort of game did you have in mind? 3D first-person shooters are probably a bit of a stretch.
I recently got my RPi 3, even though I had planned to use it to control an autonomous robot, being a gamer at heart, I'm really very  curious about whether or not it can run games, and if it can (like it runs the the Minecraft Pi edition) how will be the performance? Can regular Linux games be run on the RPi 3? Moreover, I don't have much knowledge about Windows 10 IoT, but can it run the usual windows games?
Quake III is easy to install on the Pi and it looks awesome. This shows what that little processor can do, though, my challenge is to get Quake II running. I'm making an Amiga in mine, but I expect that with so many units sold, new games (like Q3) will be developed to buy and install in the Pi. Obviously older games with 320 x 200 screens in 16 colors don't translate well to modern hardware but by the mid 90's RTG boards and 32 bit processing made high resolutions and huge color palettes programmable and I still get a kick out of Metal Slug and Cruisin' USA on the Pi. (It's hard to believe that was 25 years ago!)
Win 10 IoT don't provide desktop interface. If even it do you was aren't able to play games because most of games for x86 architecture and RPi based on ARM one.
