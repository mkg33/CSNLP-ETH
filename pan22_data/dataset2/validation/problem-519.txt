It technically is since both those 100's have the same context.  Similar to me using 32 as a width in several different places.  It depends how nitpicky you want to be.  In this case I might use something like MAX_PERCENT.  It does help with readability as well since when I see that I know the calculations have to do with percentages.
Any number that remains unnamed remains a magic number. It's not related common usage as common usage is relative. The problem with it is "when" or "where" to draw a line... when does a number changes its state to non-magic...
If forced to use a symbol, I might call it N100.  That way you can tell what its value is.  A long time ago I saw this done for common constants.  And negative numbers were prefixed with "M".   Why did they do this?  Because the computer instruction set couldn't load numbers in line ("immediate"); they had to be fetched from a memory location.  And the assembler used symbols to refer to those locations.
Others have already stated why they believe that 100 is an acceptable constant here. This answer shows how you can get Sonar to accept that.
So if you want to discuss, go for the relative approach. You will find the discussions never ending. And if you think it is over another number comes along.
Under your-sonar-domain/profiles/, you can edit quality profiles, and the rules in them. The "Magic Number" rule is customisable, you can specify certain numbers for the rule to ignore. Simply specify "100" as a number to ignore.
The absolute approach is simple an clear: Every number that is not named is a magic number. Discussion over... for all numbers... Of course this is only a (one) definition. But this definition has inherent properties that will make it possible to evaluate it exactly.
The relative approach will lead to a discussion that will evolve a local aggreement. And the result to consider a number to be non-magic, will depend on when and where you start the discussion. Unfortunally this discussion has to be lead for each number separately.
Or you go and find a definition that can be used in boolean expressions that will evaluate to true or false.
I go the second way with following definition: Every unnamed number is magic. Even if you practically ignore it the statement stays the same.
