One thing to do would probably be to find a better way to implement your software, using tools more suited to performance computing, or even a language/framework that is specific to your problem domain.  Many tools are out there, i.e. Mathematica, SAS, R, and on and on.  In addition, you should parallelize it as much as possible.
You are using the 25% of the CPU because the COM object is single threaded and does not use the other cores of your CPU. You can not increase the performance of your calculation without modifying the COM object code.
Also, avoid using the disk as much as possible.  If you are going to use disk, beyond RAM disks you should consider using a high-performance raid array like a RAID 10, or even better a RAID 10 composed of SSDs.
You should profile your process while it runs and see how much is system time and how much is user time.  I'm willing to bet that much of the execution time is taking up in system calls to perform all that disk I/O.  Get rid of it.
You can then click twice (not double-click) on a column to have it sorted in descending order of values, so as to check for excessive usage.
