If you need to read 1,000 rows, don't get them one at a time, each with their own query. Use a WHERE clause with a list of values that you're looking for, or a range comparison (like greater than a particular ID, and less than another ID.)
You are almost certainly 'doing it wrong' in one way or the other. If your application truly needs to operate that way, you probably should be using some other sort of datastore. Maybe something like Hadoop or a key-value store. Alternately, you may be doing something that is inherently a batch operation and should be done on the server side rather than remotely. Your description sounds like load-test simulation software designed to find the limits of connection pooling.
If you need to write 1,000 rows, try working in a batch instead. Writing all 1,000 rows in a single statement can result in less blocking - whereas 1,000 statements trying to write to the same table, simultaneously, can be a blocking nightmare. (Especially when that table has multiple indexes.)
