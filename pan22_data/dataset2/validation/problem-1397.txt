We're small enough that we use the spreadsheet method - there are only 3 of us that work on the servers and networks, so we do keep it up to date.
If that DHCP scope ever fills (so far it hasn't but it could happen) it's time to hunt up the other admins and see what those servers are doing on the temp address like that. It helps that the DHCP server is not run by the DNS guys, so we can look up leases ourselves.
Data Center IP addressing... We have a small, 8-10 address DHCP scope with a really low lease time on our data-center subnets. This allows us to get a system set up (as far as we can with a dynamic IP anyway) and then request a real address from the DNS guys. The DNS guys do all the tracking of who requested what for what.
But one of our "when we have time" projects is to switch to using DHCP reservations for everything that needs a static address.  We do this for most of our printers now, and it's saved a lot of hassle recently.  All the secretaries and executive assistants have networked printers and there's been a lot of reorganizing recently.  With DHCP reservations, when people have swapped departments, we "swap" their printer IPs in DHCP and tell them to power-off/power-on their printers.
We use a copy of dokuwiki, with a page for each used subnet. Whenever anything is commissioned, it's updated, althought we're small enough that if it's not updated for something, we can probably work out who did it.
I use DHCP for my servers as well, with static allocations based on MAC addresses, then when we need to make changes or quickly lookup a server's IP we just go into our firewall / router's configuration. Saved having to change DNS server options on 40+ Virtual Machines when we rearranged our infrastructure a while ago.
