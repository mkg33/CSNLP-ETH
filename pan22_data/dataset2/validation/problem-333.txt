In what seems to be a just released Firefox extension, the original question now has an answer which is both a direct solution to the problem posed (not how to also remove cookies, passwords, etc from the selected domain which happens through the use of "Forget about this site") and will handle websites which utilise a page redirect rather than a page content change that is undesirably cached. Great design also. Quick and efficient.
If you want to do a force-refresh, which is what I think you want to do, hit CTRL+F5. And of course, Cmd+F5 on a Mac.
I'm kinda late to the party here, but I wanted to leave this answer for people who found this thread through googling like I did. The problem was solved for me by accessing Firefox's profile selector (Windows -> Run -> "Firefox.exe -p"), using a new profile and visiting the website from there. Then when I went back to my regular profile, the website began working normally again! Opening it on the other profile must have refreshed my regular profile's cache with non-corrupt versions of the files.
Another approach would be to use Firefox's containers - create a fresh container tab/window using (using a container add-on e.g. Temporary containers, or Mozilla's Multi-account container add-on) and load your site in that container - a fresh/temporary container will have empty login, cache etc so will act like you've cleared these.
