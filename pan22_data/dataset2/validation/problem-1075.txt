Third, before enabling aging on the zone and scavenging on the server make sure to export the zone so that it can be restored in the event that something goes wrong.
First, understand that an update and a refresh are not the same thing. An update is an actual update of the record, such as a host getting a new ip address and updating it's DNS record with the new ip address. A refresh is a refresh of the timestamp of the record with no other change to the record itself. Updates are always accepted regardless of the No-refresh interval. The No-refresh interval is meant to tamp replication traffic in the case that a record is not updated but the client is merely attempting to refresh the timestamp of the record. There's no need to replicate every refresh of the timestamp, especially considering that Windows clients attempt to refresh their timestamp every 24 hours by default.
Second, you can enable aging on the zone without enabling scavenging on the server so that the DNS zone has time to "shake off the dust", meaning the timestamps of the records for real, honest to goodness clients can be refreshed. You can then see which records are being refreshed and which are truly stale. I'd recommend setting the No-refresh and the Refresh intervals to the default of 7 days each. This should have the effect of allowing all records with timestamps older than 7 days to be refreshed. Then wait 14 days (the No-refresh interval + the Refresh interval) and enable scavenging on the server (I recommend the default scavenging interval of 7 days). Then wait 7 more days to see which records have been scavenged (this will be records that haven't been refreshed in 14 days + 7 days (the No-Refresh interval + the Refresh interval + the scavenging interval).
