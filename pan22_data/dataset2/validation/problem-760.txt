You may want to consider a real Document Management system. These days there are hosted web-based ones available such as DocuVantage which are very cheap and take no time to setup.
At my organization, we are loading up an instance of (DocMgr).  It's free, runs against Postgresql, keeps revisions of documents, OCR, indexing, relevance searching.  It can easily be tweaked to run against MySQL.  The project has been stagnant for a while, but development is picking back up.
I might be able to point you in the right direction a bit better if I was aware of what distribution you use.
With these systems you get more than just file storage. You get version control (can go back to last version), security so you can control access, custom metadata and searching on metadata, full content search of the documents, can tie approval processes to documents, can scan documents in the web interface into the system, can get notifications when documents are viewed or modified. 
I don't know which of Tahoe distributed filesystem or OpenAFS is the most adapted to your setup. Also, if it is only for documents sharing, you should perhaps take a look at KnowledgeTree or AlFresco.
You could quite easily setup samba on your linux file server and share the directories that way. It would allow you to mount the shares, control permissioning, and not drastically change the way you are currently setup.
Here is a link to the current official how to guide to setup Samba: http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/
