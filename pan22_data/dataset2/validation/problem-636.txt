On Synergy, on the other hand, I believe you have clipboard and screensaver synchronization, but aside of that, it is just a KVM switch.
I've doing some testing and it seems Maxivista in remote control mode is better than Synergy because you can keep keyboard focus irrespectively of what screen your mouse is.
Edit to add: Unless you want to have a dual monitor setup for one of them and don't need both desktops visible all the time. Then I'd recommend putting both onto a single machine and RDP (Remote Desktop) into the other. (Yes, remote in from two feet away!)
I haven't used Maxivista, but if its a choice between Synergy and a hardware KVM when you already have a monitor for each, Synergy will win every time.
Maxivista's remote control mode is a little more than that. For example you can use Windows' screen keyboard to type on the other computer! magic!!
I do just what you're describing all day long every day. Two machines each with their own display and one keyboard and mouse on the "server." Sometimes the machines are both Windows, sometimes one Windows and one Linux. Synergy + is so easy to use and get used to that I don't really even think about it any more.
One thing I dislike about Synergy is the fact I still must have keyboard and mouse connected to client pc in order to run synergy in case it fails or if I reboot it. I don't know about kvm.
