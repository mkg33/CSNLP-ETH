2. Windows Vista introduced multiple local GPOs which achieve the same result without a domain controller;
The biggest advantage for me is the ability to whitelist signed executables by publisher. Have a look at this http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee460943(v=ws.10).aspx
At the same it has one BIG disadvantage that make it pretty useless: it is not extensible, and you cannot add custom file extensions that you want to restrict.
As the documentation says: Applocker relys on the Application Identity Service (make sure it starts automatically).
I have read many articles from Microsoft and others saying that the new Applocker feature is 100%  better than the old Software Restriction Policy and is recommended as a replacement of latter.
I use Applocker within my company. The strategy we use is: Deny everything as a baseline (in fact: the Applocker defaults), and then do what was suggested: make a rule that allows for only signed applications (office, adobe, wintools, ax etc.). Most, maybe all malware is not-signed software so won't execute.
Further I cannot confirm one cannot use UNC-paths. In some extra safety deny-rules I use UNC-path's succesfully. The pitfall is in using environmentvariables: they don't work for Applocker. Use * wildcards.
