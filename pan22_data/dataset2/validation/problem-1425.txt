The advantage to the new AC wireless standard is that all devices will be connected at their max level(depending on location) thru to a max possible speed in excess of 300 mbs.  Traditional Routers send to only one device at a time, where AC routers with MU-MIMO can send to multiple devices at once, making sure that all devices are connected at their max speeds and reducing the likelihood of disconnects.
In addition, with range extenders we should be able to form a reliable wifi network coverage.  The reported range of the ac routers I’ve been researching (high end)  have been up to half an acre.
Archer C5400 http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/cat-5506_Archer-C5400.html $250  No failures, but in some cases only providing the low end of 50 mbs instead of the higher 300+ mbs that are achieved on other routers.  I’m never used this company before, but just researching the top tier routers makes me more likely to buy them in the future.  Some users report HUGE range gains.  Some routers have shipped without the MU-MIMO.  It will require a firmware update in these cases.  
Based on my research about real life use (reported speeds via router reviews) it seems like we can expect speeds ranging from 50mbs to 300+ mbps.  So I'd say yes, wireless can replace wired.  I'd be surprised if a single user was using more then 50 mbps even "heavy" applications only run about 5mbps.
I’ve done significant research and it seems that Linksys currently has the fastest router available.  And I’m sure the ability to remotely reboot the router will come in handy.
However reviews indicate that a lemon is a fairly high likelihood about 1 in 10.  There are also business versions.  However I’m not sure that they offer much to us beyond what the consumer version does. Cost is high at $338.58.
Best to move slow on this, as it seems that at the cutting end of technology the chances of getting a lemon router are much higher.
