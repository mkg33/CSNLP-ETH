iOS has WebGL capabilities, but currently they have disabled it.  I do however think it's likely they will enable it in the future, so HTML5 could be a good platform for you.  Also, because your looking at making puzzle games these are traditionally less resource intensive than other genres of games so the current performance should be good enough for your needs.
HTML5 is definitely the best for cross-platform support. As any browser that renders canvas should be able to play your game. Although you'll have to be wary, as there are still some browser specifics. 
As an example, here's Bejeweled in HTML5.  Try running this in your ipad browser: http://bejeweled.popcap.com/html5/ 
Do not rush, take your time, and learn. I also do not recommend stopping half-way to develop on a different platform. 
There is no doubt if you want to develop a game on iPad or iPhone, it is probably best to learn cocos2D and obj-C.
I would recommend a mobile development platform like Corona or Moai. They make the process a lot simpler, by handling all the low-level eccentricities of iOS and letting you do all the programming in Lua.
My suggestion? Pick a random thing you want to do, develop it FULLY, then decide if you liked it, then consider some ideas:
As far as engines to use, I'd look at either Cocos2d or Unity.  Both will get a lot of the heavy lifting out of the way and let you hopefully concentrate on making the game itself.
We make the Construct 2 game maker engine which lets you create HTML5 games.  No programming is required but if you want to you can program your own plugins and behaviours in Javascript to extend Construct 2's capabilities.  If you're looking to make HTML5 games rapidly you may want to look at Construct 2 as an option.  There's an extensive free edition as well which is getting quite popular now.
If you're making a game specifically for the iPad, I'd shy away from HTML5.  You'll get much better performance using a native app.
HTML5 has a good future ahead of it and it's just starting to gain some good traction so now might be a good time to step in!
