The envelope can contain either another printed copy of the whole list of one-time passwords, or the original (non-skey) password, which still works. (Of course for maximum security, if the envelope is ever opened you want to change whatever it contained [either the sequence of OTPs or the original password].)
Background: Two admins share an account. Another one should be given an "emergency envelope" that is sealed and contains information for that account. Breaking the seal is allowed only in case the other admins are unavailable.
Things like Vasco Vacman provide RADIUS authentication, which you could use to log into linux using regular PAM. They require a physical token, and are pricey though, so probably don't suit your current situation. 
I used to use OPIE. It asks for the passwords by number, so you know which one on the list it wants.
take a look at mobile-otp - it's 'cheap' soft-token you can run on java-capable mobile phone. i used it successfully only with web-apps, but as i see they have pam module as well.
Every time someone logs in, it sends them a visible "challenge" which includes the index number of the password it wants. Enough information is given to figure out which line of a printed list of one-time-passwords is being requested  ...without any sort of coordination with any other user sharing the account. (Another way to look at this is all necessary coordination is provided by the computer itself, with no need for the multiple users to ever talk to each other.) Similarly there's enough information (both the index number and the seed) to give to a program to regenerate the requested password (provided of course you know the secret). 
S/Key seems to be the "usual" solution but it requires strictly following the order of passwords on a list. This is undesirable for shared accounts as all parties would need to synchronize use of the list.
Surely it is no good idea to log into a remote system from an untrusted computer. But sometimes it is plain necessary. Exposing an unencrypted SSH keyfile is no option of course. Entering a regular password is none either.
So skey seems to easily fulfill both requirements. Tell me again why you're searching for something different?
