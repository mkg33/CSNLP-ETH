PrimoPDF can be used from the command line too (it has a GUI but it can be used without a GUI too). It has a free version and a commertional one called nitroPDF.
If you are looking for a commercial solution, I think Easy PDF Creator can fill your requirements. I have used it to set up a shared network printer with automatic saving (creates the PDF in a predetermined directory) for a similar sounding situation as what you describe. Can setup locally in a similar fashion as well of course. It was very flexible and once set I didn't really ever have to worry about it.
Its commercial, has a defined support roadmap, and is about as proper PDF as you can get, but is a lot more expensive than other apps here, and is aimed far more at 'Enterprise' solutions.
Depending on your platform, the PDF printer for CUPS might be an ideal solution.  I've used it before on OS X and it's worked great.  (Just tell it where to throw the PDFs, set it as your default printer, and you're good to go.)  Apple is the official maintainer of CUPS, but I'm not sure of commercial support.  I really don't know much about how it's implemented, but it could meet your needs:  http://www.codepoetry.net/projects/cups-pdf-for-mosx.
Have you looked at the Adobe LiveCycle server, it has core modules for automating PDF creation/generation/conversion.
