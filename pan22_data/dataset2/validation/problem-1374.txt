It seems that if any other device within range of the modem is connected to the 5G network the network card on the PC, which is only able to connect to the 2.4Ghz, isn't able to connect at all. 
If this turns out to be your issue, you can disable this secondary network manager so that your computer stops saving (potentially conflicting) network information in two places.
Then suddenly, out of nowhere, my desktop flat-out refuses to connect to the network. I've tried just about everything Google and computer forums gave me and nothing seems to work.
I once had a similar issue. The root cause for me was that my computer had two WiFi managers: a native Windows manager and an OEM (Dell) WiFi manager. Clearing out all saved networks from the Windows manager did nothing to fix the issue until I also removed all saved networks from the OEM manager.
And absolutely none of it so far has helped in any way. I'm honestly at my wit's end. Without internet connection, I can't do my job. So any answers would be greatly appreciated.
Now I'm not sure what exactly was the problem, but I get the suspicion that my roommate might have blacklisted me. It doesn't help his case that we're pissed at each other.
thank you for the help! I tried to get into router settings but my roommate changed the password, so I ended up jumping the gun and factory resetting. Not only did it let me access the settings, it fixed my connection problem.
Make sure all devices within range are connected to the same network type, if more than one is available.
This may be random but I was having the same "Can't connect to this network" issue which happened only very occasionally in the US, Ireland and UK but sometimes multiple times per day in Belgium (Brussels). I run Windows 10 on a Lenovo 15" Flex.
I've restarted the router and my computer multiple times each, I've uninstalled my drivers, updated my drivers, forgot every network on the list, used command prompt, changed the properties of my network adapter, etc.
For a while before this issue, my desktop has had frequent connectivity issues (slow connection, dropping offline and the like) that led me to constantly having to restart our router. According to my roommate, the wi-fi still works perfectly fine for him during these instances, so he's confused as to why I had that issue.
Try searching for a program with "WiFi", "wireless", "network", or your computer OEM in the name to see if you might have a second network manager, too.
I tried the various "fixes" but to no avail and resigned myself to simply rebooting. However, by pure chance I discovered that simply by closing the lid on the Laptop - which probably induces hibernation - an reopening after a couple of minutes I was able to reconnect without the reboot.
I'm on mobile wireless, and the router offers two networks for devices to connect to; the 2.4GHz standard wireless data and 5G on 5Ghz.
