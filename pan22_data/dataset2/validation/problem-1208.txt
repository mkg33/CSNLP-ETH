Can you let me know if there is anything I can do to make my code more scalable and more toward production standard?
First time posting in Code Review! I have started learning front-end development to complement my UI design skillset and am starting with CSS Grid and bootstrap.
                                                <input type="email" class="form-control" id="inputEmail3" placeholder="Email">
                                                <input type="password" class="form-control password" id="inputPassword3" placeholder="Password">

Have a look at the snippets. I think the 2 work quite well, using CSS Grid for layout and the Bootstrap library for things like buttons, forms and navs etc.
