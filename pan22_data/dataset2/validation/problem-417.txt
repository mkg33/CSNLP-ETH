You can make is easier to use by returning a boolean directly, so the caller does not need to make the comparison.
I like that the input functions actually check the entered input matches the wanted type. Though in some cases a user might like to be able to abort some action at the prompt, so returning None or some default value for an empty input might be one choice. 
However, print_fizz_buzz_output directly prints the result. So I cannot use it if I want to do anything else. You’d be better off either:
Then you can rename it to ask_confirm. This allows you to abstract the notion of asking a confirmation with how it is done. You can then consider changing the implementation, and for example support other languages, with localized responses which would not need to be y/n.
I’d choose the second option since it allows for better reusability and you can still call list on the generator if you trully want a list there:
As it stand, your "real" FizzBuzz code is contained in print_fizz_buzz_output, the rest being a mean to grab parameters values from the user.
