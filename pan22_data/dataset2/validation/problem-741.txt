Example: Google recommends using just // instead of http:// or https:// as it will default to whatever is being used on the page. 
You need to tell the browser what protocol you want it to speak to the server. Most browsers support multiple protocols in the main navigation area, such as https and ftp, which use port 443 and 21/22 respectively.
You got that the other way round. If you type http://, then the request goes to port 80 unless overridden (e.g. http://www.yourserver.blah:8080/...).
When we make a request a page from a server, the request by default goes to port 80 on the server that is the http server. Why do we then type http before the path of a resource. If the request is going to a http server it must be a http request.
But if for example you typed https://..., then the request would go - again, unless overridden - to port 443/tcp and would even "speak" a different "dialect". The same goes for ftp:// and port 21, if the browser understands the FTP protocol (as most do).
Also keep in mind, that the usage of a URL is for the user. When you specify http:// it tells the user to create an HTTP request to the address. Your request of the browser for http://www.example.com is then translated to the HTTP protocol. This article gives a pretty good description:
Most browsers do consider the lack of a http:// qualifier in a Web address as meaning "this goes to HTTP port 80/tcp", and they automatically add the http:// for you. Otherwise, you have to specify, and the port chosen will follow the specification.
It is also useful not to think of the "server" as a box, but as "service" running on a specific port. When the client makes the request, it doesn't know who will be receiving it. While the standard is 80, there is no reason that cannot be an SSH server. Imagine a scenario where someone is behind a firewall and wants to SSH to their home box, if they run the SSH server on port 80, they may be able to get past basic firewall rules that allow you to open a connection to port 80. There are defaults, but they are not requirements.
