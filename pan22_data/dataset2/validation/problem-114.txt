Deduplication option is available under Linux, on filesystems BTRFS and ZFS. BTRFS is natively developed under linux and has off-line deduplication tool. I aren't thinking 'offline', you must umount fs. Offline means, actively writed data isn't deduplicated. But later you run tool for deduplicate thinks stored now. Actually probably tool is in beta.
See doc available on the page. For speed up writings and readings, you can add faster devices to the storage pool (specially SDD drives or maybe faster flash USB, pay attention on device reliability).
Other way is inside ZFS. Avaliable as FUSE and natively: http://zfsonlinux.org/  . This do online deduplication, unfortunately this slow down writes because all must be calculated on the fly. You can online off and on this behavior. After you off deduplication, all deduplicated data will be still stored as deduplicated. New writes will be stored as 'duplicated'. If you want deduplicate that data in the future, you must turn on deduplication and rewrite all 'duplicated' files.
