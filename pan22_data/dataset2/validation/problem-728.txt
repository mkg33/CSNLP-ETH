Additionally, if you add the -p parameter, and run it as root, it will show the process that opened the port:
A good and reliable way to check for ports opened is using ss (replacement for the deprecated netstat), it's usable in a script without requiring elevated privileges (i.e. sudo).
The number after the colon in the Local Address field shows the port in use.  If the state is "LISTEN" it means a port that is using for incoming connections.  If the IP address in the Local Address field is 0.0.0.0 it means incoming connections will be accepted on any IP address assigned to an interface - so this means from connections originating outside of your machine.
Usage: option -l for listening ports, option -n to bypass DNS resolution, and the filter on source port NN: src :NN (replace NN by the port you want to monitor). For more options, see man ss
Anything not shown as being in use is free, however users (unprivileged accounts) can only open ports above 1023.
