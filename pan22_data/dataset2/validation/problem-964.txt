If you're willing to consider commercial options, Aspera and Signiant are leading products for this sort of thing. They'll also be much faster than Rsync or anything SSH-based.
I have had success with large file transfers with BitTorrent Sync.  I havent used the Linux version, but the Windows version works well.  It is designed to transfer large files and supports block level changes and resuming transfers.
As a secondary preference, it would be desirable for multi-session support (even more so if it auto-scale sessions based on reliability).  
I need to transfer a directory of large files (~1.5G each) from my laptop at locations with variable intermittent connectivity and high round-trip delay (e.g. From hotels in Asia to servers in Virginia).  Since the source is a laptop, it needs to be able to automatically resume infinitely until the file transfers are completed.
The --partial option will cause rsync to resume interrupted transfers where they left off. You can also include --progress if you would like a transfer status indicator.
