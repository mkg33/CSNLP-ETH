Doing it this way also means you have a PST file with your mail backed up, so if your import is unsuccessful for any reason, you still have all your mail in the PST and can try again.
If your company uses Exchange, you will be able to download your mail from the server just by connecting with your outlook client. However, if you have archived any of your mail to a local PST file, you will need to copy that.
Just use Outlook to import the .PST/.OST file.  Click File, Import or something like that.  Been a while since I used it.  I assume you were using Exchange?  If the .OST file is bigger, convert it to .PST then import it:  http://www.convertost.com/
On your old laptop, open Outlook, then go to Tool -> Optoins -> Other Tab -> AutoArchive. In the middle of that tab will the the path to your Archive file. Copy this file to your new laptop and point the AutoArchive path on the new laptop to the copied archive file. If Outlook can't read the archive file for some reason, you can import this file into Outlook. 
If you do not have Exchange, or you you just want to make sure you've got everything, your best bet is to make a new PST file. To do so go to file-> export. Then select export to a file. In the next menu, select Personal Folder File (PST). On the next screen select the root of your mailbox (Often personal folders), and then export it, to a location you want it to end up in.
