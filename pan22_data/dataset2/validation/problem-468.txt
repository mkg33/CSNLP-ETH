Selecting "automatic proxy configuration" and pointing to where your pcap file resides. Don't forget to use file:// extension.
If you're using a windows VPN connection, there is a check box on the ipv4 settings advanced properties window (of that connection) that (since the release of windows 7 is checked by default) forces all connections to use the 'default gateway on remote network'. Un-check this box and you should be able to navigate to any address. This may require you to specify a domain when you rdp into a machine in your office (i.e. machine.domain.com).
Theoretically proxy auto configuration (PAC) script is meant for this (but this requires some programming).
I think what you want to do is configure your home computer to only use the VPN connection when trying to reach machines at work, otherwise forward through your local(home) router.  Presumably, you won't have to deal with any web filtering that way.
Practically, I think you can use different browsers - one for sites you access via proxy and second for all other sites. In Firefox you can also set up different profiles - one for using proxy, and second for direct access to internet:
