Assuming no power-hungry peripherals and no heavy computations, your RPi will draw about 0,5-0,7A. Since you want to run it 24/7, you should account for these rare cases where it's raining for several days straight without any useful sunlight. If you want your RPi to survive a 5-days outrage (120h), you'll be fine with a battery of 60Ah. This won't be cheap, but if you can afford such a battery, then problem solved.
I am not familiar with battery specific supplies but I have worked with Uninterrupted Power Supplies, and I believe you can get solar ones.
There is a variety of cheap solar powered 5V USB smart phone powerbanks offered at Ebay. Some of them hold a capacity of 50Ah or even 100Ah. 
Another option you can look into kinda stems off of a project I did back near the end of highschool. Essentially, I disassembled a camping solar clock and a Nintendo DS charging cable and MacGyver'd them together. This proved to be fruitless as the DS received an inconsistent charge, was unable to keep up with the load. This would be another issue you may run into.
Those powerbanks include all neccessary functions in one easy installable device. I can't say how long it takes to charge one while under load of a Raspi nor do I know how long the last not beeing charged. But that's easy to measure. Simply power your Raspi by a fully loaded powerbank with a covered solar panel and wait for the Raspy to brown out. You may want to append a timestamp to a text file by cron every minute and afterwards read the file.
The only concern then becomes can you find one small enough for a Pi? Most UPS are for desktops or servers, which may be greatly excessive. Whichever you choose, it must be able to supply the Pi whilst under load.
I would also like to suggest you find one with a wall plug as well to assure reliability when it isn't generating power from solar.
