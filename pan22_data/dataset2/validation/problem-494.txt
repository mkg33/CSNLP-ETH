Is it possible for me to use modern equipment (say, an all-in-one) to accept the signal and then re-broadcast it in my apartment- thereby creating another (wireless) Lan just for my family? Also, I can now add some security to the network, which is non-existent, now.
I would LOVE to know just what is inside the Belkin (and similar) adapter (I can't find out from the internet) as that would help me to understand requirements, etc, a little more, i.e does it contain a router, modem, switch ... etc) in this very small package.
At the end of the day, what I need is to have more than one computer on the internet at the same time from the one (single) source that I have.
Could you help, please? I have tried (seemingly) everywhere and I get no answers. Like many people, I live in an apartment building, which provides wireless access for which each computer (not apartment or user) has to pay (monthly) to access the Internet. I use a (wireless) Belkin USB Adapter, to access the service. There is no set-up procedure or any special actions required - you just login to the network using the login details provided every month. I use Windows 7, but in my time here, I have used XP Pro, Vista and even Linux (Ubuntu).
