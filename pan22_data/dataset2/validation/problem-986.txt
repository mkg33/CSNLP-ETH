For example, on a Cisco switching infrastructure you should be able to use DHCP snooping to prevent this happening in future. Other switch brands may have similar features.
You can track down the user using the techniques others have mentioned, but even better would be if you can prevent this from ever happening again.
If none of these work then you will need to do a search by physically diconnecting one wire at a time from the switches until the problem goes away.
One way is to get your laptop and do some "war driving" in the dorms.  In other words, roam around looking for strong wireless network signals coming from the rogue router. This will get you close to it, as you look at the varying strengths.
If your switches are not managed its well worth upgrading, but if that's not an option just ping the IP from the earlier step:
The procedures above will help you find the IP address they are using.  The traffic lights on the routers may also help for a visual indication. If you don't have a handle on where all the wires go it may be difficult to trace.  If you can pin down the port or ports that have th routers, consider disconnecting them at the switch.
Most likely someone brought their router from home and connected the wrong port to your switches.  Most home routers provide DHCP and will happily give out addresses in the wrong range.  From what I have seen this is fairly common in dorm situations.
I'm guessing that someone in a dorm room has connected a SOHO router instead of their computer, probably so that they can have wireless access.  What you can do is a series of steps to isolate the problem.
Try posting a notice that anyone with their own router should connect only the WAN port to your network.
By the way, if the administration and IT are doing a decent job then the students have signed some kind of agreement that prohibits them from doing this.  SO you can bring in the Dean of Students (of whatever he is called on your campus).
