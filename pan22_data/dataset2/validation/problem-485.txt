Needless to say, this response has been greeted with derision by various others in that thread. Now maybe Nick's comment to the question basically highlights Microsoft's rationale, but tbh it's a pain in the neck for those admins that do know what they're doing...
Zow-- It looks like they've changed the behaviour from Windows XP! You used to be able to select multiple files and see a security tab, or select multiple folders and see a security tab. Selecting both, in XP, resulted in no security tab being displayed. I'm seeing a behaviour where I can't get a security tab with any combination of multiple files, folders, or both seleted on a Windows 7 machine. Ouch! What a misfeature.
A workaround (also described in the thread) is to access the server from a 2k3 or XP client, then permissions can still be modified directly through the GUI.
Apparently it was purposely removed, according to this thread in the Server forums: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/winserverfiles/thread/dbfa011b-7c27-4e1d-b1a4-f0f8839b2d46

On Windows Server 2008, is there an easy way to modify security permissions for multiple files at once (as with Windows Server 2003)? Right-click menu -> properties does not provide a "Security" tab if more than one file/directory is selected (i.e. ctrl-click multiple files).
re: the "valid security reason" - Setting file permissions to what you need is a "valid" use of an operating system feature. A server OS w/o configurable file system permissions would be a pretty crappy server OS. (grin)
