In a single player, or even a multi-player with under 12 players, the designers can control how much content needs to have drawcalls made on them at any given time.  Additionally they can control fully how many textures any scene, or area if you will, has.  Since they can fully control these assets they are able to turn the model detail far up the spectrum with High poly model and richly detailed textures.
In an MMO, by contrast, a zone can be devoid of any other players other than yourself, or there could be hundreds, and each and every character is often wearing different texture and shader combinations.  MMO's, however, can look very nice if the creater get very clever and efficient with their use of well designed meshes that are applied to models.  And this can compensate a lot on the graphics difference between mmo's and stand alone games.  But in the end the graphics detail level of an MMO will never be the detail level of a stand alone game with equal system requirements.  Resource management just doesn't permit it, at least not if you want an MMO framerate above 5.
It is also the case that MMOs often have many things on the screen at once; this can differ based on the game, but some games allow many people to be standing in one area (for example if there is an important event or party). That is a lot of polygons; so each character must be low detailed in order to be able to draw them all on the screen at once. Similarly, even in the fighting areas there can be a generous number of NPCs/mobs on the screen at once. Level-of-detail algorithms can be used to tune the detail levels based on how much is on screen, but then you are introducing even more content that needs to be made (each thing would then need to be made several times -- or an algorithm can try to do it automatically).
Having done A LOT of research on MMO creation the single biggest issue on graphics is that a designer really has no way of knowing how much content will be present in an area at any given time.  
Take a game like Skyrim, single player game, lush graphics, high detail.  But if you pay close attention, there are seldom more than 5 or 6 moving "characters" at any given time on screen, and when there are more if you carefully look around you'll often notice that they've cut back a little on the amount of material present in the scene.  Additionally games like Skyrim know's exactly what every character will be wearing in each scene.
MMOs often have much more content than traditional games. If you think about it, your traditional one-player game has a mostly linear storyline, so the levels are very straightforward, linear, small and restricted. They can be scrutinized and made to a high level of detail. A MMO, however, has an entire world's worth of content, so a lot more art and content is required to match that same level of detail.
Your point is valid. But keep in mind that a MMORPG has more models, textures and animations than a normal game; making those assets in a very high resolution would need a lot of disk space, and they wouldn't be easy to stream to system/graphics RAM. So they are kept low-res to easily load a higher part of the world, and to make the development of the game shorter.
The problem in an MMO is you have little control over how many "assets" are going to be in a given area at any given time since players can wear what they want, where they want, when they want.
