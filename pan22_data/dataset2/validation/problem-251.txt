The middle water tile has a double transition in it's top right corner and bottom right corner. So since swamp goes over plains we first draw all the plains transitions. Then we draw the swamp transition. And thus the 2 corners will end up with 2 transitions drawn over the original water tile. It is up to you to set precedence and the art but this should give you good results. This solution does not offer different transitions for each other type but it is possible with a simple if statement, however your needed assets grow exponentially and that may not worth your while. But I can imagine a transition from swamp into water looks very different then into plains. This is essentially what you are showing in the comments, the mountains blend in very well with the grass but they won't blend in with the water that well. The reason you don't see the grass blend with the water is because the mountain overlaps it. Personally I think it looks fine but I see a lot of room for improvement, the tiles used are not much better then your average programmers art (Sorry to offend the artist, but I'm sure he agree's if he practiced more since then :) ).
Jungle over forest -> forest over rocks -> rocks over hill -> hill over swamp -> swamp over desert -> desert over grass -> grass over water.
I know this is old but this has not been mentioned. Your assumption of the transition tile is wrong. Your transition tile gets 8 transitions instead of your 4. On top of that it can have multiple overlapping layers in order of precedence. In the article they mention they have the following precedence.
Ultimately, though, I think this is very much about visual design. There's an art involved in getting a limited range of tiles to look correct, and I suspect that shading is extremely important—a boundary with no appearance of depth will be more jarring than one that's carefully designed.
The "base" for any given tile type would be a single solid tile, and then you'd have the 16 or 32 transition tiles, like Artifact. But you could also add a customized transition tile set (another 16 or 32 tiles) between a specific pair of tiles that need additional help. The transition tiles could either be done alpha tested/blended, like the generic transitions, or they could completely replace the lower-precedence tile. This still isn't perfect—say you have a custom water-grass and water-hill transition, but what happens to water that has grass on one side and water on the other?—but it does at least allow you to prioritize.
Since you're presumably in a situation where you don't need an extremely low-budget solution for technical reasons, and you are also presumably not interested in creating the 200+ unique different tiles that you would need to handle every possible case, you may want to consider a solution that allows you to use alpha testing or blending to handle most cases (like Artifact's solution), but override specific transitions that look poor.
Of course this comes with it's limitations but not in the scope you are asking for. I'll take your example layout but cut off the eastern tiles so we end up with 9, we don't need more since there won't be overlaps with tiles not being direct neighbors.
