If it's none of the pedestrian/common options, it could be you have the drive listed as 'shared' on a network and have accessed it via another computer. In my case, even though the remote computer was off, it still had a lock on the directories. Unshare and it should work if that's the case.
For me changing the drive letter did it. I could not kill the accessing process cause it was PID 4 (system itself), which opened H:\$EXTEND..... (did see it in Process Explorer).
This will show you all the open files on your removable volume, the processes that own the file handle and the PIDs of the processes.  Double click to highlight the process in the main window (top) and file (bottom).  From there you can right-click the process to kill it or right-click the file to close the file handle.
Often this will be because the drive is being indexed; right click the drive>properties, and uncheck index. Or the AV is monitoring the drive - turn off AV to test this.
The 2 most reliable ways are ones that nobody has suggested yet because they are sometimes the most inconvenient:
