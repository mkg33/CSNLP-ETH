Personally, if I'm looking for a utility or small application for my machine, I will check that it works with 64-bit operating system, but whether the application is 32-bit or 64-bit is not normally high on my priority list.
According to Process Explorer, I currently have 25 64-bit processes and 28 32-bit processes running, ignoring Chrome)
I recently upgraded to 64-bit OS(Windows 7) from my old 32-bit version. I noticed that while several applications are available in 64-bit(e.g. DC client, Tortoise SVN, Graphics driver), many are still 32-bit applications (e.g. firefox, adobe reader).
Some 32-bit 'applications' will not work in 64-bit mode, for example graphics drivers and shell extensions (such as Tortoise SVN). In such a case you need a 64-bit version.
Even ignoring memory considerations, you can not say for certain that a 32-bit application running in 64-bit mode will be faster or slower than the 64-bit equivalent, nor whether the application will be faster or slower than when running on a 32-bit operating system.
So, unless you really desperately need 64 bit for the application in question, you can often be safer sticking with the 32 bit version.
If you happen to have, for example, 16GB of memory and are running SQL server with an extremely large database, then having 64-bit version of SQL is very important.
So, how important is it to have 64-bit applications (performance wise)? I use my laptop for many different things like gaming, coding etc.
If, however, you have 4Gb of memory (with almost 1gb 'stolen' by the video card), then you may be running low of memory and using 64-bit applications (which may require more memory) may actually slow your system down.
It depends entirely on the application.  Most applications are operate exactly the same in 32 bit form as in 64 bit form.  For the applications where it does matter, you'll almost certainly be aware that the 32 bit versions are limited and wouldn't need to ask the question.
One area to be careful of is when an application has a 64 bit version that has poor 3rd party support.  I'm thinking of Excel 2010 which is available in 64 bit form.  Excel 64 itself works perfectly well, but few 3rd party extensions and add-ons have been ported yet.  As another example, consider Python on Windows.  Again, a number of important non-core modules are not available or hard to obtain in 64 bit form.
