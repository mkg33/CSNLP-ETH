just unplug the mouse from your pc and reconnect it. I do this whenever I face this issue(I have guest additions installed but still has the problem). 
Well for me, the problem was solved by selecting my external mouse under USB in the devices menu. Maybe it installed the driver or something. (Sorry if I sound like a noob, but these are my 1st 30 mins into virtualbox.)
I am using latest version of VirtualBox (VirtualBox 4.3.6 for Windows hosts) and after installing any OS and clicking inside of it mouse disappear. It is not visible until I press right CRTL. Anyone know what can cause this problem. I have also installed extension pack. 
One stupid thing no one mentioned, the actual key combo to release your cursor is SHIFT+right ctrl, not right-ctrl. It doesn't say that anywhere in the interface, docs or website. I'm not sure this is your problem, but others might run into this.
It's not a problem in Virtualbox. RCTRL is set the default button for mouse capturing inside virtualbox. So you would only be able to use the mouse inside VB after enabling mouse capture. If you don't enable mouse capturing you can use your mouse but it will be invisible as the mouse is being used by the Current windows. You can change the RCTRL button by going into File -> preferences and then you can enable mouse capture with other button. Also check when you enable Mouse Capture the mouse will disappear from current windows and show in host windows.
