I think one issue is that we need to fix the "scale" of the problem. For example, the paper I refer to below defines NPO so that the objective function takes only positive integer values. With that definition, 1. is easy: fix say $\varepsilon = 1$, and then you get a $\max\{N_\varepsilon, 2\}$ approximation by definition.
With this definition of NPO, 2. also holds. In particular, no APX-Complete problem has an asymptotic PTAS unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. See the remark on the bottom of page 1761 of this paper, and also the proof of Theorem 4.10. On a high level, the proof shows that if a problem has an asymptotic PTAS, then it can be approximated to any degree with a constant number of queries to an NP oracle (Proposition 4.6). On the other hand, any problem $P$ which can be computed with $k$ queries to an NP oracle can be reduced to approximating an instance of an APX-Complete problem $A$ within factor $r$, where $r$ is a constant depending on $k$ (Prop. 4.8). So, if you have an APX-Complete problem which has an asymptotic PTAS, then there is some constant $h$ so that the query hierarchy collapses to level $h$, i.e. any problem solvable with $k$ queries to NP, for any integer $k > 0$, can be solved with $h$ queries to NP, where $h$ is a fixed constant which does not depend on $k$. This implies that the polynomial hierarchy collapses as well (Thm 4.2).
