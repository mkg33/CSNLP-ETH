I think the only way to avoid this is by having a default printer that is not remote.  Here is a simple JScript that will set your default printer to "Microsoft XPS Document Writer" (assuming you have it installed) which is always a local, non-hardware printer.
There isn't an obvious (to me at least) rational reason for an application to interact with a printer when changing a font style, but if that is what is happening then at least a local printer won't be across an unconnected network.
I've seen the exact behavior you describe when switching fonts, and I think it's because some printers have allowable fonts, and Word is checking to see if they'll actually render on the printer (though why this is necessary until you actually print is beyond me).
One option would be something like this to automatically switch your printer based on IP address. It presumably could switch to none when you're at home.
This will list all installed printer names in the Immediate window of the Visual Basic Editor (CTRL+G for the Immediate window if you're not very familiar with VBA)
You could add a procedure to the ThisWorkbook/ThisDocument module of your personal.xls/normal.dot that would detect if you were at home and set the printer default appropriately.
I've not tested this, but USERDOMAIN (index 30) should be suitable for this purpose.  The following code should give you a rough idea of what is required to do this.
Note that the ports will likely be different on your PC, you can run the following code to check what VBA thinks your printers are called.
