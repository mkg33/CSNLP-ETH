There's only a couple of "gains" that I can think of off the top of my head. First off, security. If for some reason a login had to have elevated permissions on the instance but there are sensitive databases then that could potentially be a reason to have multiple instances on the same box. 
What will I gain and what will I lose?  Tagged sql-server-2012 because it's the most pertinent, although generally the question is across SQL Server versions.
As for losses, you are having multiple instances having to share the same resources. Sure you can easily isolate, but you're still taking away max specs if it was instead one instance. 
For a use-case of 9 databases spread across 3 time zones, is it advantagous to spread the databases onto multiple SQL Server instances on the same server?
So let's say you have a OLAP and OLTP environment but somehow on the same server, let's say in cases of multi-node failover.  Now you are supporting both nodes on 1 server, by setting affinity masks and total amount of RAM per instance,  you ensure that customers can still process data (and make $$$) while reporting takes a back seat.
I have been advised by MS to install multiple instances of SQL server to work around spinlock problems due to Always On. It has not helped with push locks in Clustering Services though, as they sit below SQL Server instances.
Another one would be the requirement for different SQL Server versions to support different applications, if you didn't have other available servers.
