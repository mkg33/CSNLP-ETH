This will allow you to make queries from serverb to servera using the credentials of logina and vice versa.  From there you just need to grant the rights to the user on server1 and serverb.
The downside of this approach is that anyone with access to serverb will be able to change the data on servera that logina has access to and the other way around, but the configuration should be simpler than using component services.  If you limit the grants to just read this will not be an issue.
I think the easiest way to handle this would be to set up 2 SQL logins (logina and loginb) on each server (servera and serverb) and create a linked server on each to the other.  On servera you change the properties of the linked server (serverb) and go to the security tab.  Change the radio button to "be made using the login's security context" and then put the un/pw for "loginb" in the "remote login" and "with password" options.
