I bought a new hp laptop from e-commerce site "Snapdeal". Model is "HP 15 ba025au". It has AMD Raedon R4 integrated graphics. Since it had free DOS pre installed, I immediately installed Windows 10 pro 64 bit. I had already downloaded drivers from HP site. So after W10 installation, I installed some drivers such as AMD HD graphics, Realtech sound, Realtech wireless LAN. Everything was going fine then I tried to lower the screen brightness, I tried from hotkeys i.e. f7. But nothing happened, the screen brightness didn't go down. I tried from power control option. It shows the value like 25%, 50%.. but brightness remains constant. I googled the issue 'n find one solution that is to update the driver under "display adapter" under "device manager". But when I went to "display adapter", I found  my amd graphics driver is not listed there. I can only find "Microsoft basic display adapter". Then I realized my graphics driver was not working. I reinstalled it but the problem persisted. Then i read somewhere graphics driver doesn't work if graphics card is not there. But my notebook has the aforesaid graphics card. Then why it is not listed in device manager? How can I fix this issue so that my brightness control works properly. Please help me. Thanks in advance.
If there are further issues with the display after changing the driver, then it may be possible that your graphics card has an issue, which is why the driver may have defaulted to the Microsoft one.
