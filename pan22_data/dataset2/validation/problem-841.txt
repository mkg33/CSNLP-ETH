What are you testing the link to link endpoints for speed? I mean, are all your links you're testing between 1 Gbit? You can only get 1 Gbit between two or more machines with gigabit network cards. The router will never go above 100 Mb since you said that's what it at most supports (so your wireless connections will be stuck going through a straw connecting to a firehose anyway).
It is possible the linksys is interfering; it looks like we had an issue where someone had a small hub for testing some systems hooked up to a Cisco switch in our MDF room and it caused all sorts of problems where the switch was confused because of that hub having multiple systems coming off one port. Why? I don't know, I didn't handle the issue, just had the report after the fact, but I know it caused at least one room to have huge connection and performance issues between their lab and the NAS in another building. The best way to test that is disconnect the linksys from the switch and see what 2 or more wired workstations are getting for performance in transferring files and pinging each other after a reboot or two (and restart the switch) to flush cached tables and such.
You might also want to test your wiring to the switch to make sure the wires and connectors are secure and of high quality.
1. Go to hardware section (Control Panel => System => Hardware => Hardware manager OR right click on "My computer" => Properties => Hardware =>Hardware manager). May be another names - something similar
For Gigabit speeds the requirements are that both the switch and the network card or other switch port that it's connected to supports Gigabit, and that the cable be Cat5e or higher. For gigabit in a business I prefer pre-made and tested cables as a simple connection test with a cheap cable tester is not enough to verify that the cable has the signal integrity to support gigabit speeds.  However I have my house wired with Cat6 Gigabit and the end points are punched into Cat5e patch panel and wall ports and all cables are hand crimped to the computers.
If all of these things are true and you're not seeing the link negotiate to 1 Gigabit then you'll need to trouble shoot the issue to rule out a problem, in order of likely hood:  bad cable, bad NIC in computer, Bad or mis-configured port on the switch, general switch issue.  This last one would be pretty rare if the switch seems to be functional otherwise. 
If you have all of the requirements, you can troubleshoot the connections some with a sniffer like wireshark to see the initial negotiations when you plug in the cable. This is limited in use, and may not even work. The best troubleshooting method is an expensive network tester. Fluke makes some of the best ones of these, there are many others. You might want to contact a wiring vendor to help you troubleshoot this as it would be cheaper to pay for their labor than to purchase the tool. Just make sure they come with a quality tool.
Re: How do I see the auto-negotiated speed and how can I manually force a speed? That seems useful for testing:
If your workstations have gig cards and you can verify that they're working properly, you can try manually setting them to a gig connection full duplex, disabling the auto negotiation.
