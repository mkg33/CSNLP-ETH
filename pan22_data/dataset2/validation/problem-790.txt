As Fractalizer said, this is an issue with the setuid bit on sudo.  A detailed explanation of how to fix it can be found here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=219767
First, you copied to a NTFS partition, which has different permissions, so yo are likely to lose some information in the process, although I have never tried it.
Recently, due to some messy stuff with master boot record, I have to re-install my Ubuntu. Before doing that, I back up all folder (exclude root, bin, sbin, tmp, media, mnt) to a NTFS partition.
There's a pretty good chance there will be other issues beyond this program.  So you may find other things blowing up once you resolved the specific problem with sudo.  Unfortunately, cp'ing to an NFS share isn't going to retain all the permissions you'll need for a fully functioning system.  Especially in places like /usr/bin. 
sudo command must have setuid permission bit set on it's executable. But in Ubuntu you currently cannot become root. I think you can boot from emergency disk and set this bit on sudo using chmod.
The best option is to use tar (or equivalent) and I guess you mistyped the command with its options. A simple way to do a backup is something like
After installation of Ubuntu, I copied back all the folder using a nautilus (running by sudo nautilus). After that, I reboot my computer. And boom, now I cannot run sudo any more, my network services cannot run. When I run sudo from a terminal, I ge "must be setuid root" error. In ubuntu, root account is disabled by default, I don't know why all these files is no longer under ownership of my account.
