So I think the answer to the first question is that firmware is to software, as software. So BIOSes are also software, firmware or not.
Maybe a BIOS is to firmware as a square is to a rectangle, but the first question should be what is a firmware to software?
The "soft" in software came about in the early days when Computer programming was written via flexible material such as punch cards, floppy discs and reams of paper. The programs were in a soft, changeable state.
When a program got coded into a solid state hardware the program was in a "firm" or fixed state. Changing the program at this point required replacing physical piece of hardware.  
BIOSese were once firmware. The other answers offer more about the BIOS and shed light on why that would be, but I just wanted to highlight the firmware misnomer.
Firmware is held in non-volatile memory devices such as ROM, EPROM, or flash memory. Non-volatile memory chips were / are used to ensure the information stored persists even when power is removed. The information stored could be data containing settings used to operate / identify a device, or software that executes functions in the device hardware.
(FIRM softWARE) Software instructions residing in non-volatile memory chips that hold their content without power. Firmware is found on computer motherboards to hold hardware settings and booting data (BIOS) and on myriad consumer electronics devices to hold the operating system or control program.
BIOS is the main firmware required by PCs primarily to identify the components connected to the motherboard. An example of such a component is the primary internal hard drive.
I think firmware used to exist as something very specific. Some chip, for example, that was programmed once, and stayed in that original configuration forever. Just being, unchanging, firmly.
Early PCs used ROM (read-only memory) chips for BIOS which could not be altered without replacing the ROM chip. ROM memory chips were later replaced by EPROMs (erasable programmable ROMs), and currently BIOS is stored in flash memory chips, both EPROMs and flash memory can be flashed and upgraded.
On devices with no hard drive, such as smartphones, MP3 players and tablets, flash memory chips also hold the applications and user data; however, in this case, they are called "memory" or "storage" and not firmware.
Firmware is a code that makes a hardware inteface working and responding to system software and is placed below that interface but BIOS is code that configures and operates the hardware that is below itself and responds to higher system software. 
Firmware in non-PC devices may be upgradeable depending on the complexity of the device and decisions made by the manufacturer. More and more pieces of hardware have upgradeable firmware these days than in the distant past.
But what's like that these days? Are BIOSes still deployed on ROM chips? Do the things we think of as firmware have firmware-like qualities which distinguish them from software? Do firmware updates require professional servicing?
