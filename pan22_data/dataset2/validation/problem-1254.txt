Also, you declare an inner version of Test in the if statement: int16_t Test[960 / 2];.  But this version only exists in the body of the if.  Once you leave the if, the original Test[960] is active again.
What's your convention for variable names?  Some of them are capitalized, some aren't.  I don't care what convention you use (some folks would care, a lot), but you should be consistent.
Maybe this code should be split into 3 different functions, one for MixMono, one for left, and one for "other".
Is there a relationship between bufferSize and the size of Test (which is 960 or 960/2)?  Why are you looping over elements of micBuffer, instead of looping over elements of Test?  Have you tried writing it with the if-else if-else  on the outside, with a (different) loop inside each block?
You set the booleans to true, then test them in the if.  The if condition will always be true, so what's the point?
Where's the declaration of micBuffer?  If s is supposed to be a 16-bit integer, why isn't it int16_t?  (The parentheses around the RHS expression seem useless.)
Does this code actually work?  I haven't figured out what it's supposed to do yet, so I can't be sure.
