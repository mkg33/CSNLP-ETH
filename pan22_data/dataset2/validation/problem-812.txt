ZFS is awesome tech, and I highly recommend it. But you're going to need to revisit your structure here in order to be able to correctly use it. Namely having ZFS create the logical volumes (vdevs) from the disks directly.
You should DIRECTLY attach all drives to a box running ZFS. Get a SAS HBA and connect the drives to the ZFS capable box (eg runing OmniOS or SmartOS). You can then share the space via NFS, SMB, iScsi ... 
The reason ZFS on top of HW RAID logical volumes is a VERY BAD idea, is because ZFS requires block-level access to actually properly function. Yes, it will be usable, but functionality will not be complete until you attach drives directly to the OS via an HBA or direct SATA connections. One example is that in the configuration you're proposing ZFS cannot reasonably protect your data against changes to the data below (on the other side of the HW RAID controller), and as such cannot guarantee the safety of your data. This is one of the PRIMARY reasons ZFS is used, in addition to it being super duper fast.
It sounds like there's a lot more reading you need to do on how ZFS operates before you can accurately understand what you've proposed it, contrast to what really should be done instead.
