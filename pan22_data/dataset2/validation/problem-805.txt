If you want to see "dangerous", that would be those options or programs that rewrite the partition tables!  Grub had (or maybe has) a command like that some years ago, and I wiped out a laptop the first time I tried it. (I did fix it, but it took a long time).
The key to your project will be (in grub, anyway) that there's a keyword default that you can use to designate which partition you want to boot from.  I think just moving that keyword around will change what you boot.  You might  also think about booting from a thumb drive as your "temporary" boot partition.
The happy news is that modifying the configuration (in grub, a text file) is a pretty safe operation. You can even save backup copies to fall back on.  And grub itself can be worked from a command line if you get into a sticky situation.
The nature of booting means that the only things available at boot time are the boot program and its configuration.  Therefore, if you are going to modify anything, it will have to be somewhere in the bootloader.
