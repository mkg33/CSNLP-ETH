Unable to open the physical file "c:\".  Operating system error 2: "2(The system cannot find the file specified.)".
Fortunately, we did have a backup.  It was located on a drive that had been disconnected after the server reinstall.  Network guy was verbally spanked on that one.
The point is: IF you are using FILESTREAM, you have to get the stream data in addition to all of the normal data files otherwise you can't reattach. 
Short answer: a database is screwed IF you are missing the filestream data.  I tried pretty much everything under the sun and you cannot attach a database that has a filestream dependency WITHOUT the original filestream.hdr file.  
You can get it to the point that it's in recovery mode, but that won't allow you to get to the tables.  All we cared about was structure.
Armed with the .hdr file and everything else in that directory we were able to attach the database back to the server with zero issues.
I have a sql 2008 database that had a filestream.  Unfortunately, all I have is the .mdf and .ldf files.  I no longer have access to the filestream .hdr file or anything that was in that directory.
