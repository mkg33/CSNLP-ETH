I have just successfully dealt with this very same issue with this particular motherboard. In my case this situation was caused by a faulty RAM stick. Î¥ou will need to determine which hardware part is causing the problem in your case but before we get there, let me first explain what's going on.
So, what you need to do as a first step is plug in a speaker (see last paragraph for tips), as Ash suggested. Then power on your computer again and wait for the beeps. Refer to your motherboard's manual to find out what the beep codes mean and identify the problem. I was unable to find them in my manual and the only relevant thing I found on AsRock's website was this page from their FAQ section. Supposing what is written there is true for this motherboard you could still hear no beeps which would indicate a faulty CPU (ouch) or RAM. After you find out what the problematic part is you should contact the shop you bought it from and invoke your warranty if possible.
Many computer cases provide a speaker for your motherboard in their front panel. If so there should be a cable along with the other cables coming from the front panel (LEDs, power, reset, USB ports, etc), which should be labeled as "SPEAKER" (don't confuse it with the "HD AUDIO" cable!). Moreover, if you have an old case or motherboard you can look for a speaker there, unplug it and then plug it in your current motherboard!
The reason you get no video output is because the POST (power-on self-test) fails, which usually means some hardware is faulty, and so it doesn't even load the BIOS/UEFI and gets stuck there. When POST fails you should normally expect to hear those beeps which represent some code to let you know which part is faulty. However the AsRock H97 Pro4 motherboard doesn't come with an integrated speaker and so it is unable to sound the beeps!
