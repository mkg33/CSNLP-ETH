Try mlxtend. Here's an example of multi-class case: http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/evaluate/confusion_matrix/#example-2-multi-class-classification
Look at sed_eval library. It is developed for evaluating event detection in audio which is a multi-label problem (as in each audio, multiple events exist). They have many evaluation options, which might fit to your needs. 
There are many different parameters which can evaluate the performance of your method by comparing the real and predicted labels. I suggest PyCM module which can give a vast variety these parameters which are suitable for multi-class classification.
You can get the true-positive rate, ... and from there computing the confusion matrix is not that hard.
Also take a look at scikit-multilearn. It is a very good library that extends sklearn for multi-label learning. However, I'm not sure how the confusion matrix works for multi-label problems...
Scikit-learn does support multi-label confusion matrix. See the links below for documentation and user guide:
