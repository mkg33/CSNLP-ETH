If your mail is stored on Exchange, which is often the case in a corporate environment, you will be limited by how much space you have on your mailbox, and any restrictions put on the server by it's administrators. In this scenario it would be best to contact them and ask them if they have any limitations.

If it's local to your machine, in a PST file, then the only limitation is the amount of disk space you have to store data. The number of folders are not restricted.
Be careful however, a lot of folders can become hard to manage, and can become an issue when using a mobile device or web browser to access your account if it is on a corporate network.
For outlook 2007 and later Microsoft states that there is a limit of 500 folders in cached mode or when using a pst file or shared mailbox.
The problem comes in "searching"   Outlook is currently hard code limited to 64 subfolders for indexing/searching after that weird stuff starts happening.
