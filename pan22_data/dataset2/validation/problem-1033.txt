Now in the t_Transaction table I have a Credit Account and Debit Account with 1 Amount field. My question is what is the best approach for managing the amount part?
I'm developing a simple double entry accounting system for managing the payments, charges, cars expenses, etc. for car rental companies. I'm done (Development and Database wise) with the Main operation system for managing cars, customers, contracts and so on and now I'm stuck in the accounting part.I have come up with the below DB design for managing the accounting part but I'm still not 100% sure if I can use it and consider it as a go.
2- Or should I have 2 separate fields (a. Debit Amount) and (b. Credit Amount) and then based on the transaction 1 field will have the actual amount while the other will have NULL value.
1- Is it better to be logged into 1 field in the database? but then how can I distinguish weather the amount is a debit or a credit while generating reports.
I'm still confused on how to develop the code for logging the transactions into the database as this is my first time development for an accounting application
