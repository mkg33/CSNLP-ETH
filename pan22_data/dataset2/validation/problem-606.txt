I downloaded eclipse and unzipped the file into a folder and also added some plugins, changed some settings.
As such, it doesn't matter as much if you use it on another computer, but more if you use it on another workspace.
This means it can work on any machine that doesn't have Java installed without having to run special command line or path settings. Just run eclipse.exe and it finds the Java runtime in jre for you and carries on happily.  Neato.
I just download the Eclipse zip file, extracted it to a directory on the desktop and do the following steps.
After that when Eclipse asks for a workspace I simply enter .\Workspace so that the workspace directory is created within the eclipse directory, and it seems that all the workspace details are kept under that directory in a "relative directory" fashion so it doesn't matter if the drive letter changes.  Plugins like Pydev keep their settings in the workspace folder (in a folder named ".metadata") so once you've set it up they'll get remembered between places too.
Eclipse does store all of its plugins and configuration in its own directory structure, so making it portable it surprisingly easy and intuitive.  I've used Eclipse in a portable fashion with no problems at all.  All I can recommend is a couple of extra steps to make your life just that bit easier and this is what I do:
Copy the Java runtime from a computer that has it installed into your Eclipse directory.  The folder with java in it should be named "jre" so you end up with the following:
If I copied this folder to a pendrive and opened it in another PC, will all my seetings and plugins work out of box?
It should. I have eclipse installation on a flash drive and it works fine. Sometimes I have to select which JDK I'm using though.
