When moving from Location A to Location B, the laptop wakes up from sleep, displaying the screen on the internal monitor. I switch to the external monitor display (using Fn+F8 on this laptop), and only after that do I unlock my session with my password. However, Windows has crammed all my nicely arranged windows into the upper left corner as if it were trying to fit them all on the laptop internal screen resolution.
Longer version: I have a laptop that I move between two locations. I have one docking station, and the same kind of monitor configured for 1600x1200, in both locations. The internal laptop screen is awful so I don't use it.
When moving from Location B to Location A, I have the laptop lid closed when using the docking station so Windows apparently concludes the screen resolution is 1600x1200 and doesn't resize any windows.
Short version: When moving my laptop and sleeping between using different monitors, all my open windows are crammed into the upper left corner as if they tried to fit on the laptop internal screen resolution. I plug in and switch to the external monitor before unlocking my session. Is there a way to prevent this automatic resizing?
