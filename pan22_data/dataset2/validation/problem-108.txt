Which happens exactly how often? Remember - DNS answers are cached, possibly on multiple levels. I.e. I would bet most end users use their provider's DNS. You REALLY overthink the estimate of that 1ms (max) in the whole larger amount of work it takes to get to the host name and then make something with it.
Seriously, you totally overestimate the issue. If you use CloudFlare than this is good enough - especially if your content is behind CloudFlare.
No. You have no clue how many name servers. What you see as one server can be a cluster using the same IP address. You only have a minimal amount.
Let's be clear. Ever since the outage of a low cost low end provider of whatever you do not trust a technology that is proven. Why? You think everyone is as incompetent as GoDaddy? Never had a DNS issue in years.
Should I limit that amount? Main concern is adding a tiny bit of latency each time someone does a lookup on my domain name. Does the lookup download the list of 13 name servers?
I just created a domain name and next step is setting up name servers. I'm thinking of using Route 53, CloudFlare DNS, and another provider. This means I'd probably end up with about 13 name servers attached to my domain name. 
Overengineering showing a paranoia mostly built on not knowing technology AND Professional providers. Get rid of that.
