If you are set as to what the server will do and don't plan on changing it then you can run the Security Configuration Wizard (assuming sp1 already installed or higher).  This is a great tool (carefully used) to lock down the server to just the services needed (in addition to other security measures if necessary like IPSEC).
If you don't have a wireless network card on your server (and I bet you don't have one), that's a service you can safely disable.
Generally the defaults are optimized well enough as far as cpu and memory utilization goes, performance gains are reached by optimizing disk configuration depending on what the role of this server will be.

Windows Server 2003 is pretty much secured and tightened on its own; one thing that puzzles me a lot is the Wireless Auto Configuration Service, enabled and starting automatically... wireless servers are quite unusual, I think.
