Currently I keep audio recordings on a PC, with a backup on an external HDD. I keep a subset of these on a couple of USB audio player and some more in a mirrored directory between all the PCs I use. Video material is either on a PVR or on DVDs. I do use Magnatune, but just for downloads, no subscription.
This is, in my opinion, a massive problem and one that the companies selling digital media will need to address at some point.
How are we going to be able to have a fully digital media collection? How can this work when a typical HD 45 minute TV show is at least a gig in size? 
I use Windows Home Server.  It can be expanded to have any number of hard drives, can be backed up without much fuss, and can stream the media to any DLNA device in the house.
But this is not practical really. It doesn't connect to a network in order to steam the media to many devices and space will eventually become a problem again which would require more external hard drives and it all becomes a mess! 
Option 4 combined with option 2 and all DRM-free media probably gives the most versatility. Option 2 would be my second choice, but that probably requires DRM-free and a licence that allows backup copies (e.g. in the long term there is little point having backup copies of the downloaded media if they can only be played on one particular hardware player).
I would quite like to be able to subscribe to programs, ala iTunes Season Pass, and download high definition copies. All my music is digital now and I tend to prefer a digital format for my videos as well. I currently have a 1tb hard drive onto which I burn my DVDs so that on one device I have my entire collection.
I see two solutions: Home media servers or, when connections are fast enough, our media stored in the cloud. Maybe one subscription opens up a world on demand media.
