Solution two: Don't do it on autopilot at all. Make a mini-game where the player has to use thrusters to approach the planet, and if they hit it at too high a relative speed, they blow up, but they have limited fuel as well. Make the player learn how to solve the intercept problem!
I am creating a 2d space game and need to make the spaceship intercept a planet. I have working code for straight line intercepts but cannot figure out how to calculate the planets location in a circular orbit.
I would fix the location at which to intercept (graze the circle, at the "outgoing" side of the orbit.)
Solution one: Deny the premise of the question. The quantity that is "slippable" in the question is the angle. Instead, fix that. Point the ship straight at the center of the orbit.  
Now you just have to adjust the spaceship's speed so that planet and ship reach that point at the same time.
Note that the rendez-vous could be after N more orbits, depending how far away the ship is, and how fast the planet is orbiting the star.
The game is not scientifically accurate so I am not worried about inertia, gravity, elliptical orbits, etc.
The question is: given that the ship moves in a straight line at a given velocity, and the planet moves in a circle of given radius at a given angular velocity, and the starting positions of the planet and ship, determine what direction vector the ship's straight line should be in to plot an intercept course.
