Try selecting them by dragin the pointer around them, just like you select text and then press CTRL+C.. Go to Word, and Paste.. Should work.
Right click and Copy might not work in all cases as described by John that they maybe behind some web-based authentication.
Bring the web image and/or text in the web page to the center of the screen.  Press PrtSc.  Open Paint in Accessories and paste with Ctrl+v.  Select the required area and copy by either Ctrl+c or by right clicking.  Then go to your word document page and paste with Ctrl+v.  Your job's done.  That's it!!
From time to time I want to copy and paste a portion of a web document (viewed in both IE Explorer 7 and 8) into MS Word 2007.  The selected text copies and pastes fine, but I am left with only place holders for the images (png).  Right clicking the image and clicking copy, then pasting into MS Word doesn't work either.  If I paste the image into MS Paint and copy it from there, I can paste it into the Word document.  What gives?
The ability to copy text and pictures into Word from a web page depends on the browsers layout engine.  Today there only seems to be a choice between Trident, Webkit and Gecko and only Trident will enable you to do this.  I found that an earlier version of Word enabled pictures to be copied at the same time as text.  I think it was Word 2002.  Otherwise only the placeholders for pictures are copied and each picture has to be copied and pasted into it's respective placeholder. I found that other word processors like Open Office scramble the formatting of the original web page during the pasting operation.
Another factor is the view you're using in Word.  Some views, like Draft, don't show images normally.  Try switching to Print Layout view.
There are some options in Word 2007 that you should check.  For instance: Advanced > Show Document Content > Show Picture Placeholders.
