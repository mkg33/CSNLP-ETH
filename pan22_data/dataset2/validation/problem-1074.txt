After successfully moving to a new hoster, I'm having a weird issue on just my computer (Windows 10). After propagation was complete and I removed the temporary entries in my hosts file, it looked fine for about a minute (apparently some sort of local cache), and then it wasn't. Checking nslookup, I saw this strange scenario:
mail. and www. were correct, and they even claimed to simply be aliases of the base domain, but a query on the base domain itself pointed to the old server. What???
Then, after a couple hours I noticed that the previously behaving mail. and www. versions had also reverted to the old IP! Then a little later they got well again. Then after an hour or so away from my computer I checked again, and www. is correct, but mail. (and of course the naked domain) were wrong. A few minutes after that, they swapped (mail. was correct but www. was wrong). I'm going mad!
The naked domain doesn't come and go, but is consistently wrong. Re-adding the hosts entry 192.145.233.49 proverbs2525.org fixes it, but when I remove the hosts entry again the naked domain goes back to 192.232.219.88, possibly taking the subdomains with it. It's as if I have some secondary, hidden hosts file (shall I call it a "ghosts file"?) that still has 192.232.219.88 in it and wants to assert itself when I'm not looking. I moved two other domains at the same time, and they are working fine. It's definitely not a propagation problem - I set all the TTLs to 10 minutes the previous day, and it has been about 8 hours since I changed the nameserver entries. My husband's computer on the same LAN, my phone, geopeeker, etc. all see everything pointing to 192.145.233.49 as they should. Can someone help me find the ghost?
