on windows now, though, so i can use it for gaming when i'm not developing.  but i can say for cuda development opensuse worked great.
Looking at the CUDA website I would try getting hold of one of those distros - including the version specified. Of course, when you want to install a newer version of something you get into a whole new world of pain...
I tend to think that the best distro for this sort of thing is that which the developers of the thing use: any instructions and downloads are far more likely to work on the distro they were written for than on any other.
I would use Arch Linux since it comes with the very latest stuff and you can install CUDA-SDK/everything you need from AUR directly. (Also NVidia driver is directly avaliable in the repository.) But yeah you can use anything if you build up there the environment.  
i used OpenSuse and it worked pretty smoothly and was easy to set up.  extra benefit is OpenSuse is a pretty nice desktop environment w/nice package management tools that doesn't suffer from limited functionality such as ubuntu's over-stripped down-ness (and brown? really?).
