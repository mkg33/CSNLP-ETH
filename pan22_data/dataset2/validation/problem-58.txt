Call me naive if you like, but if you don't mind me asking - why are you doing this? Is it really that much of a problem to move new user/computer objects manually to their desired OU? It's only a one off process when a new person starts or a new computer is joined to the domain.
The one problem you'll run into is older software that assumes the presence of 'cn=computers' in your tree as the default location for stuff. This is happily becoming increasingly rare.
We've done it. We made the Computers context an OU instead of a CN, which allowed us to hang GPOs on it. Soon we will be moving it again and calling it 'unclaimed'. Our techs are supposed to pre-create objects before importing, but they don't always do it. Putting the not-pre-created computers into an OU named 'unclaimed' makes it pretty clear who is responsible for what computers... no one. 
Has anyone done this in the past and experienced any gotchas that we should be aware of? Much obliged for the advice, tips and/or forewarnings.
