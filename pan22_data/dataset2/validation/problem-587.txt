If you wanted to retain the ability to connect from anywhere without maintaining a geo-location blacklist/whitelist, you could implement port-knocking. It would stop most automated attempts while allowing you to still connect from any address.
Note: Don't put the port to knock adjacent to the port to open, otherwise a sequential port scan will activate your rule.
On the off-chance that you have a BGP-enabled router or two in your stack AND have some kind of idea what the hell it is you're doing/work with someone who knows what the hell it is they are doing, or are maybe behind a DDoS prevention provider cool enough to assist in the implementation of this, there's a relatively fresh method for restricting traffic to geographical regions called selective blackholing which I think is worth a look.
Like most servers (I assume), we have people trying to brute force our services 24/7. I have cpHulk blacklist their IP's, but it seems like it'd be better if they didn't get that far in the first place. Myself and my host are the only ones who connect to the server on ports other than 80, so I'd like to block connections from all countries outside the US, except for port 80. I contacted my host to set this up, but they were hesitant because they said it would create an exceptionally high server load. It's a dedicated Xeon 1230 server with 32GB RAM running CentOS 6.6 and iptables.
First, any reason not to do this? Second, is what my host told me correct? Third, is there any way to accomplish this without a high performance impact?
