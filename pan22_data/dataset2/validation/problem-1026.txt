In the long run, a better option would be for you to switch to modern, shader-based OpenGL and use Vertex Buffer Objects instead. Performance will be much better and the restrictions of Display Lists no longer apply.
You are using OpenGL Display Lists, which is a deprecated feature. One of the reasons they were dropped from the standard is that once created, a list cannot be modified. In your current setup, you have only two choices: 1) recreate the whole list every time something is changed; 2) just use direct immediate-mode drawing.
I am currently working on a game and I want to know if there is any way of handling with the elements i am drawing . For example : if i draw in a loop 100 cubes , how can i show / hide the cube number 15 or 63 or n ... clicking  I thought that initializing elements in a list would work , but i didn't find any property of it that could help.
I googled a while for deleting elements after displaying them , like in minecraft , but i couldn't find anything useful(e.g: When mouse - right click -> then create cube , and when mouse - left click  -> then delete the cube.. ) Some sugestions would be all i need ..  ...Thank you.
