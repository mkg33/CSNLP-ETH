If you have it check for updates prior to scanning, and scan at least once a day, that's a sort of automation. Otherwise I think you would have to run a script of some sort to scan the names of available optional updates and install anything with Security Essentials in the name. Microsoft doesn't make a method available to do that.
No you can not set the MSE updtaes as required or permanent. Setting the MSE updates as required or important could make it seem that MSE is a required installation for Windows. This would then lead to some legal issues. See this article from Computer World
Is there a way I can selectively make some optional Windows updates permanent? In particular I'm looking to make the definition updates for Microsoft Security Essentials permanent.
To set a scheduled scan open up MSE and click on the settings tab. Check the box "Run a scheduled scan" and set the day, time, and type of scan. Then make sure the box for "Check for the latest virus & spyware definitions before running a scheduled scan" is checked. 
to check for Microsoft Security Essentials Signature Updates on daily, weekly, or monthly basis, without requiring the scheduling of a scan.
