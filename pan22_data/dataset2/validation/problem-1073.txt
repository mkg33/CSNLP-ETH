You could use your /root/install.log and /var/log/yum.log to get a list of installed RPMs, or, if you have a similar system you could get the RPM list from there. 
I've never tried to, but you can try to set up a new empty RPM database (copy from fresh install?) and reinstall all currently installed packages in the current installed versions. You may have a look into your rpm (or maybe yum, if you're using it) logs to determine currently installed packages.
Sometime ago I managed to erase the /var/lib/rpm folder which basically contains information about all the rpms in the System
You said you already did this first step, but for future reference (and for anyone else that runs into this)
That said, if this system can suffer downtime, I'd suggest re-installing as the best way. Otherwise, see the comment above.
Its my pure curiosity to know of a method by which we can restore the database of the installed rpm's
If you've kept a backup, then you might be able to restore it. Otherwise, you've wiped the only copy of the RPM database. (The rpm --rebuilddb command rebuilds some files in that directory from others.) Your system is basically hosed.
It's not really a big deal, your system isn't hosed.  Just run the above command(s) and you should be back in business.
