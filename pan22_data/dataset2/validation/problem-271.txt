and i'd be tempted to present them with an invoice for "loss of privacy" as if it's a product or service they are purchasing from me.  purely symbolic, of course, there's no way anyone would pay it.
I'm a Domain Admin, and I have not been subjected to a background check of any kind.  I also work in the government sector.  From what I understand most universities are not doing background checks of their admins.
The company I presently work for did a background check on me when they hired me. Standard practice for all new hires.
and, as mrdenny suggested, there's a difference between a check at time of employment (where you know up-front that that is a requirement of the job) and a check later where it is an additional condition added afterwards.
I would say in this day and age and due to the power that a domain admin has, it's not an unreasonable request.
i would resign if my employer insulted me like that, but then i don't work for the military, the police, banks, or anywhere else where a security check would be justifiable.
I think it's all completely warranted. There's a lot of bad people out there. If you're one of the good guys, you have nothing to worry about.
At a company I previously worked for, I had to undergo a more extensive background check for a federal security clearance because we did some work for government.
The only time I've ever had to go through a background check was at time of hire.  However I know that some companies to like to do them every once in a while just to be safe.  If it's in the terms of your employment (which I'm sure that it is) then the company feels that it's warranted and in their best interest.
