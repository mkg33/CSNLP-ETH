What I need is not even in the C:. it is in the partition next to C: that I tried to shrink. It has some 200 gigs of non backed up music. Is there any way I can get it back? Help!
Trying to access the drive I was trying to shrinkfrom ubuntu says I need to run CHKDSK /f on it from windows.But I can access the C: partition from ubuntu fine.
I got a windows 7 CD and made a bootable usb flash drive with it. Booted from them. They boot, but when I enter system repair, it gets stuck at 'System Restore options' screen where it detects the partition with the faulty windows but I can't click next or anything.
I tried to shrink a partition(not C: drive) from ubuntu using gparted so that I can allocate more space to C:. After the shrinking, Windows 7 won't boot. The grub screen shows up(dual boot win7 and ubuntu) and when I select windows it hangs at 'starting windows' screen. The other options don't work as well.. safe mode/repair etc.
I connect this hard disk to another working windows computer, boot from the hard drive that has the working windows, and it gets stuck at 'starting windows' screen. I remove the hard disk with the bad windows installation, it boots fine. But with the bad windows hard drive it just doesn't boot. And it is not a device selection issue as the grub screen doesn't show up and it goes straight to starting windows screen. So the working windows is trying to boot. But it fails.
