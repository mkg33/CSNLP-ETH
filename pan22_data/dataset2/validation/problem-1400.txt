My deceision is simple, and stupid :) I've got a Master workstation, and all files from "~" are just copied to the second "Slave" one. The moment i realize I need to modify something - i do it on Master, and Slave catches these changes on sync.
Ubuntu One might be what you're looking for. Unfortunately it's still in beta phase, and I have no experience with it, so I'm not sure if it'd work for you.
This will use rsync to only copy the needed changes, not re-copy everything every time the command is ran.
I think you can achieve what you want better by NFS mounting a common home folder.  Check out this article http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4880
You could use a sync script like osync which can propagate deleted files and update only modified ones.
If you also want to sync configs - tools mentioned above are totally helpless: configs are often changed, and many logfiles will make conflicts so they can't be merged.
osync is rsync based but can handle a lot of sync scenarios between local folders or remote ones over ssh.
