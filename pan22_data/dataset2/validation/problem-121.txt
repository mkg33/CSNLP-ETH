I figure out this myself accidentally and hope it help others. The problem arise from the ROM itself. So no matter what you do to connect the phone it will disconnect itself and making impossible for you to flash. 
Need help with this issue. After installing this driver and ready to flash phone the connection of usb keep disconnecting thus preventing me from flashing. I'm using latest windows 10 anniversary update. Help please!
I search everywhere including forum and all for days but no avail. Lots of suggestion but no solution. So its really easy solution now I'm enjoying my Lenovo S920 with original firmware just like newly bought android. Remember this is not a complete guide and only as reference.
What you need to do is simple but dangerous. Instead of check "Download Only" option in SP Flash Tools Check "Download Only + Flash". What you doing here is you brick the phone in order to flash it. Sound crazy right! But this option will wipe out all error in rom so you will be able to flash it later.
Now the phone is brick :(, when you put the battery back the phone wont even start to boot. Just blank screen. You also cannot charge the phone. Remove the battery and try connect it again this time check "Download Only" in SP Flash Tools. This will install back fresh ROM and also flash the phone. Wait the flashing phone. Disconnect and voil√†! 
Congratulations!!! You just flash your phone :). Pat at your own back cause this is also a method to revive the dead/brick android phone.
