Some applications would no longer run. If the swap was hosted on the removed disk, some applications would crash, and possibly the whole system would, too.
This of course refers to data at rest. Any data that was being written to the internal disk when the system crashes is almost surely at least partially lost... but I don't believe you expected anything different.
In all likelihood, yes. There are conditions and setups that could result in otherwise, but they're unlikely to apply.
If it was mounted, yes. At the very least the "Disk Dirty" flag would not be cleared by a clean unmount, so at the next boot Windows would require a disk check, too.
If by "affect" you mean data loss or hardware damage, both are conceptually possible, in the same sense that you could die of a meteor strike as soon as the disk is unplugged. All three possibilities are equally remote.
It also assumes that you're using the latest version of the ntfs-3g Linux module, or an equally mature and stable software that understands NTFS, MFT management, journaling and staggered R/W, and properly implements data safety procedures. Otherwise, a kernel crash can do literally anything to any disk physically connected, including replacing an unmounted disk's partition table with pictures of lolcats. Unless you hacked the kernel or whipped up a distribution yourself, chances are that while this uncomfortable situation is absolutely possible, yet you are not in it.
I expect that in both cases you will be able to access both, in both cases being required to check the filesystem integrity first.
