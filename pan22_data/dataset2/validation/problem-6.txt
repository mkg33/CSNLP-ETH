Your password hash is typically left when you logon or RDP.  So if you are using your admin account on your workstation, your password hash is there.  Similarly, when you RDP to a server (except for newer OS), your hash is left there.  This problem is mitigated in the Windows 10 OS codebase (Server 2016).  You should have an admin server, and not log on with domain elevated rights to your workstation. You don't want to be using email or browsing the web using elevated rights or from a workstation where you routinely elevate or log on with elevated permissions.  
You can also consider using LAPS to put a random system maintained password on your Windows workstations.  LAPS is free from Microsoft.  This prevents the problem of a single workstation compromise taking down all workstations, and if you connect with the local administrator password for the machine, any compromise would be limited.  The downside of using the local administrator password is auditing and that you may have to enable that via a GPO.
You can RDP to the admin server, and administer from there.  If you are using PowerShell to connect to the remote systems, you aren't leaving as hash.  If you are using a smartcard, you can flip the smartcardrequired bit twice to invalidate your current password hash.
