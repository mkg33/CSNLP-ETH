As you have access to a Windows system, download HP Library and Tape Tools. L&TT can run a wide variety of tests and report things which may be set up incorrectly.
Tell us about your actual hardware setup. Looking at a local HP Ultrium 960 drive, I'm getting write speeds of ~2,000 Megabytes/minute (33Mb/s) across a mixed data set (with hardware compression ON). This is with an HP ProLiant DL380 G6 server and an HP-branded LSI Ultra 320 SCSI HBA. 
3Mb/s is slow so there probably is a hardware problem as the other answers suggest. However, even when this is fixed, from a single server (depending on hardware and what you are running) you might have trouble writing to the tape fast enough to prevent shoeshining.
Shoe-shining refers to the tape drive stopping and rewinding due to an empty data buffer or inconsistent incoming data stream. This was a problem with older DLT drives. LTO drives shouldn't experience shoeshining. The LTO format/standard was partially designed to eliminate this behavior. HP drives, in particular, have a variable write speed to help reduce this effect. The Ultrium 960 should shift down to 27Mb/s as a minimum streaming speed.
One thing to try is using a cleaning tape and see if this helps. Otherwise, I am guessing that the write head is broken, creating many write errors that get detected by the verify-after-write functionality.
