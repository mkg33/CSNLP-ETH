Players are also quite happy to buy into subscription-based services - most MMO's use this format, and are quite successful because of it. This subscription is not generally tied to your ingame actions, and you pay regardless of if you play. But, again, this is a well-understood cost to the player. There is no surprise here, they understand what they're getting.
This is my own personal opinon on the subject, and some other people may dislike microtransactions for other reasons, but hopefully this will give you a first element of answer.
Players are all too happy to shell out $60 for a triple-A title that has decent reviews - because they understand the cost that it will incur to them. They feel like they can appropriately weigh the cost against the reviews (and their preferences) to decide if they want to invest their time in the game.
Most mammals act like this; our reward centers are focused on getting rewards more often, not necessarily in larger amounts. Similarly, we feel costs more strongly if we incur them more often. A pet cat who is fed multiple times per day is much happier than if the exact same amount of food was given to them all at once.
If you ask a player for a lump sum at the outset, or silently bill them every month, they forget about the money. But if you constantly harangue them to buy more skins or loot crates, they are viscerally aware that they are constantly spending money in the game. This is bad, because even if you only ask for a dollar or two at a time, doing so a dozen times feels like you're asking for more than if you just asked for $30 up-front. 
But microtransactions are more uncertain. Players don't know if they'll end up spending $3 or $30 over the course of a week or month of gameplay. There's no upper limit to the amount they might need to spend in order to play the game the way they want.
There's also the issue that you don't know beforehand what will be locked up behind microtransactions when you buy the game. Of course you can make your researchs, but there's a difference between buying a game without microtransactions and knowing you can explore it fully without any constraints, and buying a game to later on realize some of the content is not available.
And of course, there's the slightly different issue of competitive games where microtransactions can give you an edge. It's hard to not feel cheated in this case.
Let's say you're playing a non-pay-to-win game, and you buy some hats or skins. The assumption is that because the game was free, but the skins cost money, that it must be costly to produce skins. But this is ludicrous, skins and hats are the easiest things in the game to produce! Players know this, and so when you demand $1 for a fancy hat, the cost is associated with the hat, and players feel a bit cheated because they know that the hat couldn't have taken more than a dozen or so man-hours to slap together, and it seems ludicrous to demand so much money for something like that.
They are often associated with psychological tricks to make you spend money. One basic example of these tricks is create a fake currency (like the gems in your example) which act as a layer to detach the customer from the money which is actually spent. Another example would be to tease the player by giving him one free item, which will later on only be available through microtransactions. Much more devious methods exist.
