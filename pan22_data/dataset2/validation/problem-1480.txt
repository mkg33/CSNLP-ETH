I think someone experienced will immediately recognize the problem I mean, if not, when I return home soon, I will shoot a little youtube video demonstrating the issue!
When from walking from some direction, to attacking, it starts "jumping", appearing glitchy, because it's not staying in the same correct position, only doing so for the right attacking sprite, due to the drawing being made from the lower left part of the rectangle.
Another speculation would be that there might be some sort of method in LibGdx, the library I'm using, that allows me to change the drawing center (which I looked for and didn't find), so I could choose from where the drawing starts.
It all works fine, except when the sprites are all similarly sized, but when a sprite changes from a small sprite into a big one, such as here:
So the question is: what possible solutions are there? I've thought that some sort of individual frame "offset" system might be the answer, or perhaps splitting, in this case, the sprite in 2: the sword, and the character itself, and draw sword according to character's facing, but that might be overly complex.
Thing is, I've used darkFunction Editor as a way to get all the spriteCoordinates off a spriteSheet for each individual sprite, and parse the .xml it generates inside my game.
