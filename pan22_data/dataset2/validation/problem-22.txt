Going above 'dual head' at the moment is moderately complex under Linux, though dead simple under Windows sadly.  You'll probably be looking at using Twinview on each 'Device' within xorg.conf and then tying them together with Xinerama. This may hurt performance.
I'ev got three  myself.  The optimal way is to have one monitor per video card.  Just be careful what your motherboard supports.  Some only support ATI cards, the others just support NVidia.
On Windows, a large virtual desktop spanning multiple monitors can be set up no matter which way you connect them in your circumstances. I don't have any multimon experience on Linux and I've forgotten what i knew about OS X.
However, performance depends on the particular combination of factors in a specific configuration. The OS, drivers, slot type(s), bus speed etc. all interact. The only way to tell for sure without doing a well-designed benchmark. I would find something that does a lot of OpenGL and displays the frame rate. Run it so that it spans the two monitors (if it will let you) and try it in each potential configuration.
Multiple monitors is pretty standard for a NOC environment, and my experience setting it up and configuring it under Linux varies wildly. Some of the new support under Ubuntu Linux can be quite fantastic, they make installing the proprietary nVidia drivers very simple indeed. Invoke 'nvidia-settings' as root afterward and you'll spy a very simple way to configure the right orientation for your monitors, works perfectly for two monitors or similar cards.
I can't be sure on this, but one to each card would be the logical answer.  Distributing the load across both cards.  I should think it makes minimal performance difference, but that's the way I'd do it.
Regardless of the OS, I would think that some operations that span the two monitors would have better performance if they stay on one card and don't involve the bus or the OS. So I would recommend that you use one card until you get more monitors.
