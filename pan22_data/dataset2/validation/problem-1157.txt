Fiber is going to be expensive. I would recommend going with copper as a first step. With copper (ethernet) you've already got the infrastructure in place (I'm assuming that the other building already has plant wiring, a switch, etc). The only implementation costs is going to be for a copper cable run from one building to the other. If you go with fiber, you're going to have to pay for the fiber cable, installation and qualification, new switches and\or fiber interfaces for the current switches if they support fiber, etc.
A physical connection fiber/wire will almost always be better from the perspective of functionality and performance.
The two buildings most likely don't have a common ground.  Running anything with an electrical connection such as a CAT5 cable across that takes a risk of electrical surges due to the difference in grounds.  I've seen a lightning strike one building and take out everything connected to a network in another building b/c they were linked via a cat5.  It killed a lot of switches and network cards.  Maybe modern switches do more to protect against this as this was a long time ago.  But I wouldn't risk it.
Also while you're running the lines run a couple of spares if you can.  No matter what you choose to go with.
OTOH another inexpensive option might be to just setup a point to point wireless connection.  A wireless connection using recent technology should be able to provide between 50-150 MB of bandwidth and seems like it should be enough for 10-15 people using computers for typical office functions.
