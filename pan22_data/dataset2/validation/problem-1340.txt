I have the ability to write a quick script to clear these folders out every so often, but I would like to avoid that if possible.
I have tried pointing it to a different location, such as C:\temp0\ and changing the registry key to reflect that, but it still has a limit on it. I have looked through Outlook 2010 settings and have not found anything. When I google or search on this forum I can only find band-aid fixes, which I'm trying to avoid.
Recently I've had many users report to me with errors when opening attachments in Outlook 2010. The issue is because the temp folder assigned for Outlook attachments is getting too full and won't allow anymore to be saved to the temp folder. The easy solution is to open up the folder and delete everything inside of it, but I am finding that I have to do this constantly for people who receive up to 50 attachments per day. 
Looks like I should have done a little more research. This is a known issue with Outlook and was resolved in Microsoft Office Service Pack 1. This explains why this was happening to a few users and not all of our users. Once I updated said client's PC with Windows Updates, the process tested fine.
