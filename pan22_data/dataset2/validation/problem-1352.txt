You may also just be having an issue where WebDAV is working properly but the tests are failing, thus preventing WebDAV from working.  You can bypass the WebDAV tests in the admin site by adding check_for_working_webdav=false to the config.php file.
As discussed in the OwnCloud forum, the OwnCloud sync client also does not necessarily work with self-signed certificates.  Try switching to HTTP temporarily and see if that works.  (However, others have gotten self-signed certififcates to work with no problem, and the error you are receiving does not say that this is the issue despite the fact that the symptoms are the same.)
Alternatively, this could be because your server is not allowing the WebDAV HTTP Verbs through to PHP.  See the OwnCloud setup guide for instructions on making sure these settings are set up properly.
The most likely reason for this error is that your server cannot communicate with itself.  This could be because your router does not have NAT reflection so your server cannot communicate with itself on its public IP.  Try adding a cloud.mcsoftworks.net pointing to 127.0.0.1 in your hosts file (or your internal DNS if you have) so that the server knows to contact itself instead of going out on the Internet.
in the IIS 8.5 manager there is a tab called modules if you open that it displays tons of modules search for WebDavModule and delete it.
