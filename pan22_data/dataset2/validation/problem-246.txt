I tried to remove it from their page and it says "That IP Address is not listed." but when I checked it again, it is listed and gives me the above message. 
SpamRats is a cheating "company" that is adding whole IP ranges and after than they try to sell you commercial services provided by their official companies ... if you write them an email with demand to stop illegal discreditation of the good name of your company or you will sue them they will remove it within an hour ... personal experience
There seems to be no way to persuade spamrats to unblock your IP.  Their removal tool simply does nothing, and attempts to contact them go unanswered.  You either need to persuade the people you are emailing not to use spamrats, or get yourself a new IP. 
Just so you know, the 'blunderbuss' only comes out when sufficient IP(s) in the class C all are detected as being a spam source, however the SpamRats! team is very good about helping you get unlisted if your server is properly configured, even if it is in the middle of a class C full of spammers.
