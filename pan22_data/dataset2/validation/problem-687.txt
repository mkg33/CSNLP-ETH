I use Outlook as a calendar and contact list for my students.  For each meeting that I have with a student I put the class number in the Notes section of the appointment.  If I want to have a review session I can e-mail all of my students who are taking a specific class.
My idea to accomplish this task is to link specific contacts with their appointments.  Then, when I search for a particular class, I'm hoping to list the e-mail addresses in the search results.  I can link the contacts, I can see the contact name after the search, but when I add the e-mail address field to the search results the e-mail address field is blank.
Currently, to let students know about a review session, I do a search in the calendar for the class name, get a list of the students, then go back to my e-mail client and type them one by one.  This can get rather tedious so I'm looking for better solution.
Is there a way to display the e-mail address of contacts in the calendar search?  If not, does someone have another way of performing the task?  Thanks.
