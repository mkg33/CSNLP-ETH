Since you didn't specify what exact type of a "hack" it was, I think I can assume you got compromised through SSH brute force. Here are some general tips:
...we switched from Windows to Linux recently because it was supposed to be more stable and secure. Go figure.
The hacking of your site likely had very little to do with the underlying operating system, and more to do with the code running on your site. All it takes is a single SQL injection, and you're history.
Others have already covered most of the important points.  But to add to what they have said security is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain.  This is almost always the human element involved.
On the other hand, if it was a vulnerability in your operating system, you may want to try switching distributions to something intended for web serving, like FreeBSD, CentOS or RHEL, assuming you aren't already using one. You may want to consider beefing up SELinux, or adding an Intrusion Detection/Prevention System of some kind aswell.
These rules will allow 3 ssh connections from an ip address on eth0 in 60 seconds and then block that ip address for 60 seconds.  This is normally enough to cause the automated attack to move on to another host.
In many places, it is a legal requirement to notify your customers of security breaches if personal information was potentially compromised, you may want to look into that.
As for how to tell your clients, if any of their data was exposed or even POTENTIALLY exposed, AT ALL, call them ASAP. No email, no hope it goes away. Use your phone that's sitting on your desk.
I've posted some comments on the various bits of specific advice that has been offered to try to avoid future attacks. I found myself in a similar situation just over a year ago, and certainly analysing the attack to improve your setup is important, but imo right now you should be worried about the servers you have running. How do you know you can trust anything on them? If you can't, then you need to wipe them.
Since you were blacklisted by Google, I'll assume someone managed to set up a malicious script on your server, in which case you might try something like mod_security, it's not a piece of cake to configure, but it's worth a try. It is, however, of paramount importance to ensure your code is free of these kinds of vulnerabilities.
Besides legal repercussions, you were providing a service to them that they were undoubtedly using to provide services for others in some way. You owe it to them to disclose any potential breach of data so they can adjust their workflow accordingly and notify anyone else downstream from them that it may affect.
You will need to make sure that these iptable rules are restored when you reboot.  Different distributions have different ways of doing that so google that or let us know what distro you're running and someone can provide you with that information.
Assuming that this was a brute force ssh attack if it only took them 20 tries then your passwords were pretty much non-existent.  These attacks are almost always automated attacks and are pretty easy to block with the following iptable rules.
Linux is more flexible than Windows in many scenarios, and thus can be made more secure when those certain situations arise. Switching from Windows to Linux for no real reason, especially when you're unfamiliar with the environment, is a bad call. If you run an internet-facing server and don't understand how the services on that server work, whether it be Windows, Solaris, RHEL, or BSD, you're asking for trouble.
