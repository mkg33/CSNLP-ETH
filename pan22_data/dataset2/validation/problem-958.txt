Assuming i'm using classic slow softwares like adobe suite (photoshop, flash, autodesk) and some very simple soft like notepad, php and so on...!
I would say it's good to have a large internal HD. And a large-ish external HD to backup all your files on.
Disks in the 50GB range cost almost as much as a 500GB disk, there' just no reason no to spend the extra $20 and get 10x as much storage.
You can do both. Partition your drive into 2. One for your Main Drive (C:) and the rest for your storage.  This way, if you system crashes, you can wipe drive C and start over without having to wipe your entire storage.  If i have a 500GB, i normally give 100G to my main drive.  It usually depends on how many apps you planning to install as this will be on the main drive.  The other drive will be where I store all my backup, pics, etc.
I don't think hes worried about data protection at all. He just wants to know if a smaller hard drive will boost his data access speeds. In most cases this won't help at all and if it does, the difference would be marginal at best. The platters on these drives are the same size so a smaller drive doesn't mean less travel time. Just make sure you get a drive with a good cache amount and stick with the 7200 RPMS. You shouldn't see any slowness.
The other benefit is that if you're really looking for speed, you can image your 32GB C: drive to an SSD, and boot off the SSD, giving you significant speed benefits as all the Windows activity (registry, swap, prefetch) is contained to the SSD. From reports from friends who've done this, putting Windows on an SSD gives the system more of a boost than anything else. 
but this time i'm not sure i want buy a big Hard Disk! i was thinking to have a "very small" HD like 50GB as main one and external (big) for store all other stuff!
The best mix I've found is having a big physical disk (for speed) logically chopped up into smaller logical partitions based on what you need. The main reason for this is backup and restore. If you have a 500GB C: drive, and your Windows boot disk gets corrupted  (based on the software you mentioned, I'm assuming you're running Windows), you have to restore 500GB. 
do you think this is a good practice for improve performance/speed or i'm jast saying some stupid thing!?
If, however, you format your boot disk as a smaller disk (I usually recommend 32GB, but it depends on what you're doing), then you can restore your boot/programs disk without forcing a restore of the other 468GB. In other words, you're more likely to do it.
