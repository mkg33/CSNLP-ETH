This common subset is very limited.  Observe, for example, that this mode of message submission from standard input and command arguments is Sendmail's -bm mode, but not all sendmail programs actually even support a -bm option.  So to portably invoke this mode, you cannot use the option.
You are missing the distinction between message contents (headers and body) and message envelope.  You're invoking sendmail with message contents, but you aren't supplying the envelope.  It's the envelope that controls delivery.  Without it, the message cannot go anywhere.
There are also portability caveats when combining -t with recipients given as command arguments, for the details of which see Dave Sill's book.  So pick one form or the other.  Don't mix them.
By default, sendmail expects the recipients to be specified on command line. Use -t to make it read the To:, Cc:, Bcc: headers.
By putting Subject: This is the subject, I don't need to specify the subject in sendmail, but adding the To: myemail@hostname.com field gives me Recipient names must be specified
You don't say which sendmail command that you are using.  Each MTS — Sendmail, qmail, Postfix, exim, and so forth — has its own.  The common subset of them all has just two ways of specifying envelope sender and envelope recipients:
