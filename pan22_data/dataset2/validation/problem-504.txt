I have considered buying a NAS for home use, but I am not sure this would be optimal. I am not looking for product recommendations, but more what technologies I should rely on to be able to run large executables from an expandable storage medium - the current laptop seems to need replacement.
I often end up buying a new laptop every second year, which is a bit of a problem. I run multiple applications that take up a lot of storage. For work, it is software for scientific computing (MATLAB etc.), programming (e.g. Visual Studio, Android SDK, Java), and graphics (Adobe Indesign, Photoshop). For leisure I run multiple pieces of music software and games that usually take up a few gigabytes of storage each.
I do have an external hard drive (1 TB), but I would like to avoid depending on a modular system and I am not too sure if running executables from a disk other than C:\ produces expected behavior. I am guessing that this is a fairly common problem for power users and would like to ask what the most common solution is. The goal is to have a durable storage system.
