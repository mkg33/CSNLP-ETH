I right-click on the file and select Open With->Choose Default program. In the "Open With" dialog, I select the browse button. I choose Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office11\msaccess.exe and press "Open".
I have seen cases where some dialogs don't prompt you for security elevation and do not give you a message that the change could not be made.  Try doing it through control panel
