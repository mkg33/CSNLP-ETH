To disable gdm in Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04 rename /etc/init/gdm.conf to /etc/init/gdm.disabled. In Ubuntu 9.04 it's /etc/event.d/gdm.conf
This should remove the entire GUI subsystem -- Xorg, Gnome, GDM, etc.  It should leave you with the ubuntu-minimal and ubuntu-standard packages and their dependencies (to be sure, you can pin them in Aptitude).  These are the base packages that all Ubuntu versions use (Server, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc).
Im running a virtual linux server on a low-end system, and i wold like to configure the server to boot in terminal window and not to the Gnome log in window, this is because of the low specs on the hardware.
If you're intending to run Ubuntu as a server only, you should have a look at the Ubuntu Server Edition, which would eliminate all desktop-related processes and free up some resources.
Mainly you need to remove the ubuntu-desktop meta-package and let Aptitude remove all its dependencies.  I think you can do this with:
Why did you install Gnome in the first place if you want a headless server? Anyway, maybe this little guide on how do deactivate the GUI helps you. Basically you use rcconf stop gdm and X.org from starting.
Once you've done that, fire up Aptitude to install the packages you want on your server.  If you want a lighter GUI, install Xubuntu (XFCE instead of Gnome, meta-package xubuntu-desktop) or Lubuntu (LXDE instead of XFCE, meta-package lubuntu-desktop).
The Ubuntu Server Edition is probably easier to use to create a fresh install of a headless server.  But if you want to avoid reinstalling, use Aptitude to purge your desktop packages will get you there too.
