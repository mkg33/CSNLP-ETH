Personally, I find OpenVPN to be the perfect tool for things like this.  It's very easy to setup and configure, runs well and Linux and Windows, and it's open source.  Hard to go wrong.  Also, I've used it heavily at multiple companies for production work, and had great success with it.
You could use the Service Bus in Azure .NET Services to securely relay your messages between your cloud instance and your intranet web services.  We're using this to call internal web services from Windows Azure.  The service is obviously much easier to use if you're using .NET web services (using built in libraries), but the service is supposed to be vendor agnostic via a REST API.
I'd setup a VPN between your Amazon EC2 instance and your local network.  That will allow you to keep all of your communications private and secure, while also allowing the EC2 instance to access devices behind the firewall.
Amazon just launched Virtual Private Cloud service which enables you to connect your existing infrastructure to a set of isolated AWS compute resources via an IPsec connection.
