Once you have your cluster use the (sudo) pg_ctrlcluster 9.1 main start to get the cluster up and running.
To finally solve the issue it helps to (re-)install the locales and reset the locale configuration. For me (using a debian 7.8 system) this was done by:
Just having a closer look on the output of apt-get install postgresql I noticed the output first states that something is wrong with my locale settings and in the end reports, the cluster could not be created:
Without an initialized cluster it really is just an empty directory. The most likely thing is that you don't have a cluster created (see what's in /var/lib/postgresql).
dpkg -c /var/cache/apt/archives/[PACKAGE-NAME].deb shows what is in the package and supposed to get installed.
Funny. I had this once, when I tried to aptitude install the postgres package, but removing, purging and installing with apt-get did work. I'ts a package issue. Report the bug.
Otherwise you may have luck with some ubuntu packages. And in the end it's not hard to build and with checkinstall you can easyly create your own packages and delete the sources.
I'm trying to install PostgreSQL 9.1 on a Debian Squeeze server using Backports, but after installation I don't have the /etc/postgresql folder, instead I've got a /etc/postgresql-common folder.
Is there something I'm doing wrong? According to the Debian Wiki I should have a /etc/postgresql/9.1/ folder.
Then use (sudo)  pg_createcluster 9.1 main to create your DB cluster (called main). Once created you will have a /etc/postgresql/9.1/main directory with the settings for that cluster.
