So classes seem great right? There is one major disadvantage: it is hard to create such a system, and much harder to create it right. This will require lots of thinking and creativity, and will never be perfect. Additionally, you will have to prevent new players from using very difficult cars, usually by a car unlocking system. And I am sure there are other disadvantages and advantages I missed or didn't think of, that will probably be pointed out in the comments of this awnser, but with dedication, you can overcome or mitigate these problems.
This will also have a side effect helpful to your situation: a "skilled" player may only be vary skilled in one or a few classes. If you make certain classes have an advantage against certain other classes, insomuch as to cause a 50-50 winning-losing chance for that combination, a you get closer to your goal. The skilled player either chooses their car or picks a different one he's not as skilled in. Either way the good player would be uncheatingly challenged, and the worse player has a real chance.
Your game is symmetrically balanced, which leads to the better player winning. A solution is to create classes of different cars. Have classes that don't take a lot of skill, and doesn't really punish the player. And create skill-based classes that are difficult to utilize optimally and/or punishes harder for mistakes of skill.
