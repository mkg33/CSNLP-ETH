If you're looking for an easy to use application, try soundconverter for GNOME or soundkonverter for KDE (both available from the repositories). If you prefer CLI applications, you can't do much better than Perl Audio Converter. There's a Debian/Ubuntu package on the Downloads page there. 
The quality setting -q:a ranges from 0 to 9, where 0 is best quality and 9 is worst. Here is a more in-depth guide. For most people, -q:a 2 is more than good enough.
If you install the package ubuntu-restricted-extra then you can rip to MP3 instead of Ogg Vorbis. Ubuntu doesn't ship with the MP3 encoder by default because of the legal minefield about who owns it.
Transcoding from one lossy format (vorbis) to another (MP3) is not ideal, but unfortunately it is necessary sometimes, especially if one has an ageing audio device. The command-line tool avconv can do this well (ffmpeg uses identical syntax).
This would be of broadly the same quality as -q:a 2, though the VBR mode should generally be preferred.
Sometimes people need to use a constant bit rate, for some really obsolete hardware, or for streaming. If that is the case,
Of course, the best answer is to re-rip from the CD to avoid loss of quality. By converting from one lossy format to another, it's like making a photocopy of a photocopy. Quality suffers.
will give you a variable bit rate MP3: this means that the encoder will alter the bit rate depending on the needs of the music. Dubstep needs a higher bit rate than whalesong. On average, over several pieces of music, -q:a 2 will get you 190 kbit/s, though most of them will be over or under that bitrate.
