This example reinforces Daniel's point (which I agree with) that it would be surprising to find a problem that is W-hard by vertex cover, without having some additional input given besides the graph.
The catch with our reduction is that we need to produce an edge-weighted graph, i.e. we need the edges to have different lengths. We can replace weighted edges with paths, but then this only proves W-hardness when the problem is parameterized by feedback vertex set. Indeed, if all edges have uniform weights then the problem is FPT parameterized by vertex cover. 
$(k,r)$-center is another (arguably natural) problem that is $W[1]$-hard parameterized by vertex cover. (See a recent preprint by Katsikarelis, me, and Paschos here - sorry about the self-promotion!). The problem here is to select $k$ vertices (centers) so that all other vertices are at distance at most $r$ from the closest center. This generalizes $k$-Dominating Set (which corresponds to $r=1$). More strongly, the problem is $W[1]$-hard parameterized by vertex cover and $k$.
