The best way to find out is to try it.  I just installed DD-WRT on my router a month ago. It took a few days to figure out how to go about doing it, but once you're prepared, the actual installation is very simple.
Of course, my situation is not your situation.  In my case, my router was dropping connections and returning spurious DNS entries.  Installing DD-WRT appears to have fixed it.  But if you have to reset your modem (not the router) to temporarily fix your issue, then it sounds like your modem may be the culprit, not the router.  Did you purchase your modem or do you lease it from the provider?  I know I've taken many modems and DVRs back to my cable company's office and they replace it without question.  You can try that first, then try replacing the router's firmware.
Yes, I have found the DD-WRT to be much more stable than the latest Linksys firmware on the WRT160Nv3 and it may be true for the WRT-54G as well.  Make sure you follow the upgrade instructions on the DD-WRT wiki exactly.  Sometimes the reset process of 30/30/30 is essential in making the hardware accept the new firmware and be stable.
If I install the open source DD-WRT or Tomato firmware, will this issue go away? Is this a software problem or a hardware problem? I was thinking, well I'll just try it. Then I looked at the instructions for installing DD-WRT -- wow that's a lot of work. 
I've got a Linksys WRT-54G wireless router. The connection is flaky. Once or twice a week I come home from work and can't connect to the wireless so I have to reset the modem. It's annoying.
