My find_path function particularly seems like it needs work.  Seems like I should be able to calculate a path through an 8x8 grid with a recursion depth of less than 1000.
If you are going to return a value from your main function, you should pass it to sys.exit() so that it actually functions as a return code.
I'm trying to implement my own A* pathfinder, but the voices in my head scream of better ways to do this.  Probably because I'm exceeding Python's default maximum recursion depth of 1000.
Don't put mutable values like list as your default parameters. Python will not create a new list everytime this function is called, rather it will keep reusing the same list which is probably not what you want
I suggest a function get_blocked that you pass cell to which check for 'X' and also returns True if the cell is off the side of the map. Also catching IndexError may not be quite what you want because negative numbers are valid indexes, but probably not want you want. I suggest checking in the get_blocked function for inboundedness.
