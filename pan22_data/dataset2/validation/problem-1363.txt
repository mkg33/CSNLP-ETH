1.1/24 can talk to anything in 1.0/24 because the mask says they are "local" ("on the wire"). If 1.1/24 tried to talk to 2.1/23, it fails: "2" is outside the 1.0/24 range; and fwiw, "1" is outside 2.0/23's range. 3.1/22 would be able to send to 1.1/24 -- /22 covers 0-3 -- but 1.1/24 wouldn't be able to answer.
As you state these are on the same switch, but you don't specify a VLAN assignment or otherwise, so I assume the broadcast domain is still the whole network. What you basically have is an overlay network, in which two IP networks share the same broadcast domain. In itself not a problem, but does cause additional traffic. Any host on IP network A that wants to communicate with a host on IP network B has to go through the router between the two (yes, this router must have multiple addresses on the same network interface, one for network A and one for network B). Even though they are in the same broadcast domain, the IP addressing prevents them from communicating directly.
"but the IP addresses could be said to follow the /24 paradigm.". That is the irrelevant statement. In Classless Inter-Domain Routing, as is common these days, the actual values in the IPv4 address are irrelevant for network address determination. Only the netmask is relevant to determine what part of the IP address is the network address and what part is the host address. 
C cannot talk to B, since the C host's. 3 would be a broadcast address (not a valid host) in B's subnet masking. 
are within the subnets of each, where the original post showed A with a /24 and B with a /30...while C had a /29.
It might definitely work. But the  problem that arises when you are not configuring static IP's , then in that case /24 can assign 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2 as well and /23 can also assign the same - especially if you have same range in DNS/DHCP. so there could be potential IP conflicts that could arise
