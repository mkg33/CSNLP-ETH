What's the proper way to run pry in this Linux?  On Windows and Mac OS X I can simply type pry at any command prompt or terminal.
there's a pry file in ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/bin.  I have to call it with ruby_noexec_wrapper in the same directory:
If you had installed pry from the distro package, apt install pry, then likely it would be in a normal system bin.  However, the distro version (0.10) is probably older than the one installed by gem, and will not get updated as often (presuming gem, or you, update stuff it installs).
bin directories generally contain executables and if you echo $PATH you'll see a number of them there.
This prefixes that directory.  It is important not to replace the rest of it, which is why there's :$PATH at the end.
I installed rvm and Ruby 1.9.3p194 on a Raspberry Pi using Debian Linux.  When I installed pry using gem install pry, everything installed perfectly but typing pry in a terminal didn't work:
To make it permanent, put that export command in ~/.profile.  Note that it applies only to the current shell session, so if you have added it in one GUI terminal it won't magically apply to a concurrent one.  Also note that .profile may not be run if you use a GUI login.  To check just login again and echo $PATH.
