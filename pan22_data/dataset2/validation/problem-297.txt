Personally I've used ActiveXperts Network Monitor for this - it's a no-nonsense Windows-based monitoring service with a very easy to use configuration tool... it has built-in checks for stuff like web site replies, sql queries and can handle most custom scripting and snmp if needed. It's not free, but it's extremely cheap imo.
I monitor a few server ports with the freeware version. For easy setup there's a nice web interface included. There, you FIRST create your servers ("devices") and THEN (on the "device") you set up the "sensors" you want. 
Have you tried PRTG Network Monitor? It can monitor web servers. It also has a built-in SQL database monitoring (mySQL, MS-SQL, Oracle). For SMTP/POP monitoring, you can set up a "round-trip-sensor" that sends an email via SMTP and checks whether it reaches your POP server.
Maybe the freeware version is already sufficient for you. It supports 10 "sensors", which could basicly be 4 ping sensors, one email sensor, one ftp login sensor and 4 SQL query sensors or similar.
There are a bazillion products that do this. I've tried half a bazillion of them. They range from the very simple to the very complex. Based on your responses to the answers posted so far, your best bet would be to peruse some of the vendor's web sites, download the ones that look promising to you, and try them out.

PRTG also sends notifications when one of your servers is down. And you can see nice statistics and graphs for up to one year in the past! You see, I love it! ;-)
I can't believe I am mentioning "Whats up Gold" in the same thread as Nagios but wug is about as simple as you can get.  Also every network is different so any product you install will require some work.
We used to us OpManager which worked nicely for us. It's very easy to setup and run a simple monitoring scenario on (it looks complicated, but it's not just point and click web interfaces, automatic discovery and configuration, etc). In the end we decided to go with Nagios for all monitoring (previously nagios monitored our datacenters, and OpManager monitored our office servers)
