AltShiftNumLock gives you a dialog box asking you whether you want to turn on Mouse Keys. Once enabled, the numpad's / and - keys can be used to switch between the left and right mouse button (or * for both), 0 will press and hold the mouse button, and . releases it.
As an alternative to the already posted answers, you can turn on Mouse Keys. Mouse Keys lets you use the numeric keypad to control the mouse pointer and buttons. You can combine this with a real mouse or trackpad, so that you use the keypad to control the buttons, but a mouse or trackpad for positioning.
If you are using a Microsoft Mouse you can download the control software from hear,  sorry I can’t find a list of what it allows you to defined each mouse button to do on each version of windows, but worth a try.   
There are many mouse on the market with additional buttons, often these come with software that let you define what you wish the additional buttons to do.      XMouse Button Control (XMBC) is free software that claim to work with most mouse with additional buttons and allows you to control what these buttons do, one option it gives is “Click-Drag [Sticky buttons/keys]”
After suffering from severe back-pain (not caused by an injury) while doing mouse-intensive work I've found using a vertical mouse a very big relief. It might take a few days 'til you are familiar with the altered position of your mouse-hand but after a while using a conventional mouse felt even more awkward, not to speak of using a trackpad.
As for a key toggle, I think that some 3rd party mouse/trackball drivers offer that.  I don't recall the current kensington software, but as you note it’s “other” balls that need this kind of thing for a larger number of users.  With 4 or 6 buttons, it might be a choice to set one to latch left button down.  I saw that many years ago but it could have been Logitech. 
Ps: I am not affiliated with any of the companies mentioned nor do I sell their products or benefit from mentioning them in any way.
Use a trackball, but rig up the button to be pressed with the other hand.  This is a feature I look for in a tiny (for HTPC) keyboard+ball device.  But for a good quality Kensington trackball, it would be a simple mod will wire a switch in parallel to the existing one.  Put it on the other side of the keyboard or use a foot switch.  The company that makes XKeys sells foot switches and such.
While i think that keltari's and and mioxlav's answers are probably what you were aiming for I yet would like to bring vertical mice into the game.
If you use "ClickLock" (Windows 7 and above) you have to be able to press the mouse button for a very short time to start a drag, however a lot of people can't do this....
