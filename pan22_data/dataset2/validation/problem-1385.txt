You have two possible ways of share a disc between a Windows machine and a Mac and use it to backup both machines:
The only filesystems that are readable on the major OSs and their variants are ISO9660 and FAT to my knowledge. With a 1,5TB harddisk you will have a problem I think. I remember some border on the FAT partition size and that was definitely below 1500GB
Are they on the same network? You could share the drive on the Mac and have the PC backup over a local network connection (I have my Mac and PC directly connected together for such a purpose.)
I can't think of any solution that supports both properly without some kind of bodge, and the idea of "some kind of bodge" being near "backups" makes me sad :-(
As far as backup software for the PC, it depends if you want the software to do a full backup including the OS, or if you want to to just backup your documents and the like. (The latter would work great with Unison or rsync.)
Best ideas are either backup to the Mac across the network for the Windows machine as Rizwan suggests, or failing that just buy a second drive - not what you wanted to hear but it isn't that expensive in the great scheme of things and certainly "cheaper" in terms of your sanity than a backup solution you can't quite trust.
You could also possibly partition the drive into an NTFS partition (for your PC) and a HFS partition (for your Mac Time Machine.)
I'd rather use some network attached storage to accomplish what you want. Cheap disks with network functionality are available at your local retailer.
