While we're at it, let's look at the basic functions you're going to have to handle and their alternatives. 
Virtualisation. Do not forget virtualisation. You can run multiple servers on one machine. It will also help in configuration and set-up. If you are unfamiliar with how one server works, you can create a virtual server and test it to your heart's content before setting up the production one in another virtual server. Also, as someone else has mentioned, you can run Windows virtualised too.
It all depends on your needs. I run a mix of Windows and Linux, with each chosen to suit a combination of what it has to do and what hardware available for it (it's a small company). As nearly all the workstations run Windows it makes sense to use Windows on the main servers. i.e. Those servers users interact with directly. For what I consider to be "sundry services", things such as firewall, system monitoring, spam filtering, network faxing, etc I use Linux. This enables me to implement readily available and well proven solutions at very close to zero cost, without creating interoperability issues. This last point, previously raised by others, needs to be given careful consideration. That, more than anything else, is where the true long term costs of a mixed environment are likely to be.
No.  For a small business, you are likely getting your Windows licenses with the hardware you're buying.  It's basically a no cost venture other than maybe some CALs.  While you might be familiar with Linux, you're likely to run into compatibility issues with the software you've already mentioned requires Windows which alone make it a bad idea.  I would venture to guess if you added up potential lost productivity fighting those issues vs the cost of the Windows licenses you'd actually have to buy apart from hardware, you'd find the license cost is far less than the cost of your, and others time.  
Besides Evan's excellent answer above, I'd like to add in that there are other interoperability solutions that aren't covered. 
If possible, I'd outsource as much as you can. Email is a great target -- it's usually cost-effective to outsource it because the authentication, security, spam, and network transport issues are non-trivial (i.e. reverse DNS &c) and a pain in the butt to keep running. 
As I mentioned in my comment on Evan's answer, interoperability is the key thing here.  There's a lot more to client/server communication than raw IP traffic.  If nothing else Windows servers will give you Active Directory and Group Policies.  Add in gains from centralised management, single sign on, and being on a client/server platform that's designed to work together, and it looks like being a no-brainer.
Of course Windows has it's issues, but my experience has been that it is quite stable in a standard configuration and Linux will only introduce problems, especially on the desktop.  Servers are an entirely different question.
The cost of the licenses is only a small fraction of the overall cost, and with Windows on the desktop you're just going to get a much better environment by putting Windows on the servers.
