I recall this being chewed over on alt.sysadmin.recovery back in days of yore, when there was no such thing as /proc, and /dev was just a regular directory containing entries for a bunch of unusual inodes...
If you let it go, the OS will pretty much be beyond recovery though you may be able to get some data back easily.
On such systems, if you started one up in maintenance mode (so nothing was running but your shell, not even init, and no secondary file systems were mounted) and did exec /bin/rm -rf /, you would be left with a completely empty root file system except that /bin and /bin/rm would survive.
One point I didn't see made by anyone else: files that are currently open (e.g. rm itself), even if deleted, won't actually disappear fom the drive until closed.
It'll go quite far... if you're using a gui you might have fun noticing things degrade more visibly. (icons on menus stop loading etc.)
For having tried it once (on a server that what pissing me off), logged as root, in terminal, you'll lose almost everything. The only thing that'll not be erased will be only the process that was essential for the OS.
... but, on some variants of Unix (my recollection is HP-UX, but that could be totally wrong), you could not remove the last directory entry for a program that was running.  (Shared libraries?  What are those?)
