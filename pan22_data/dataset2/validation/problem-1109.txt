To the OP, there is indeed currently no way to rearrange jump list items without unpinning all and re-pinning in the order you prefer. MS's decision to disable drag-and-drop functionality here is curious. And annoying for many users. I personally don't use the quick access feature (formerly known as favorites), as I dislike the extra steps to open explorer and having another window to close. Jump lists are more efficient to many users' workflow. Removing drag-and-drop functionality diminished their usefulness, IMHO. 'Hoping MS returns this functionality to Win10 in the near future via updates.
I found I was able to do it as with Windows 7 through 8.1.  Drag it as usual but don't expect a visual indication that it is moving.  When you release the mouse button it will indeed appear in the new location.  If you do it slowly (as I had been because I was expecting that visual clue) you'll get a menu instead.  Just quickly drag and drop.
The original question pertains to pinned jump list items off the task bar. Quick access and jump lists are independent of one another, therefore rearranging quick access items/lists does not affect jump lists, nor vice-versa.
This is currently not possible. You can only do this by un-pinning every item and then re-pin them again in the correct order.
I have only been able to figure out how to do this using folders in Explorer. But if you open a folder and go the the left pane, there is a Quick Access shortcut at the top. These are your pinned folders. You can rearrange them in any order you want here.

Unfortunately many folks are confusing pinned task bar items, pinned jump list items off the task bar, and quick access lists in explorer, and thus, giving irrelevant answers.
