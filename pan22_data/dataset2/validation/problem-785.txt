To test this premise, before you plug the cable into either pi, try and stop the service on both of them:
I'm guessing this is because of hijinks caused by ifplugd, which runs as an init service by default on raspbian.  The intent is to configure ethernet automatically when a cable is plugged in, since this is an event that the normal NetworkManager system can't detect.
I have two rpi's both of which have a wifi dongle. I can vnc into rpi but if I connect the two rpi's via Ethernet cable, vnc fails. Is there a way to hook the two rpi together via ethernet ports and retain access via wifi?
Make sure it is really stopped with ps -C ifplugd (it shouldn't list anything).  When I noticed this app on my first pi, it seemed very pesky and I had to completely uninstall it to prevent it from coming back.
Yes, put a static ip address for eth0  in /etc/network/interfaces on both RPis. The network has to be different than that of the WiFi devices. 
If the wifi goes down and ifplugd isn't running, you probably have to reconfigure or disable NetworkManager.
Plug in the ethernet cable and see if the wifi goes down.  If so, check ps -C ifplugd again (you'll need a keyboard and screen plugged in to debug this, obviously).  If not, problem solved.
