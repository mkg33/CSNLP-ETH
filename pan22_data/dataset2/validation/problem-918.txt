It's not easy, and the science of game design documents is woefully under-explored in comparison to other software domains.
You should not require yourself to add information that you think you need just because some template has it.
Typically large games aren't built off monolithic design documents, but a distributed document system. Either a series of smaller targeted docs or a wiki. Personally I prefer the wiki approach as allows readers to quickly jump between related topics which maps well to system designs which are often integrated.
A good paper on this is Requirements Engineering and the Creative Process in the Video Game Industry.
There are no minimum / maximum. It should contain everything you need to start work on the game. Nothing more and nothing less.
Having just begun studying design documents, I've come to the conclusion that no-one really knows what goes in them.
Each list contains layout sheets (or character layouts for characters - front, side, 3/4), notes, mechanics notes for animation, etc. Whatever you need or might need. 
The size and scale of the project documentation completely depends on the size of team and the scope of the project.
The design document itself should be what you need to progress from pre-production to production. How do you turn the game design from this nebulous idea to something that can be created and executed? Too little detail and there's too much ambiguity, creating uneven results, too much detail and you limit possible creativity from your team.
I'd say you should work out what the gameplay is, who your character is, and what the environment is like. But my advice would be to start making playable prototypes as early as possible.
