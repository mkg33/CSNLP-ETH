There is an amazing technique available for finding out impact of a different features on the model, it is called Permutation Importance.
Read about PCA("Principal Component Analysis") and while implementing must standardize data on similar scale.
Do so for each categorical variable.  Sometimes it will be better to assign, say, only 3 major responses plus "other". Then do one-hot-encoding, (=categorical to numerical using dummy variables) then do simple KMeans clustering and interpret the resulting clusters yourself for plausibility.
I'm not an expert at clustering methods at all. Is there a way to known way of estimating the importance of a feature (or combination of features) in deciding which cluster a user falls into? 
I have entirely categorical data (survey results from users), so I've used k-modes clustering to better understand my users. 
Apart from this, if you want to learn how to manually analyse K-Means clustering algorithm please read this paper.
If you have only free-text  responses in your survey, or lots of NAs, you have to do even more preprocessing first.
Compute which feature value has the highest probability of predicting a particular cluster. It's a straightforward application of Bayes' formula.
