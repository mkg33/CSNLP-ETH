I haven't actually ever tried it for a personal files, but you could transfer the file using the BitTorrent protocol which was designed for peer-to-peer file sharing. There are many free client programs available like ÂµTorrent to use. The documentation for the latter discusses how to create a private torrent file and send a link to it to someone else for sharing. There are also many tutorials on the web.
You also could query IP from Websites like http://www.wieistmeineip.de/ but there are many problems with forwarding the adress/port through the router and your firewall.
You can use SSH to copy files securely from one system to another. One must run a windows SSH server program such as freeSSHd, while the other uses an SSH copy tool such as PuTTY Secure Copy client. In order to know what your system's IP address is you could write a batch script send an e-mail (with blat) with the server's current IP address, then create a scheduled task to run the script every day (or every few hours even).
I use a Windows XP PC and have a file of about 700mb, that I would like to copy to another PC (Win XP) over internet. None of the PCs have have a static IP from ISP. How can I transfer the file? I don't prefer uploading the file to a file sharing server and download it in the other PC. Is there any other way (like team viewer or torrent)?
Teamviewer should be the best option(the fastest one) I see imo. Torrent would be very slow to transfer.
