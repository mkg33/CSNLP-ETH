If I can ReShare it from the server it will be "Printer on Server" for everyone. (It'll also mean I don't need to change the hardcoding when the replacement networked printers arrive).
Can anyone think of a way of Re-Sharing a Shared Printer? When I connect the shared printers to Server 2008 R2, it comes up as a network printer, and settings take affect on the host (not the server) so I can't Re-Share it.
A printer is a logical construct that "maps" to a physical device. There's nothing stopping you from creating a second printer, with a Share name of whatever you require, that "maps" to the same physical device.
Why bother sharing it twice? Just install the drivers and create a TCP/IP port and map the second computer directly to the printer, or are you traversing networks here that is limiting direct TCP/IP connectivity from the second computer to the printer?
The reason I need this is I have a number of workstations that run software in which I have to hardcode the printer name. In an emergency I have to use USB printers shared from a workstation, which also needs to print. So on the workstation the printer name is "Printer" where as on the other computers it's "Printer on Workstation", so I can't hardcode the printer names.
Instead of connecting to the printer on the server, go through the Add New Printer wizard on the PC and create a new Local Port, and use: \servername\printershare as the local port name. Then select your driver, and the printer will be usable as whatever you name it.
