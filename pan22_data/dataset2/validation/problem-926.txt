I feel Option 4 is not well understood, but the Options 1-3 have a lot written on them in various places, so I'll comment on 4.
I prefer the social solution, instead of the technology one. Which are programs like Covenant Eyes. Instead of "blocking" software this is called "accountability software".
The basic approach is to use a router that has a lot of configurability, like a dd-wrt router, and set the router's DNS to openDNS's server, and add a command in the iptables to force all DNS packets to go to the router's DNS server.
You can configure it in the router to filter specific computers (by MAC address). If you're trying to concentrate, say, for a week or two on some crushing work project, you can change the settings on openDNS to block pretty much all time wasting sites, give the password to the router and openDNS to your wife, and then have a single work computer on which you can't check facebook just one more time... or at least until your project is complete.
These programs allow the child to view anything, but everything they see gets reported to you. The advantage here is then you have to talk with the child more, and have a dialogue about what they are viewing, and establish proper boundaries through a punishment / reward system, and through education. I offer this as an alternative, hoping it may help in addressing the root of the issue, rather than the symptoms. For mobile, you can likewise install the app, and use parental controls to block the default browser.
Disadvantage: It only blocks one site, and as soon as the kid figures out it is the hosts file, he can just edit the file back again.
Option 2-Sign up for opendns.com, configure it to block what you need. Set the kid's computer's dns to the OpenDNS servers.
Option 4- Use a router than can lock down the DNS settings so that everyone on your network HAS to use openDNS.
Disadvantage: You're only blocking individual sites, one at a time, and some people have a hard time confronting their router's settings.

Advantage: You can have total control over your network. There are some sites that are dual purpose, such as images.google.com, that you either won't be able to block or won't be able to differentiate between a safe and unsafe use, but in general, this has the best total control over your network.
4c) Buy a router that has a GUI option for "parental settings" that can force the use of openDNS or Norton SafeConnect. (Basically option 4b done for you).
