For performance, start measuring application performance. Western Europe to China through the great firewall will perform poorly. Try different regions until you find a close one by network latency.
Data sovereignty, compliance, and other political concerns may require determining where it physically is. Ask your compliance person whether the API telling you which region is sufficient.
Do not rely upon or trust geolocation services for IP addresses. Today, IP addresses are logical entities (I am oversimplifying) and can be assigned to different data centers, in some cases to multiple data centers at the same time (IP ANYCAST). They can also be reassigned (Software Defined Networks) with an API call.
Geolocation of IP addresses is unreliable. Sometimes the correct city, sometimes the incorrect continent.
All Google IP addresses are owned by Google and typically point to one of Google's business addresses which does not indicate the physical location.
If you are using a Regional IP address then you know what region it is in by selecting the region when you create it. Regional IP addresses can only be used in the same region.
