CEO/CIO/CFO: "The email integration with our ERP/CRM system isn't working anymore. We can't communicate with our customers. We're losing money by the second!"
I am just reorganising my companies active directory structure, as it hasn't kept up with changes in the company structure.
There are a few items I am not sure if I can move or not. Can anyone tell if it is ok to move the below or not:
Cleaning up and maintaining the AD structure is one thing but don't get wrapped up in "busy work". Organize the OU's and objects that you/the company has created. Leave all of the Built-in and default containers and objects as they are. While there may not be any issue with moving some of these items the fact of the matter is there's just no good reason to do so (or very, very few good reasons to do so).
From what I have heard, the Exchange Security Groups OU can be moved in it's entirety as it has a well known GUID and Distinguished name. I am not so sure about the accounts for system mailboxes, although I can't think of any reason why not. All the builtin accounts I assume are fine to move.
