The web interface may not give you many configuration options, so may not be of much use (I haven't used it before).
The real question though is why is the switch not allowing a flat network by default?  It may be that the connection between the two switches is not working.  Is it copper or fibre?  Are you getting a link light on both ports.  if not, check the cable.  If the connection is fibre have you tried crossing over the fibre?
When switch reloads it will have a default config and should allow a flat network out of the box.  You may also be able to wipe the config using the web interface.
Once you are connected to the CLI, enter the following to enable the web interface (replacing the IP address with something on your network, and the interface number with one of the free interfaces)
To enable the web interface, you will first need to connect to the switch using a serial cable, connect to the port marked Console on the back of the switch.  Use a terminal emulator (e.g. Putty if you are using Windows) and open up the COM port the serial cable is connected to.  If you are using a USB-Serial cable, you may need to install a driver first to virtualise the COM port.
Now connect a cable to the port in the above and connect to https://192.168.1.80 (or whichever IP you have used)
Is the switch new?  If someone else has used it before and it contains their config, you could try the following to wipe the config.  From the CLI, using the serial cable as mentioned earlier:
