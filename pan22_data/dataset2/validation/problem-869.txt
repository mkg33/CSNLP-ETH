The activation is done by a marker in the BIOS (SLIC), a Digital OEM Certificate (*.xrm-ms) and a generic OEM product key.
Something like a bootable copy of Acronis True Image will do this, or linux's dd can do so too I believe. 
On your currently installed OEM Windows search for the OEM.xrm-ms, make a backup of it and run a tool that can extract the currently used OEM key. Now save this Key + OEM.xrm-ms to an external drive and do a clean Windows 7 install.
After the setup, copy the OEM certificate to C:\Windows\System32\OEM, run %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\SLMGR.VBS -ilc %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\OEM.xrm-ms, next enter the OEM key with this command: %SYSTEMROOT%\System32\SLMGR.VBS -ipk KEY.
Now you have a clean Windows which is activated via OEM key. Make a system image of it or create a setupcomplete.cmd which does all the steps on your own and added it to the Windows DVD so that the setup does all the steps on its own.
The "cleanest" way to do this in my eyes would be to make a disk image of the entire disk as it stands. Then you can restore it to EXACTLY as it is today at any point in the future.

Otherwise look for a similar tool in your laptop there must be one if the Windows came pre-installed.
There's a default application software provided by the manufactures on the PC's with pre-installed Windows like for Acer there is Acer Recovery Management,for Dell there is Dell Backup and Recovery Manager and for Lenovo I think there is Lenovo ThinkVantage Tools or OneKey Recovery.These tools are used to create factory restore disks for future use,previously I think they used to provide recovery media with the PC's but now they expect you to create one using the above mentioned respective tools.I am posting some links see if it helps:
