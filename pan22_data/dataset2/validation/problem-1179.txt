Jul  4 11:50:46 Virtualization kernel: [ 6239.229383] e1000e 0000:07:00.0 eth2: 10/100 speed: disabling TSO
Beginning at 9:22, every fifteen seconds or so, syslog spits this out ("Virtualization" is the server's hostname):
The cables and connections are all well tested and weren't touched between 8:05 and the time I came in.
I'm scratching my head. I recently configured a server with two identical Intel NICs inside a DMZ. This morning at around 8:05, I successfully SSH'd in through the internal interface (via my LAN-based PC) and had access to the outside world as well. When I got into work at 9:30 or so, while I still had external access (eth1), I wasn't able to SSH in, nor could I ping out to the LAN (eth2). Restarting the interfaces or rebooting had no impact.
