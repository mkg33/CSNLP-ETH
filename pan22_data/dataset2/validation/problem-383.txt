You can also use WinDirStat to look at your files to see if there are any really large ones that may not be necessary.
Rather than just free up space, I am guessing that you have probably two partitions on the same disk, with D: being much larger, and hopefully, with a lot more space. I would use GPARTED, or some other partition manager, and just make C: larger, and solver the problem permanently, as you are sure to keep running low as time goes on.
Download CCleaner from http://www.ccleaner.com, install it, make sure to uncheck possible boxes like "Install Google Chome" during the installation, start CCleaner, click the Analyse button, click the Clean button, Done! :)
In the short term, I am with the guys, who said use CCleaner, but also you can consider moving your swap file, which often takes up a lot of space, especially on newer systems with more RAM.
Try using Disk Space Fan to visualise your hard drive. This can help you see where some of your biggest folders are, and what's in them.
