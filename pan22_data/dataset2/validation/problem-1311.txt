I suggest starting two terminals, one for monitoring and another for sending a request. Terminal1 will show responses from all existing DHCP servers including MAC address. This example was run on Ubuntu:
There are also a number of utilies avaliable which proport to do this one is DHCP explorer another is DHCP probe which you mentioned in your original post.

On a Mac, run ipconfig getpacket en0 (or en1). See http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060124152826491.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_DHCP for a list of tools (many of which were listed in other responses).

Another way would be to use Wireshark packet capturer/analyser to look at your network traffic and find DHCP connections, there is a lab worksheet on how do do this avaliable from here.

That monitoring terminal is needed just to see all responses (nmap is able to show only the first response).
You can get the IP address of the server by running ipconfig /all on a windows machine, and then you can get the MAC address by looking for that IP address using arp -a. 
dhcpdump, which takes input form tcpdump and shows only DHCP related packets. Helped me find rootkited Windows, posing as fake DHCP in our LAN.
There are several ways, if your running a small network the simplest way is to turn off / disable / un-plug your dhcp server and then run
