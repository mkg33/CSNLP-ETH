Pseudo Terminal Slave (pts) connections are SSH or telnet connections that means indirect connections to the system. All of these connections can connect to a shell which will allow you to issue commands to the computer. So when you open up a terminal on your system from gui, it opens up a pts with source ip 0.0.0.0. From the information provided by you, it seems that it happening because of script running on this server or scheduled, which is using ssh or telnet service or local pts to throw output in terminal. 
This looks absolutely puzzling to me. Either it should use some DNS name or IP address. I checked the last.c file also but I still can't find why it is not showing anything. Probably given some time, I can figure out the part about 0.0.0.0.
The Third type of Entry comes when you open a screen session after loggin into through SSH. That will also create a entry there and without any IP address.
The second Entry normally comes into picture when you log into a Machine and open up a terminal window in GUI. There will also be a entry even if you open a new Tab in the same terminal window.
Perhaps your IP address resolves to a blank string on one of your DNS servers, probably the secondary if it happens only 10 per cent of the time (or just possibly a hosts file if these are distributed from a central repository). That would account for the missing (or white space) entry and be consistent with Soham's reading of the source.
The First entry with tty* comes when you login through the terminal or console by pressing CTRL+ALT+F1-6. Its pretty much clear from the terminal it's using.
I am pretty much sure that your case comes under in any of the 2 cases, one with the terminal Window in GUI and the other with the screen session.
