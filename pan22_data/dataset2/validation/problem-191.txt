We finally resolved it by swapping around different negotiation methods between auto, 10/half and full, and 100/half and full, for each of our locations, until either auto or 100/full “stuck.” You may also want to ask your provider to temporarily remove the 13Mbps cap, to see if it’s an issue with their bandwidth limiting.
AT&T blamed it on the switches they used (also Cisco), but wouldn’t swap them for alternative models. We stopped caring as long as we stopped getting errors and 100/full worked (either by hard coding or auto negotiation).
To this day, we still have some offices auto and some 100/full, just because it worked and we don’t want to break it.
Do the interfaces on your router show any errors? We use Cisco and we would see CRC or input errors, depending on the interface.
I had a similar problem with filling the ethernet buffers on a Cisco 857 by maxing out the connections on the switchports.  
The spec claims that it can shift 140Mbit, or 30k Packets per second.  So might not be that, but perhaps a beefier router could cope with the traffic?
Just an idea.. But what's the speed of the fibre?  Can the backplane of the router actually shift packets at that speed?
