Any ideas about how to get into the drive outside of windows? I have seen virus protectors that will boot there own OS to fix a virus so I assume some software must be available that will do the same to recover data.
Ok , it took a while but I have now tested a new adaptor and also tried the hard drive on 2 windows 7 PCs and a widows XP. The result is the non windows TV runs the disk (in read only mode) and on all windows systems it will install the drivers sucsessfully but after that the drive is not visable/accessable. Divice manager will find it but not access it, and disk manager will not see it at all. My conclussion is the MBR is broken or missing.
I can connect and read the harddrive on my smart TV from Philips, but cant recover the files from there. Any ideas how I can copy the data that I need off of this drive? Is there a third party tool available that I can use?
I am recieving a message that the drive is not initialized. When I go into Computer Management I can see the drive (as "Disk 2, Unknown, Not Initialized"), but when I attempt to initialize it or right-click and select "Offline" It tells me that "the device is not ready".
I have an old Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 hard drive that I am attempting to connect to a Windows 7 machine by using a USB 2.0 to IDE/SATA Adapter.(it was previously connected to an internal IDE connection untill it disapeared from the disc manager) I'm connecting things in the right order (ide, power, then usb) and the jumper settings on the drive are neutral.
