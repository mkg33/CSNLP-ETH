I personally prefer to do things as is the English way answered, but in the interest of fairness and such I feel obligated to share that I pestered Paul Vixie (as high an authority on the matter as I could think of) about this. His response was that this belongs in root's personal crontab.
TL:DR; What is the intended use of the various cron locations? And where should the schedule for a utility that needs to run without human interaction go?
With all of them being functionally equal, what is the most correct place for a utility to place its crontab?
In an amazing display of pedantry, a coworker and I have been arguing for literal days over the intended use of the various places for a crontab to live.
At the heart of the matter is a backup script we use to push archives to our customers of their data. Some want that weekly and others want it exactly on certain day of every month - so our current crontab is pretty lengthy. The utility itself is nothing exotic, just a little node script that gets triggered periodically with different sets of customer-ids passed to it.
