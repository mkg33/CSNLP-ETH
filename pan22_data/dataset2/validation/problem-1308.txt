So, make sure that you have a account exists with 'mysql_user'@'10.4.0.211' and then try to connect from other IP than 10.4.0.211
From the documentation, I understand it like, the server accepts connections only from the IP - 10.4.0.211.
None of the above  has the bind address in them, but how come I am able to connect to the service. Please clarify.
The server listens and accepts connections only on (not "from") the stated address.  Where you can connect from is determined by the entries in the `mysql`.`user` table, which are created by GRANT statements, and, of course, whether you have network connectivity to the address where MySQL is listening.
Otherwise, you can report this issue to http://bugs.mysql.com/ mention specific MySQL version and OS details where your server is running
If you intend to bind the server to a specific address, be sure that the mysql.user grant table contains an account with administrative privileges that you can use connect to that address. Otherwise, you will not be able to shut down the server. For example, if you bind to 0.0.0.0, you can connect to the server using all existing accounts. But if you bind to 127.0.0.1, the server accepts connections only on that address. In this case, first make sure that the 'root'@'127.0.0.1' account is present in the mysql.user table so that you can still connect to the server to shut it down.
