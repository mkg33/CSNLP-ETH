That would total $34,512 vs $99. Not to mention the price of the hardware required to run 3TB of RAM.
Of course, current operating system may not support this at all, but is there any reason RAM isn't used this way?
It actually is done in some scenarios. If you have an operating system/app stack small enough, you can run it entirely in RAM. Of course it has all the disadvantages that the accepted answer has. But it is possible and does happen.
NRAM is basically "mechanical"  switches that are a few atoms wide, It doesn't need current to maintain state so it is energy efficient and doesn't need to be cooled down and because the switches are so small the density is very high and this is good for two reasons, one is the access to memory is very fast and you'll be able to have terabytes of data on small devices like cellphone. if you like to read more see this: http://www.nantero.com/mission.html and this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano-RAM
Yes this is the premise of many in-memory databases that are coming up on the market. One example is SAP HANA. The idea is that RAM is cheap and from a performance point of view read / write operations on RAM are 1000x faster than disk operations. So most of the data is kept in the RAM and then you define a data ageing strategy using which the old data is recycled back to cold storage (i.e. disk).
RAM is cheap, and much faster than SSDs. It's just volatile. So why don't computers have a LOT of RAM, and on power up, load everything to the RAM from the hard drive/SSD and just run everything from there, assuming there's no real need to persist anything outside of memory? Wouldn't computers be much faster?
Take a look at Puppy Linux, a popular Linux distribution. Their how it works page talks about running from RAM: http://puppylinux.org/wikka/howPuppyWorks
