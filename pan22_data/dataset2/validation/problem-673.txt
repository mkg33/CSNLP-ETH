Because routers don’t work with MAC addresses (layer 2 of the OSI model), they work with IP addresses (layer 3). The router knows which IP address the packet is for, and so it forwards the packet to the switch, which looks for the IP address in its ARP table to find the corresponding MAC address and then send out the frame on the appropriate interface/port.
Only the WAN-facing interface (ETH1 in this case) would have an (external/public) IP address assigned by the ISP. The other interfaces would have a manually configured (internal/private) IP address (in this particular case).
No, facebook.com would see a request from your external IP address (the one on the ETH1 interface). Since private IP addresses are not routable on the public Internet, the private IP address of the PC (192.168.1.x) is “translated” to the public/external IP address through a process known as Network Address Translation (NAT). The router keeps track of these translations in a so-called NAT table, so it knows where the request came from, and where to send the reply from the server.
