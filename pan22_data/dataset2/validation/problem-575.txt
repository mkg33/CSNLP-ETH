Which is quite a barrier to entry especially for Internet Explorer users as the process to import a root certificate can be long and confusing for non technical people.
This works great with one exception: when a user first connects to our WiFi, we have to ask them to install our CA root certificate to be able to MITM their HTTPS traffic to filter out bad content or they get a message like this when trying to go to any site over HTTPS:
We also have a number of on-site machines that need the root certificate, but we can roll it out to those with an Active Directory GPO so that's not a problem.
Am I missing something? Is there another approach to solving this problem that is easier for the end-user / doesn't require them to do anything?
Currently we're running an instance of Untangle with the Web Filter, HTTPS Inspector and Captive Portal add-ons.
This problem also affects our captive portal, as we need to redirect users to the captive portal to log in - which is impossible over HTTPS without MITM the request / response.
