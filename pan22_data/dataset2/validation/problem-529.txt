If I could get something in the $50/60 range that would be great, I've seen a bunch but I don't know if they're good quality even if the specs seem okay. If spending a little more would be advisable that's alright too. Thanks for any advice!
In fact, what outputs does your GeForce 6500 have? And does the monitor also have speakers? (i.e. will it need the audio component of the HDMI connector?) And what monitor is it?
I was looking at this one earlier today, again though, I don't really know much about them to know if it's any good. It just seemed to have decent reviews: http://www.ebay.com/itm/DIAMOND-AMD-Radeon-HD-6670-PCIE-2GB-GDDR3-Video-Graphics-Card-/321070374078?pt=PCC_Video_TV_Cards&hash=item4ac1491cbe
Any graphics card that supports PCIE 1.0 will do the job. You should be able to find something for $30 range or less really.
I'm not looking for anything fancy, just something that allows me to watch videos on my new screen how they're meant to be viewed. I won't be doing any serious 3D gaming etc.
So I'm in the process of trying to choose a new graphics card. I'm getting a new monitor that has HDMI input and I'd like my computer to be able to get the most out of it.
