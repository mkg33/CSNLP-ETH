Note that the "power surge" was most likely on the network cable, not through the power lines.  If you have a cable modem the point of entry would have been the cable connection.  The place to install surge protection is on the cable before it reaches the modem.
It's doubtful that the the damage would "spread", save for the possibility that the adapter may have been damaged somehow by the surge.
In my case, though, it wasn't an external event; at least, I don't think.  Whatever caused the caps (all of 'em) on the sound card to pop just ranged through everything it could get to electrically.  
I'm pretty sure that it will not. A similar thing happened to me but both the card and the slot were dead. The rest of the system worked until it was replaced some years later.
As always, each case is a little different.  I once had a sound card that bricked itself; in the process of it expiring, every other item on the PCI bus lost its magic smoke, too.  A couple of other PCI cards, as well as the on-board devices that were part of the bus.  CPU and RAM survived, the drives themselves survived, but the MoBo was a total write-off.
