Leave him be, you have no control. He will soon enough be listed in RBL, after that no email would be accepted from remote server when your client will email, your client might change his view then
You can ask their admin if they have SPF record, has the response back can be an answer, but not from a email sent by them if SPF record are not set.
PS: I'm not the network administrator of this company (who thinks just like the customer!) just the website and email service provider.
I have an important (+10 outlook accounts) but very ignorant client who refuses to accept that there is malware on the company's computers. Malware that steals Outlook data to send and receive spam. The situation went on a limit, due to the stubbornness of the client and with that I decided to raise the anti-spam filter. That started to make the customer more satisfied because he no longer receives return messages associated with the malware (lots of Chinese messages). It is not a sustainable situation because normal messages are being filtered.
