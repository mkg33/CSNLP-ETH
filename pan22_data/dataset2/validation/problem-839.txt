My version of scvmm does not list "Legacy Adapter" as  a network cary type, however, so I can't get it to work without sideloading a driver after install.

I discourage anyone using hyper-v modules from mainline kernel in older kernels. The notable exception are the MS-provided ones for RHEL and SLES which are backports of later versions and work quite well.
I've been able to have some moderate success with network drivers, but only when the vm was created on a hyperv console, not scvmm.  In HyperV, selecting "Legacy Adapter" for network adapter type works.. I was able to get tcp connectivity to my vm.  I did not stress the connectivity, or test it's stability, but it worked out of the box.  I found a link on the web that gave me this method (currently uncited, but I'm sure you can find it..)
In order to get Hyper-V modules install on fresh Debian 6 in Hyper-V you need to compile your own kernel. This is how i did it
Just as reminder: I have been playing with the Hyper-V modules for linux starting 2.6.33 and had freakingly bad results with hv module back these days. If you are using a mainline kernel, you get better results starting 2.6.39 where lots of changes whent in to get them quite stable.
