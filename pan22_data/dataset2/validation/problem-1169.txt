Not a recommended way to fix it naturally! if you can find another way to recover the data then go with that as you might make it worse, but if you get desperate, take the drive out & hit it against something and give it a try again.  (if all else fails it might just make you feel a bit better!)
That seems to be not an uncommon problem with WD drives. About half of my drives I had from WD exhibited that problem sooner or later. As long as you get it running again (might take hours) you probably can get your data off of it again, depending how long it survives before going into that click-click routine again.
Before you try the freezer thing (and yes, it sometimes works. I successfully used this trick once myself before), try changing the drive's power source. Sometimes an underpowered drive trows up the click symptoms as well.
I once had a HDD fail in a similar way (clicking noise) that I recovered by giving the drive a good whack on the side, as if something had got stuck.  
But for all practical purposes the drive is dead. The only thing you could hope for would be that you still have warranty on it.
If possible, use a different power supply. You do not have to swap out the current PSU, just attach the failing drive to a second PSU. If that is not an option, try using a different connector from your current PSU that might be on a different 12V rail.
