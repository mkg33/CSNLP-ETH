If you update Ff and decide to run it as if it is an older version, then it will have some unxepected behaviour. You can disable automatic updates, keep using the older version and whenever it is you feel like upgrading, do so. Once you have upgraded Ff it needs to be restarted.
Currently, when choosing between updating at Firefox's schedule or not updating at all, I choose the latter. Obviously, this is not optimal in terms of features or even plain security...
Unfortunately at some point this behavior changed. Now after update Firefox refuses to open new pages, is informing that it was updated and should be restarted, while promising to make the restart painless (which is a lie: text I wrote in text fields is gone, page scrolling is forgotten, youtube videos don't remember where I was, etc), and then at some point actually closes without asking.
Previously (at most 1 year ago) updating Firefox was easy. Firefox was automatically or manually updated from the official repository and I could still use my currently running Firefox instance. I would get that new installed version of Firefox only after I manually chose to restart old-Firefox.
This "we are forcing you to restart your software when we want and not when it's convenient for you" approach is very Microsoftish. I hate it!
