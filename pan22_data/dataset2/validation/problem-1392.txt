Left button is number 1, right button is number 3. Using xmodmap you can swap mouse buttons like this:
However, I wasn't able to get this to work under Win7 last time I tried, so when my new work PC arrives I shall probably buy a Microsoft mouse to go with it.
My Penguin Ambidextrous Vertical mouse works very well in remote sessions. Also, I only need a single mouse. If I want to switch from left to right or vice versa, I just click a toggle switch. The built in track point and track pad in my Lenovo x230 does not carry my settings over to a remote session. This drives me nuts when working in a remote session on the road. 
Beware that I haven't tried it myself and it's expensive compared to a normal mouse. I wonder if modifying a normal mouse is worth the saving.
Microsoft Intellipoint mouse drivers handle the swap buttons feature in a different way to the standard mouse drivers, and remote desktop works correctly: A left-click on the physically-connected mouse is sent to the remote machine as a right-click. And when connecting to the machine from elsewhere, Intellipoint does not swap buttons.
One gotcha: You have to turn the standard "swap buttons" function off before installing Intellipoint. Otherwise when you remote desktop to that PC from elsewhere, the buttons get swapped.
X-Mouse Button Control does its changes by intercepting clicks, so they carry downstream to any Remote Desktop session. But I don't think it has per-mouse settings.
A hardware alternative may be a gaming mouse. I have found this SteelSeries mouse that claims to be ambidextrous and driverless. I guess you can swap left/right buttons by clicking another button.
My work PC has two Dell mice, and is running XP. Fortunately the mice have different hardware IDs, so I've modified an .inf file in the Intellipoint driver's installer, and convinced it that one of the mice was made by Microsoft.
However, the Intellipoint software does not swap the buttons over on a non-Intellipoint mouse. So, my home workstation has an Intellipoint mouse to the left of the keyboard, and the supplied Dell mouse to the right of the keyboard. Works a treat, for both left- and right-handed users.
In an X Window System, you can use  xmodmap (utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in X).
