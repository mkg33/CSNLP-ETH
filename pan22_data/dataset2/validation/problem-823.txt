Is there anything better than VNC server for OS X? Also I need something that has a client (viewer) for Windows machines. 
The reason VNC is so slow is because it does little more than stream a screencast of your desktop and forward mouse and keyboard commands. RDP and NX both send instructions on how to render the display (kinda like SVG vs. JPG--JPG is, in fact the format that VNC uses to send the screenshots). I think TeamViewer does the same process, though I don't know for sure.
The only drawback is that on free licenses it limits your connection time if you use it too much. I don't have this problem because we have a premium license. You can use it on cross platforms (with feature limitations of course).
An old SuperUser thread pointed  me towards the $80 iRapp, which seems to work rather well but is rather expensive (well, not by Mac users' standards, but...). It's an RDP server for Mac OS.
I love Logmein for this as I have access anywhere and I don't need to worry about forwarding ports.  Might seem like a bit much if you are only accessing it over a LAN, but still usable.
VNC just feels sluggish and inefficient, and occasionally has display glitches. On windows, I can use Remote Desktop (RDP / MSTSC), and on Linux I can use NX Server, both of which are much better performing than VNC.
