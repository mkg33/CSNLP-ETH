A common cause for this is a hung "sudo" process. If you run sudo and it prompts for your password, but you close the terminal, sudo will hang forever waiting for the password, and this blocks any other logins until you kill it.
After installing MySQL 5.1.50 64-bit and running the package that configures MyQL to run at startup, the Terminal app now sporadically display a blank window, like so:
Try running jobs at the Terminal to see if that shell has any child processes in the background.  If there is something super heavy running in the background maybe it is causing the shell to become unresponsive?
I opened the Activity Monitor and selected to show all processes. I noticed root was running several (> 10) login processes, few sh processes and a sudo process. I force-quitted them all, though some login processes didn't quitâ€”probably the sudo kept them hanging. After this, Terminal worked normally and the excessive login processes I couldn't kill quitted.
I managed to get the command prompt back after following the instructions from the MacFixIt column at CNET : OS X Terminal displays a blank window instead of a command prompt
I just had the exact same problem, though it occurred after installing Git (or at least that is when I noticed the issue).
I think the trick is to look for login and shell related processes which could hang new ones. Probably, in my case, killing the sudo would've been sufficient enough.
However, the Terminal will intermittently go blank and I have to repeat the process again and it's driving me nuts. The CNET article cures the symtoms but the cause of this problem is still unknown. Does anyone has any theories or experiences to share in order to fix this annoying problem permanently?
In my case, somehow git diff head had got put in the background in one of my shells, so git and less appeared under a shell in which I thought there was just a bash process. When I did fg it fixed the problem. If most of your windows/tabs are just "login -> bash" then it should be easy to spot.
