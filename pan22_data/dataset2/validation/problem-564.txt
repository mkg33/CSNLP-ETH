3) Nod32 v4 Anti-Virus on Windows 7 slowed down all my MySQL ODBC queries! It was fine on Vista and XP. I uninstalled Nod32 and the apps that use MySQL are fast again!
As others have stated, there are lots of kinds of slow-down, so you may need to be more specific. But I have three guesses:
I wouldn't expect it to be slower.  Could you have anything else in play like a database or web service call?  I would recommend testing a simple static page with a for loop (i.e. 1M iterations)  Compare the time.  Then start to bring more of your site back into the picture to see what is causing the differences.  IIS7 should perform as well or better in virtually very case.  Any chance you've moved to 64-bit?  
As others have indicated, if correctly configured, Win7 on the same computer is unlikely to be noticeably slower. On a faster computer, there ought to be improved performance.
How much slower are you talking about? It should be expected for your site to run a little slower, since you are running a newer operating system. XP was extremely stable and streamlined, while Windows 7 is just out and most likely unstable and slower. Of course if there is a significant slowdown something else is wrong.
1) There is one very common kind of web app slow-down that users going from XP to 7 will experience. Windows 7 (and Windows Vista) install IPv6 by default. Firefox and Chrome each operate very slowly over IPv6 in certain situations on Windows. If you are experiencing slowdown with Firefox (pages take forever to load, and images pop in really slowly), but not with IE, look into disabling Firefox's IPv6 support. This sped up my web apps in Firefox GREATLY!
2) I noticed that when I moved from XP to Windows 7 that my web applications started taking a LONG time to start (as long as 20 seconds, while those same web apps started in 4 or fewer seconds on the same hardware with Windows XP x64 and IIS 6)! They were very responsive after startup, however. There could be a million reasons for this, and I never figured it out. I still have the problem. But, I worked around it by using Visual Studio 2008's built-in web server, Cassini. Now I use Cassini to develop and only use IIS when I have to.
W7 uses much more resources than XP. Running a local web server requires more power one should think, since You got several apps playing ping pong while sharing the same resources.
