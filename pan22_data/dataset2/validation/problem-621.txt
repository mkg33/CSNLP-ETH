I've been seeing a lot of junk in /var/log/messages on one of my servers, lately. There don't appear to be any associated I/O errors and the server is still performing its intended tasks without any appearance of a problem, but I was wondering if this is indicative of some kind of other failure that I could be concerned about.
Try to track down where that stuff is coming from.  If it's being logged by something (and thus has the normal header that syslog adds), well, maybe that program has a problem.  If on the other hand syslog is writing that stuff out instead of what you expect, I'd get worried.  Any errors in dmesg?  Segfaults?  Have you done a memtest recently?
Is this all that's getting into syslog, or is it scattered among "normal" entries? I'd try shutting down the log daemon, move the syslog file, start it up again and see if it persists. If so, schedule a fsck and restart.
Check if your partitions overlap, then run fsck on your /var or /var/log filesystem (you do have a /var and/or /var/log filesystem, don't you?)
