Controlling territory, killing turrets, killing players, etc. Some or all of these could generate differing numbers of victory points. Collect enough victory points, and you win.
Points that are further from the center get captured faster. The final point is captured in 2 or so seconds, compared to the 30 it takes to get the middle one. Consider something similar! Towers have more health if you control more of the map, meaning that having more map control makes defending a little easier, and speeding up the game once one team has obviously been put in a losing spot.
I offer Team Fortress 2's design choice for the analogous mode, capture point; there are 5 points on a symmetrical map, with 1 in the middle. Each team starts controlling the two closer to their base, with the middle one neutral. You capture points by standing on them without enemies standing there. The points are in a line, it's a tug-of-war kind of deal, and you can only capture the enemy's point closest to you.
A quite typical solution for "control" maps is this: game win condition is achieving a certain amount of points, with points being received regularly based on the number of towers/amount of territory under control. Optionally, if you make the relation between towers controlled and points gained non-linear, you can tweak the unpredictability of the end result as you see fit.
Your spawn points move up as you capture points to ensure the team with advantage can actually reach the fight in a timely manner, but the losing team always spawns closer to the main "conflict zone". The final capture point is right next to their spawn. How is this gamestate resolved?
You could allow players on the winning side to respawn in regions close to the remaining towers to be captured. This would allow the winning side to also enjoy the benefit of having all of its players spawn in close to the action and would eliminate the frustration of having to trek across the map, unable to do anything important, between respawns.
This prevents any imbalance-ing that your suggestions might have. It also makes it so that the defenders don't crowd around a single objective to fortify, they have to split up. That gives the attackers the chance to form strategy, i.e. if each team has 10 tanks the defenders will need to split up 5-5 on the last two remaining sectors, so the attacking team can see this and split 7-3 on some. When that tower is destroyed, the defenders don't instantly spawn on the other objective to defend it, the attackers can make a push there while the defenders are en-route to defend.
That system is more like Battlefield 1's multiplayer mode Rush, which is probably a good indication of it being a good system; if a major publisher uses it in a game that is very critically acclaimed, chances are it's at least usable. The only difference is in Rush there is 1 attacking team and 1 defending team, and the attackers have a limited number of lives to destroy all objectives. That provides a time limit without actually having a temporal time limit, which I usually don't like, but may be necessary to stop a game.
You could designate the top left/bottom right corners as spawn zones, with no towers. That way, tanks that re-spawn need to travel towards towers to defend, giving the other team an opportunity to get some shots in on the tower before the defenders reach them.
If a simple "point" game is too boring for you, you can make those points a sort of a currency, rather than the win condition. Make it so you can activate a powerful (but temporary and one-shot) power-up or ability for a certain amount of points. Then, on the one hand, the weaker side still generally enjoys numerical superiority to make it easier to push back and return in the game. On the other hand, the winning team can get the momentum required to finish off tightly respawning enemies.
Additionally, or alternately you could make it so there is a no man's land between the guaranteed spawning locations and the spawning locations you earn by securing objectives.
You could award points only for team kills (or devise other methods not related to tower destruction, like killing the last enemy inside of a square to 'clear the zone' or something), to give the game a multi-faceted approach for winning. Players will have to devise strategy. It won't make players too cautious, either, because they'll need points to win if they don't capture all the objectives!
