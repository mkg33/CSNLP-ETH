The 3rd party agents will often have "brick level" backups and restores which allow you to restore parts of a database (tables, etc.) rather than only the entire database.  They also do not require you to stage the output (doubling your disk requirement) by backing up the database directly.
Although SQL 2008 has it built-in, SQL 2005 and below benefit from many third-party backup compression capabilities.
I am currently looking for some new backup software and have noticed that a number of the products out there charge a lot for the SQL server agents i.e. around Â£500. Could anyone tell me why these addins cost so much when SQL server has built-in backup. Would you advise against using the MS SQL server backup functionality and then backing up the output, if so why?
Some third party products, such as Quest's LiteSpeed and RedGate's SQLBackup, will also provide you additional data level compression and encryption options unavailable through SQL Server's native backup mechanism.  This is much favorable to options at the NTFS level.
I can't say that I would advise against using MS SQL backup functionality because it works well and is obviously free (included in SQL Server), but if you're looking for more bells and whistles, or looking for a more integrated recovery solution, then the third-party tools are the way to go.
