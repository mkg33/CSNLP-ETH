There are a lot of tricks which can be sold as a service. For example, there could be a transparent proxy gateway between you and a server farm with a really good network bandwidth. Some tricky coding-recoding of the communication (for example, forcing caching/compression, or caching parts of html pages) were also possible.
In the dial-up and Windows 98-days, I used some software that preemptively followed every link in the background for every page I opened in a web-browser.  The results were stored in the browser's local cache, like any other page I had previously visited.  It was still a look-ahead caching proxy of sorts, but it worked on my computer without the need of a separate accelerator proxy, and it worked really well for surfing web-pages.  It made dial-up feel instantaneous; however, long downloads (audio and video) still took normal speeds, because they were simply too big to preemptively download and cache.  And, it could not help AJAX and other dynamic pages.  It eventually failed, because they could not keep up with browser development, and they slipped over the event horizon like most every other dot-bomb company.
99% of all "Speed up/Tweak your PC" are fake or do nothing but the very basics that every good SysOp will do anyways. There are however some tweaks for unusual system settings which in fact might result in a speed advantage.
For example Windows isn't really prepared for 100 mb/s DSL connections and is noticeably slow (like ~80 mb/s only) unless you tweak the Registry properly. In this case a tweaking tool might save you some hassle, but usually appropriate tools are freely available either directly from Microsoft or from third parties.
If someone re-invented that wheel, they could make a lot of web-surfing feel faster, although you can never exceed the ISP-provided bandwidth, and AJAX pages would be a hairy thing to try to accelerate (i.e., look-ahead cache).
The main problem with these solutions, that these goodstanding people before me simply don't understand, how they could work.
One example would be, you send a request to a server with a fast connection to download the content you want and relay it to you in a low bandwidth friendly way. Essentially zipping the internet.
