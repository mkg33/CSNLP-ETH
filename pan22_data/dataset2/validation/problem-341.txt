Personally, I'd use a Linux-based router with a recent Shorewall firewall package (you do want some security, right?), that can certainly do it.  In fact, I just did that using a used server, with Ubuntu 9.10 and the latest Shorewall.  OpenWRT should let you do it pretty inexpensively.
Basically, it would be setup so that whenever someone does a ping from the internet to ..*.1 it would come through the router and be routed to our computer 192.168.1.3. And also for all outgoing traffic from 192.168.1.3 it is marked as going out from ..*.1 
say we have 3 computers 192.168.1.2-5 well we want for 192.168.1.3 to have the static public IP of ..*.1 where our gateway has *.6. 
In PFsense, you can set up "Virtual IPs" on the WAN interface - these can be natted through to the lan via 1:1 NAT or 1:N NAT, depending on what your needs are.
That feature is normally called "1 to 1 NAT".  Look for that in the documentation of whatever routers you consider.  Domestic routers don't normally have that feature, but any open-source or corporate grade router should be able to do it; all the BSDs and Linux have that feature in their kernels.
we have a 5 public IP addresses. What we basically want to do is have a router(one single router) that will translate a static private IP so that it uses a static public IP(as in, NOT the gateway public IP) 
As Kyle said, yes, this is possible depending on what you're using for your router. Since you didn't mention a specific model/technology, I'll assume you haven't chosen a router yet. In that case, I'll recommend Pfsense. It can run on a spare PC you have sitting around or altertatively, one of several low-voltage embedded platforms. PFSense is based on FreeBSD, and as such is free (beer) and free (speech).
