You're connecting to the SQL 2012 instance.  Your 2005 instance probably has a different instance name.  You can tell what it is if you don't remember by looking in Services and seeing what SQL instances are named there (2012 is the default, or MSSQLSERVER).  When you find the name (for example, if it's 2005), ask SSMS to connect to .\2005 instead of what you're using.
Management Studio is just a client. It connects to database servers. It is not the database itself. It is possible to install, operate, and maintain Sql Server without ever installing or using Management Studio.
What you see when selecting @@version is the version of the database server. It has nothing to do with the version of Management Studio you are using.
There is never a reason to need an older version of Management Studio, though you may sometimes have applications that only work with older versions of Sql Server. In many (but not all) cases, these applications can be appeased by setting the Compatibility Level of the database.
