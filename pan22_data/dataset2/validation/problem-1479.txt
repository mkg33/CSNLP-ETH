I had originally planned for the swap space to just be three separate partitions (one per drive, let the kernel do the striping), but then I had read that having the swap as a second RAID1 can be better for the kernel when losing a drive (and as a bonus, the 12.04 example preseed covers this exact scenario).
Unfortunately, documentation on the partman preseed options seems a little hazy. Is there an obvious mistake in the above configuration? Thanks for any help.
At various points in my fiddling, I had it running all the way through successfully, except that the swap partitions were 1TB in size (way too big). At other times, it would work successfully except with no swap partitions created at all. With the current iteration (above), it runs, but gives errors about partitions being in use, or being otherwise unable to proceed. I have tried using dd to zero out the first 512 bytes of each drive, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.
I have three 2TB drives in the machine; I want a RAID5 of ~4TB capacity, and 100GB or so of swap space. No LVM, no encryption, no fanciness. This is easy to do using the interactive installer, but I'm hoping to basically preseed this whole setup.
