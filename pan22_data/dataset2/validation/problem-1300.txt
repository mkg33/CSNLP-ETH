Are they saying that they want to give you an additional port on their switch, and then you buy a switch, and connect two ISP ports on your switch, and 1 port to your sonic firewall?  Depending on what actually happened, that wouldn't actually really add a lot of redundancy to the system - I'm not sure what problem they're trying to solve.
We were in contact with the ISP for well over 2 months and were consistently requesting further information regarding adding two switches to our rack to handle HSRP.
If you do not feel like buying and installing another switch, you can simply create a VLAN with 3 ports on your existing (extreme) switch. No need for shipping and mounting: you can do it remotely and simply have them repatch the cables.
By doing this they shift the redundancy (and thereby the single point of failure) a bit further towards you. You get two ethernet cables to the outside, automatically picking one that is not down. Makes sense.
As expected, after some due diligence on their part, our ISP confirmed that they had a switch between their router and our firewall that provided HSRP and that at the time of the outage was misconfigured.
If they want to provide you a redundant link, that would mean two Ethernets going to you. Anything they provided before that would be a single point of failure. If you need to run those two links to a single firewall that only has one 'outside' port, you'd need a switch to hook it all up.
The single point of failure will now become this new switch and your firewall. Duplicating those would allow you to be even better redundant.
