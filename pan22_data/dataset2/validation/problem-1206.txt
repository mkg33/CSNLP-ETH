I found it quite convenient to installed different version in separate locations and just symlink to the version you want to use, like:
this will slightly standardize your setups and ease deployment on many servers. also you'll not need gcc on production machines [ which many will consider as security benefit ].
If you're going to be installing this on a single machine, then doing it from source every time is problem the best way. If you are going to be installing this on several machines and you want to make sure it's consistent, it's probably worth learning how to make Debian packages. You could probably use the packaging in Ubuntu as a base.
There isn't a great way. The reason that effective package management was created was to solve this very problem. Upgrading and uninstalling source-compiled things is hard. 
Of course you still have to re-apply any configuration changes you've done to the previous version, but for that you can use some versioning system (RCS/SVN/GIT) or configuration management tool like Bcfg2.
i'm afraid this is the only way. if you have more servers to maintain - consider having separate test environment where you compile and possibly package result of your compilation. 
If this is a one-off case, then re-compiling from source is probably your best bet. If it's on an array of machines, it's definitely time to move to the supported package management.
