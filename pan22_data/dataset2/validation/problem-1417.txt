If you want to host a server online, you may need to contact your ISP and ask what plans they have available for people who want to host a server. They likely have a business tier of plans that do not have the port blocking.
Often an ISP will offer a separate plan for people who intend on running a web server. They may enforce this by blocking common web hosting ports like port 80, and use traffic monitoring to look for "suspicious" traffic. The reasoning for this is that they don't want to risk someone using a lower tier connection with less bandwidth hosting a server that ends up getting lots of hits and clogging the pipe, so to speak. Often home internet plans will also be more configured for high download rates but very slow upload rates. For people connecting to your server, they likely will suffer a very slow connection rate. Usually this will be spelled out in your Acceptable Use Policy when you sign up for the service.
To be absolutely sure, you should connect your workstation directly to the modem provided by the your ISP, bypassing the router and running the test again. If you're on a residential plan, I wouldn't be surprised that the ISP is blocking the ports. However, if connecting your workstation directly does work, that would mean your router is not doing port forwarding properly.
