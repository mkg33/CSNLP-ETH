In GIMP: Filters -> Map -> Tile. If you change the unit to "%" and then enter 300% x 300% for the dimensions, you'll get a 3x3 tiling of your image, which lets you see all four edges easily. After doing it once you can use Ctrl-F (repeat last filter) to re-do the tiling after making modifications, as long as you don't use any other filters of course.
Using photoshop or GIMP, you can use the offset command. If you are working for say a 100x100px image, you can offset it 50px in each direction, and the seam where the image tiles together will be displayed in the middle of the image.
Krita has a feature that allows you to edit tiling textures and see the changes update live. By pressing the W key, it enables wrap around mode, which makes this possible. A youtube video of this feature in action is available here. (feature is enabled at 0:12)
If you want to test multiple images, it may help to have an mini webapp based on Anko's answer. This will let you drag images onto the page to let you test them in quick succession:
