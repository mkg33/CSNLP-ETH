The virtualhosts in Apache are a separate concept from the etc/hosts file. The etc/hosts file is just a method of local DNS resolution. Virtualhosts are a configuration option where Apache will give a different page depending on what the requested URL is. This requires some DNS magic, since the end user needs to be able to resolve the host names. Multiple IPs or ports are two other options.
My server isn't currently open to the internet yet, but if it is, what's the best way to resolve DNS for my virtualhost domains if it were to become forward-facing (i.e open to the internet)?
I don't think it can be put elsewhere for use with Apache, simply for virtual hosts, and the main HOSTS file for blocking sites etc.
I heard about PAC files on Uniform Server's website (http://wiki.uniformserver.com/index.php/Virtual_Hosting:_PAC) but they're browser-specific though, aren't they?
I'm competent at the basics of Apache, PHP and virtual hosting but have a question about virtual hosting.
In DNS, you'd just add an entry for a different domain, pointing at the same IP. For example, www.site1.com and www.site2.com would both point to 172.32.4.6
