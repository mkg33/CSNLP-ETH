But where does this path come from? This is the reason so much contradictory advice occurs: You must use the path shown in the Explorer window title bar after a successful connection. This will vary depending on dozens of imponderables.
This is a pure example of Microsoft's famous "FUD" technique. They want people who connect to Apache servers to experience "Fear Uncertainty and Doubt."
The fix for this is a bit involved and a great deal of contradictory advice exists on the web. The first step is generally agreed:
The AuthDigestDomain directive should list all the locations protected by the "davusers" realm in the davusers.digest file. It tells the client browser to let users access the other locations if they have provided authentication for one of them.
In the example above, we created an exception on the local "intranet" (LAN), but you can do the same thing for remote servers if you feel daring.
In your case, the server name in the tile bar may be shown as an IP address, or perhaps without @SSL: Just enter what you see. Back out of the configuration windows and the nagging will stop.
Both of these support mounting a WebDAV server. But I'd recommend to test them first; the Rclone devs say their mount option is experimental, and in my experience Mountain Duck still has some bugs.
If you really hate the idea of dealing with SSL, you can turn this requirement off using a registry hack on the Windows client. Put the following lines in a plain text file "Install - Enable BasicWebdav.reg" 
When you are able to mount your WebDAV share, you will be assaulted by another annoyance. Every time you drag a file from the remote folder to a local folder, you will get a menacing warning:
Finally, and this is very important, WebDAV access from Windows will be insanely slow (as in glacial) if you don't make this adjustment:
Every version of windows has required a new set of hacks and patches to make WebDAV work. One might get the impression that Microsoft feels threatened by this technology or, perhaps more likely, only wants to see it work with their servers.
The answer by @user2152363 is very good. Just for completeness, here are two alternative solutions you could look into:
