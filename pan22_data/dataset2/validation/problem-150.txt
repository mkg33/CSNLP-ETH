Notebook is a more complete experience, formatting numberd lists and sublists is easier. As well as more eye candy, stickies and post-it flags, and animations.  Notebook also provides a service to clip from within any application and add it to your Notebook document.
I use it for all my note taking stuff, I find it fast and responsive. It also will intergrate nicely with a lot of other applications, such as Cyberduck which I use for FTP.
Maybe what you are looking for is a note keeper/organizer where the notes are easily searchable.   Something like Circus Ponies' Notebook or Voodoo Pad.  This way you don't have to save a new document each time you want to add a note, web link, image, or sound clip.  I leave VoodooPad Pro running all the time.
myTexts is an application that I've been meaning to try. If other applications are too complicated, this just might do the trick - it looks promising!
I'd recommend Smultron. As a plain text editor it's pretty good for replacing TextEdit. Offers a good replacement if you're not looking for anything fancy.
Once you get to know some of the features in TextMate, it definitely has some time savers! I used it for note taking all last year, and it worked like a charm.
Voodoo Pad Lite's price is right and provides most of the functionality of the regular version. VoodooPad has a higher geek factor, you can embed scripts in real languages (Python, Lua) and execute them from within Voodoo Pad.  The Pro version includes whole document encryption and a built it web server.
