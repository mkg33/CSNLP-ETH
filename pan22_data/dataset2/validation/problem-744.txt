Also note it's the GPU's capability, not the ports on the card, that ultimately decides how many displays you can use. Some cards may have 3 outputs, but you may find that you can only use 2 of them at a time.
I currently own a 27" iMac and 2 24" monitors. This configuration usually runs in a triple monitor config with the 2 monitors plugged into the iMac's 2 thunderbolt ports.
Better check the specs of the GPU on nvidia/amd's website to make sure how many displays are supported and the max resolution for each. 
My question is if I buy a new graphics card with 2 DVI ports and 1 display port, will it allow me to run the Ubuntu desktop with all 3 screens? If so, can anyone advise me where I can buy such a graphics card? I'm sure there are good places to buy such things cheaply. Right now I'm going through each card since I don't know a site that searches specs. To confirm, the purpose of the card is purely for the triple screen config, not for gaming, etc. so hopefully I don't need to buy a really recent card.
I have another desktop which runs Ubuntu and I want to hook it up to use all 3 monitors. The current graphics card on it is 9800GT which has 2 DVI ports and no display port so I'm able to connect the 2 smaller monitors but not the iMac. As I understand it, the iMac screen can only be used as an external monitor through a DisplayPort output.
Display port is sort of a multi-purpose port... you can use an adapter to convert it to a DVI port quite easily.  Keep in mind, as it's a mac, it's more likely that it's a mini-display port... not the full-sized port... but there are still adapters.  It should work fine as long as you get the correct adapter.  Alternatively, HDMI ports are becoming more common as a 3rd port on many video cards... which also have an adapter to convert to DVI.
