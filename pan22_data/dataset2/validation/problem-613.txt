After getting the correct repo enabled, use yum distro-sync to replace all the wrong versions of packages with correct versions of packages. You'll also need to remove some packages you got from SCL or other repos, such as those with names starting with php70-.
I'm tried to understand how it is setup, but I'm missing something, so I'll reproduce what I've and what I've got so far:
You've mixed a whole bunch of manually downloaded RPMs (some built for the wrong versions of PHP, Imagick or other things) and conflicting repositories. Stop now. Don't manually download RPMs.
When I'm trying to run this: sudo /usr/bin/pecl install imagick, it's giving me the following error:
So, I'm trying to install Imagick in order to be able to render/make an image off the first page of a PDF.
You've done well to use Remi's PHP repositories, but you've enabled his repo for PHP 5.6, while you say you want PHP 7.0. You need to disable the remi-php56 repo and enable the remi-php71 or remi-php72 repo (7.0 is EOL, don't use it).
