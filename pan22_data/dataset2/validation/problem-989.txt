The processes with negative values don't seem to have much in common, and it's strange that PDU DISPATCHER and IP SNMP would be using the most memory.
I've found an article suggesting you can subtract CISCO-PROCESS-MIB.cpmProcExtMemAllocatedRev and CISCO-PROCESS-MIB.cpmProcExtMemFreedRev (Cisco process memory usage) but that doesn't seem to result in sane values.
The output of show processes memory on a switch shows the same results that I see via SNMP (insane values if the allocated - freed logic is correct), but it also shows a Holding column that looks like it has what I need.
I wrote a script to snmpget all of the values to prevent timing issues, and sorted them by Allocated - Freed :
I think it might be down to shared memory and the original OIDs pre-dating modern memory management in IOS.
Often the values are the same (resulting in a zero) and sometimes the freed is greater than the allocated (resulting in a negative number)- though I think this is probably to do with memory being freed between when I pull the allocated results and when I pull the freed results.
I can't find any references to Holding in the CISCO-PROCESS-MIB and I've had no luck searching on the internet.
I can't find any other Cisco MIBs that contain better data, so I don't think there is a reliable way to get this information.
I've just spent a good half an hour looking at this, and I don't think there is a way to get an accurate number from SNMP.
This is the data available from the 3 tables in cpmProcess (there are many more OIDs, but they don't seem to be populated on the devices i was looking at)
