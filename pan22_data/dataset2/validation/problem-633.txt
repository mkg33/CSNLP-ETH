Modifying this setting requires the user to log out and back in before taking effect, but we find that the hardware profiles for tablets are automatically setting it to 150%, which causes issues with some legacy applications we use. We also have a few users that keep their scaling at 150% for visibility reasons. 
In Windows 7 and 10 (possibly in earlier versions as well), you can change how the DPI scaling for your desktop, essentially "magnifying" items on the screen. In Windows 7, this option can be found under Control Panel > Display like so:
I'm currently tasked with either A) finding a way to make this change more convenient for the user, or B) completely redesigning the way the applications handle scaling. For obvious reasons, I'd much rather do option A if it's available. If I can change the scaling programmatically for the app's purposes, then back without user intervention, that would be ideal as well. Unable, I've been unable to find out how this feature actually works, and/or why it requires a logout.
