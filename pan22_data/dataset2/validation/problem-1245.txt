Caveat: Technically, multiple home support was introduced in 8.1.5-- if you're using earlier versions, the answer changes a bit.  You can still generally do it, just not as simple.
That said, running two instances (other than dev/test) on one server isn't generally recommended. If they are small, you'd probably get better performance as separate schemas in one instance, and if they are big then go for separate servers. Also consider virtualization as an option.
I recently tried installing Oracle 11g on a server already running 10g. Each would run independently with no problem, but 10g refused to run simultaneously with 11g. Can this be done? I don't need a solution so much as confirmation that it is indeed possible.
It is certainly possible.  You do need to ensure that the different versions are installed in different Oracle Homes, but other than that, you can have as many versions of Oracle as you'd like.
You can always have multiple oracle accounts; the oracle account does not need to be named oracle.  For example, you can have an oracle10 and an oracle11 user.  This is more straightforward than a single 'oracle' user and multiple ORACLE_HOMEs.
Yes, you can have different versions of Oracle installed and running on the same server. I'd probably go with different listeners on different ports. And you wouldn't want two instances with the same name running. There's plenty of other areas you'd want to be sure they don't bump into each other (mostly disk locations).
