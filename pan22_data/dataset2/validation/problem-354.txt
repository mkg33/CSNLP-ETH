I'm not sure of the steps off hand, but have you tried creating a new folder toolbar? If you right click the Taskbar, and select Toolbars, by default there is one for the desktop (so you can activate that to see how it would work). I think that there is an option on that popup menu to create a new toolbar for an arbitrary folder. So, you could create a folder that contains all of the shortcuts to all of your games, and then you'd have access to those shortcuts from the taskbar.
A medium person has about 50-100 application installed.....each one should be reached in maximum 2 clicks, this can be done best by stacked links near start menu.
"Please note that as opposed to the original QuickLaunch toolbar, the LaunchBar toolbar window cannot be manually resized, only positioned. It will always just be one button wide/high and adjusted to the number of buttons present."
You can probably try building such a program yourself which will have a custom Jump List. You would then just right-click on the icon for that to work.
Indeed, both 7stacks and Jumplists are useless, you can do this with LINKS and custom toolbars. In order to have a configuration like:
Would certainly be possible that way but involves some coding. Altough the .NET APIs for the new taskbar are pretty nice.
