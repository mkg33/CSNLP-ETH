I think you could use time series modeling algorithm as @Student_T said. Also you can make window time to find relation between new donate and previous donate and you can use amount, may be people with high payment and low payment have different behavior. first of all you should change your data in a way that fill gaps. I mean you should add data about month that a person have not any payment. 
You can create several RFM types of features from this data set. Examples: Number of donations, time between donations, time since the most recent donation, time since the first donation, average donation amount, the amount of first donation, the most recent donation amount, etc. (I can provide more examples, if needed.)
You could group together data of each user and run the algorithm for the user that is being asked for.
Regression is the way to go if you want to know if a user will donate or not, to find the probability, try markov!
person_id / month(or day or week or 3month) / count of payment / count of payment last month/ sum of amount that paid last month/ Is paid last month?/
Also, you could detect patterns in the dataset by plotting it and then figure out which algorithm to use based on what is the degree of correlation and the nature of the plot.
In order to make this model generalizable, I'd recommend pulling several such cross-sections of your data (in addition to the October 2015 slice explained above,)
Since your task is to predict the probability of donation during a four-month timeframe (Mar-Jun 2016), you can create those features (leading indicators) for each donor as of the end of October 2015. All leading indicators would be created based off of timeframes prior to that cut-off point. Your observation window is from Nov-2015 to Feb-2016. This is where your event flag (dependent variable) should come from: 1 if a donor donated (again) during the observation window, and 0 otherwise. 
First you need to find in what kind of distribution is your data: linear, exponential, normal ... Etc. 
then you should find whether your filed is useful and independent or not. and try to add other filed. and then build your model.
