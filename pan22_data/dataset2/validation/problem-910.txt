The other solutions are quite good, but also remember that man pages are just data and you can easily do almost anything with them in Linux.
For instance, I need to know the meaning of the -o flag for mount. I run man mount and want to jump to the place where -o is described. Currently, I search /-o however that option is mentioned in several places before the section that actually describes it, so I must jump around quite a bit.
When reading a Unix manpage in the terminal, how can I jump easily to the description of a particular flag?
@piccobello's answer is great, but it was eating the colors in my man pages. Instead of piping to less (since man already uses less by default usually), I simply pass the modified less command to man:
converts the page into a plain text file you can then manipulate. I keep a copy of the bash manual as text in my bin directory so I can just load it into my text editor to search for things and copy and paste while I'm editing scripts. 
Although it wouldn't work for you in a terminal, I (with the help of a friend) even wrote a script that grabs a man page and displays it in a web browser so I can use its navigation/search features which are way better than less.  It's a bit kde dependent, but easy to modify.
