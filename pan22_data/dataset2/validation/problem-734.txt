I just want Windows to use the drive as simple plain old storage without cluttering it up with  its internal stuff and metedata - and as far as I know, removable drive is the way to go.
I want to connect my external 2TB USB HDD that has 4 partitions, to be treated as a set of  removable drives on Windows.
This is because I do not want Windows to create "System Volume Information" and "$Recycler" ans stuff on it ( these are not created for removable drives right? )
Every time I try to disconnect the thing, I'm told the device is busy. I end up unplygging the darn thing. Explorer then goes bananas, and eats up system ram until something crashes. I've searched around for a while on the web, and most points to hardware or partition issues.
If you want to support Linux boxes, the only really good filesystem that works between the systems is FAT32. Linux can read and write to NTFS, but the Linux NTFS driver runs as a FUSE module, and performance is comparatively poor. exFAT would be the best option, because FAT32 doesn't allow filesizes greater than 4 GB, but AFAIK Linux and friends do not know how to read it (and neither do versions of Windows earlier than Windows 7)
(P.S. It worked in WinXP but I haven't tested them on Windows 7/8. Try and tell us if it works or not.)
