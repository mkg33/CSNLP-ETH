Power Users also allows an account to create shares. I tested it by creating shares in a cluster with new-smbshare command where I only added the domain account to Power Users. Without being in Power Users, the domain account could not create the share. Useful if you do not want to make an account an Admin just to be able to create shares.
Caveat: This was tested in a Windows 7 environment with O365 only for Outlook, so I can't swear it will work for the other apps, but VBA permissions have never varied per-application before, so I'm assuming it will be the same for the Excel, Word, and PowerPoint macros. 
Not quite true - if you use Office 2016/O365, all macros are disabled until you are at least a power user.  You can enable anything you like and there is no error - it just doesn't work.  But after I upgraded myself to the Power Users group (I had already enabled the right options in Trust Center), I can record, write, or run vba solutions as I do when logged in with my administrator account.
