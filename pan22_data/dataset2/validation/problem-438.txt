If you can get the serial number for your laptop, the manufacturer may keep records of MAC address tied to system serial number. It's a bit of a long shot, but since MAC addresses are unique, this is definately possible for a company to track.
If you connected to your home internet, there is a log in the router that stores all mac adresses and the IP adresses. 
I don't mean to be a debby downer, but depending on the model of the network adapter, the MAC address can be changed.  This may may make things a bit more difficult.  They could have changed to something generic like DE:AD:BE:EF:20:12.  On the other hand, this isn't something that is commonly known to be changeable because the stardard for years was that the address was "burned" in the chip by the manufacturer.
If you computer has been stolen and you need to give them the MAC adress of your laptop you can get it from there.
Maybe I'm over thinking this, but MAC spoofing is relatively easy, and the address isn't even unique. Honestly, the only way you're likely to get your laptop back is if the thief accidentally leaves it somewhere, and even then, the police would need to find it, and you would have to somehow prove to them that it's yours. I honestly think that the best course of action would be to change any internet passwords that are remembered by your stolen laptop's browser, buy a new computer, and move on. I can only hope that you have backups of any important data.
I know this question is old, but today I had a similiar headache myself after finding out that my router already "forgot" my recently stolen Macbook. There is one way not mentioned here, the storage backup. If you have access to any kind of backup from your stolen laptop, it is possible there are some wifi diagnostic files included. Not sure about windows, but from my OS X backup I dug up the whole wireless diagnostics archive (thank God I had this problem with wifi once hehe) and one of the files it contained was wireless_diagnostics-ilTACd.log, which inside among other technical stuff had the MAC address of my MacBook :)
However, woliveirajr has a point in comment to your question in that if you have a router at home that you connect to, you stand a good chance of finding a log with all the different MAC addresses associated with their host name that has ever connected to it.  Or if you you connect directly to the Web, your ISP may even be able to tell you the MAC address your modem has connected to it.
