I think the sticky point will likely be getting (redirected) links on the test.example.com server working properly. Here's a pretty complete explanation.
Does anyone have idea how to do this? And what should I do in my domain provider's controls, so that they can fetch data from my server, without changing URL.
My PC has a configuration to work as a server. It has quad core processor with 8GB RAM. So I made it a server. 
With apache, I don't believe there is a way to make this mapping arbitrary and ad-hoc; each domain is designed to represent a site, not a directory within a site.
You would use name-based virtual hosting and then define subdomains with your DNS provider.  You must set up an additional DNS name and virtual host for each domain name (including subdomains) you wish to use.
Wouldn't a reverse proxy set up in mod_proxy cover this? Although as pointed out for,  sanity's sake you'll probably want to run a separate Apache for each host header (www, test, etc.).
Also, you'll want to confirm that your ISP is set to forward *****.example.com to port 80 on your IP number and not just forward www.example.com.
But I want to forward e.g. www.example.com to folder C:/wamp/www/example and test.example.com to folder C:/wamp/www/test 
At present, when I am calling my IP address e.g. 123.234.345.456, I get index file from C:/wamp/www/.
