It's a bit crude but effective. And practical in many cases (probably in all but the most mission critical "can't ever be down" systems). The "&&" in the command makes sure that if a previous command fails it will not continue.
However if the mysql database itself is not that large and the system's I/O speed reasonably high you could easily do this withy minimal down time, just by chaining a few commands together and running it at a time usage is low. I've successfully done this a number of times for critical mysql databases. Perhaps announce the maintenance and do a few test runs on a test system to find out how long it takes.
Setup a second server as a slave. You probably want a master/master setup so either host can take writes. Move the IP over to this second machine. Now you can do your maint on the first machine. This will minimize the downtime for the MySQL service. 
I'm sorry to say that the answer is no, there's not. If you start moving the filesystem while mysql is using it, you'll get your database entirely hosed.
