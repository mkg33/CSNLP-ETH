If the command window has a specific name when it waits for input its easy to do with autoit. You can check for the name or title of the cmd window an then press y or n. As well it should be possible in different other ways.
Im not sure you can accomplish this with batch file but there is a easy 3rd party scripting language that would fit you task. The programm is called AutoIT. You could include your batch script into the AutoIT and then do the y pressing with autoit.
To use approach that Ivan Viktorovic suggested (about the window name), you can still use VBScript. It's easily done by checking if the window with that name exists, and then sending window name to "AppActivate" and performing Enter key with "SendKeys", and sending appropriate keys to send Y or N. This one would be better if you don't want to download additional software.
You could always try looking at the "sendkeys" interface.  Have a look at tcc from jpsoftware, which has the ability to send keys to other windows, to see if this is what you want.
