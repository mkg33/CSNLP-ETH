The instructions are pretty straightforward but there is one unsettling part: search for "Enter the address of your NAS server." Basically it seems that to connect one's Mac to the Synology NAS, you have to provide an IP address.
Synology provides a utility called SynologyAssistant (Windows and MacOS) that shows you all Syno devices connected to your network and their ip-addresses.
You're right as to the fact that it's possible the NAS will grab a new IP address with method 1. But most likely that's not going to happen if you have a small network.  
Or you connect to your router and in the router you configure a so-called static DHCP mapping (refer to the manual of your router for how to do that) so the router always assigns the same ip-address to the Synology.
Through this utility you can also connect to the web-based management interface of the NAS and (in case the NAS isn't setup yet) push the latest firmware version to the NAS.  
First of all, they don't explain how to determine the IP address of your Synology NAS. How do you do that? Second of all, a bigger concern is that if I'm not mistaken, that IP address can change whenever the NAS reconnects to the router (for example, if you restart your router). Doesn't that mean that your Mac's connection to the Synology NAS would break whenever either the router or the NAS is restarted, since it is based on this IP address?
I am considering buying the Synology DiskStation DS115j after discussion at my previous question (how can NAS work if it is not connected to Internet?). Before I did that, I wanted to read through instructions about how to set it up with Mac's Time Machine, to make sure it would be easy. I found the instructions here: https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Backup_Restore/How_to_back_up_files_from_Mac_to_Synology_NAS_with_Time_Machine
I'd say that best method is to use 2 and remember the address.  Just be sure to give it an address outside of the DHCP scope.
