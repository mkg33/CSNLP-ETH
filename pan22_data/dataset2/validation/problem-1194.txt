First, here is a picture of two pages of the same manual, which seems contradictory to me.  One page says only a single connector is required, while the next page says both are required.  The entire manual for the card can be found here: http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/kepler/Tesla-K20-Active-BD-06499-001-v02.pdf
In case anyone needs it, the owner's manual of the R720xd can be found here: ftp://ftp.dell.com/Manuals/all-products/esuprt_ser_stor_net/esuprt_poweredge/poweredge-r720xd_Owner%27s%20Manual_en-us.pdf The relevant page is page 68, which clearly indicates that the 8-pin female port on the riser card is for a GPU.
Neither the R720xd NOR the GPU came with the necessary cables.  And given what appears to be a contradiction in the GPU manual (above), I'm not even sure at this point what we actually need.  I have searched high and low online for things like 2x6 pin PCI-E to 8 pin male-to-male and so on, and for the life of me cannot find what we need.
I am trying to put an NVIDIA Tesla K20C into a Dell PowerEdge R720xd.  I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the power requirements of the card.
