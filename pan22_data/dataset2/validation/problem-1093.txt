About Office 2007, it shouldn't be any issue installing this software except if that DVD is broken, scratched or files corrupted.
You're probably dealing with a bad combination of drive and disk. Windows 7 and Office 2007 work fine together. If you have a second machine you can try these options to try and get the software installed: 
I was trying to install Office 2007 on my new Win 7 box, but after inserting the DVD (original Microsoft disk), the drive kept trying to read the disk and nothing happened at all. I couldn't browse it nor start manually. After removing the disk I got the error message that the format operation failed . The disk seems fine, because I was able to mount it correctly under Linux on the same machine. Any ideas? I thought Win 7 was supposed to be better than XP an Linux?
Sounds to me like the disc is damaged or your DVD drive/drivers are bad. Try initializing the installation process on another (Windows) computer. If it allows you to initialize the installation, then it is the drive or that machine. If not, then the disc is bad.
Just because you are able to mount the disc in Linux doesn't mean that the disc isn't too damaged to install properly in Windows.
Same for me as GAThrawn. You also can try to install Office 2010 Beta that is now available and I use it, so far so good!
