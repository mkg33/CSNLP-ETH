(The above reflects my personal experience, and might not be valid for all computer/mouse/driver combinations.)
I just remark that a PS2 mouse is even more responsive, but very few computers today have the outlet.
I think the underlying issue may be more related to Wifi interference though, as the unifying receiver transmits in the 2.4GHz frequency range used by 802.11B.
moving the USB wireless dongle from the back of my PC to the USB hub I have at the other end of my desk worked for me.
It's also possible that it's a power-related issue.  Disk access causes a spike in power use, potentially leaving peripheral devices (like a wireless USB mouse) with less power.  But this is very unlikely; unless you have a lot of other power-hungry peripherals and/or an undersized power supply, it would tend to point to a faulty power supply.
Even though the receiver was only 2.5 feet from the mouse I was getting a lot of interference and jittering. Moving the receiver to my keyboard USB hub, which is about 0.5 feet away, fixed the problem entirely.
You might have your hard drive in PIO mode. I say this because one of my friends had his hard drive in PIO mode and his mouse lagged all the time.
I had a very similar issue with a Logitech Performance MX wireless mouse, which uses Logitech's Unifying Receiver.
Take a look at the Windows Device Manager.  Look for any red flags/indicators on any of the device icons.  Pay particular attention to the disk drives and controllers.  A flag here could indicate a resource conflict or a driver problem.  I'm not sure whether this is still the case with Windows 7, but in earlier Windows versions, when a 32-bit disk driver somehow failed, Windows would revert to a 16-bit generic driver and the result was terrible performance and weird effects such as you describe.  The solution may be a matter of finding and installing the correct disk system driver for the affected component, which might be the motherboard.
