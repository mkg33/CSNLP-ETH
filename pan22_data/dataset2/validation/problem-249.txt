You need to set up and install a Proxy Server on your VPS. The most commonly used one is Squid and it can do everything you want.
To set up a SOCKS5 proxy on my localhost via the SSH tunnel I am able to establish to my remote VPS host but it seems it's still not as secure or as anonymous as expressvpn.com.
I also tried https://www.some-web-proxy.com, or similar web proxy sites with HTTPS / SSL enabled on them, and they worked. However, the problems with them are
Without knowing what you are trying to achieve it's difficult to say how you can achieve your end result, however that statement doesn't make a lot of sense - and you've provided no explanation of how you arrived at that conclusion. Given the confused nature of the rest of the question makes me suspect that your basis for making such an assertion may be flawed.
This opens a port on your local machine to connect to. The next step would be to change the proxy settings in your web browser to the following:
Question is a bit confused. The point of SSL is that nobody except the browser and the server can read the data stream - so all the (HTTP) proxy has to do is pass the data back and forth. In order to connect the client to the server the client needs to tell the proxy where to connect to (not using SSL). The proxy does not need / cannot use a SSL certificate.
I don't want to pay for this kind of VPN service because I believe I have everything they have, I just need to set it up on my VPS server via SSL. Right?
How to install it varies greatly based on your OS of choice, so I suggest you research installing squid on your platform. Some you'll have to build from source, others will have packages you can install.
You say you want security and anonymtity. The former is very generic but adding a proxy does little to enhance security. Anonymity is something a lot more complex.
