But again, from a management perspective, it's not worth it for us to spend the time to figure it out.  We'd never sell Windows or Office or Acrobat or any other widely-used app or utility, since we use a mix of versions and sometimes have upgrades, and OEM Windows can't be sold w/out the hardware...  For lesser-used utilities, by the time our user wouldn't want to use it, the version would probably be too old.
So, ultimately, I'd feel free to do it if the circumstances made sense, but we're never in a situation where it makes sense.
If you asked the software company they will tell you that it is illegal and you only have a license and not ownership of a copy.  
You really need to read each license first, as most I've seen cover this subject. Beyond that, do as others have already suggested and get proper legal advice.
We don't usually have the time to sell surplus equipment, and we've never taken the time to sell surplus licences.  At least with old hardware, it's sitting unused in a corner anyway, it's already been removed from inventory, and we can just post something on Craigslist or sell it internally and it's not a big deal.  For software, we keep things in the inventory for a long time, just in case someone needs a specific version or we are able to get a competitive upgrade.  So the extra effort of verifying that something old isn't used on a lab machine in the corner and taking it out of the database isn't worth it.
There was a recent ruling (2) that would seem to indicate you may be an owner of a copy which would allow you to resell your software.  Listen to Episode 32 of TWIL they discuss it.
It depends on the license you obtained (Or the agreement) from the Original software company. The most fair answer for your query is "NO"... 
Legally, it would depend on the actual license, but practically, if I did have some surplus s/w (maybe something that was never actually installed), I'd feel quite free to sell it.
