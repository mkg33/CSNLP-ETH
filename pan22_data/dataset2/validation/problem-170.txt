An ADSL router with 4 ports (they are routers, not modems), typically contain an ADSL port which is routed to the 4 ethernet ports.   The 4 ethernet ports are typically individually accessible but bridged to behave like a dumb switch in software.    [ I know this because I have reconfigured a number of these devices to have different switches on different VLANS and route between them by changing the software to OpenWRT ].
An ADSL modem is the bit in the router which actually captures the raw frames.  In earlier times, ADSL routers were internal cards (which could go into a PC) which did this - they did not have routing functionality on board.   Remember too that a "modem" (or "conventional modem" is actually a device used to modulate a digital signal over an analog carrier - typically associated with speeds of 300 to 56400 bits per second and used over the phoneline in days gone by).
A single port ADSL router (Its still a router even if its called a modem) routes packets between the ethernet and ADSL interface, but is still routing the packets.  We know this because the device will typically strip off the PPP overhead (ie the PPP bit in PPPoE or PPPoA) and then make that available to ethernet side of the connection.  The devices also often run a DHCP server so they can hand out an IP address.  These devices are generally slightly cut down version of 4 port routers.
