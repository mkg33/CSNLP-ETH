Since you refer to "replication" in a very general manner I'm guessing that you probably haven't fully researched the replication functionality in SQL Server 2005.
I'm doing POC on database replication, and I'm stuck with question from my boss. Is database locked when it's in replication process on SQL Server 2005?
Exactly what happens during replication depends on what kind of replication you're doing - however the Host database should not be locked.  In a log shipping situation the server being log shipped TO will be locked during the restore, no matter what, however you can set it to be read only and accessible when not restoring.  With mirroring you should be able to run queries (selects) against your mirrored (secondary) server at any time.
There are different "flavors" of replication technologies in SQL Server (publisher / subscriber, database mirroring, etc). Depending on what you're trying to do you may opt to choose one replication strategy over another (scalability versus availability, for example). Your replication latency requirements, throughput needs, and desired overhead are all going to make differences in what you choose.
