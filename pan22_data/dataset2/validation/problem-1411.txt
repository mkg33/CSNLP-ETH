Finally, as mentioned in the comments above: If you're planning to just write an image (an .iso file) to the disk, then you don't need to do any preparations at all.
Except some people call step #2 "low-level format" now that there's no #1 anymore. And sometimes people call erasing the whole disk "formatting" even though it doesn't write anything with an actual format in there. Sometimes people call reinstalling Windows "formatting" even if all the files are left untouched.
Such image writing starts at sector 0, so it trashes everything that was on the disk previously (up to the size of the image). Whether it had partitions and files, or whether it was blank, doesn't matter – it simply gets overwritten with the image's own partitions and all.
"Format" might be one of the most confusing terms in consumer tech, really. Even your post already confuses two or three different actions...
Everything beyond the size of the image will be left as it was, but the OS won't care about it – since the image's partition table says there's no partition there. Though of course discarding or blanking the disk is still a good idea if you're going to give it to somebody else.
