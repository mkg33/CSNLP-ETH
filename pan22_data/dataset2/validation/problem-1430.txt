Yes. If you're on 2008 you can set up an extended event session to record logins to a file (you can configure it to roll over and set a maximum size, even 64mb may be enough). You could use a ring buffer but it seems like a waste of memory... and if extended events were not possible then an audit trace will work, as will a standard trace (created in profiler and exported to a script). They can all do rollover and be accessed one way or another through simple repeatable T-SQL.
Have an agent job which reads the event file each day and aggregates data into a table (on the server or on another server - if you have a lot of servers it's good to consolidate, and you can do this in a bit of PowerShell but it becomes more complicated too).
The main columns you want are the login name, application name, database name, host name (though this can be spoofed), the date, whether it was successful or not, and aggregate a count.
I do this as standard across all the servers I look after because noticing a bunch of failed logins (security attack) or safely cleaning up the existing security over time is a core part of being a DBA.
