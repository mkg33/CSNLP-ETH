If you really tried everything and you are sure it didn't reset (did you try to ping the original IP address 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1 (?) being on the same subnet?), then I suggest you ask for a replacement:
I was unable to un-brick this router. As a last resort I'd opened the box to attempt a reset by draining the cap holding charge on the nvram. This also didn't work. As a result I have voided the warranty. So we purchased a new router. Not Belkin this time!
This has worked for me with several different brands (although mainly Linksys) -- hopefully it will work for you, too.
The reset switch in Belkin F5D7230 is not very easy to push. If you are having problem resetting it it's best to open the 2 screws under the sticker at the bottom of the device and open it. Then very carefully without touching any electronic parts inside with your fingers use something to push the reset switch for few seconds. I assure you the router will reset. Once it's reset the IP to access it will be 192.168.2.1 and for password just press enter.
