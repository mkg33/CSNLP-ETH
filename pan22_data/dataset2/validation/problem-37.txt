Unless you have a very unusual workload for your computer, it is never a good idea to use FAT32 over NTFS. And by "very unusual" I mean something like a constant amount of saturated writing to the disk in random files, etc. Otherwise the SSD will not wear out appreciably slower on FAT32; you'll just end up with less features in your filesystem and more chance of losing data.
Also, no filesystem on the planet can protect against hardware failure of your SSD/HDD if the only copy of the file you have is on that disk... not NTFS, not FAT32, not reFS, nothing; so "the data is only backed up" if you back it up to a separate machine. Just keep that in mind. (this paragraph is in response to your question "2) Is the data backed up in case something goes wrong?" -- the answer is "only if you're backing up the data to another storage device").
  If you've got things on your Data partition that you don't want your kids/employees/guests to view/edit/delete, or something like that, then you definitely don't want to convert to FAT32, because there's no way to stop them from doing anything they want to your data.
