I'd like to use the TPM to secure my boot process for my linux laptop. Any manual, howto or tutorial I have found about this topic mentions I have to use the TrustedGrub bootloader to keep up the trust chain. TrustedGrub, however, is not in the repositories of any major distribution, it is based on Grub1 so the number of file systems it can boot from is quite limited, and worst of all, it cannot boot from UEFI, so I simply cannot use it.
The question on my mind is: do I really absolutely have to use TrustedGrub to use the TPM, or can I use another boot loader like Grub2, Shim, Gummiboot or whatelse is there?
In case of both, secure booting and trusted booting you need to get trusted grub. Trusted grub will measure the boot process. I am not aware of anything which is not using trusted grub. 
I experimented with the tools on my system and they worked without TrustedGRUB being installed, including sealing and unsealing files.  You'd probably seal a file containing the key and then hook into an existing bootscript (or add a bootscript) to unseal the key and use it to run a cryptsetup luksOpen ... --key-file {your unsealed key on a tmpfs} or similar.
