You didn't have access permissions to create the necessary objects in AD. What account were you logged in with?
Have you confirmed that your Active Directory is actually working? Can you join other computers to the domain? Have you tried running DCDiag and Netdiag to validate the configuration? 
Can we get some more information on this? Below are some questions that came up for me after reading our post. 
Struggling to get MSMQ installed in Domain Integration mode on Windows 2012 (Azure). So far, I've provisioned a brand new Windows Server 2012 (R2) machine on the Azure platform and installed the Active Directory role and promoted the machine to a domain controller.
There are also some specific things you have to do to get MSMQ working in this mode on an actual domain controller. Here is an example for 2008 on what needs to be done. 
Once the AD was in place, I then added the MSMQ feature, along with the Directory Integration add on.
I had similar problem, able to resolve after adding the account to delegate control to create objects at Active Directory Users and Groups -> Right Click on your DOMAIN -> Delegate Control
Did you replace 'DOMAIN' to omit your domain name or did you really try and create a domain named DOMAIN? That seems like a generic message and might not be the issue.
