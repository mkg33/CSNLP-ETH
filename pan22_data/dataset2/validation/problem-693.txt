If you have your sword and armour, then changing AD can be done with LDIFDE, or directly with ADSI calls.
Is it possible to configure microsoft DNS server (widows server 2008+) to use Microsoft SQL as a data source for DNS data? Is it any guides available?
You could use DNSCMD to change the zone somewhat safely without mucking in AD directly. I say "somewhat" because there be dragons in this land.
DNS Server using a SQL backend will just slow up DNS response time. Are you looking to get statistics of the DNS? If so then you need to look at the Windows Server SDK which will allow you to interrogate DNS, of course you will need experience in programming.
There are lots of good DNS server libraries for many languages out there that support database back-ends. Usually they are focused on geolocation, like pgeodns.
I agree with everyone else, mucking with AD is not a good idea. If you want your application to interact (add, delete, etc.) with DNS zones\records on a Windows DNS server, use the dnscmd utility.
