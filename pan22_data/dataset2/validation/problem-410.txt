I had a similar situation in the past and tracked it down to bad wifi in my router (don't know if it was merely the antenna or card). Replacing the router resolved it for me. It took me a while to realize it was a problem of the router though. Ping tests can help reveal if there is an actual break in the packet flow, but not the cause of it.
found that ping dropouts intervals matched this parameters, googled adding parameter name and I found 
Unfortunately, if it's not environmental, it may be that either the wifi adapter in one of the computers is going bad, or the router is. In that case, you may be looking at a replacement purchase.
If it's the router, try moving it to a different location in the house/room to eliminate possible environmental factors. Also check the logs on the router and see if they reveal the wireless broadcast information (may be a problem in wireless broadcast). If it's determined to be the PC with the USB wireless you can try using the adapter on another computer to see if you get the same effect there.
Not clear on what you were pinging. Is it only one or both of the PCs that are dropping out? Try pinging the router ip from each. Do both drop?
Are the PCs within a comfortable range? I have had drop outs caused by PCs sitting on edge of range with a weak signal.
If you're running a ping test, are you merely having each computer ping the other, or from both computers to the same IP on the internet or your intranet? If the two computers are pinging just each other, then it's possible that the wifi on one of the computers is bad. Try the ping from both machines to either your router's IP, or the same public IP on the internet (4.2.2.2 which is one of Google's public DNS adresses would work).
