For larger networks, I usually follow the same principle: using 10. addresses you can have 256 subnets of 65534 hosts, or 65536 subnets of 254 hosts: more than enough for any network, without the need for fancy /13, /28 or /27 subnets. There can of course always be exceptions, but this is my general rule.
.11 and .12 (and maybe .13, .14 and so on) are domain controllers, DNS and WINS (if in use) servers.
Usually I dump all the servers on their own ghetto subnets, so I can keep an eye on them, and make sure they don't mix with crappy desktops. If I have to have them mixing, then, yea, I reserve the first 50 or so addresses for servers/anything that needs a static ip. Again it's just a matter of less typing. Desktop users seldom care what their IP is, and you don't often need to type it in.
If the network is larger and more segmented, I like to put servers on one subnet and clients elsewhere; client (and even server) subnets can of course be more than one, if the network is big enough to require VLANs.
I strongly believe in order when it comes to network and systems management, because computer systems tend to be chaotic in their essence (as in chaos theory): the smallest error can have unpredictable results. In network addressing, I try to always use the same ending addresses for the same roles; this is my typical breakdown of a class-C network:
I usually use 1 for the gateway, just because it makes it easy to remember. Either way, as long as you use the same number on every subnet, it doesn't matter. Other than the gateway, I don't reserve specific ips for specific types of servers. 
I prefer "round" subnets, because with them it's a lot easier to remember subnet masks, networks and broadcast addresses, and to know which subnet an address belongs to.
I like DHCP (we have tons of laptops), but you need to couple that with registered MAC addresses, or any shmuck off the street can come in and plug in and that's a no no. MAC's aren't secure, but they're at least as good as statics, as far as security is concerned. I don't use "registered" DHCP; I'm not a windows DHCP person. If I'm going to have statics and dynamics on the same subnet, I just set the DHCP range to be 51-255 or similar, and put the statics in 1-50.
After 10 I usually work in /16's, but I plan them by /8's (which are usually a nice size for a business unit). Working in 8's is nice because (unless your company is massive) you can just assign a business unit 10.1.0.0 and you won't have to worry about them running out of space any time soon. Obviously, if you have more than 255 business units, ymmv.
I tend to choose 192.168.X class-C subnets for small networks where 254 addresses will surely be enough; I'm usually quite conservative here, and go with the simplest of them: 192.168.0 and 192.168.1; I also like 192.168.42.0/24 a lot, for obvious reasons.
This hint greatly improved my VPN life: for example having the same subnet might be annoying when 192.168.0.1 might be your home router and remote server you're trying to fix. Then you'd have to add a manual route through the VPN interface, etc.
The subnet size is of course to be choosen based on the size of the network, with enough room for future expansion, because re-addressing is always a big pain. That said, my favorite subnets are those beggining with 192.168. and 10.: I really can't stand 172. ones, and of course this doesn't have any rational reason: it's purely an aesthetic concern.
I usually use "low" addresses for servers and "high" ones for clients; the former are always static ones, while the latter are assigned using DHCP. I'm a great fan of DHCP and dynamic DNS for clients, but I'd never use it for servers and other "fixed" systems, like network printers and scanners.
Besides all the wise suggestions given here, one that I found useful: for sake of comfort, avoid having the same network as your office or other LANs you might have to connect to (remotely). 
10.x.x.x; anarchy and crawling chaos (/22 is actually a damn useful subnet, not too big and not too small, so keep the same irrespective of the size, second octet defines a primary location, third defines a sub-location); gateway is always 1, servers start at 11 (with primary DNS being 11), then clients (starting at 10.x.1.x/10.x.5.x/etc using a /22 subnet), finally printers and other devices (starting at 10.x.3.x, 10.x.7.x, etc); servers with the same roles in each subnet have the same address where possible; DHCP for client PCs, static for everything else, reservations used for certain "special" clients where there are legacy apps and legacy security models that rely on a specific IP address.
