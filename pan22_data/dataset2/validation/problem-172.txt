At the bottom of the shown PivotChart, it shows the two levels of Data Labels at the bottom, for the X-Axis.
Thanks in advance. I've done a bit of searching and so far can't find anything to help me with this.
The Table now has special formatting, with a colorful header row and alternating bands of color. It's a little overformatted, but you can select it and choose a less (or more!) formatted style.
Excel charts work by plotting rows and columns of data, not just a big long row. So arrange your data like this:
If you don't want the total (it might overwhelm the rest of the data, simly select and delete the total columns in the chart, or select only the first four columns of the table before selecting the chart.
And a bonus question... Let's say I want to add a new "week" every now and then to the right of this table (expand it with more data). Can I do it so that the chart automatically adjusts and includes the new data? Or will I have to manually edit it each time?
I'm trying to create a fairly simple chart from a fairly simple table. But I'm having more problems than I thought I would have and spending too much time on it.
So... X-axis has labels from the top row, Y-axis has values from row 4 and bars are grouped according to labels in row 3. Also, bars are colored and there's a legend on the side linking a color to a specific sub-label.
Select this range of data, and on the Insert ribbon tab, click Table. It won't insert anything, but it will convert your ordinary range of data into a special data structure known as a Table. Nothing to be scared of, Tables are pretty powerful. The dialog will ask if your range has headers, which it does (Week, A, B, C, Total).
(By data labels I mean "field" labels along the bottom below the axis, not actual data labels in the chart.) If I right-click on the Axis labels and select Format Axis, I get the option to format the Axis, but it seems I can only format the "A, B, C" level labels (from the example here), but can't figure out how to or if I even can format the "1, 2, 3" level of labels.
Now comes the magic of Tables. If you have a formula somewhere that relies on the whole column in a table, then if you add or remove rows in the table, the formula will update without any effort on your part. These formulas include the Series formulas in the chart. So add a row to the table, and the chart will automatically include the new row of data.
My question: How do you format BOTH LEVELS of the X-Axis data labels? Both the "A, B, C" and "1, 2, 3" levels of axis data labels in this answer's example.
My question is related to the "There is a not-so-simple way to do this with normal charts, but the real skill here is to use a PivotChart" PivotChart answer.
