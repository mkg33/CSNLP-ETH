As the name implies, the location is intended for files that are only supposed to be stored temporarily.
i have found programs like skype and vmware persistently holding on to files in temp folders, but i dont think they depend on them to function correctly.
So, in my personal opinion, deleting the contents of the Temp folder shouldn't cause any problems. But due to the fact of how it is used, it can not be guaranteed to be a safe operation.
As stated by many, it should not be a problem, but honestly just in this week i was trying to 'clean' my pc by Uninstalling programs. to my dismay i couldnt uninstall a bunch because the uninstall depended on files stored in the temp folder(since the installer extracted the setup files there), which i clear regularly. 
Please also keep in mind, emptying the folder while the system in operational could cause a running application to lose a file it placed there. Emptying the folder is something best done during boot.
If someone decided to place a critical file in that location, deleting that file might cause a problem to an application.
So, if you write an application and you want to store something for later retrieval, this is the wrong place for you. The Temp location is only to be used for data that, if gone, wouldn't matter anyway.
once on a server, after clearing the temp folder for 'Administrator' various functions in Sql Server management studio failed because of something that couldnt be found in the temp folder.
