For option #2, you can just put it up there and link to it in some online forms (though not here, maybe in chat though).
For option #1 you'd probably need to modify it a bit to conform to the rules of the marketplace. Depending on how your game works, this could be a minimal effort or a huge task, but you have the opportunity to earn a bit of money (probably not much, but you might eventually buy yourself a very nice dinner, and maybe even more, without seeing your game its hard to say). If your game is really good, you could even try publishing it to Steam, but their requirements are much more strict than Xbox Live Indie games.
You are in the catbird seat. You have a complete and working game. Your options are limited only by how much additional effort you'd like to put into this game. In my mind you have three basic options:
Using monogame you could publish it to the Win8 store and even the Apple store. Perhaps you could make some money on it there.
If you just want to share it and you don't want to set up your own website for that purpose, you could always use any file hosting service and share the link via gaming forums. It doesn't get much easier than that.
You might get some added attention from the XNA community by uploading your project to CodePlex. It's Microsoft-hosted and thus you can expect a lot of C#/.NET stuff. A lot of open-source XNA games, engines and frameworks are easily found there.
However, as people are wary (or at least should be) of downloading executables from an unknown source, you could always share the code itself through something like Sourceforge. You can quite easily set up an online repository, forum, wiki, all sorts of things, depending how much effort you want to put into it. That way, people can still download the executable, but can also verify the code that it contains nothing harmful/malicious. Also, if your game contains something that piques someone's interest, your game might, with your consent, get developed further into something even better.
