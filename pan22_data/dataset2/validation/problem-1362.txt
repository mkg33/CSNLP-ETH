When I scanned for hardware changed within Device manager (after removing it) Windows again detected the device but as unknown.
Windows scanned, found a driver but then instead of detecting it as a network adapter I saw the System Devices list get updated instead. I have no idea which one it is.
Attempting to install my downloaded drivers failed, so I told windows to update the driver software online, trying to bring it back to how it was a few moments earlier.
I then went into device manager and removed the device and the drivers (perhaps I should have just removed the drivers in hindsight) with the intention of installing the new drivers I had downloaded.
I've tried removing the card and then installing it again but I now can't get it recognised as a network card.
I've just installed a PCI-E network card and when it was installed Windows (7 64bit) found a driver.
It might just be something silly like unzipping the driver file you downloaded first, then just running the installation program.
