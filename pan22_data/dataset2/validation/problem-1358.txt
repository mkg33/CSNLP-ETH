1) they do have a linux client - the web-client - you know when you log into the .net client - well it says in that little text bit at the top something along the lines of 'stop using this, it's going away, use the web-client' - well, that.
4) Given you only have two disks might I suggest that switching to SSDs wouldn't be too expensive and you can forget all this tuning you're trying to do.
5) This may sound harsh but it's not meant that way - get some training, even the basic ICM course teaches these basics.
3) Rather than limit IOPS why not just set disk shares to be higher on the higher-priotity VM/s - that way you're not limiting the maximum performance of any given VM but just weighting their responses under contention.
2) As a rule of thumb I assume about 200 random IOPS per 15krpm disk - I know you may well get more but it's a reasonable assumption - of course you're using R1 so writes get a 2:1 penalty and reads may get a small boost but again I wouldn't bank on it. Oh and your definition isn't really right - there are lots of different types of IO benchmarking, IOPS is simply a measure - in basic terms there's sequential-read/write and their random versions too.
