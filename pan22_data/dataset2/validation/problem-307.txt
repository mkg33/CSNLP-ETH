tl;dr Previously I was using RD Gateway and it worked pretty well, I didn't have to install anything in the client. However, my ISP has recently blocked port 443 and 80. After some investigation, I determined that our proxy also allowed communications on port 8080 (I was able to open a site I hosted on that port) so I figured maybe I can change the RD gateway port from 443 to 8080. But after some digging and days of troubleshooting, its seems like its not possible. and that brings me here.
Is there anyway I can remote my computer at home from another location (work) where the only way I can access the internet is through an http proxy?
I know you mentioned without installing additional software on the client, but you said it's only a preference.  If you can stomach it you could try logmein which is free and accessible from a web browser.
Is there any other way I can remote my computer through an http proxy, preferably without installing additional software on the client? I don't really care how a ugly hack it might be. or maybe some web app I can install that will function like RD using a browser?
