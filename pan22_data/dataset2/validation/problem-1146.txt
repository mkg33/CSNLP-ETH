Is this copy operation just via a normal network share (i.e. copying via Windows Explorer or similar)? I experienced a bug like this in under Win2K but that was fixed as far back as SP1 if I remember rightly.
If you are copying via another method then that application/service may be trying to hold the file in RAM until it has it all, in which case you need to upgrade or replace that app/service.
Try to use a protocol like FTP - if it still happens, you should probably look into some networking problems. 
Based on my work this AM ESEUtil seems to be the way to go.  It wasn't as fast as I'd expected, but it didn't freak out Windows either.
Trying to do a P2V conversion onto a 64-bit server running Windows Server 2008.  Any of the normal file transfer methods for the VMDK file (which is 44GB) cause Windows on the destination server to run out of its 14GB RAM after a few minutes due to the file system caching.
In any case I would check that your RAID 10 was actually healthy - the symptoms here would make me suspect it wasn't able to write as fast as it should be.
Also, from a logical point of view, the server does not actually need to store a file in memory when copying from file system to file system; it just allocates a buffer in memory the file passes through. Depending on how you copy files, though, some applications will first store the file completely in memory, and then write it to the disk.
Running the P2V conversion or file copy on a 32-bit server doesn't have this problem and memory usage stays reasonable.
Seems to happen quite a bit in 2003/XP x64 actually. In fact I just realized one of my servers has been experiencing this same issue for a while now and I haven't had time to troubleshoot it. 
There are known issues with the Network File Copy processes on W2K - if the remote system can't empty the write cache faster than the rate the file data is arriving in over the network then it will steadily consume all physical memory on the server if the file is big enough. Mark Russinovich has some details on the ways this might happen in this article on changes made in Windows Vista's file copy mechanisms. The performance graph you posted looks like this issue and I have seen exactly this sort of behavior in the past where I had a target system with very slow disks and a fast network. 
Maybe you need to beef up your virtual memory on your system hard drive, where low hard drive space could have caused said problem.
The interesting question here would be how the server actually stores the files - as you can see, the I/O load is just way down, which means it's not actually writing the file anywhere, just buffering it in memory.
Are you using Server 2003 64-bit? There is some information on fixing this issue with x64 on Server 2003 here -> http://www.techspot.com/blog/224/slow-system-performance-when-copying-large-files-in-xp-x64-server-2003-x64/
The Windows FTP client uses a Temp file on C:\ before moving the file to the target destination.  Beware! :-)
However even though your target OS is a bit old the hardware isn't all that weak and a RAID 10 setup with 4x7.2K SATA drives should be good for somewhere between 60 and 120Meg/sec write speed which is significantly higher than the 39Meg/sec Vista is reporting for your copy. The odd thing here is that if it is a solid, well-configured GigE link then you could hit network transfer rates reaching 70Meg/sec (and maybe a bit higher) for a sustained copy of a large file like this. That said 38Meg/sec isn't abnormal either if there's any other traffic flowing in or out of either the client or server or (as is more likely) that rate is mostly limited by the speed of your local laptop hard drive.
