3) In the < head > tag, it highlights all indents with white for some reason. I don't want it to do that.
As you can see, I want to make small changes. I tried opening htmldjango.vim and editing it but I have no idea where it defines the colour of the tags. htmldjango.vim says this
2) It colours all opening tags (< and >) yellow and all ending tags (< / and >) red. I want them both to just be blue. 
1) It highlights all variables (whatever starts with {{ or {% and ends with }} or %}) white and gives it a red font. I want all variables to just he yellow. 
4) it underlines all the link names. (example: < a href = 'link' > linkName < / a>) I don't want this either.
I'm guessing this is where the tags are defined. But how do I change what the tags are coloured and what not? I even tried opening html.vim and reading through that and it seems that even in html.vim it doesn't define the actual colours (I couldn't find the name of any colour or hex code of any colour in neither html.vim or htmldjango.vim). Where is the file which defines the colours of the tags / variables in htmldjango.vim?
