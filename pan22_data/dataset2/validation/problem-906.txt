I have a group that I use named staff.  It is a parent of a few nested groups.  I need to audit the group to list the users who aren't a part of that group or any nested child groups within it.  I have found scripts that will give me the users who aren't part of the Staff group, but it doesn't include any of the child groups so a user could be part of the child group but still be listed as not being in the parent group.  I don't want to have to script that for each child group of the parent.

The numeric OID for this operator is 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941. You request this type of option in the LDAP search by placing the numeric OID between the attribute and the value you are searching for (attribute:OID:=DN). You can run LDAP queries with the PowerShell cmdLet like this:
You can run a single LDAP query like that by using what it called the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN operator.
Two MS articles that cover this and some other details on LDAP search syntax that makes this possible:
