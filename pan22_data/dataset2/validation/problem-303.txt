If the systems let you connect via telnet or ssh or something similar, you could script the password changes in a relatively straightforward manner. If the password changes have to be done via a web interface, writing tooling to deal with the variations would probably be more work than it'd be worth but I'd at least try to make sure the new password was pasted in from a reliable source rather than hoping I could accurately retype it 400 times.
NOTE: Changing passwords on a regular basis does NOT improve security as much as is commonly believed.  If anything, it may encourage folks to pick inferior passwords, because picking a new good one every N months is a pain in the patootie. It only helps if you believe someone is reasonably likely to have stolen your existing password and if that password's getting out exposes something you care about or has a risk of being leveraged for rights amplification.
I myself use different pass for different sites, unless they are all leaked out, I don't need to change them at one time.
Also worth noting is that you should make sure the sites have been upgraded before changing your password.
Federated ID systems simplify this somewhat by providing a single point to change the password for multiple systems... but of course you have to decide whether you trust those ID hubs.
LastPass have heard you and posted a blog entry explaining how this can be done. And the bottom line is: you need to do it by hand site by site.
You can try to use Dashlane utility which includes Password Changer feature (it's free) which can change dozens of passwords in a single click.
you do a batch of password changes , and log the session using AHK. next time you want to change password. take out the AHK script and change the password only. you only need to play the AHK script again.
Since your question probably doesn't lend itself to an easy answer, I would propose that you change the passwords of websites based on how vulnerable they make you (loss of money, loss of privacy, loss of reputation, etc.)
