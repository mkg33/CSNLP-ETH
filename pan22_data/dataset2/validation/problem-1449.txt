But when you open your PC anyway just have a look at the mainboard. Typically there is some sticker or print on the PCB stating the concrete model so anyone can find detailed information online then.
Assuming you currently have just one module (1x1GB) installed I would recommend to get another 1GB module so you have a pair of 1GB modules installed (2GB total). As long as you don't have any specific programs which demand more memory this should be sufficient for Windows 7 and some office use. It does not make much sense to invest a lot in such an old machine. Getting a single 1GB module should be pretty cheap though.
Likely you will find some information like "PCxxxx" (DDR) or "PC2xxxx" (DDR2) which makes it easy to find the right module type.
To find out the maximum memory your motherboard supports you'd have to refer to the Gigabyte support docs, which shouldn't be a problem once you have the model name. 
Regarding the number of modules: Most CPUs since Socket 939 feature Dual-Channel memory access. This means if modules are installed in pairs it can access them in parallel (2x64-bit bus width) and therefore increase the memory bandwith. If you just install one module or install module with different capacity then either dual-channel feature is disabled or it just works for a part of the memory size.
Use HWiNFO32 to find out details about your motherboard model name and the RAM modules you currently have. It provides very detailed information. 
You might use CPU-z to get memory information. If it fails to read the information then sometimes even the CPU specification is sufficient to know the right memory type. For example Athlon 64 in Socket 754 and 939 uses DDR memory while AM2 uses DDR2 and AM3 usually is combined with DDR3 (but supports DDR2 from the CPU as well, so there are some mainboards providing DDR2 but most have only DDR3 sockets).
