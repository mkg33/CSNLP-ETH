As part of a requirement I have been issued, I seek the ability to push apps from the Windows Store (.appx) to remote users.
I've seen this guide; http://blogs.technet.com/b/keithmayer/archive/2013/02/25/step-by-step-deploying-windows-8-apps-with-system-center-2012-service-pack-1.aspx, which details doing exactly this, but it is only applicable to machines that are administered by a system running Windows Server 2012 R2 with the 'System Center 2012' bundle installed. The systems I target are considerably more decentralised than this, making this guide inappropriate.
The framework surrounding the data transmission is sorted; What I need to know is if there is a script that can be sent out along with a URI or the package proper to facilitate installation on the user-side of the Windows Store app.
I have a hunch that Microsoft have deliberately designed the Windows Store to be this way, but I figured I ought to ask around before I resign myself to the requirement.
I am well aware that numerous guides exist from Microsoft on pushing out Line-of-Business (LOB) (AKA Enterprise) applications -- that is, apps that have been developed in-house and are not for the consumption of the Windows store. This is inappropriate for my requirement, however; the customer wants their clients to receive apps that appear currently on the Windows Store, and for them to be installed in a silent manner.
