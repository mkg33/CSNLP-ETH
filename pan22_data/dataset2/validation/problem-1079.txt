While changing some connection in the server room and simultaneously in a wiring closet, I hooked the switches up in a loop.  It took a few seconds for the ports to saturate, and a few more to unplug the last few connections.  
Luckily we only setup LOCAL authentication for serial line access (hey if you have access to the box to plug into the serial port ... well we all know the rule about physical access and security) 
Almost 20 years ago, I was helping set up a new office and was getting the Internet connection going, setting up an HP/Apollo workstation as the main DNS server.  I learned the hard way about the need to include the . at the end of FQDNs.
I dont know if this counts or not.  We were on a very tight budget and needed to run 10 new CAT5 runs to a location in the middle of a concrete floor.  There wasnt any under-floor conduit available and the ceilings were cathedral with no crawlspace.  There was a row of low-hanging florescent light fixtures directly over the location where the CAT5 needed to be installed.  I proposed that we run the cat5 out of a wall at fixture-level, then run a piece of conduit 25' across the top of the fixtures to a column.  Then down the outside of the column to a box.
You are a System Admin/Consultant and you have to deploy an application working fine on dev machine, but as soon as you deploy it on the production machine it does not work. What is the silliest configuration mistake you ever made?
This looked and worked beautifully for years....until maintenance was called in to change one of the florescent tubes....access to the light was via the top of the fixture...which is where I had mounted 25' of conduit.
