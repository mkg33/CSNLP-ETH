Once you have permission, work WITH your company's support staff to plan the best way to keep them from having problems because of you.
This really isn't the forum for these kinds of questions. Most of the people here are the very people trying to keep you from bypassing security measures.
My guess is that the corporate filter is blocking traffic it thinks is disguised, and will look for keywords such as proxy and long urls after generic sites. Example: www.home.com/index.php?id=2309324230842303984320948230982039 where the id is a base_64 encoded version of the requested url or something. 
My suggestion is still create a VPN network at home, and connect from the office. At the very least you could then RDP into your home box and browse as if you were on your home computer.
...Go to your boss and convince them you need such access. Make him / her a deal; if you aren't getting your job done to their satisfaction, you'll give it up. If you're smart, you'll plan a way to make it VERY easy on the company's administrators. Also, if you're smart, your boss might want to keep you.
If you run it as a secure (https) website, then all they have it the URLs, they can't see any of the other content, and thus can't block it unless you have suspicious paths.
Web filtering normally works based on the url. If you've got a file called proxy.php or a folder called /phproxy/ then it's going to catch those. If there are no keywords in any of the URLs, then it could be looking at the page title - it's unlikely that it's trawling the whole page.
