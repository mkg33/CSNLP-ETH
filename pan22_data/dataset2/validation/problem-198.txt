So, basically, all these arbitrary limitations you're learning to deal with are because we're nursing a data structure from the 1980's along.  >smile<
All this "primary" and "extended" nonsense is based on old, old, old disk partition structures from way back in the day.
Basically, the master boot record (MBR -- a data structure stored on the first sector of the hard disk drive) has "slots" for up "pointers" that describe the on-disk location of up to 4 partitions.
Simply put you need a primary partition in order to boot.  Extended partitions cannot be the boot partition (beacuse it's just a container to get around the old limitations
Partition table can have maximum 4 records. To have more than 4 partitions several partition tables are organized into chain using extended partitions. Historically partitions described in first partition table of the chain are named primary while all other partitions are named logical.
It is pretty normal to have only logical partitions without any primary partition. The only drawback is inability to boot from logical partition with ordinary BIOS.
Somebody got the idea that an entry in the master boot record, instead of "pointing" to a partition, could "point" to yet another list of up to 4 partitions. This is the "extended" partition table.
