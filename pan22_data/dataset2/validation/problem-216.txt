Edit: It's currently charging and it did something similar: the charge jumped from 2% to 7%, then it started increasing steadily as one would expect.
I just noticed a few days ago that Windows 7 hardly refreshes the battery charge (or current capacity, expressed in percentage) as the battery is discharging or charging. I had it jump from 100% to 80% then to 20%; today it really bit me as it jumped directly from 96% to 0% - as in Windows didn't even had the chance to notice the battery was almost dead, so the laptop ran out of power (I forgot to plug it in to AC).
If the battery is relatively new (i.e. < 1yr) then it could be a faulty charging circuit causing the odd readout.
My old HP Compaq nx6325 was doing the same thing. I used this tool from hp to test the battery. This tool shows you if your battery is ok, defect or needs to be replaced soon. Mine failed... but, after replacement, everything is working as expected.
What is the problem here? The BIOS has no option even remotely about the battery and the diagnostic options only have memory and HDD tests; the log is totally empty. I'll give HP a call, but I'm not looking forward to it, as the customer service is horrible, at least in my country.
I use the free BatteryBar utility instead of Windows own battery indicator, which I first found through Gizmo's Freeware, and posted about on my blog Steve's BPCA Blog back in April 2010. 
How old is the laptop? As the battery ages the available runtime lessens but also the reported value becomes less accurate to the point where my old laptop always registers as 0% charged.
Your battery is probably just not calibrated right. The battery after a lot of usage forgets what is 100% and what is 0%. What you want to use is to charge the battery until it's full and then keep it plugged in for a couple of hours to establish 100%, then disable the critical and low battery functions until the battery dies to establish 0%. Then recharge.
