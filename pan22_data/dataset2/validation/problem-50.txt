Some EULAs are in fact invalid in some countries. I think this is a case for most US EULAs used in EU. US legal system has some resemblence to UK legal system, but EU legal system is in fact a mix of few totally different ideas how law should look like, and is quite different from US.
For some parts of the world, piracy is as high as 90% or above.  People don't really care or are unaware of software license at all, not to mention EULA.
The only times when an EULA is enforced would be in a corporate environment where a large number of licenses are compromised and catch the attention of the owner (e.g. MSFT). In such case, a team from the law enforcement body will raid an office and... you can imagine.
What about the right to do reverse engineering provided as fair use in copyright law, you bought the product you have that right. Then you can deny to accept the EULA, which by no means would take from you the rights acquired when you bought the product to reverse engineer it. So you reverse engineer it to take away the EULA in the installer, and then proceed using it normally without accepting the EULA. Isn't this valid?
If you understand the Dutch language then De (on)geldighed van EULAâ€™s (gastpost) will try to explain it from an European view. If you can't read Dutch, then Google Translate might still make it readable.
Some courts in the U.S. have upheld shrinkwrap license agreements.  See particularly ProCD v. Zeidenberg and more generally, Wikipedia's section on EULA enforceability.  This covers how the DMCA may apply, for example.
For some developed countries, people pay more attention and respect to properly licensed software, but still, we have an attitude of "I pay for the software so I am fine with it."  Nobody is actually reading the content of an EULA.
In the end, though, you'll find that EULAs are sometimes deemed to be enforceable and sometimes not.
