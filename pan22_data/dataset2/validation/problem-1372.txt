The system works basically fine, but only I found the NDP function seems not working correctly. Firstly I noticed, with two such devices, I cannot ping each other by their IPv6 link local address (fe80::.../10). I then used tcpdump to monitor the tun traffics and found there is no Neighbor Solicitation/Advertisement message at all. Another strange thing I found is that, there is Route Advertisement sent out from one device of the network (the master PLC device which is so-call coordinator node), but not from any other device in the network. 
I want to understand what's the correct behavior I should expect from such kind of network according to IPv6 NDP and how to make it happen.
I am working on an old code that used to connect different IPv6 devices over a different kind of network (a powe line netwrok, PLC, which is quite similar to 802.15.4). To do that, it created Linux tun/tap interfaces on each device (Tun actually, not the Tap) with C code, which can receive egress packets from tun and deliver them to the PLC and on the other direction it can read ingress packets from PLC and inject into the tun interface.
