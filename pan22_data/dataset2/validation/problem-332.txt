I found that the firmware update (HP Broadcom NX1 Online Firmware Upgrade Utility for Windows Server x64 Editions (cp025019) in the latest support pack was causing the fans to keep ramping up and down. Very annoying.
There might be some settings in the BIOS.  But from my experience it takes a good amount of heat for those fans to kick on so high...  I have only heard them full bore while rebooting or the drivers are not working in the OS correctly. I also noticed with VMware ESXi the fans run a little faster then the slowest speed after I did a BIOS update...
Check your CPU usage to make sure some rogue process isn't running the CPU 100% of the time, increasing heat, causing the fans to run full-bore.
Some rackmount HP machines that I've worked on in the past were known to run their fans at full tilt until a proprietary driver or software package is loaded in the OS. Then they would be relaxed down.
Put it in a cooler room or feed it more cool air. The fans typically ramp up as more cooling is needed. Are you monitoring any of the temp sensors to see how warm it is when it gets loud?
