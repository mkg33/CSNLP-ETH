Don't put two subnets on the same VLAN. That's trash, and there are really good reasons not to do that.
One could also use an entirely separate physical network for this (or in addition to), but since this is in a datacenter, all networks (no matter if they are on the same fabric or on an entirely different one) should have separate VLANs.
What you want can be accomplished with VLANs, and / or a separate physical network. VLANs will give you the ability to isolate the broadcast domains entirely from the public network and the private network, while staying on the same network fabric if need be via tagging.
Yeah, definitely keep the NFS stuff on a local private network, if only for security reasons. That's a pretty nasty thing to have on public addresses. Do make sure to restrict NFS to use only the private interface on the NFS server itself (if that's to be a host you manage and not a shared storage solution from the datacenter). Ideally, if you were managing the NFS server, it wouldn't even have a public IP.
Setting up VLANs on your hosts is extremely easy. You create a sub-interface with the proper vlan number (such as eth0.300 for vlan 300). Then you use it like any other interface. I imagine the datacenter will be able to provide you with two or more VLANs.
