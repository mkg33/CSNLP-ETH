The best way to explain it is like this: Imagine a factory that produces exactly one car per hour, on the hour. Say you decide to sample the rate at which the factory produces cars. You start sampling at 5:59 and stop sampling at 7:01. You see two cars produced, one at 6:00 and one at 7:00. You sampled for 62 minutes and 2 cars were produced. Thus you calculate that the factory was producing cars at about 200% of its rated capacity.
In addition, you cannot compare top values against each other because top doesn't provide you a set of measurements of a single system state but a set of independent measurements each subject to their own set of conditions.
For example, the per-CPU values can be computed using a completely different mechanism from the per-process values. The per-CPU values can be exponentially decayed while the per-process values can be the difference between two totals. So they can reflect measurements of the same type of thing, but using completely different methodologies.
