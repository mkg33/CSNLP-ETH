If you get an empty cluster, it has no center of mass. You can simply ignore this cluster (set k=k-1 for next iteration), or repeat the k-means run from a new initialization. You can also choose to place a random data point into that cluster and carry on with the algorithm if you must have this specific number of K clusters.
Three random cluster centers are initialized. At the end of first iteration points 3, 1, 2, and 7 will be in one cluster. 4 and 5 will be in another cluster. And 6 will be in the last cluster. Note here that the distance between 3 and 4 is larger than the distance between 4 and 5 and so 4 is assigned to the cluster represented by 5. Before we begin the second iteration we update the cluster centers and the following picture shows the centers and the clusters at the end of first step.
Now, the cluster center for the red cluster moved closer to point 4 due to 1, 2, and 7. And the cluster center for the blue cluster moved away from 5 due to point 4. In the next iteration point 4 will decide that it is closer to the red cluster and point 5 will decide that it is closer to the green cluster. This will cause blue cluster to be empty as shown below.
