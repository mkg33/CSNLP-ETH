That last is more Ubuntu-centric than the others, but you might still glean something useful from it even if you're not using Ubuntu.
First, be aware that EFI/UEFI isn't simply a new BIOS feature; it's a replacement for the 30-year-old BIOS. EFI also uses a new partition table type (GPT) that's replacing the older MBR. Thus, the huge chest full of BIOS- and MBR-centric tools for managing dual-boot configurations is pretty much useless on EFI-based computers. You should forget everything you ever knew about dual-booting when you deal with EFI. Also, if you run across a product and it doesn't explicitly state the boot method (BIOS vs. EFI) or partition table type (MBR vs. GPT), you should assume it's for the older BIOS and MBR systems.
That done, you can begin learning about EFI and GPT. Unfortunately, there's a lot of bad information on the Internet on this topic. Three sources you might try include:
As to your problem specifically, if your partition table has been damaged, you may be able to recover it with the help of my GPT fdisk (gdisk) utility. See in particular the GPT fdisk documentation on fixing GPT problems.
More specific advice will require more specific information from you. You could run the Boot Info Script from a live CD, post the RESULTS.txt file that it generates to a pastebin site, and post the URL to your document here. That will give us a better idea of what's happening on your system.
It's not clear that your partition table is damaged, though; it could be that your boot loader is damaged or missing. In that case, fixing the Windows boot loader will require running a Windows recovery tool, and you can then install any Linux EFI boot loader you like.
