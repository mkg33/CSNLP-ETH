Does anyone know of a program?  I would download a trial of Fireworks but that section of adobe's website is "experiencing difficulties".
recommedation appears to be PSD, and to my knowledge that's the only layered format that Fireworks supports.
Macromedia/Adobe Fireworks is stored in chunks that are marked as ancillary, private, and possibly unsafe-to-copy.
The PNG format consists of signature, and a series of data chunks. The signature lets the program know
You will need to download Macromedia/Adobe Fireworks, install it, open the image files, and export them
that this is a png file, and chunks store data. Chunks have properties to further define them. Byte 1
While I cannot find any information from Adobe/Macromedia I would assume that the layer data created by
the image-software cannot understand the chunk, or has an error it is allowed to skip the chunk. Byte 2
and page data. I would assume this is probably why in the export options it's called a Fireworks PNG.
Since the image-editor may not be able to understand the chunk this property lets it know how to use the
will define if it's data is critical, or ancillary. Critical means it contains data that is important,
display an error message. Ancillary chunks contain data that isn't important to regular presentation, if
in a different format that supports layers; it should be a format that GIMP also supports. The common
that some data may be dependent on other data in the image, and therefore would not work with a new image.
and if the image-software has issues with a critical chunk, it is required by the PNG specification to
format. Byte 4 defines if it's safe-to-copy, or unsafe-to-copy. This byte is for image-editors to tell
the data is specific to a third party. Byte 3 is just a reserved property for future revisions of the PNG
