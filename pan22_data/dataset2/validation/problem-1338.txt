At the same time these signal are missing in Mini DP pure connector. http://pinouts.ru/Video/mini_displayport.shtml
So, additional circuit is required inside the adapter to convert signal levels from DP to VGA. Like this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#/media/File:DP_to_DVI_converter_unmounted.jpg
VGA is analog port using basically 3 signals. When signal is converted between HDMI, DVI and VGA the same 4 contacts are used (see picture):
Where @Hardoman description is completely accurate, the shorter answer is simply that you can't magically convert analog signalling to digital.  VGA adapters typically only carry the existing analog signals to a display that supports analog inputs. (on the same cable that could do digital)  Display-port (and Mini-DP) are digital-only.  There is no Analog support.  So, you'll never find a passive VGA/Mini-DP adapter.  There are some active converters that will essentially take the analog signal, and process the data to produce a digital signal, but these generally are expensive, and only work for a limited set of resolutions/sync rates/etc...
The chip on the board converts the voltage levels generated by the dual-mode DisplayPort device to be compatible with a DVI monitor. Another is required to convert signals to TTL VGA levels.
