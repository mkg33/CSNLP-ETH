If you cannot find the option then Office 2007 does support the ability to create protected PDF documents.  While the PDF standard is open, certain features, are only supported by certain editors.
Creating protected PDF documents is one of the features, that only certain editors support, which means programs like Foxit will not respect the fact the document is protected.
Since Office 2007 does not have the option you would need to purchase PDF authoring software that does support it.  However, I will again point out that, programs like Foxit will not respect the fact the document is protected.
I am currently using Microsoft Office 2007 version. It has all the updates released so far. There is an option to save documents as pdf but I cannot find an option to protect them from copying its content or editing. In other words to make them read-only. I attempted to use Foxit Reader but it does not seem to have this option neither. There is a way to protect documents with MS Word own protection but that's not exactly what I am looking for. Does it exist a way for this which doesn't involve the necesity to purchase an additional software for that matter?
