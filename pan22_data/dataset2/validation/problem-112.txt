Most sites have a favicon to leave an impression on visitors. It's not needed, but helps distinguish from other sites (say in your bookmarks or something similar).
You don't, of course, need to do this.  It just gives a web site a little bit more personality and recognizability.  I suppose you could do as you suggest and put up a blank icon file, but if you'll go to that much trouble, you should just put up a real one.
Why don't you just create a small icon that suits your web site and use that?  It's trivial to do.  Most modern browsers look for this file.  I haven't tried it myself, but Googling, I found the website favicon.ico Generator that presents a simple image editor interface.
I had this clogging up the Apache logs and wanted to clear it out. For one of my websites, I created a valid favicon.ico. For the rest of my virtual hosts, I simply "touch favicon.ico" and created an empty one [Note: Apache running on Linux]. No more errors in the error logs.
I thought about the waste of resources, but only for a short time. If I provided a real favicon.ico, then I would be transferring a lot of bytes very frequently. If I provided nothing, I would be sending back a 404 response. Sending back a zero length file appears to me to be the least waste of resources and bandwidth. And my error logs are clear of a spurious problem, so I can focus on real problems with my webserver.
While not required, having a favicon.ico will improve the user's experience on your webpage.  Most modern browers request one, and not having one requires your server to generate a 404 error and send this back to the browser.  404 errors can degrade the user performance because of how slow they are.
In these days of tabbed browsing, the favicon is more important to me than ever - I wouldn't consider running a site without one.
