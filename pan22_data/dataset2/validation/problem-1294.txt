This formula only works halfway. The condition in the IF formula is working. However, the "value/action if true" is the part I have issue with. After finding the correct productID where the "X.test" is greater then 3 I want to fetch the comment on that row. I'm currently using VLOOKUP again, but that will only find the comment associated with the first productID it finds, not if the period in the same row is greater then 3.
I have tried using match, row and index. However the combination between them might not been right. The solution might just be right in front of my eyes without realizing it. 
After reading multiple posts on this forum and others without having any success or finding similar problems I've decided to try my luck with my own post. I will try to explain the problem to the best of my ability without pictures from excel. Hope you'll understand.
I added a IFERROR in case VLOOKUP doesnÂ´t find the ID. As stated by @Alex M, you where missing the number of returned chars.  
What I want to do is fetch the comment from Sheet1 based on the ProductID from Sheet2. However, I only want the comment if the number in the period column is greater then 3. For example "2.test" is not ok, but "4.test" is fine. 
My current DAX formula (located in the Comment column in Sheet2) is described below. Worth mentioning, since it's not clear from my illustration of the sheets, is that B2 is the cell containing 123 in the ProductID column in Sheet2.
