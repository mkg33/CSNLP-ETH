OS X Lion by default sets the locale in env variable LANG in Terminal. This was set to nl_NL.UTF-8. Sshd on the CentOS system imports this environment variable in its shell when you ssh into your CentOS box.
Don't know if you run OS X on your desktop, but bottom line is: sshd on CentOS imports the locale settings from the ssh client workstation.
At least Fedora 16 defines language in GRUB command line. See /boot/grub/grub.conf and /etc/grub.conf. 
Apart from the fact that this greatly bothers me, I am having a pretty hard time actually changing it back. There does not seem to be a setlocale function, and system-config-language tells me I am using an English locale, even though my environment says otherwise.
Both my ~/.bashrc as ~/.bash_profile contain no locale settings. Additionally, /etc/bashrc does not contain any locale references either.
I just stumbled on this exact same problem, and found out why this is happens in my case and thought i'd share. I recently got a new iMac at work that runs OS X Lion (previous workstation was OS X Snow Leopard)
I solved it by disabling 'Set locale environment variables on startup' in Terminal preferences (settings->advanced)
