When someone accesses the php file over http through your web server, they will only see blank output.
As an exmaple, any wordpress installation has it's config file in the root dir. But as it don't echoes the vars there is no security issue, as long as the files are treated as PHP scripts and not text files. But it is a good idea to block direct URL access to such files through a .htaccess file password protection.
It sounds like apache is not configured to execute your php files and is instead serving them as test/html.
Under windows the path "modules/libphp5.so" will need to be modified to point to the php module, which might be a dll.
No, you can't reach those files as a text file using this address (assuming your site is functioning)
See  http://php.net/manual/en/install.windows.apache2.php and http://httpd.apache.org/docs/ for details.
Alternatively, (and not as good), you can make sure that your config files are treated as php files, then start them with the php open tag:
Try not putting your config files in a public directory. If the content on your web server is in here:
