In each static method I instantiate an instance of the DatabaseMySQL class. In each static method I set the correct static $table name to be used in the SQL queries dynmically by getting the name of the class and appending an s to it. So if my class was User, that would make the table name users. 
However I am still not clear about a few things. I am posting my code here in a clear and concise way and hope that people can point out both the good practices and the bad ones. I will list all my questions at the end.
My next file I have is my class that all my other classes inherit from.  I have called it MainModel. I have no idea if this follows convention or not.
Let me start with a little introduction. I am in the process of learning OOP in PHP. I have also researched Design Patterns but have not yet fully grasped the different types of concepts. I am at the stage where every few months I realise that I am not doing things the correct way and have to change my style. This is so frustrating. Therefore I would like to find out the correct way of doing things once and for all. I have tried to fully read up on Stackoverflow about the following topics:
In my constructer I have placed an optional array which can be used to insert some variables as properties of an object as it is created. This way everything is done dynamically which leaves me to the final stage of my project. My inheritance classes.
This is my Database class file. This class allows me to create as many instances as I like of this class and it will reuse the already instantiated PDO object stored as a Static property of the class. It also fetches the data from the result set using PDO to get the data as objects of a specified class.
To summarise this file. I use static methods like find_by_id($int) that generate objects of the called class dynamically. I am using Late Static Bindings to gain access to the name of the called class and I use the $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_CLASS, $class_name) to instantiate these objects with the data from the database automatically converted into objects. 
Please do not close as a duplicate, I have honestly searched through almost every question on the topic but I still want to know a few things which I have not been able to clarify. Sorry it is so long but I have tried to organize it so it should read well!
