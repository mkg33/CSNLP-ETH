Your computer is connected to a proxy server ( Local IP: 10.10.80.12). This proxy server has two IP addresses(Local & External). This proxy server is connected to Internet. It's external IP is 212.25.28.65 which is given by the ISP. Your computer's IP address is 10.10.80.111. 
Your computer has one IP address 212.25.28.65 which is given by the ISP. Your friend's computer IP address is 121.15.27.65 which is given by the ISP.  
Router1 is connected to Router2. It means LAN1 (Network 1) is connected to LAN2 (Network 2) via Router1 and Router2. 
Your friend's computer is connected to another proxy server ( Local IP: 10.10.80.13). This proxy server has two IP addresses(Local & External). This proxy server is connected to Internet. It's external IP is 121.15.27.65 which is given by the ISP. Your friend's computer IP address is 10.10.80.111. 
In this situation if you type 'what is my IP address' in google you will be seeing your IP is (212.25.28.65). Because this is the external IP. 
But within a single network, IP address is unique. It means, if the IP address (192.168.0.100) is assigned to you no other person can have the same IP address (192.168.0.100). Because IP address is unique within a single network. 
(You) 10.10.80.111 <--> 10.10.80.12 (212.25.28.65) <--> Internet <--> 121.15.27.65 <--> 10.10.80.13 <--> 10.10.80.111 (Your Friend)
I would suggest you to read functions of 7 layers in OSI model. Also read the devices that are involved in data transmission.  
Let's assume your computer is within a LAN (let's say LAN1), and your computer's IP address is 192.168.0.100. Your friend is in another LAN  (Let's say LAN2) with the same IP 192.168.0.100. Now you want to chat with your friend. How will it happen ?
