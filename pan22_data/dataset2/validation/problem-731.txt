Change the domain of the client and rechange it back to the same domain this should reset the VTP counter and now the client will get the VLANS from the VLAN server
I think you should check whether you configure the client switch port with mode trunk or not, it update automatically, right after you put the right domain name and password.
A vtp advertisement is sent only when their is a change in the revision number. How we can change the revision number? Pretty easy.. create and delete a dummy vlan. We cant force a client to pull the update from the server.
Updates to VTP are only sent out when there is an increment to the VTP revision number. The only way to 'force' an update is to create an erroneous Vlan and then delete it. This will accomplish a 'force update' and send the change out to the rest of your clients.
While most people get the vtp config setup they sometimes forget to trunk the interface. When all your vtp stuff looks right (but config rev not incrementing/updating) then it's probably a trunking issue on the int itself - try switchport trunk encap dot1q/isl then switchport mode trunk - should do the trick - kerry_13 had this exactly right, that answer should be at the top for all the times i've seen new guys do it.
