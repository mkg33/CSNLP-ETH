The "rules" vary depending on your requirements. And there are special cases, like, for example ZFS: "At 90% capacity, ZFS switches from performance- to space-based optimization, which has massive performance implications.". Yes, this is a design aspect of ZFS...not something derived via observation or anecdotal evidence. Obviously, this is less of an issue if your ZFS storage pool consists solely of SSDs. However, even with spinning disks, you can happily reach 99% or 100% when you deal with static storage and you don't need top-notch performance - for example, your personal all-time favorite movie collection, which never changes and where safety is priority 1.
If this is a media or long-term storage drive, then 5% to 10% free should be sufficient, and 10% would be preferable if it is a spinning disk. You don't need as much free space because this drive will rarely require data to be moved, so performance isn't nearly as much of a factor. The free space is useful mainly to allow bad sectors to be discarded and replaced, and to allow files to be more contiguous. 
For SSDs there should be some space left because rewrite rate then increases and negatively affects write performance of the disk. The 80% full is safe value probably for all SSD disks, some latest models may work fine even with 90-95% occupied capacity.
I wouldn't push any drive past 95% capacity for more than a day unless there is a very good, clear reason.
Next, btrfs - an extreme case: when free space gets too low (a few MByte), you can hit the point of no return. No, deleting files is not an option, as you can't. There is simply not enough space to delete files. btrfs is a COW (copy-on-write) file system, and you can reach a point where you cannot modify metadata any more. At this point, you can still add additional storage to your file system (a USB thumb drive might work), then delete files from the expanded file system, then shrink the file system and remove the additional storage again). Again, this is some aspect caused by the design of the file system.
One thing to consider with mechanical drives is that the throughput of the outer edge is higher than the inside. This is because there are more sectors per revolution for the larger circumference of the outside.
People who can give you "real (serious) data" are probably the ones which deal with "real (serious) storage". Twisty's (excellent) answer mentiones hybrid arrays (consisting of massive amounts of cheap slow spinning, lots of fast spinning disks, many SSDs...) which are operated in an enterprise environment where the major limiting factor is the speed at which the admin is able to order upgrades. Going from 16T to 35T can take 6 months...so you end up with seriously backed reports which suggest to set your alarm to 50%.
There are many, many factors that contribute to the result in very setup-specific amounts. So, there's no hard-and-fast number, this can only be measured as a function of those parameters. (That's probably why other users report no specific research on this specific subject made - too many variables to compile anything conclusive.)
If this is the main drive on the computer and files may be moved, then 20% free space should prevent significant slowdowns. This will allow enough open space throughout the drive for data to be moved and copied as needed. A spinning drive will work best when the free locations are nearer to the original data, while in an SSD the physical location doesn't affect daily performance. So, the spinning drive should have more free space for purely performance reasons. On the SSD, the reduced free space will reduce drive longevity, but it won't reduce performance. SSD's try to store temporary data and random download files in least-used locations so they can balance the cell usage across the entire drive; otherwise a portion of the drive will age much faster than the rest of it. Some newer SSDs may intelligently re-arrange files so the empty space moves, but older drives may not do this.
As the drive reaches capacity, perfomance will decrease because only slower inner sectors will be available.
It depends on the intended usage of the drive, but in general 20% to 15% free space is a good answer for spinning disks, and 10% or more is good for SSDs.
