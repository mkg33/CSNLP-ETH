The router is running a dhcp server, and I would like that wifi clients get their ip directly from the router without any "routing" in the ubuntu box.
You will need an extra interface for the machine itself tough. Or you can look for tricks that will leave the bridged interface usable by the machine as a normal ethernet interface.
So, you basically want your Ubuntu box to act as a repeater or media converter, otherwise known as a bridge.  Try adding something like this to /etc/network/interfaces:
I am quite sure it is not possible for clients to get IPs from router without "any" routing in ububtu box. The box will not route traffic from WiFi to LAN and back all by itself.
Read http://www.linux.com/archive/articles/55617 for a fine introduction to wireless access point configuration under Linux, including securing and bridging. Note that not every chipset can run in AP mode, so your mileage may vary.
You can bridge the ethernet interface and wi-fi interface, and all the traffic will pass unmodified. Your router will see DHCP requests from wireless clients and answer them.
