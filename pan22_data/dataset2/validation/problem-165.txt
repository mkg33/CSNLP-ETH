I had this problem and after check for leading spaces and getting rid of the filters, I finally solved it by copying the non-sorting cells and paste special them as "unformatted text" into Word and then copying and pasting them back into Excel.  No idea how they picked up some kind of un-sortable formatting as they appeared normal.
You might have some of your rows in a table and some not. If you have banded rows, then those are probably in a table.  Check the Design tab, Properties group, click Resize Table and make sure the range covers all of your rows.
I just encountered a similar issue.  The answer ended up being that some of my cells in the sort column were entered as text, and some were vlookups from another page.  The cells with vlookup formulas were not sorting properly either through a filter or through a sort.  I copied the spreadsheet and pasted as values over the top of it and it sorted properly after that (although I lost they dynamic nature of the lookups.
I copied and pasted my data into a new sheet, without the headers.  It sorted properly.  Be sure to save your work prior to trying anything new!
You've not told us what type of data you are using. Mixed data can cause all kinds of issues with sorting. If it is mixed, it should be formatted as text. Here is more info about how to troubleshoot sorting.
If you've reentered the data it is likely you've gotten rid of blanks. It is possible the rows are not included in the sort because they are not selected. If those 43 rows are not included in the sort grouping, they will not be sorted in the order you choose and will appear in their own group. Verify they are being included and retry the sort.
