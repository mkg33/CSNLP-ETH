I don't know of any way to do this natively to bind9 if you're using flatfile backend. There are various DB-backed systems which can help automate it.  Or you can script it:
For the amount of zones I have, syncing manually ended up being easier than getting any other solution to work. If I had many more zones I'd look into the proposed solutions.
I've also experimented with stuffing all the domains to propagate into a special zone, and used a simple script on the slaves to rebuild the named.conf based on what they see in the master zone. Basically the same deal as the text file above, but feeding it from DNS to keep everything in-band. I should probably publish the script before I end up losing it =/
I populate a text file with a list of zones and the primary NS IP for the zone, and stick it on a website that I allow my slaves access to. The slaves fetch this file periodically, and if it has changed they parse it generate a named.conf, and tell bind to reload configs. It's "automatic" in the sense that I don't have to manually ssh to my secondaries and update configs, but it's still external to bind9.
While this won't go back and clean up any mess that you have currently, it does make it really easy to synchronize machines that you are able to manage using "rndc" going forward.
Using rsync on your entire /var/named tree works pretty well if you write your zones correctly and make sure named.conf lives in /var/named. It won't work with dynamic updates though, and is sorta against the grain for "how things should be done".
In the days of everybody and their mom having their own domains, it surprises me there isn't a good solution for this integrated with Bind by now =/
Maybe you're looking for a configuration management system like Puppet or CFEngine? There's extra infrastructure involved, but they can handle distributing a lot of configuration stuff, and could easily include this too.
Look at BIND 9.7.2-P2 in which you have the "rndc addzone" and "rndc delzone" statements that allow you to "remotely" add and remove zones from a running server.
You could also use a higher level configuration management system such as puppet, to manage your entire DNS infrastructure. That's a bit more complicated though.
