That Microsoft moved the Users folder to the root directory for Vista and 7 probably is a good indication of how many people prefer the root directory (default "c:") in practice.
However, I'd bet that many programmers were lazy and just decided to plop their program into C:\ by default, just out of convenience.
Some programs malfunction when they exist in a path with spaces (i.e. "Program Files"), which is why they are installed to the root of C:.
As Tonny suggested, this is partly to simplify tech support, but it's also for your own convenience.  When you extract the driver files to a location that's easy to find and accessible to all users, it's also easy for the system to locate the files again if you need to reinstall the drivers.  Unfortunately, most vendors do not clean up old files, so you can end up with gigabytes of old driver packages that will never be used again.  In some cases it may be more appropriate to extract them to %TEMP% or to the "All Users" account, and some vendors do exactly that.
You state that this concerns Windows only, but the software may be ported to/from other operating systems.  Also, there may be differences between Windows versions, e.g. some translated versions of Windows also have this folder name translated, and the user can also change the location (e.g. instead of "C:\Program Files" I used "P:\" for a while).  This can all be detected by the software, but it's easier to use a fixed location.  Also  in the case of drivers it could be necessary to know where the files are at a time that this information is not available from the OS.
Although 'most' software and configuration files can handle long directory paths, mixed capitalization, spaces and 'nonstandard' characters, they don't always and tripping up on this in the middle of your work-flow can be a minor hassle.. 
Some developers don't follow standard conventions because they're either unaware or too lazy to do things "right."  Many amateur developers will also hard-code paths into their software and/or installers rather than querying the environment (e.g., %TEMP%, %APPDATA%, %PROGRAMFILES%).
