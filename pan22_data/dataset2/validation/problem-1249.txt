It's got all (most?) of the bells and whistles others' do, plus a few extras (like 'grid' storage between clients and such).  It's pretty straight-forward to setup and run, and for our purposes it was/is way cheaper then I would have thought it would be. :)
Do you have a solution in place for clients that are inside your corporate network? If so, can that solution be extended using a VPN solution?
There's an open source solution that looks promising. (never used it but I have heard good things) http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/info.html
Personally, I'd use rsync as a preference. Setup the outside server with rsync (there by default on Linux, Deltacopy on Windows. You can then install the Deltacopy client onto any Windows machines you wish to backup, and while the first backup will take a long time, subsequent ones will be very quick.
We use Vembu's StoreGrid to do our in-house backups, as well as provide off-site (to our private servers) for our clients.
If you aren't happy on Linux, or don't have the option to setup an rsync server; then FTP is probably your best option. I've used Cobian in the past (free, used to be open source) - it supports full/incremental/differential backups, and have options to keep multiple timestamped copies. If thee server is untrusted, it can also encrypt the files for you.
