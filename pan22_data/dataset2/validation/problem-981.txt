Hot swap hard disk trays are indeed intended to allow you add and remove disks without shutting the system (typically a server) down. 
In a professional environment swappable and extractable backups are traditionally done with tape systems.
But yes, you could use some hot swapping systems for backing up under some conditions. Taking into account that those are meant for replacing damaged components, e.g. disk or power drives.
There is a consequence of being meant for replacing damages, not backups, and that is that this hot swap systems often take several hours to rebuild, in case of hard disk drives common RAID systems.
This process works well and really works on its own other than remembering to swap a drive, but wouldn't be suitable for large arrays (like a SAN, for instance) or if you're packing multiple terabytes of data.
I would consider purchasing a NAS device with its own RAID array to do your backups. We (the company I work for) has a NAS that all our backup jobs dump their data to on a daily basis allowing us to leverage incremental backups. The NAS is in turn backed up via USB3 to an external disk which is taken off-site nightly (we use two disks so one is always connected).
Making back-ups to removable disks is a viable solution for small business but my recommendation would be to use an interface designed for removable storage like USB3, firewire or if you're fruity, thunderbolt and not hot swap disks.
The primary purpose though is to facilitate easy replacement of broken disks or adding disks in RAID arrays. That means that the mechanical engineering is typically designed for incidental use and it will not stand up to the wear and tear of daily disk swaps. 
In addition, it would mean that after removing the disk you would need to use the RAID controllers management tooling to present the disk to the your server as it won't magically appear.
