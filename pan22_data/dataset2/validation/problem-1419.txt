Inside the DigitalOcean web interface you can rename the droplet Select Droplet->"Settings"->"Rename"
As to why the option in  previous answer does not exist, CoreOS does not ship Python cloud-init had to be re-written in a compiled language (hence it being written in Go.  To view the metadata on DigitalOcean log into the host and run the command:
On DigitalOcean (and some other cloud providers; Openstack for example) they're providing metadata on each boot of the machine (either provided via cloud-config  or via the options you provided in the DigitalOcean web interface).  When you bestowed a name on the droplet/VM you signified to the metadata service that you wanted the hostname to be called that value.  cloud-config is honoring the request put forth by the DigitalOcean metadata service.  This is actually a design pattern and operating outside of it would me much like trying to avoid uing convention over configuration in Rails.  You can do it, but you're only making things harder on yourself.
