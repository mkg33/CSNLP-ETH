An analytic proof could go like this: assume the distance matrix did not characterize the graph uniquely, then you could build two graphs that are different from the same matrix...
If you are given two sets and they are identical, does this imply the graphs corresponding to each set are also essentially the same?
I think the following example with four points answers your question (though it gives multi-sets of distances). See Reconstructing Sets From Interpoint Distances by Skiena, Smith, and Lemke for more information.
Now imagine I put the elements from the upper triangle into a set, such that you no longer know which pairs of points produce the distance values. This is essentially the set of edge weights, with no information regarding the relationship between the weight and the edge the weight belongs to.
A distance matrix uniquely characterizes a topology in a given space on some give elements given some property such as distance assuming a few ground hypotheses...
Let $D$ be the distance matrix between all pairs of points, such that entry $D_{ij}$ corresponds to the distance between points $i$ and $j$. This matrix is of size $n \times n$ and the upper-triangle contains the distances between unique pairings of points.
In your case, the distance matrix is defined from a given vertex to the other. If the matrix is symmetric with 0-diagonals, you have a simply connected graph. If you have diagonal elements, you are allowed to use self-loops and if the matrix is not symmetric, you have a digraph.
There are $n$ points in $R^2$ (i.e. the 2D real space). We can think of them as a complete graph where edge weights correspond to the distance between points.
Additional information on the subject can be found in terms of spectral craph theory, which only defines isospectrality, not isomorphism.
