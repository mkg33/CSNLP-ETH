Spend your time and effort on adding storage, providing an easy to use file repository for your users, implement mail quotas and educate your users - it'll be much cheaper and you'll save yourself a world of pain.
If you're looking for a new mail server, then I believe that both Dovecot and Cyrus support single instance storage.
Having previously run OpenMail systems which do exactly that I would very strongly recommend you find a different solution to the problem. There aren't many mailservers capable of doing this, they are niche products and they are very complicated.
Exchange 5.5, 2003, and 2007 all are capable of using Single Instance Storage, which is pretty much exactly what you're asking for. It's per-database, but it's better than nothing.
2007 changed it to only work on attachments, and 2010 did away with SIS altogether due to some of the scaling issues and lack of overall effectiveness over time. Here's a blog entry on Technet explaining it a bit.
As an alternative idea - you could use storage that does de-duplication. I think NetApp can do something like this. Although, it may still be cheaper just to buy more storage. Just my 2 cents.
