The first thing to do, before investing a bunch of time in a programming project, is to see what is already done.  Don't uselessly repeat a bunch of work (and possibly do an inferior job), only to later learn that there is a popular re-release that already accomplished your goals.  Many organizations have released source code of some popular software, including "id Software".  (A comment by JakeGould, mentioned earlier on this page, refers to the "open" source code for "Wolfenstein 3D Engine".  The Blake Stone game simply used a minor enhancement to that engine, so check on that engine.)  Other popular re-releases/re-makes include Descent ][ (Descent 2 @ DDN ; and D2X project and hyperlinked projects).  For WarCraft ][, there is War2.ru unofficial port/remake.  Clones may include Stratagus (WarCraft 2), or FreeDOOM.  Those are just some selections based on some games I've enjoyed (which were popular around the time of Blake Stone, or shortly after).  Many others exist, as seen by Wikipedia's list of commercial video games with available source code, and Wikipedia's list of Open Source video games.
Sure.  There is nothing technically preventing you from re-writing the whole game.  Note that I'm just referring to what is possible, from a technology standpoint.  Many popular games were "intellectual property", so there may be some issues from a standpoint of legality.
I don't know where you got that idea.  Having unique-per-game "Copy protection" methods seemed to be more common back in the DOS era than today.
I was wondering if I can use the old files and rewrite some code (or the whole game) to create a version for modern windows to process.
 I noticed that back then piracy wasn't as big of a problem as it is today so I have access to all the files I need from the original disks.
