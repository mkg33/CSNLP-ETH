On a side note, some browsers will even cache data for pages you havent even looked at yet.  This is called pre-fetching.  While you are looking at a web page the browser will navigate the links in the background and start downloading those pages into its cache, just so they will load faster in case you do click those links.
This is due to your browser caching the files.  Caching temporarily saves the data you view to your hard drive.  This includes the text and images on web pages, and therefore the icons in question.
What is the purpose of caching data?  Speed.  By downloading the files locally, you dont have to download the data repeatedly as you navigate the website, or go back to it at a later date/time.  In some cases, the time saved is insignificant, but in others, you can visibly see pages load instantly, as you already have the data.
As people mentioned in the comments, if you clear your browser's cache, the icons will disappear.  However, if you open a different browser and test it, the icons wont appear, as they were never cached by that browser.
