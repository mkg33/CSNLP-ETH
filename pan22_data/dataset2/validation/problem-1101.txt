Ultimately.. installed opera 28, installed extension "Disable Youtubeâ„¢ HTML5 Player" and it's good now. 
The firefox extension Flash Control always worked for me. It disables autoplay of both flash and html5 media. It provides placeholders F for flash and V for html5 media that can be clicked to get played.
But now that HTML5 video is getting popular, I see a lot of ads popping into view again. They are not only a distraction, they hog resources on my computer and make the fans spin full speed.
The bad thing about Flash video was that it required a third-party plugin to play the content. The good thing was I could select which content to play; using the click-to-play feature in Firefox and Chrome.
For Chrome/Chromium, there is HTTP Switchboard (available in Chrome store or github). There is a column in the matrix which can be selectively be turned on or off, which turn on/off HTML5 video/audio/SVG/fonts -- for whatever hostnames you wish.
In Firefox you can set media.autoplay.enabled to false in about:config though as of now this may not be sufficient for every case. An extension like NoScript (default settings) could be used to complement the missing functionality or even otherwise used by itself without the about:config setting. In NoScript it's also possible to extend the functionality to whitelisted sites (NoScript Options > Whitelist) via NoScript Options > Embeddings: Apply these restrictions ...
