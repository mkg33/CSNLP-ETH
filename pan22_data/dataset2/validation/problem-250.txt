Say, I have an executable file that I want to pass a parameter to from a .bat file. The catch is that the parameter value must have a newline in it.
One possible workaround is if the program recognizes an escape sequence, such as recognizing \n.  (JScript, supported as .js files that CScript can use, supports the unescape command.  WScript.Echo(unescape("%0d0a"));)
The file format of a batch file assumes that the newline character ends a line.  There is no supported escape sequence.  So, what you're asking for cannot be done.
Similar to why the chown Unix command uses a colon as a separator: chown assumes usernames end with colons.  Likewise, batch files have a file format.
Another common approach to handle this is if a program supports a data stream, which could be a specified filename or the "standard input" stream.  Newline characters/sequences can be provided to a program that way.
Those approaches are used by multiple programs.  I'm not offhand recalling any way to just have batch ignore a newline character, nor any other standardized way to try to encode that character in a way that all/most programs will recognize the character(s) that you're trying to refer to.
