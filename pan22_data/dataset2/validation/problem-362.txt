I have read that there is a difference between OneNote and OneNote 2016 (and 2010, 2013, etc.), and in the lightweight version, it seems I cannot insert equations, customize the layout, etc.
Microsoft have further obfuscated the downloading of Office 2016 Onenote.  The only place I could find at Microsoft was here (32-bit) and here (64-bit).  These currently redirect to these download links (though for how long remains to be seen).
You can also download these from Softpedia, as well as an Office iso from there (although I've not tried that).

These versions of the programs are very keen for you to login to a school/business account - I had to fiddle around to get it working with my personal MS account.
Despite MS's promise to provide the same functionality in the MS Store version of OneNote, there remain significant differences e.g. tags are not fully supported - search is expected next month, and it looks as though the facility to save to local filestore will never appear.
I have Windows 10 with OneNote pre-installed, but it's a very lightweight version of the real OneNote 2016.
Microsoft has hidden the download link somewhat recently, which could mean, that this version will not be there forever. But as for now you still find it here:
How can I install OneNote 2016? If I go to www.onenote.com to install the full version, it says that OneNote was already shipped with Windows 10.
You can download OneNote 2016 at here, despite what the website says, you are eventually sent to the executable download.
