On your computer, you will need to add the printer as a TCP-IP printer. For this you will need to know the public IP address of your Google Wi-Fi mesh. This can be found as the “WAN IP Address” in the Network tab of your Google Wi-Fi app. 
Set your printer up to allow the TCP-IP connection on port 9100 if this setting is not already enabled. Check your printer documentation on how to do this, as it will vary by make and model.
In the Google Wi-Fi configuration, set the printer to have a static DHCP address by doing the following:
I would suggest using port forwarding instead. If you can print to your wireless printer over TCP-IP, then you don’t need to connect your desktop to the wifi at all.
Next, you will enable port forwarding. Specifically forward port 9100 to the DHCP address you just reserved for the printer. 
You should now be able to print directly to your wireless printer from anywhere you have internet access. Even if you’re not on the same network as the printer, it should send the print request to the printer. You can now disconnect your computer from your Google Wi-Fi, ensuring all your traffic is going through the wired connection.
