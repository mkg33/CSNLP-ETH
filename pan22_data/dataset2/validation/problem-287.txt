I don't know what your voltage is, but 90 A would only sound sensible with something like telco-rack 48 V equipment.
APCs switched rack PDUs do support a "staggered" powerup - you can set a powerup delay on each outlet. Other manufacturer's gear might do that for you as well, but I only ever worked with APC stuff. Apart from that, most server systems and disk arrays (or rather their controllers) also would not power up all drives at once - this helps keeping current spikes down.
The nameplate draw is going to be maximum configuration worst-case draw. I'll second the power advisors that ewwhite suggested (I use the APC one when building out racks myself), and using a power meter to figure out your actual configured power use, if you have the equipment already (or if you can get eval equipment to test with). 
I use the HP Power Advisor and the APC UPS Selector tool to provide a good estimate of power requirements. The APC tool has a great database of common telco/server equipment, and provides a way to build in some headroom for expansion.
I've used things like Kill-a-watt (which plugs into the wall and your server plugs into it) to evaluate single power supply load, or dual with a split power cable. Some of the metered/managed PDUs will report on current draw (pun not intended to be funny) so you can figure it out without unplugging/rebooting your server. But if you have dual power supplies into separate PDUs, which is sensible, you may not get the whole picture. 
Also, the storage array and switches may vary widely in power use. I had enterprise storage arrays that warranted 2-3 dedicated 20A circuits each; if your array has multiple controllers and dozens of drives, it's different than, say, a 1u 4-drive storage array. Often the vendor will have recommended practices, and the vendor SE should know how accurate the published specs are and what people are actually doing as far as power distribution. Ideal is not always practical. 
Rather than looking at the power supply rating, you should be looking into the data sheet for the specific system for a better estimate on power consumption. The supplies already come over-engineered, so just because a system runs with 2x 1200 Watts PSUs does not mean that it will suck down 2,400 Watts at any point in time - especially since those would be running in a redundant configuration which are meant to provide enough power for every situation even in the case of failure of one of the PSUs.
