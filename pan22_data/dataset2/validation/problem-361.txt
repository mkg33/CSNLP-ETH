You can also use UltraMon (non-free, Windows, GUI) to set up a keyboard shortcut to move a window to the next or previous monitor.
Win + Alt + Arrow: Move the active window to the monitor whose direction is indicated by the arrow. Note that this may cause your window to move outside the screen if you try to go up from monitor 2 or right from monitor 3 in your setup. I'll update it in the future.
I had the same issue with winamp. The only (unsatisfactory) solution i found so far: change the screen resolution to a different one and back
In this case, if you can open additional instances of the application, do so.  The first few instances will almost certainly appear in the task bar as yet more phantom windows.  Keep doing this.  Eventually, they will begin to populate the primary view.  Then use the task bar icon to right click and close the off-screen instances.  Once there are NO off-screen instances open, close the ones on the primary screen.  Next time you open that application, it will appear on the primary screen and not "off camera."
I use a nifty little tool called Shove-it which simply checks whether any window is outside the screen edge and shoves it back onto the screen again. It's ancient software (and the homepage proves it) but works on all Windows versions.
In some cases, despite having multiple screens at the remote location, you may not have access to them from your location.  The key commands won't work because you have been locked out of any view that is not on your screen.
I've written a tool called Borderline that will automatically move off-screen windows back on-screen when run.  You have to run it when you need it (works best if you assign it a keyboard shortcut or put it in the start menu), but that also means it's not always running in the background.
