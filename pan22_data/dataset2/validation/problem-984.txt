in order to use that on any computer, you have to digitise the signal first, which is usually done via a framegrabber card in the computer.
if you are getting an HDV-stream (which is really an MPEG-TS stream over ieee1394), there is a separte hdv1394src object:
most other protocols you will found out there (e.g. GigE) are proprietary, industrial grade procolls (and don't offer "camcorder" hardware)
that's where all the webcams come into play, probably some external analog2usb devices, maybe some "camcorders".
bttv (bt878) and connexant based grabber PCI(e)-cards are very good supported on linux (others are probably well, but i never used them), and in my experience this is still the way to go if you need low-latency, but unfortunately these cards are getting sparse.
industrial firewire cameras (mostly used for image-recognition and the like; there is no "camcorder" on the market using this protocol, so i only add it for completeness sake) used a protocol called "IIDC".
Can I use a camcorder as V4L2src in gstreamer? Simply can I use a camcorder as a webcam in Linux? If so what models are sported?
a DV-stream contains both audio and video, so in order to get an image you have to first grab the DV-stream  then split the two (audio and video) streams apart (aka "demultiplex/demux them") and then decode the resulting video-stream.
