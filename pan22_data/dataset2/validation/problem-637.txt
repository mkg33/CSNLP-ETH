Restoring though is going to be trickier if you are using POP3. Using IMAP is easy, delete the profile and start again. Though that does loose your filters, saved searches and so on so export what you want before deleting. With IMAP, everything is kept on the server and Thunderbird just keeps a local copy if you ask it to.
If you are using POP3 rather than IMAP, I think you should see similar things though with a slightly different layout under a POPMail folder - though I'm a little rusty on POP3 mail in Thunderbird as I haven't used it for a very long time.
It looks like there is not just the <containing-folder>.sbd directory, but also a <containing-folder> file. After having restored that from a backup, I could access the subfolders again. If the <containing-folder> did not contain important information, but the subfolders do, one also can reactivate the subfolders by creating an empty <containing-folder> file.
In that folder, you will find a bunch of stuff including sub-folders for each server you connect to. An in there are a sub folder for the top level of the mail server and in there are files that contain the actual mail.
Let me know if you are using POP3 and find a file for the folder you want to restore and I'll try to remember how to restore it (if it is possible).
My situation was that the mail server was wiped and I only had Thunderbird local copies. The only way I was able to make Thunderbird see those folders was to copy the IMAP mailboxes to the Local Account, see the images below. Make sure Thunderbird is shutdown, also there was some corruption but it was better then nothing, I don't think the .msf files are needed as they are re-generated.
