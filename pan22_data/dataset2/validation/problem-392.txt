One last thing.  I tried to also run root-kit revealer and IceSword so I could do a rootkit scan on my machine and neither of them would run and I am pretty sure it is because I am running a 64-bit OS. 
I am also a computer professional so I have a pretty good idea when NOT to click OK on a windows dialog that looks rogue.  
I was at work and got a help desk call about a rather severe malware infection and it got me thinking about my own computer.  
I am running Windows 7 64-bit RC1 on my everyday laptop.  I run ESET NOD32 antivirus which does a good job of keeping itself up to date.  I never turned off UAC.
All that to say that I think I am clean but I wanted to be sure so I booted into safe-mode and downloaded and did a quick scan using the well-recommended anti-malware tool MalwareBytes tool.  It only found a strange registry entry which I deleted.  No file or folder problems were detected.  I rebooted to complete the clean as it requested.  I was surprised by this because all it did was clean a registry entry.
After re-booting normally, WinPatrol warned about new program MalwareBytes which I expected and allowed.  But to my surprise it also had me confirm the install/setup of userinit (I can't remember if it was dll or exe) but the program info was that this is the file that presents the startup screen to windows.  I allowed it but it caught me off guard.
