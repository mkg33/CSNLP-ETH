Your basic problem is a complete lack of a methodical approach to cabling. The use of such absurdly long patch leads, as shown in the photo, just makes it near impossible to be properly organised.
Then, I use 6" patch cables to connect the panel to the switch.  The benefit is that everything is nice and neat, and organized...  Then, any infrastructure related cabling (connecting switches, etc) I run out to the side of the rack and then up/down to where it needs to go...
or.. make or buy (if you can) some cables that are just long enough (but not so short that you put strain on the plugs - give it an extra inch or two for wiggle room). Our cables tend to be the long ones, but they are all pulled to the side, kept together and the other end pulled in - like you have a box of cabling at the side of the rack to store the main cable, pulling the ends out. That's tidier in many respects as you can still get your hands in there to change them, the cables aren't in the way. This is the main reason I can think of why very short cables would be a disadvantage. Similar to what you show in your pic, but a lot more disciplined - no cable gets added that isn't first put with the bundle on the side. Don't forget to label both ends though!
Surely 6 inch cables are just too limiting, get the longest ones you can and loop them together to keep things tidy.
One of the most important things to consider is how you are going to know which cable connects to which end points, without having to trace that cable. I use a MS Access database for that, because it's easy to use and I can produce reports in any convenient format. Several of those reports are printed out and hung on the rack. Any cabling changes get updated on those sheets and later entered into the database.
As to the cables themselves, I prefer to make my own to whatever length is called for. If you don't want to do that I suggest getting a bunch of different lengths and using the appropriate one each time. There's certainly nothing wrong with 6 inch cables in and of itself, if that's appropriate to the situation in which they are used.
The main downside with a cable as short as 6" is that you may end up with problems if you use it to directly connect two interfaces, but for a patch between a panel and a switch (or two panels), it should be just fine.
Personally, I try to put the switches as close to the patch panels as possible.  Typically, I'll put a 48 port switch between 2 24 port patch panels.  So it goes like:
Before you touch another cable sit yourself down and give serious though to the result you want, rather than how to fix what you have. If you don't have a final objective everything you do to that cabling will still end up messy and hard to work with.
