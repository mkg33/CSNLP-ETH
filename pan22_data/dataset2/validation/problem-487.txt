Some how if I get server B from a host like vultr, I don't get this error but if I get it from digitalocean I get this error. I did some research and saw I should allowtcpforwarding to be yes but I could not find it in /etc/ssh/ssh_config
The config file you need to edit is called sshd_config you wrote ssh_config. What you have listed looks like the contents of the ssh client default configuration, not the config for the ssh server (/etc/ssh/sshd_config)
I have two servers, let's say server A and server B. I wish to use server B as an ssh tunnel so on server A I did this
Note that yes should be the default, so it is strange it does not work. You can add more verbosity with ssh -v or -vv or -vvv and have a look at your server sshd logfile that should provide more information on what is wrong.
You likely need to set AllowTcpForwarding yes in the sshd_config on the server to allow this to happen.
It connects and as soon as I put in the server B as a SOCKS5 proxy on my server A, the server B comes up with this erorr:
