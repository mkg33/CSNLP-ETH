The observant reader will note that this is a screenshot of Ardour running on Linux, not Windows. In my case, I'm offloading the DSP to a Linux box; jack has network capabilities, so you can link two jackd instances and have them share audio. This way, the audio from my Windows system gets sent over the network to my Linux system, mixed by Ardour there, and sent back to Windows to be sent to the hardware and/or programs that record audio (OBS, Discord, etc.). This all happens with ~5-8ms latency, which isn't perceptible.
I recently wanted to use OBS Studio to record game footage while playing with a friend, though that friend doesn't want his voice to end up in the recording.
A quick search on Google led me to test two programs: Virtual Audio Cable (what we French call a "usine Ã  gaz" ["gas factory", a very confusing and hard to use program]), and JACK Audio Connection Kit.
Jack can use ASIO drivers, and there's a few pieces you can put together to do this -- in fact, this is the setup I run on my streaming/gaming rig for everyday use.
I also tried to use the Connect feature of QjackCtl, but obviously, neither OBS or the game appear there.
Note that the config can all be pretty finicky so you may have to play around a lot to get it to work well.
Technical details: I downloaded JACK2 1.9.10 64-bit from the official site, and I run it on Windows 10 64-bit.
The thing is, OBS Studio cannot record audio from a program, but from a device (the sound that gets output to the speakers, for example).
While I found some tutorials on the Internet (this one is the best I've seen), I'm always stuck at the same point: the selection of the JackRouter audio "device".
