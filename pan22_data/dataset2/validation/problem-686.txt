I would recommend that when you talk to people, you use the right language. Telling an IT tech that you want to go off the domain is a good way to get a long lecture. Saying you have a printer that you want to install locally usually goes down better. If you can get a hold of the technology policy for your company, you can usually figure out how big of a deal a new local printer would be. 
Axxmasterr is mostly right when it comes to network printers. You can never be assured the same IP address for a device when you use DHCP. Unless you can get someone to reserve the IP address for the network card in the printer, that number may change at some point. In most cases, when working with DHCP, it's best to use the host name of the printer when possible. Usually, this is something you can control by going to the web management console for the printer. http://"printer's current ip address"
It should be noted that if you don't have admin control over your laptop you are usually stuck when it comes to adding printers. If this printer will only be used by you, companies with loose tech policies will allow the tech to install it for you. If not, then you may have to talk to someone higher up the corporate ladder to get approval.
