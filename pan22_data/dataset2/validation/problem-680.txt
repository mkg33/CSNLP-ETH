Bash is using the same syntax for if and while as that can be used in /bin/sh scripts on the command line. 
Popularity, #bash 430 users. #zsh 123 users. I believe the zsh website has a good comparison of zsh with other shells. zsh has better vi mode support.
I still use bash instead of zsh. I rarely come across compelling features that zsh supports that bash does not. Occasional problems with zsh over the years, or it not existing on certain sysetms, have made it not worth making the transition.
I can finally use the same shell on every Unix system, it's not worth breaking this for features I'll never use.
The features present in zsh that are not present in bash seem to mostly be cute but not ones that would matter on a day-to-day basis.
I'm a fan of zsh because of the vi mode support, but I am discovering that it's not very widely used.  I think I read that zsh likes to take popular features from the other shells and combine them (so things specific to bash and thing specific to csh are both available in zsh).
I don't know of any bash features that zsh does not support. The design goal of zsh seems to include supporting any features that bash adds.
Someone also said that I'm flexing my geek factor by using zsh, but I can't confirm or deny that rumor.
Within zsh the syntax is different. Effectively using zsh you have to remember both, if you are using  an if- or while-statement on your command line
