It is a pretty long road if you start out only knowing how to program. It is also a field with a lot of current activity and a lot will change before you get very far along that road. It is good to have a goal, but if you start late in a hot area you need to keep a flexible outlook so that you have options if that field cools off while you study. But those same things needed for ML are also good for other things as well. 
The first two paragraphs of the Wikipedia article on Machine Learning will give you a good outline of the things you need to know. Algorithms and Data Structures are key from CS, but you also need quite a lot of things like Statistics, Mathematics, Pattern Recognition and such. 
So, the courses you mention probably aren't especially necessary but your statement that you have trouble with documentation is a bit worrying. Perhaps that will change with practice. 
If you are a young person starting out, don't commit too deeply to any one path. Learn the basics so that you can choose later when you know more, both about yourself and about the state of research at that time.
