My only other advice would be to watch a high-def movie file while playing Crysis, editing a huge project in photoshop, and running Chrome with 128 tabs open.
It's really hard for even Vista to use more than 6GB of RAM. What you can do is use a Ramdrive program to create a virtual hard drive (ie R:) and put cache in there like firefox/photoshop/swapfile. You can also install your most launched programs there for a slight speed boost. Just don't put anything super important. I myself use ramdisk plus as it can use the memory above the 3.2 addressable in XP. I just put together an i7 and mapping out how to use 12GB. I generally run lots of VM for testing so it shouldn't be too hard ;)
If you really want to use up a lot of RAM just set up several virtual machines using VirtualBox or a similar program.  You basically set up a separate virtual computer with its own operating system.  When you create the VM you can allocate a specific amount of memory for it to use.
The end result is that (with your amount of RAM) you could easily have a Windows Vista and two Linux distros running simultaneously. Or, if you're feeling froggy, you could be running Windows AND Linux AND OS X at the same time.  Look out.
