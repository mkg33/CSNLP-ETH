Compare the inventory with their licenses, take note of how the software is used, some licenses only allow certain types of use (MSDN licenses, for example).
I'd start first with assessing their business needs and determining what software is required for their business functions.  Then determine what would be the hardware+software costs for new servers.  Then take a look at the hardware available and see if it's worth keeping.  In a similar situation I was able to get the client to dump 6 older machines and buy 1 copy of windows server datacenter edition.  This version allows for unlimited virtualization so seperating servers was still possible without the overhead. Direct savings over licensing wass about $3K Same goes for the laptops/desktops.  It might be cheaper to lease new OSes with the hardware than setting up a seperate openlicense.  If they want or need SA rights you can still enroll OEMd licenses.
Consult your local license provider. They wont get slammed at running illegal software - especially if you're looking at legitimising them.
If you're not too hard pressed on financial side, you could restart by volume licensing everything and discarding OEM legacy. You could also get Software Assurance, the same key for everything, home usage program, easy upgrades in number of licences etc.
Prepare a report for them, listing their software and identifying any items for which you could not find licenses. Suggest that they locate or purchase licenses for this software, since not having them available is a legal liability.
Microsoft has some licensing options specific to small business with as few as 5 computers, that allow them to spread payments over three years, finance the cost, etc.  The information is here: http://www.microsoft.com/smallbusiness/buy/software/buy-software.aspx#VolumeLicensing
Consider their position too; If they're in Education or Non-Profit, they can get heavy discounts and get VLK (Volume Licensing).
Alternatively look at "Microsoft Open License" ( https://partner.microsoft.com/UK/licensing/licensingprograms/ltvolumelicensing/vlopenlicense )
