I'm confused as to what these terms actually mean AND as to what they do/how they contribute to the system as a whole. In particular, back when I was running Ubuntu, there were several keywords like:
Xorg is an X server. It implements X11 and provides an interface to keyboards, mice, and video cards.
The login screen should appear immediately. Log in again and avoid making the mistake your did last time. Sorry for the long discourse.
You can run Compiz in GNOME, KDE, and Unity at least. Just get the CCSM package by entering this into the terminal:
Metacity and Compiz are window managers. They decorate X window primitives and support various operations such as moving, resizing, and maximizing of windows.
Compiz is a window manager and desktop compositor (a desktop compositor is a program that renders special effects, such as a desktop cube, on your screen).
In general, you may also be interested to know that the window manager and desktop environment are what the user interacts with. You don't directly touch (unless you are in a recovery shell) the windowing system.
GNOME, KDE, and LXDE are desktop environments. They provide libraries and specifications that applications use and follow in order to "play nice" with other applications.
(Don't enter the dollar sign and the space after it; these just mean that you are not logged in as root.) In CCSM (Compiz Config Settings Manager), turn on and configure whatever desktop effects you want. Be careful! You may lose the titlebars in GNOME and UNITY. If that happens, press Ctrl-Alt-F1 and then type in:
X11 is a network protocol. It encodes things such as graphic primitives, images, pointer motion, and key presses.
Note also that these things can be modular to respect with another. For example, you can use any window manager on Xorg, and any desktop environment on top of any window manager.
What exactly is the difference between all of these? Which can be changed? Do the same things apply when we're talking about KDE or LXDE?
