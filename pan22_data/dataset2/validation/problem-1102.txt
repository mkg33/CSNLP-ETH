I was very impressed at the power saving for a better machine! And as I run Hyper-V on it I was able to run the old server image, my build machine, a Home Server virtual machine and others all on the one box so it was well worth the upgrade.
Give Edison a shot.  I never actually figured out what it does for you, but it does tell you the energy consumption of your computer, how much it costs, etc...
You may be interested in a Kill-A-Watt device; it allows you to directly measure the electricity usage of any device.
Any specific reasons for windows home server?. Linux is a good choice for home server if you have little experience with pc's as you may have to do some customization. You can build a custom pc with 45w processors.
If you have a budget around $500+  then you could build a Windows Home Server with this and it only consumes around 80W (http://www.mini-box.com/PicoPSU-120-WI-25-12-25V-DC-DC-ATX-power-supply ).
I believe the dedicated home servers are designed to be low power but if you add lots of external HDDs with their own power supplied add about 15w (0.36 Kwh a day) for each one.
I recently upgraded a server I had running at home, it was a Windows 2k3 install which I believe is what is under the covers of Home Server.
