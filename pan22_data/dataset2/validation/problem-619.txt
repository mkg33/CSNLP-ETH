I had this issue after I installed Oracle VM and a Lubuntu image. Right after the Oracle installation everything was fine and I also managed to install Lubuntu. I've done everything through RDC.
Suddenly, the screen went black. I haven't restarted the computer or done anything worth mentioning at all, it just happened. This all happened in one single session.
In the end, I restored my computer to the state before I installed Oracle VM with a restore point that was generated automatically by my computer. Now RDC works again and I'm able to see the screen.
I then tried restarting the computer manually, I tried all of the above settings which helped other people and I also uninstalled Oracle VM. Nothing helped.
I had this issue since I was having different DPI. On my laptop I had DPI set to 125% while a computer I was connecting had 100%. Setting DPI to 100% on laptop solved the problem.
I've had the same problem - switch from 32bit to 24bit colours and it will let you connect as normal. All other settings can be left on their defaults.
When I have this issue I move the RDP screen to my default screen and maximize the screen.  The RDP screen should no longer be black.  I then move the RDP to my secondary screen.  Not the best work around, but it works.
