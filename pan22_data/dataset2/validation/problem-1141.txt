The /var permissions are either a red herring or incidental. For the uid-to-name lookup to work, the following must be correct, in order:
Turns out that my password had expired. It was odd that I didn't get any previous warnings that it was going to expire. After a couple of reboots and logging in did a statement finally indicate that my password expired.
I had this problem once, a misbehaving script had modified permissions of several files in /etc/ on my machine.
If that doesn't help (and even if it does), please provide more information about your auth system - LDAP, samba, AD (via what?), or something else.
You should also chown the folder to ensure the permissions are back to what is needed for your implementation.
More than likely you will need you set the permissions to something like 600/700 with root as the user. But once again, I don't know what you're doing in that directory so it depends on what you need to do.
I encountered the 'I have no name!' prompt on my laptop (Ubuntu 14.04) at the office today. My laptop uses pbis (Likewise) to connect to AD.
