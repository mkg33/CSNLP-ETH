As a home user you can learn from my advice and learn better ways to do things or you can choose to be blinded by the "smell" of cats, your choice... but know that if you openly use this practice you will be called on this practice all the time and you will silently have to admit they are right and you are stubborn because it's true. :-)
Now I can sit here and debate things like code smell or readability all day with anyone, but at the end of the day it is a matter of write or wrong and any time you use resources on a system and gain nothing for it... it is wrong.
If you will never ever try to instruct others with your examples or share your code, then by all means please use it at your own leisure.
For all who say cat is acceptable to use because it "smells" better or "is more readable" I would only say this: 
As far as efficiency goes, if you are executing a pipeline from the command line, it takes less time for the machine to execute cat somefile | than it does for you to think about whether it might be more efficient to use < somefile. It just doesn't matter.
I will also add this comment, as a long time Linux user and Admin/Engineer... (and there are many of us) it makes our eyes bleed to see this. Why? Because it uses resources on systems that we control resources tightly on. The cat command and the pipe itself use extra memory and file handles that are completely useless. You have tied up resources that my system needs free and you have gained NOTHING that can explain the usage of these resources. This is a huge no no.
I think the position being taken by some of those commenting on something being a UUOC is that if one really understands Unix and shell syntax, one would not use cat in that context. It's seen as like using poor grammar: I can write a sentence using poor grammar and still get my point across, but I also demonstrate my poor understanding of the language and by extension, my poor education. So saying that something is a UUOC is another way of saying someone doesn't understand what they're doing.
