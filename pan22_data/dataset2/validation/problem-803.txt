Most virtualization software can use this .raw file as the disk - I haven't done much with XEN, but VirtualBox and QEMU will both use it fine - HyperV and Virtual Server will need it converted to VHD format. I would expect XEN to use it.
LICENSES: If this is Windows you are going to have license issues (perhaps not technical but definately legally speaking).
I have checked google, and nobody else seems to have tried this as yet. Any suggestions would be great.
ec2-unbundle: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/dg/2006-10-01/CLTRG-ami-unbundle.html This is a raw disk image which is what Xen uses.
NOTE: You will likely have driver issues, you didn't say if this is windows, linux or other. It will likely detect new hardware.
The .img file, from ec2-unbundle, is the file that typically uses extension .raw on some virtualization platforms - It's just the raw disk contents byte-for-byte.
A quick google for xen and raw shows this may be the command (but a lot of useless posts came back so not sure):
I have an AMI which was created from a base AMI on Amazon. I would like to bring a copy of this internally to run for development. I have downloaded the .manifest & part00-50 files (approx 550mb) from my S3 bucket. Unsure how to convert into my local Xencenter however.
