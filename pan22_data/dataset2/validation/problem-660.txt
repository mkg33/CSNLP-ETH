If your RAID controller is fully supported by Linux as a RAID controller (i.e. it sees it as a RAID controller and not a bog-standard SCSI/SATA/PATA controller), the you may find useful information in the /proc filesystem and find tools out there that display/monitor this information for you.  If you know the RAID controllers that are in your machines, you might want to add that detail to your question then people with specific knowledge of that controller might pipe up with more specific information.
Well i don't know your system but i think one of the best way of viewing the current RAID setup on a system is through its BIOS. EXAMPLE on HP DL380p gen 8 bios menu, you can press F8 to view the logical disks.
I have several servers running Windows 2008 and Red Hat 5 that are capable of hardware RAID.  How do I check that hardware RAID is configured?
If you do not have any OS level tools to monitor the hardware, then you will need to reboot the machines and interact with the RAID controller's boot-time configuration code.
If the RAID controller officially supports your OS then it will have a set of tools to monitor it. These were probably provided with the hardware, though will also be downloadabed from the manufacturer's website.
