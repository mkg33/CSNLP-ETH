Now I use geeqie, eog (eye of gnome) or gthumb, it depends on the actual Desktop Environment. And I do all editting in GIMP. It is not ideal, but it is quite good.
Although I have been doing some research of this problem too, I have not found anything as good as Irfan. That is still an app I envy to the Windows users.
I believe that GTK+ and KDE apps have fully configurable key bindings for anything in their menus, so you shouldn't get too hung up on that if you find something with the right functionality.
It isn't updated much lately and the keyboard shortcuts are different, but feh is an incredibly fast image viewer.
The nearest alternative of IView for linux is XnViewMP --- not open but powerful. Still the best alternative on the market. Easy download and install, just unpack the tar.gz to the default subfolder in your user folder and run xnview.sh. You must only ensure that you have all the compatilibity libraries needed. I read that some people had an installation bug because of no libpng15-compat packages which includes libpng12.
