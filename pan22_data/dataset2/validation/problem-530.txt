My first attempt using a different method involved making the host names within IIS different and then editing the HOSTS file appropriately. This enabled me to navigate to multiple websites on the host machine. However, I could not do the same from other machines on the network.
As for the multiple IP's. There are ways around having to use multiple IP's. Even if you are using SSL , you can use a multi-domain certificate , some call it a unified messaging ssl. Another option is to use a wildcard certificate, but I don't really care for these.
If there's a reason for you NOT to do it the way I'm about to suggest please let me know and I can adjust my advice.  However...
On your IIS box set up all your webs using host headers, they can all be the same IP address.  Then in your DNS make sure your internal view resolves all of those domains to that IP.  Use DNS internally, not the hosts file - that should solve your problem.
An alternative if you don't plan on needing SSL is to use host headers to host multiple websites off one IP (Called VirtualHosts in Apache speak)
This is so that I can set up different domain names within an intranet to point to different web sites. Does anyone know of a way to do this?
If you aren't running an internal DNS server, you will have to put the same host file entries into each of the computers that you want to access those sites from. If you are running an internal DNS server, then you can add 'A' records to allow the client machines to lookup the host names. 
*Note, if you want your site to load both domain.com and www.domain.com , you will need to add both of these if you are hosting multiple sites using this method
In IIS7 - adding host header's has changed. To get to it, under the Sites tree, select the site you want to edit. In the Actions pane, click Bindings (also in the right click menu). You can then click edit to change a pre-existing binding or add a new one. In this next screen you will be able to enter a hostname. 
The other answers are great - If you don't have internal DNS, you will need to edit the host file of each.
Here is a technet article talking about how to set up host headers in IIS7. I made my instructions follow these a bit.
