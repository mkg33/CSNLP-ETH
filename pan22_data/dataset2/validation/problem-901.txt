Here is something I would suggest if you can do it. If you can get view the GVim on the system desktop then go to set the font that you want it at then do a:
This seems to be fixed in the new version of Vim. (Verified with Vim 7.3d, available here http://groups.google.com/group/vim_announce/browse_thread/thread/9e72fb17d311d535# )
Only clue I can offer is that you can set another colon-separated field just after the hXX font size to indicate the character style: i for italics, b for bold. And leaving that field blank:
The format of the commands that dggoldst has is correct.  I've tried several iterations of getting this to work.  The format works fine if you use:
Curiously, this used to work, and only relatively recently "broke".  As for how recently, I can only say "within the past month or so".  I don't know what I've updated with the machine (just run Windows Updates when they're available to keep up to date).
I get the exact same issue as dggoldst above.  adding the extra ":" doesn't seem to do anything at all, unfortunately.  There's no "r" or something like that to make the font regular.  It'd be nice if you could see what setting the font via the "Edit -> Select Font..." actually sets things to.  There's clearly some magic that's happening behind the scenes.  Doing some more testing (removing "set guifont" from the _gvimrc, opening a file, typing ":set" to see what's set, then clicking "Edit -> Select Font...", highlighting Lucida Sans Typewriter, clicking OK, then typing again ":set", shows that guifont=Lucida_Sans_Typewriter:h10:cANSI)
I suspect that there might be an issue with that particular font - the default font may actually be the italics version of the font, or the "first" instance of the font that vim is looking for is the italicized version.  My "solution" was to use a different font.  In my case, I'm using:
This will show you the font you currently have GVim set to. Open you .vimrc file in your home directory (Ubuntu) and add the following line:
