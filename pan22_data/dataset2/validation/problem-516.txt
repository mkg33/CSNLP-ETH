My Linux terminal understands C-Insert as Copy and S-Insert as Paste (kill and yank, respectively).  Emacs also understands those (at least the more recent versions do), or can be easily made to understand them.  In fact, most applications understand them, along with S-Delete for Cut; I usually only have trouble at Web-2.0 sites.
You can remap the whole dang keyboard if you like, recent emacs even have a menu and GUI to help you with this.
Problem is, C-C in particular is a prefix to a lot of other commands. Those would all end up needing to be attached to new key combinations. While your cut&paste habits may die hard, in the long run you may get more joy if you "submit" to Emacs' conventions rather than try to force them into line with Windows keystrokes.
I know about cua-mode, but I'm specifically wanting to bind C-C and C-V (the uppercase versions) to be like the terminal in Gnome.  Is there any way to do this?  I tried this, but it gave me all kinds of errors (apparently, it doesn't like me binding something to C-c whether the C is lowercase or not):
