I've seen errors similar to this one, but it wasn't related to Outlook SP2. It was related to removing the last vestiges of the Exchange 2003 routing groups after we fully completed the migration to Exchange 2007. What was happening is that Outlook was storing the names of the mailboxes internally using an AD syntax to describe where to find the mailbox. Exchange 2007 uses a different location for that. This caused havoc in things like Delegates, replying to old emails, and the frequently-mailed-contacts list. 
There is also the ugly and unpopular "recreate the account in a new profile" diagnostic step that sometimes makes Exchange problems go away.
However, the status bar indicates Online with Microsoft Exchange, and I can both send and receive emails from my primary account.  What could be going wrong?
I have had my Outlook 2007 open additional mailboxes via the advanced account settings.  After updating to Office SP2, the list of emails in the additional account still displays, but I get a message for each mailbox item:
That's a system-level fault, and it may not be your problem. But your symptoms seem close to what I've seen.
Although going into Outlook's MS Exchange settings(connect to Exchange using HTTP) was  good and well, didn't do anything for me. I performed a "dnsflush" command. I don't know if that would solve you issue but it worked for me.
The error on adding additional mailboxes was fixed by the hotfix http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968858/, however the "Unknown Error" when opening messages remains.
Also, if I try to re-add the mailbox in the Advanced tab of my account settings, I get an error message
What was happening was that each user that was migrated from Exch2003 had an attribute called "LegacyExchangeDN" that pointed to the old AD location. Users created fresh in Exch2007 didn't have it, and didn't need it. After opening an SR with Microsoft to figure out what the heck, the fix was to add a new X500 address to each mailbox to the value of the old LegacyExchangeDN. This allowed cached Outlook entries (and there are a LOT of them) to find the mailbox.
The error you recieved is usually a problem with locating the mailbox in the global address list. When you add the accounts into Outlook, try doing so with their UPN name, the name@domain.com, and using the pre 2000 login name. 
I've had a similar error, only that i had been adding a second, secondary mailbox on the already existing users mailbox. This after migrating from Exchange 2003 to 2010, on users machine, Windows 7 - Outlook 2007.
