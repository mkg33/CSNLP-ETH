Could it really be one of these? Or something even further back? The most recent Windows Defender update for Skeeyah.A!bit came out two months ago, so it should have infected me no more than two days back when I got the alert, right? Could I have contracted the trojan via some Windows 10 vulnerability? I should note that my other family members use standard Windows accounts, only I have administrator rights. Thanks for shedding some light on this, I'm totally clueless!
Any website could have been infected by malware and when you entered into one of those there was a silent download that infected you. Simply as that. It could be that you had a port open and someone scanned it and sent malware through it. You could have been infected before, or some of the devices into your same network could have been infected.
Windows Defender just informed me it had placed the trojan Win32/Skeeyah.A!bit in quarantine. It was first found yesterday and now again today. How did I contract that? My download history reveals nothing noteworthy imho:
By the way... windows defender wont do much to help you... you better start using better security measures.
