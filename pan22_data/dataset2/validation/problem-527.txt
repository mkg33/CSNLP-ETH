I would be really pushing the increased security in both IE7 and IE8. Pop-up blocking, phishing filters etc...
"It is better to 'keep up' with the upgrades and patches as they come out, than to stagnate and be left with a HUGE upgrade in the future that will be MUCH more expensive (in time, effort and cost)"
"IE6 is a legacy system, only on extended support from Microsoft.  Microsoft was recently pushed IE8 through as a Critital Patch on Windows Update and will only publish future patches for IE6 for the most serious issues"
Regardless of the numerous security warnings our there and lack of applicability in the greater world wide web, my manager still sees intranet apps written for IE6 as the main reason to stay on it. What can we do to swing the vote in our favour? We're tired of supporting an ailing browser when users call us up constantly complaining that website don't look right, and more and more people asking for browser tabs "because that's what they've got at home".
"If we continue to allow IE6 users to connect to the Internet then we are increasing our risk of malware infection."
We've already rolled out Windows XP SP2 (no hope of going to Vista or Windows 7 in the foreseeable future unfortunately) across the enterprise and our latest internal roll-out actually incorporates SP3 as well - but unfortunately IE is explicitly being kept at version 6.
Get a range on how much money could be lost by keeping IE6 (even in unlikely scenarios), and how much money can be saved by upgrading. Money and ROI talk.
IE6 is one of the biggest entry point for malware onto a Windows system. You can reduce a lot of this by leaving IE6
Hiring an intern to update the intranet apps should be probably less costly than doing extensive cleanup of the network due to a security breach, because of using an insecure and standards-ignorant browser both for intranet and internet.
