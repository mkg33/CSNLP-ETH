Consider using GlusterFS, it has an ability to combine several subvolumes into one volume. This feature is called "unify translator".
Absolutely.   On the flip-side... this is a bit of a dangerous thing to do... as any failure on any of those 5 servers can mean total data-loss/corruption.  (the 5 servers behave as a disk.  5 disks spanned into 1 volume can have very bad outcome if one of those disks fails or becomes non-responsive)
Say I've got.. 5 servers, each server has a partition with 50GB's of storage. Is it possible for me to combine these 5 partitions and then mount them as one on a 6th server? 
some CFS strategies are block-based (the "volumes" are stored on each server as a block-device" and some are file-system level only.  (the "volumes" only pay attention to "files" and pass the data to the underlying file-system to keep track of the blocks)
This is the area of "Clustered File Systems"  and there's a bunch of different ways to implement it... all with their own pros & cons.
iSCSI can do this at the block level while being FS agnostic, but has the same drawback as a DFS or CFS, as @TheCompWiz stated.
You can do a wikipedia search for "Clustered File Systems" and "Distributed File Systems" for a list of various flavors... and get some information about how to implement them.
