Did you copy/paste this info, or try to type it?  You have "193" in your network, except one machine shows 195.  Then you show 192 in  your routing tables.
It's a bit strange, to start I would try to run tcpdump on mach01, mach02 and mach03 to see if mach01 and mach02 iaregetting ARP Request from mach03 when you try to ping mach01, if it's replying (for mach03) or not, etc.
Also, please can you post the output of 'arp -a' immediately after one of the failed 'arping' attempts? This should show an incomplete entry for the IP address you tried to arping on [eth1], and will confirm that your host routing is configured correctly. 
Does 'arping' work from 01/03/04 to 02 or are they updating their arp cache courtesy of incoming broadcast packets from 02?
Please can you paste the full host routing table from one of the hosts? It's possible that there is a more specific route for another interface.
Did you know if there can be a transparent firewall between hosts ? This could explain what you're seeing.
What is the network topology ? is there many switch between hosts or just one ? What kind of switch ?
It turns out I discovered an issue with Rackspace Cloud Server's networking. The issue was escalated and has been resolved.
