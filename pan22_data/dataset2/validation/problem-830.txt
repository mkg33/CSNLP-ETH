Have to wonder - why so much of your equipment is dying - environmental?  Electrical(surge?) accident (drops?) or other?  Your solution would have to incorporate protection against this.
So now I'm asking you for a recommendation of a portable solution (max size is 2,5" hdd) that would be (nearly) 100% reliable. Which will not break. At least not easily. 10GB storage is enough.
 and rigorous in regards to the what and the when and the where, stick to it; and you've got something that's kept me (a klutz of dimensions) knowing that my that is safe...
- 8 gig with all that data on USB-stick, hash and double/triple-check at will; one kept at each parent's house (this is of course something one has to re-adjust as one sees fit, in case no-one is to be trusted, two separate bank vaults would be my guess...hardcore though...)
At one point in time I've moved all of my data (documents, programs, etc.) into one 8GB encrypted file container (TrueCrypt) and moved this file onto one of the most expensive pendrives in its range (the 16GB Voyager GT mentioned above) hoping it will prove to be 100% reliable solution. Unfortunately for me, it broke.
You mention having to sync 8 gigs of data each day - is all of that data really changing every day? Could you perhaps have separate encrypted volumes for stuff that rarely changes (no need to sync every day, perhaps every week or month) and stuff that changes daily?
I don't think you will find something realistic that is more reliable than a USB drive, so in order to increase your reliability you have to implement some form of redundancy. 
Be ultra-prudent (parents do not live in same town as me, or each other (again....adjust as see fit))
Also, have you considered a remote solution - RDP into a system at home or possibly keeping things on the cloud?  There are things like Microsoft Live Mesh.
