take a patch cord cut it into, next remove about 2 inches of the outer shielding to expose the twisted pairs, cut off the blue/white pair, orange/white pairs, and the white wire from the brown/white pair.
Certain toners or network testers mainly high end fluke brand ones will tone through a live patched cable..  Most other toners are not very practical on "live" lines.  But are great on lines that arent patched into anything at all (fresh install)
Data switches and computers "eat" the tone when applied to the twisted pairs.  1&2, 3&6, 7&8, 4&5.  when toning out the cable use split pairs.  For example apply the tone generator to pins 2 and 7.  THIS WORKS GREAT!
place 1 of the clips from your tone generator to the green/white pair and the other clip to the brown wire this will allow you to short out the active port on the switch so you can tone out the cabling without harming the port on the switch.
Cut a patch cable in half and only connect one toner lead to one wire. When the cable is plugged into a switch you must only tone a single wire not a pair
My experience with tone generators is that you're going to be touching the pins on the jacks on the patch panel, or, if you've got a really sensitive probe, the terminations on the back of the patch panel. I've never used a tone generator / probe combination that was able to pull tone thru the insulation of a UTP cable.
this will leave you with the green/white pair and the solid brown wire, next remove the shielding from all 3 wires twist the green/ white pair exposed wires together. 
I don't know that I'd plug a tone generator into the far end of a cable that's patched into a switch, either. You probably won't blow anything up, but I wouldn't try it.
