However there is at least one clear offline occurrence that I have spotted over this past year: when one of our DCs restarts, some users are being put offline, despite the two other DCs remaining up and running. Surely this should not happen, even for users who got their DHCP lease through the restarting DC. This makes me thing that something might be misconfigured that could lead me to the cause of the more general offline/synchronisation issue.
We run a small wired LAN with 3 DCs (W2k8) and about 25 workstations (most of which are XP SP3, some are 7 SP1.)
People got used to live with it (so to say) and synchronise every so often. At least Windows 7 seems to deal better than XP regarding this whole offline/sychronisation issue in the sense that it doesn't bother people so much with popups... etc. I have searched quite a lot for what could be the cause of this with no success so far. At this stage I still don't even have a clue as to this issue is even software related or not.
What version of the CSC files are you running?  Given that there are a lot of known issues with offline files functionality, you may want to try updating those files and see if if it resolves the issue.  A recent version is available here:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2705233
Users are put offline often, and apparently randomly, with Windows asking for synchronisation despite the users not being offline at all (all pings are fine, and other maybe less connectivity-sensitive services keep running fine.)
People use roaming profiles with folder redirection for Desktop & My Documents, Application Data and Start Menu.
