Re-starting Desktop Window Manager Session Manager service restored that option into that list (in checked state). I had Let Windows choose what's best for my computer radio button selected here before and after the problem and before and after the fix.
Try this: Go to >Control Panel >Device Manager >Display Adapter. I had a Mirror Driver listed (I've been running UltraVNC). I uninstalled (right click on the mirror driver, left click on uninstall). Just leave there your graphics card > (e.g. mine, ATI Radeon HD 5700 Series). Then re-booted. I got my Aero back! :D  
EDIT: I got my hint from here: http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-1680343/windows-aero-theme-unavailable-desktop-window-service-missing.html
Note that control panel\System and Security\System -> advanced system -> Performance Settings -> visual effects tab had Enable Aero Peek MISSING. It was not just un-checked, but missing entirely from the list.
However, The Desktop Window Manager Session Manager service, altho it was Started already, I restarted it, and it fixed my problem instantly. Taskbar icon peek and transparency restored.
