If there are some files that you know you want to delete (i.e., you want to bypass the Recycle Bin and permanently delete them), you can select the files, then press Shift+Del or hold Shift while you right-click and delete.
Just going this myself right now.  I have not seen the word defrag mentioned yet so for future readers I throw that one out there.  Chkdsk to see if there are issues and do a defrag if necessary / if it has been awhile since the last defrag.
If none of that works then get Process Explorer from SysInternals and see if you can tell what is going on when you delete.
Does the performance change based on your recycle bin being empty or full?  Even at 1%, if you have a 500 GB drive that is still 5 gigabytes of files in your recycle bin, which can be a lot of files if they are typically pretty small files.
This allows you to selectively bypass the overhead of using the Recycle Bin without completely disabling it.

Anti-virus is another possibility.  I have also seen other 3rd party tools that install themselves in place of the recycle bin.  Check for that as well and try disabling them.  If nothing else you could just start disabling all those applications running down in your system tray and see if that makes a difference. 
Click Start, type %temp% in the search bar and press enter. Delete all the files by manually selecting.
I find it works a lot better to remove files from the recycle bin based on how long they have been there, not size.
