Basically - once my PC is 'ON' it stays on for hours or even days with no trouble.  When I shut it down (none of that hibernate stuff - 100% off)...it won't turn back on when I hit the 'power' button.
Do you know how hot your computer runs on average?  I've seen cases where someone wasn't careful when processing video on their laptop and ended up sustaining 200Â°F for a minute or two, causing erratic behavior from then on until it finally died 3 months later.
This kind of fault may be diagnosed if you apply a electronic 'freeze spray' to selected parts of the PC one at a time, while it's running, so the faulty component or connection is cooled and behaves as if the PC has been switched off for a while.
No, no, more seriously, it may be a faulty connection (a dry solder joint?) caused by cooling from operating temperature to room temperature. What's the ambient temperatue there?
I've had this problem for a while now and it seems to be getting worse.  I've replaced cases and the problem remains - so I'm fairly confident it's not a bad power-on button.  
Does this sound like a PS issue?  Is it possible my motherboard is at fault?  Is there any way for me to test these things without purchasing new hardware?
It seems like the way to fix this is to give the computer a good smack...after a few hits, the power button will once again turn on the PC.
All the parts you mentioned would be potential candidates. Either take the PC to a repair person or try yourself with 'freeze spray' from an electronics DIY retailer.
I want to fix this - but I don't know what is really going on.  My guess is that it is a bad power supply.  I've completely taken apart and reassembled my computer - it didn't help (so I don't think it is simply a loose cable somewhere).
