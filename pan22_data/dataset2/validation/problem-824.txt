Server security is a multifaceted issue. Since many processes on your server CAN be compromised in some way, it is important to run your updates, eliminate unused services and then do security on what is left.
You can have a rock solid apache, mysql, ssh configuration, but if you are running a Wordpress server that has security holes, you are going to get hacked - repetitively. You can grep through looking for exec commands, base64_decode, but if you don't understand coding, then you may not see where you are vulnerable. 
fail2ban may be a good starting point since it will teach you what to look for in log files to know if you are getting hacked.
Good security takes a serious amount of effort and simply copying commands from the internet without understanding them won't help you. 
If you must run insecure apps because you are a startup and simply can't afford the alternative, make sure you sandbox your environment by utilizing separate VPS servers and make frequent backups. Then practice your restore process till you know you can get everything back up and running.
