There are a few alternatives to using the Windows Update site.  One I would recommend is WindizUpdate.  It's designed for Firefox/Opera users so they can get Windows updates without using Internet Explorer, but perhaps it will let you update your machine while side stepping the group policy issue.
You could also try Windows Updates Downloader which is a slightly more manual process but should do the job if Windiz isn't suitable
Use the program KillPol (standalone .exe) to remove Group Policy and then you can visit Windows Update. You need to be only a local administrator and can also use the same program to re-apply GP. I'm offering the download from my Dropbox account because I have no idea where on the net to find this program. It was given to me by a coworker.
I am in the administrators group for my local Windows XP machine and I would like to get updates via http://update.microsoft.com/[1]. However, this is prevented via the group policy:
[1] Several installed applications are Microsoft based, but are not part of the machine standard (eg Visual studio). As such, I am not getting the updates for these applications. I could periodically go to the various application sites and look for hotfixes, but that is beyond tedious.
Speak the the IT dept of the organisation. That policy setting is typically enabled when updates are managed centrally using WSUS, Altiris, etc.
