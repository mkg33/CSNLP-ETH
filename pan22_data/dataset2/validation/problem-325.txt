I've just run my info through both those sites. The first returned only 2 out of 5 domains. Interestingly, those are .com domains, whereas the other 3 are .com.au domains. The second site appears to just do a revers DNS query and is therefore only showing what I have set, not the domains being hosted.
Edit: I thought I'd try the gwebtools site against my secondary DNS server, just out of curiosity. It returned zero domains.
As far as I know they're just building a database of domain names and the associated authoritative name servers. You're just searching that database with their web interface and seeing a list of results that, through "normal" DNS channels would be rather difficult to get (w/o generating a lot of queries). It's a little bit like a telephone "reverse directory"-- it's the same information that DNS gives out to normal SOA lookups, but given to you in a bit of a "backward" manner to facilitate types of searches that would normally be difficult.
It's not actually querying the nameservers. It has a database of domains and just looks to see what the NS records for each domain are.  Your original assesment is correct, don't doubt yourself :)
Does this not work off what domain robtex has "seen" before? It doesn't detect what domains are on a NS, it just lists what domains it's looked up before that have that NS.
Spyonweb.com also provides this information. It also show all dns servers registered in certain IP address.
