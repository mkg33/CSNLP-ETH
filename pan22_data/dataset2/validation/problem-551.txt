Plaintiff: Well, Bob was late to work that day and tried to punch the clock while I was using the bandsaw.
There are none, at least with support for recent technologies (except for very basic CSS, JavaScript etc...). 
Defendant: Sure, everyone knows that. We'd just wait for the person to click the Clock In or Clock Out button and then the saw would come right back on!
Prosecutor to defendant (Bob): Did you know that the bandsaw always stops while the time clock web site is opening?
I would consider running screen sharing software.  After doing some research, it sounds like VNC was never ported to Windows 3.1, but you could try running pcAnywhere 9.2, which I believe is the last version that supports Windows 3.1.  I think the most important thing is to only run stable software on this machine, as there is no memory protection, no bug fixes in many years, and it's controlling an expensive and dangerous piece of equipment.  You can find another thread which discusses browser alternatives for Windows 3.1 here.  They seem to think that Opera is a bit unstable, and other browsers probably don't support all of the modern CSS that you need.
It's obviously a lot more destructive then just installing a browser... but it is both capable of running Windows 3.1 software in addition to more modern software like Firefox 3.6.
Plantiff: I didn't know Bob was late! The saw stops when a part gets stuck. How was I supposed to know that it would suddenly start back up while I was looking for the part in there..?
Chances are that your low-cost programmer already has Windows 3.1 as his primary OS on his 486 DX33.
Err... Do you really want to give a second task to a computer from the stone age that is controlling a $150,000 bandsaw..?
If your web-based timeclock software has only 2 or 3 menus with 4-5 options, I guess that asking a cheap programmer to develop a Windows 3.1 application that fetch data on the website and sends the appropriate data would be the simplest way to go.
