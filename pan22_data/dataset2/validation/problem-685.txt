We put $d$ with the outgoind radiance and irradiance because it's a very small part (we are looking at just one instance of that summation/integration)
It is helpful if you always look at the units that a certain physical quantity measures. Since you use Real-Time Rendering, I'll also quote from that (3rd edition). Also, for the sake of completeness, I'll go through all quantities and units related. I will however assume you understand solid angles. The time $t$ is measured in seconds $\left[s\right]$ and the solid angles $\omega$ are measured in steradians $\left[sr\right]$.
But more commonly and what makes more sense to me, and to the answer of your question, think of irradiance as the integration of radiances over a set of directions.
So coming back to your question at last, I hope you might have gotten some intuition as to what "irradiance in a direction means". 
Next is differential radiance. We can think of it as an infinitesimal quantity of radiance emitted or recieved in a very small solid angle $d\omega$.
First of all we are gonna clear up 4 terms, Radiance, Irradiance, Differential radiance and Differential Irradiance.
I'm gonna tell you how I convinced myself, as I too had this confusion as soon as I read your question. But I managed to convince myself through this argument.
Mathematically proving it is no hard feat tho. The answer here explains it quite well. I'm just gonna give a brief explanation. We know the rendering equation is given as
Yes they do. In fact, steradian is a dimensionless unit, since it is $\left[\frac{m^2}{m^2}\right]$, and therefore it doesn't really add anything. I see how this is confusing. I hope I could clear up why you do this.
Again this was just the way I convinced myself and might have some mistakes. Though this is the best I came up with.
But still, $E$ only considers the amount of energy per time, not from which direction it comes. Why is this important? Because of the way you usually look at lighting in computer graphics. You calculate how much light is being reflected from a surface to your viewer (/camera), which also means, that you want to know from which light source it originates (seeing as you would like to have the right amount of energy and the correct color). Additionally, you usually use point lights, meaning that you can view the lighting calculation as that of a ray from a single point (the light source) onto a single point on a surface (your pixel/fragment) and then to your viewer. These directions are written in the matter of solid angles, or to make the theory even easier, in differential solid angles. Another point is that your surface may reflect light differently depending on the where it comes from, which also makes important the direction part. 
I'd say it is the other way round, $L(v) \leq E(v)$, since $E(v)$ would consider any light source emitting light onto a surface, whereas $L(v)$ only considers light form $v$ (if you consider $v$ as the light source to surface direction. In my writing earlier, this is $\omega$ and in Real Time Rendering specifically, this is $\omega$ as well, or $l$ in chapter 5 as well as in the BRDF Theory chapter). Also, remember that these two physical quantities don't have the same units and should not really be compared this way.
Now as I wrote before, if you forget the BRDF for the time being, we are just integrating the radiances over a given set of direction which is the same as irradiance. 
"Radiance" is what you say associated with a certain direction. To be more formal and according to wikipedia,
$L_{outgoing} = L_{emission} + \displaystyle\int_{\Omega} L_{incoming} \;f_{BRDF}(\omega_i, \omega_o)\; \omega_i.n \; d\omega_i$
Currently I am reading the BRDF section from Real Time Rendering and I am having a hard time to visually understand the definition of this function. BRDF is the ratio between the radiance in outgoing direction and irradiance of incoming direction. I can't visually understand what does irradiance of a certain direction means? And what is the difference with radiance of certain direction? They both represents the power of light. What does irradiance of a certain direction means? Doesn't we associate a direction with radiance? Isn't radiance defined as irradiance in a single direction? I feel like i misunderstand something here. Is E(v) <= L(v) where v is direction?
To be honest, terms like these are very confusing as they aren't clear cut and on one side of the border. They are more grayish.
I hope it is clear, that radiance is irradiance from a certain direction. If not, please try to specify which part still bothers you.
This is the difference between irradiance from a certain direction and radiance. Think of it like this. You are holding a paper and there are 2 light bulbs in front of you. You want to measure the irradiance. Normally it would just be the radiant flux received by both bulbs per unit area. But now let's say I limit the direction so I am only concerned with the first bulb. Note that I am still calculating the "irradiance". If I move farther away the flux will decrease thus the irradiance even tho I am concerned with a specific direction. However this isn't the case with radiance where moving farther away won't change it since we divide by the solid angle too balancing the change.
Now there is one thing to consider: $E$ is measured with regards to a a surface $A$ that is perpendicular to the light direction (in other words, the normal of the surface is parallel to the light direction). Therefore we project $A$ onto a plane that fullfills this requirement. If the angle between the surface normal and the light direciton is $\theta$, then our projected surface $A_{proj}$ is calculated thus: $A_{proj} = \frac{A}{cos\theta}$
Careful. We don't associate direction (other than considerung only surfaces perpendicular to the light direction) with irradiance. We do however with radiance.
As we can see here, we have limited the irradiance to a set of directions, the upper hemisphere. This doesn't necessarily change it into radiance which is associated by direction. Instead what this means is, when calculating irradiance we are concerned with the light coming only from these directions, although we haven't incorporated the directional quantity into the formula like with radiance.
Next is Irradiance. Irradiance isn't normally associated with a direction. According to Wikipedia it's 
So if we integrate the radiances from every direction that leads us to the original definition of irradiance where direction isn't of concern. However usually we are concerned with only a subset of all the directions such as the Upper hemisphere or the lower hemisphere. This means for example,
The last quantity is differential irradiance. I thought of it as a tiny amount of irradiance from a specific direction. (Again direction gets involved)
If you think of irradiance as not assosciated with direction at all, even then when you try to think of differential irradiance you are gonna say it's a tiny amount of irradiance from a small range of direction or maybe a specific direction. That's the reason why it's small.
But if you think of irradiance as the sum of all the radiances over a specific set of directions. You'll see that it makes things clearer and you'll naturally arrive at the conclusion that differential irradiance will then refer to an irradiance from a specific direction.
$L_{outgoing} = \displaystyle\int_{\Omega} L_{incoming} \;f_{BRDF}(\omega_i, \omega_o)\; \omega_i.n \; d\omega_i$
