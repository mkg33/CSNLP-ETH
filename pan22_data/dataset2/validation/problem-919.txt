Of course you could make your own tent like product.. But that's a very expensive risk, the stuff in your racks could cost in the millions to replace. 
Recently we had a rather funny incident: suddenly about a liter of water ran from above the drop ceiling right in the middle of the office. Turned out it was some pipe in the air conditioning that detached and released condensed water.
Rerouting and stopping at the source would help. Maybe find a way to run a remote water sensor that can alert you if there's an issue?
You could try running plastic over the tops of the racks...but I don't know what you'll do to ventilation or what happens if the heat warms the plastic up and releases some kind of gas.
You can hang foam with wires or screw it from one side without compromising it's being water proof, and being rigid you can give it a little slope to divert disasters off to the least damaging side. Being light it's not hard to position where it will do the most good.
I'd probably look at finding a way to run a trough around where the AC leak was and re-routing it. Anything you do near the equipment will affect heating/airflow/fire suppression/safety, and putting things in the ceiling that isn't made for it can be a safety/fire hazard as well. Regular maintenance of the AC unit/inspection of the unit may help mitigate the risk.
Obviously that's not what anyone wants to happen above a server equipment rack. What is the easiest (I mean that materials should be easily accessible and the consrtcution should be easy to manufacture) reliable way to shield a rack from above to protect it against minor water leaks?
Get a sheet of rigid 1" insulating foam or something and make a cut-to-fit lid for your rack with at least enough overhang so that drips off of it don't splash on your equipment. I used to have a rack in an office below a deli. Seriously bad land-use planning, but whatever.
Not to mention if you have fire suppression...blocking things like that from reaching the equipment, what would that do?
