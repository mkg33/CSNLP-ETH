Camtasia is really good for screen cast , but I think you should by Snagit instead, both from one company . But you'll get screen capture from Snagit :)
There is a tutorial on their help site titled "How do I record system audio? (The sound that comes out of my speakers)". You may want to see if this can help you.
I had the same problem.  The greyed out option changed however when I changed my headset from a typical 3.5mm input to a USB model.  I can now record from the system audio.
Vista disable the sound and microphone options of your system by default you need to right click on your speaker icon (taskbar) select recording devices > right click and show disabled devices. This will allow you to turn on the option to record your computers sound.
May want to make sure Windows is seeing your microphone correctly first.  In XP it's: Control Panel, Sounds and Audio, Voice.
Also, I found Fraps to be a lot simpler to use than Camtasia. Then again, I'm not a very demanding audio/video capture user.
