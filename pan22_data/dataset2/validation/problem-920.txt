Is there a way to shut it down without being logging into it, so I can get the SD card out without possibly corrupting the file system (by yanking the power cord)?
More recent Pi models have two points you can bridge with a wire to reset the Pi.  If you hold it in reset it will be safer to pull the power.

If the your raspberry pi is connected to a display, and you are at the terminal login prompt, pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE should start the reboot sequence.  You can watch the screen for the moment of reboot(screen blanking), and remove power.  This should be the safest method.
Old unix's of the '80s had a user call "sync" that ran "/usr/bin/sync".  The command line login would return after the sync to a login prompt.
So it's been a while since I've played with it, and I forgot my Raspberry Pi's login info (both username and password), and it's running. I've seen some instructions for resetting the password, but they require the SD card to be put into another machine.
Add a user called shutdown that runs only the shutdown program in the "/etc/passwd" file.  In the field for the shell add "/usr/bin/shutdown".  You would probably have to add shutdown to legal shells file too. 
If you are realy concerned about this you can attach a button to a GPIO pin and have some code that starts with the system monitor the pin and halt the pi when the button is pressed.
Frankly unless you can see SD card activity (flashing LED) I'd just pull the plug.  Frankly, frankly even if I saw SD card activity I'd just pull the plug (I keep nothing important on the SD card).
