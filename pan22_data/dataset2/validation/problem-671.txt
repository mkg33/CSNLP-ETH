One final note.  PostgreSQL has its own APT repository, so if you want to use a newer version than 8.4, you can do so with little hassle.  To use it, as root, add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list:
If /var/lib/postgresql/ is empty, something is wrong.  It should have a directory for each version of PostgreSQL that you have installed, assuming you did the installation through the normal dpkg/apt-get processes (which you say you did) and that the package was intended for Debian.  On the other hand, you have the postgres user and the psql command available.  It is certainly possible that you have one of the postgresql-client-* packages installed but not the server package.
refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2748607/how-to-thoroughly-purge-and-reinstall-postgresql-on-ubuntu/40545924#40545924 for an indepth knowledge of why and why you shouold take these steps.
Similar error occurs, if installation is not fully complete.Try setting default language , it is one of the common problem. 
Since you pretty clearly do not have PostgreSQL successfully running, I would suggest a purge and reinstall through aptitude, or (as root):
I can't seem to find the folder where all the config files is either. On my CentOS server the config files are stored in /var/lib/pgsql, on my Debian server there is a folder called postgresqlin /var/lib but it's empty.
You can then install versions 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 9.0, 9.1, or 9.2, as of this writing.  You can have multiple versions installed at once if you like.  More information is available in the documentation to the postgresql-common package:
I've just set up a server running Debian 6.0 64-bit. I've installed PostgreSQL through aptitude, and now i try to access PostgreSQL without any luck. I am trying to access psql as the user postgres, but get this error message
