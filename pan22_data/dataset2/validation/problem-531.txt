My system is almost instantaneous. Visual Studio 2010 loads in under 3 seconds while I'm playing a vid on MPC-HC at the same time and cruising the web. Not bad for 9 year old system. 
THESE ARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR Win XP ONLY AND SHOULD ONLY BE ATTEMPTED BY PEOPLE WITH INTERMEDIATE TO ADVANCED COMPUTING SKILLS,-*- or people that get a kick out of frying bacon in the nude. ;-)
Caveats: NEVER symlink inside a symlinked folder. If you do, you're in for more problems than you can imagine. If you decide to also symlink the desktop itself, do not use any shortcuts that point to program files from the desktop. In fact delete all those shortcuts from the desktop and use Start --> all programs instead. Nested symlinks will wreck havoc with antivirus scanners too sending them into an infinite loop that will more than likely lock up your system. 
  If you're dead set on doing this,there is a way. Apparently you are aware of the dangers involved. That said, before you do anything, create a backup of the system. Personally I use drive image XML, or 're-do' backup. You'll need an external HDD to Bkp to. Re-Do is burnt to disk ( I burn with "starburn 9.8 ) and can recover a totally hosed un-bootable system. You will also need a burner prog later on in this process to burn a copy of a linux distro. 
  BTW - I did this because high capacity PATA/IDE ssd's are expensive, but I needed speed.  All progs recommended here are freeware that I have used myself and like. This process should work on desktops and laptops both.
I still have 32GB of space, it just gets used 8x faster than normal - lol. Aaaah the price of speed. 
I decided to write a reply because there are really no good tutorials on this subject online. I had to do this with my system, because in order to get the speed out of an SSD running Win XP the sectors have to be aligned, and I aligned mine at 4K sectors, which are blindingly fast, but which reduce my effective SSD size from 32GB to 4GB of usable space.
