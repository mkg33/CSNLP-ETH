Temporary removal seems a little risky in view of possible interruptions (eg to power!) so I’d suggest working on a copy would be safer. How to copy visible cells only is explained here. However if the hidden rows are all at the top, you could select the first ‘not hidden’ row down to the last and just copy that area. Then export from copy.
If you save once the csv file from excel sheet, excel generates the csv file full of blank spaces, but if you open the csv file and you save it again as csv file using the "Save as" menu, this new csv file won't contain the blank spaces but only the used cells.
Caveat: this answers the question by way of another spreadsheet program. The following LibreOffice extension, after installation, allows this functionality: 1) Select the desired cell range 2) Click the extension's toolbar button 3) Paste the data into a new worksheet, and save as .csv.
My best idea would be to remove the cells temporarily and then revert back to a previous state of the file.
