Will I need to use dd to copy the root partition / and /boot to the disk before copying all the other files manually?
BE AWARE: You need to substitute (hd0,0) with the appropiate disk and partition for your kernel images
I am really just wanting to berid of the multiple partitions so I can use LVM instead, I have no clue how to transfer it the "proper" way though.
Also substitute hdX with the drive as declared in your device.map, so if you have your drive declared as (hd1) you need to make it (hd1,X)
In order to boot from the new disk as you did from the old one you just need to reinstall grub in the new boot sector (I'm assuming you're using grub here).
For RedHat based Linux distros (CentOS, RHEL, Fedora) you can do this by executing as root grub-install /dev/hdX, just telling where your new hard drive is.
I have a disk with separate partitions for each folder (/usr, /var, /home etc.) and wish to transfer the whole thing to another disk that is slightly larger, now I do not wish to keep the partition scheme, so should I mount all partitions (so they populate the proper folder locations) and then rsync, or cp -avx the whole partiton (of course under runlevel 1) to the new drive?
Once you know that the new drive is in device.map from the OS booted from the old drive execute the following commands
Normally I do this kind of transfers by rsync'ing between the two hard drives, so your hunch about either rsync or cp -avx looks more than right to me.
