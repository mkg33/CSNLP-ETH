The Media_Wearout_Indicator is what you are looking for. For 100 means your ssd has 100% life, the lower number means less life left.
To check ssd life left on a (solid-state drive) ssd, you will need to install the smartmontools package. It contains two utility programs (smartctl and smartd) to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (S.M.A.R.T.) built into most modern ATA and SCSI hard disks.
The "fstrim" command from "util-linx" will run through the filesystem and issue TRIM commands for all unused space.  On distributions such as Ubuntu this is disabled by default except for a select list of "known safe" drives from Intel and Samsung.  But the command can be run manually on any partition for any drive.
On the Mac, check out the digilloydTools DiskTester. There are also some interesting data points there to see the effects of reconditioning on drive performance.
Apparently the standard recommendation is to do a full-drive write of all zeros. I'm not entirely sure why this helps (don't a lot of writes eventually kill SSDs?), but it does seem to be endorsed by the major vendor SSD support forums.
