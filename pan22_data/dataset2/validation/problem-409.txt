The first stop to answer such questions should be the datasheet of the part in question. This is where the manufacturer lists the operating conditions of the device.
Wear and tear of an electromechanical relay is usually due to switching under load, i.e. with a voltage applied to the terminals, not being permanently on or off. For more on the issue of contact degradation see here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay#Arcing (which I won't make part of this answer as it does not address the question).
A part of my engineering project involves a L.E.D tubelight staying on for 16 hours continuously. I am connecting the light to a relay module. Is it ok, if the relay stays on for so long? I mean, is it designed to sustain for such a huge period of time? 
To add to @Ghanima's excellent answer, you may also wish to consider a latching relay. Briefly, a latching relay has two stable states (i.e. it is a bistable device, similar to a flip-flop). This means that the relay can be latched into an OPEN or CLOSED state, and it will remain in that state until commanded to change by the input. This avoids the necessity of supplying input voltage and current to maintain (for example) a NORMALLY OPEN relay in a CLOSED state for an extended period of time. Latching relays typically find application in situations similar to the one you've described in your question - where they must be in an OPEN or CLOSED state for extended periods of time. 
That aside it is usually safe to have a relay active for longer periods of time, assuming you're within the operational range of current and voltage (again, as laid out in the datasheet).
