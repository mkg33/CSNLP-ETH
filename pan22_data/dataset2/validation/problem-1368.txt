If a zombie has init as its parent, then init has stopped working properly. One of the roles of init is to clean up zombies. If it doesn't do it, noone else will. So the only solution is to reboot. If init is broken, then a reboot may fail, so I'd shut down important services, sync the filesystem then hit the power button instead.
Let's keep the panic down, shall we?  A "defunct" or "zombie" process is not a process.  It is simply an entry in the process table, with a saved exit code.  Thus, a zombie holds no resources, takes no CPU cycles, and uses no memory, since it is not a process.  Don't get all weird and itchy trying to "kill" zombie processes.   Just like their namesakes, they can't be killed, since they're already dead.  But unlike the brain-eating kind, they harm absolutely no-one, and won't bite other processes.
The only way you could remove the zombie/defunct process, would be to kill the parent. Since the parent is init (pid 1), that would also take down your system.
Otherwise, I wouldn't worry too much. It's not running and it's not taking any resources and it's just there so the kernel can remember it.
