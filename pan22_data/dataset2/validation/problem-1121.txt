You want a similar user with a different name and different privileges somehow linked to an original user. AD can't do this. A user account is a user account and privileges or group membership are granted to the user account/SID.
I have a set of users in Active Directory. They are technical users, ie not associated to a real person. I need to associate them with some password different from the one they already have. Indeed this password will give them only limited rights as compared to their full rights.
But doing this I will end up with twice many users to manage. Is there a way to link two users ? For instance, if I delete username, then restricted-username is deleted as well ? Or linking properties of the two users (some properties of restricted-username would points to the ones of username)?
I understand that an appropriate way to do this is to create new users with similar names (for example, if I have an account username, I will create restricted-username). This way I can give the restricted rights to restricted-username and use this user.
