I know there are other considerations - speed, redundancy, if my link to the main site goes down the users have nothing. But I just am not convinced I need servers at these locations. 
I have one main site with several servers an a 2008/2012 environment. I have 4 remote sites that are physically close (a few miles apart) and are all connected to the main site by 20meg fiber on a private network. At each of the remote locations I have a windows server that users log in to and where their files and apps are located. 
In my opinion, it is a good idea to have at least one server in every location with more than 15-20 people.  It speeds up logins to their desktop, and it makes managing print jobs easier if they are flowing through a central server.
I am really interested in figuring out if I need servers at these locations. $3,000 to $4,000 per server every 3-5 years, licensing, administration...
It depends.  There are a number of factors that can influence whether or not you need a server at each of your remote sites, or whether you can get by with alternatives such as a backup VPN tunnel to your primary site or some sort of VDI solution like Citrix, Terminal Server or VMware View (you also don't mention if you have anything like this in place today).
There are many considerations to answering this question. But the first thing I am wondering is do I really need a server at each location? Users are just logging in to this server for permissions and a vast majority of my users are only using word, excel and email.
