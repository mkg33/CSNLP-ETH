It is not possible.  The Microsoft stand on security has always been that administrators can access everything, even things they can't access (whether that is through changing permissions or taking ownership of an object).
That said, I have seen examples where the top level users had their own single IT person just for them. They maintained separate email environments, and were the person who handled desktop IT for the C-suite. The rest of the hoi polloi IT had to work through that one person. It can really work when that one person is a nice guy and is willing to work with the rest of the company. It can be downright evil when that one person lets the power go to their head and they start going their own way just to go their own way.
Then the password for the "real" Administrator account (which still has Domain Admin and Exchange OU membership) is known only to the company directors.
At the end of the day though, if the directors don't trust the sysadmins then the business either needs less paranoid directors or more trustworthy sysadmins, depending on whether or not the directors are right to be worried.
Of course this will limit the debugging and configuration capabilities of the actual admins; but when the extra access is needed, one of the directors will have to get involved.
So, unless your executives want to manage their own Exchange server (and domain), you are going to have to live within Microsoft's bounds.
What can be done, of course, is events on those mailboxes can be audited and the event logs on the exchange servers can be secured. As Erik points out, even this won't help if a sysadmin takes a backup tape home and restore it.
What about if the actual admins (the guys who do the day-to-day work) are removed from the Domain Admin and Exchange Organization Unit groups?  My understanding[*] is that these are the necessary permissions needed to view a mailbox.
I have the utmost sympathy for the original poster: the head of my company insists on the same kind of policies.  His organization has been painstakingly created to segregate administrative power among different individuals.  It's frustrating, but the owner of the business gets to make the rules.
The only way this is possible is to not keep the emails in Exchange, which in tern exempts them from any email archiving system in place. Depending on what kind of regulatory environment you live in, that can be a very very bad idea. 
Now others, like Novell, have taken a different approach in the past where admins could have access removed from objects with no way to gain it back.  The big downfall of that is that portions of your file system, directory store, or mailboxes could easily become totally inaccessible with no recourse.
But ultimately it comes down to the trust issue. If they can't trust their own highest level Administrators to not poke their nose in areas they haven't been invited in to (perhaps they've read a bit too many BOFH stories), then that admin doesn't need to work there. It's called professional ethics, and one of the top ones for sysadmins is to not go info-hunting for curiosity. This is why I got a solid background check for this and my last sysadmin job.
