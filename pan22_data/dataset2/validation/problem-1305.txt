Alternatively, you could use something other than LAG/LACP, such as round robin. But that has very serious drawbacks and likely will be worse than using a single link.
The way to get more throughput with LAG/LACP is by using SMB multichannel, HOWEVER it is not considered stable even under the latest SAMBA release, so can it be done? Yes, via SSH to your Synology, modify the samba config file and restart the service or reboot and also verify with powershell on your machine that multichannel is enabled and in use during a file transfer. NOTE: Realize that you are potentially putting your data at risk IF you choose to do this because it's unsupported by Synology since this feature is not considered "stable" yet by samba. Best way around this is get a model with a 10Gbe card but your switch also doesn't have SFP+ ports, just SFP which is also 1Gbe so you would need another switch as well or just directly connect to your machine with another 10Gbe NIC.
All the packets going in one direction for a single connection have the same MACs, VLANs, Ethertypes, source modules, port ID, and so on. So there's no way to distribute them over multiple physical links. Thus LAG/LACP limits them to the speed of the fastest link.
