RaspberryPi uses ARM CPU so it's not possible to directly use NST on it. You would have to recompile everything and probably do some other changes in order to run this distribution. 
You could also consider setting your device up to be monitored by a cloud security monitoring service like siemless (which operates a freemium model - so free for home users). They have an interesting blog piece on setting this up on a Raspberry Pi:  https://siemless.com/blog/raspberry/
Their threat use cases appear quite basic at present, although their contextual rules look to be interesting. 
It works very well for things like scanning (nmap), limited traffic sniffing that doesn't saturate the interface (tcpdump, tshark), firewall testing (portsentry). snort should work within bandwidth limits, although I haven't tried it yet on the RPi myself.
I am planning on putting either the NST (http://www.networksecuritytoolkit.org/nst/index.html) on my Pi or just downloading a lot of similar tools and then using my Pi as a security device to monitor all the traffic on my network.  Has anyone done anything like this and does anyone know if you can boot this version of Fedora onto the Pi?
The NST page mentions including many of the sectools.org tools, and many of those are available on Raspbian. I have installed many of those on RPis and used them during network configuration and security testing work. They work well, so long as you are cognizant of the limitations of the RPi in terms of network throughput. 
You are not going to be able to sniff traffic on a busy network that saturates the RPi interface reliably, especially at 1 Gbps+ speeds. It really depends on how busy your home network is. If you're willing to live with possibly missing some traffic, it's probably more than adequate for such use.
Most of the tools should be available in Raspbian (or other RaspberryPi's distributions so that would be easier way to use the tools. 
You can also take a look at PwnPi distribution which claims to have 200+ network security tools preinstalled.
