Don't 'roam'.  Instead of seeking out the router with the highest signal strength, instruct you computer to connect specifically to your ESSID.  You may want to change the router to a different channel.
I have used both Netgear and D-Link GigE wireless routers with the WiFi disabled - DHCP works fine. 
It seems like you just need a wireless routing nearer where your wireless computer is sitting.  In that case it's pretty simple use a wireless router as an access point.  I've done this myself.
Channel 8 still conflicts with channel 11. Change to channel 6, or go with an AP in the 5GHz range (802.11A, some 802.11N AP's).
On that wireless router turn off DHCP and assign it an a static IP address in the range of your other router.  Then don't use the wireless router's WAN port at all, plug on of it's switches into your existing network.  The router portion won't be used, it'll just be bridge between wireless and your existing LAN.
I do not believe you will run into any problems if you disable the Wireless on the router. If your router does not have enough ports the DHCP should work fine with an inexpensive GigE switch with additional machines on it.
I do a lot of media work so I prefer reliability and performance of wired Gigabit Ethernet when transferring a TB or more over the network, and DHCP in home routers is very convenient for small networks.
