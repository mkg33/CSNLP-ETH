Might be an idea to keep you eyes on RedBadgers XPF project, but its going to be a long wait :P (the company was founded by the guy who did our wpf/xna implementation at work)
Not really, there is no elegent way to make silverlight/wpf and xna live side by side like that. At work we reimplemented some of WPFs basic controls to do in game 2D layout, but thats over most peoples needs. You better off rolling your own game specific UI code.
Yeah doesn't sound like that would be possible as they're both going to fight over control of directX I think. At least XNA has a decent 2D API for you to work with. You could make some simple components like a numerical display, bar display etc and possibly a little an application to visually drag them around and arrange them, then spit out an XML file with the configuration.
There are some programs that allow you to design some menus/hud/interfaces in flash and then insert them into your game. But is there something similar for making all of this stuff in Silverlight and then mount that content in your XNA game?
