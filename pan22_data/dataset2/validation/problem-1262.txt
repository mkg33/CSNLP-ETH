I'd suggest taking what I refer to as a development detour ... something where you take off 3-6 months to dig deep into an adjacent domain, which when you become competent, really supports your current thrust of work. for this, I'd highly suggest taking the time to learn 3D Mesh Modeling, specifically Blender. The concepts you'll learn will greatly support your gaming efforts from the primary objects you are looking to create to the effects you seek to create in supporting your game. Blender animations can also be exported as transparent PNG's which can be combined to form sprite sheets (very useful) fairly easily. I think it'd be worth your time.
I would recommend you the book "The Animators Survival Kit", it's not directly targeted at 2D animation using computer software but more about general animation techniques (and quite entertaining to read).
As you go trying to do higher resolution 2d animation, the thing gets more complex. A fast advice is to draw, in a, for example, 13 frames walk cycle, the frames 1, 7, 13. Then draw ibetweens of those, like 4, 10. Then the remaining ones. (is a bad example, tho)
Heres a good tutorial to get you started on one particular method using Sprite Sheets. Sprite Sheets are just that, a sheet of sprite that you run in code similar to a flip book animation in real life. But you use code to do it. It can be difficult to get started, but I feel is the most rewarding and grants the most control.
Climb aboard a brief Google of the name Sculptris. You should, in your journey, discover a three-dimensional modeling program of the same name. In my own two-dimensional-sprite-modeling endeavours, I too came to the conclusion that ProfVersaggi has. Unfortunately, I dissolved countless frustrated hours letting my brain slither over the program know as Blender. I found that I share a need with many others for a more rapid return on my "labors". Sculptris gave me this. Also, it's free as of this posting. A caveat; this program is still in development, and does experience crashing. That said, the creators of Sculptris were kind enough to implement a crash recovery feature, making the crashes little more than a mild nuisance. Open wide. Drink deep. Swallow no frustration. Digest only knowledge. Make us proud. To summarize, Sculptris is an easy way to create a 3d models for your sprites. Then, you can even press the "prtsc" or "print screen" button to copy an image of whatever is displayed on your screen to be pasted in a 2d animating software like Graphicsgale or a paint program like Paint Shop Pro. I simply cannot make it any easier for you short of doing it for you lol
Here is the first thing I found using flash which is also a good tool. I personally have not used flash perhaps another poster can chime in with their experience.
2D animation is a whole art and profession. And actually a very hard one to master. Not every animator out there does good animation, indeed. But for basic animation as you said... It depends. It's mostly simple to achieve an ok level of sprite animation for mobiles using like 4 frames for a walk cycle 24x24 pixels sprite. You can do that indeed just with Gimp and using layers transparency to have the previous or next frame in overlay as a guide.("onion skinning") .It has other features to help in this.
