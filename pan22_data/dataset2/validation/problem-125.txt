I am unable to answer this question for Mac OS X because I do not run that operating system, so at least one other answer (or edit this answer!) will be needed.
Note that many organizations' proxies can only handle HTTP and HTTPS connections, and are not designed to handle (or outright reject) other protocols by performing stateful packet inspection and rejecting all the other protocols. They might also limit which ports you can use. This Squid method should work for all outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic that obeys the routing rules of the IP stack, which, all application traffic should. It doesn't require any special hardware, but it does require administrative/root access to your own system.
In the general case, you can "force" all traffic to be routed through a proxy on localhost which can then route through the HTTP(S) or SOCKS proxy of the organization by using a configuration such as Squid. This should work on all operating systems but the configuration would be slightly different. This is especially applicable to Ubuntu, but I have no idea how well Squid runs on Mac OS X.
To set up Squid, you can follow this tutorial, or follow these general steps (outlined briefly here; should be enough if you know the tools):
