Note: Google most often pays just gimmick-attention to users' feedback, never really read their bug reports or suggestions, often closes or even deletes the forum threads involved (thus following the same path as Microsoft, and eventually the same fate). In this case, Google has closed the Issue 345698 to anyone who would have an improvement, whence my inability to post there, and my posting here instead.
Well, there must be some sort of flaw. According to other sources, this overlay can not be deactivated.
In a nutshell, the problem lies in 3rd party apps, not chrome itself: you should find which application blocks mouse hover and disable it.
According to https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=345698 the problem starts when using a drop down menu...
Whence an effective workaround: in the affected window, select all the tabs minus at least one (see Select and Move Multiple Tabs to a New Window in Chrome), and drag them out (thus creating a new window) or into another existing window: all the tabs at once recover their temporary partial status bar (for unknown reason, dragging ALL the tabs in a window doesn't work).
People mention some mouse-behaviour altering application and I found my problem in using 4t-min http://www.4t-niagara.com/tray.html that does something simmilarily unusual.
I got it back after disabling two extensions (from the cv-pls club over in room 11) and then re-starting Chrome. This brought it back.
The bug (hovering an URL FAILS to trigger, in the bottom left corner of the tab, a temporary partial Status bar showing the target of that URL) has been narrowed with precision by "liam.bro..." on Sun 23 Feb 2014 17:10:41:
I leave this here in form of an answer for further reference and will keep an eye on it if it happens again.
So I now have it back and the answer would be: Restart Chrome (probably with some extensions disabled).
