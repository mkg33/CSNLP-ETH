That said, if the drive does die, this gives them grounds to deny a warranty request if you mention doing that, and pretty much covers them if there's data loss. "It says so in the manual, you were using it wrong" 
It most probably won't but it indeed can. Any electromagnetic event has a chance, unexpected ones especially. This has actually happened to me once about 15 years ago - my laptop mainboard has got semi-fried after using a USB hard drive (a seemingly healthy one, I still use it occasionally and it's ok, no incidents have happened to it or been caused by it since then), USB ports became USB 1.1-only and memory quirks (observable with memtest86 and causing occasional unexpected behaviour during the computer usage) began to happen. I've had to apply warranty to replace the mainboard.
My understanding is that the USB standard says that if a device is active, then electricity may be flowing to and from that device, and the device is allowed to count on the idea that the electricity may continue.  This is a key reason why operating systems have support to "safely" turn off a USB device; the OS tells the USB device to start expecting that the electricity may become unavailable.
In practice, the risk seems small for USB-based thumb drives, because people do that all the time.  In practice, this DOES occasionally damage the thumb drive.  When I was actively working tech support for dozens of companies (simultaneously; I worked for a company that other companies used for tech support), I don't ever recall hearing of the computer being damaged.  So it must be exceedingly rare, but I think that the potential does theoretically exist.
Some USB implementations have done an extremely poor job of handling unexpected device disconnection.  Samsung has no way of knowing whether its drive might be used with such an implementation.  Consider the following sequence of events:
This is still called "hot pluggable", because the computer remains hot: you're not required to shut down the entire computer.
I have personally seen a usb drive fail to mount on unix after being pulled out of a Windows machine without "Safely Removing" it. Putting it back into the widows machine and doing a safe remove fixed it.
Its unlikely you will damage your pc, and somewhat unlikely you'll kill your hard drive (though sudden power stops are bad). 
Even on a really sloppy USB implementation such a sequence of events would be unlikely to occur, since everything would have to happen at certain specific times, but there's no telling what could happen if events unfolded as described.  Since it's possible that the USB implementation might work perfectly and reliably if nothing is ever unmounted unexpectedly, but an unexpected dismount could cause unbounded disaster, improperly dismounting of a device should be considered a possible cause of disastrous failure on some systems.  Since Samsung has no idea whether users of its drive might be plugging them into such systems, it errs on the side of caution by avoiding any assumption that they aren't.
"while file transfer is in progress" which means that the file structure would be in flux and could get corrupted if it doesn't have some kind of transaction system. Using "Safely Remove Hardware" will flush any delayed writes, wait until the transfer is complete and ensure no programs are using files on it.
Any time you have electricity being transferred, you shouldn't just separate the electrical connection.  In theory, the electricity could jump a small amount of air, and might find a different electrical contact.
