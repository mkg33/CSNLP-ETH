Ok, after some searching and testing I figured out the answer.  Asuming you can delete all of the reverse lookup zones in the sub domains do the following:  
I have 3 subnets, lets call them 10.10.10.1/24, 10.10.10.2/24, and 10.10.10.3/24.  I also have an Active Directory Forest (all DCs/FFL/DFL @ Server 2008 R2) with 2 subdomains, we will call them contoso.com, a.contoso.com, and b.contoso.com.  
Reverse lookup zones are becoming an issue.  For instance, the reverse lookup zone for 10.10.10.1 is on the DNS servers in contoso.com, but some servers in the a.contoso.com and b.contoso.com domains are also on the 10.10.10.1 subnet.  As a result, when a server on the 10.10.1 subnet is a member of the a.contoso.com subdomain, there is no reverse lookup zone for the 10.10.10.1 subnet.  
AFAIK, if I create the reverse lookup zone for 10.10.10.1 in the b.contoso.com domain, it will create the recors, but DNS servers in the contoso.com domain will be unaware of it.  What is the proper procesure to get correct reverse lookup information across the board automatically?  
Organizing forward lookup zones is easy, contoso.com zon on the contoso.com domain controllers, a.contoso.com zone on the a.contoso.com domain controller, etc.
