I worked for a guy that ran Windows NT 4.0 for over 2 years without a reboot.  Personally, I let Windows Update accumulate 'enough' patches, and then I go ahead and install.  Probably go about 2 months.
Personally I'm not a fan of rebooting servers (except my terminal servers) unless there's a need for it.
The various servers I am in charge of there are 3 that I don't reboot on a quasi-schedule DCs 1&2 and our Exchange server. Everything else can pretty much go up or down after 5pm but before 10pm. 
We had an internal web server (Windows 2003 & IIS) online for 600 days before we rebooted it. Of course, 600 days without a reboot also pretty much means 600 days without any patching. And that's not such a smart idea.
Even if a server has been running for a year, would it just add an unneccesary toll on the components?
Back in the bad old days of NT 3.5 and Novell it was usually a wise idea to reboot regularly, but in this day and age it's not so important.
I do it mostly because of windows' patches and cleaning out the crusty stuff. Our Citrix ICA server, has the most set schedule of reboots.
I was just visiting a server at the datacenter and notied that it has been up(without a reboot) since last October (11 months).  It is a VMHost running Windows Server 2003.
