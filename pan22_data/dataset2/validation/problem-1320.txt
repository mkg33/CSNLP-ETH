run debchange --nmu and type in a description of the change you made. This will auto-incremement the version number so that the system will not try to "upgrade" your custom package back to the standard one.
Well, it comes down to recompilation. If you don't want a full debian approved package creation environment (the right way)I've tended to use checkinstall for quick and dirty package creation (the easy way) - its not the debian recommended way, but its a lot simpler than the other way. configure then make, and substitute makeinstall with checkinstall. Then install your new package with sudo dpkg -i
Note: People have found issues with the aptitude hold command, so imho you should prefer the dpkg command to hold the package. Alternatively, you could hold the package via the Synaptic package manager GUI interface (Package > Lock Version). My preference is to use dpkg because it has worked well for me.
The answer to #3 and #4 is that you should put the package in hold status once you've installed your version. This tells the Debian package management system to "hold" any future changes to this package, in effect lets you manage the package manually.
If you download sources from official site, than there should be package itself available via apt. So you cat just download ready package, modify it and pack again:
