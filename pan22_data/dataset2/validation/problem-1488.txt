I don't know about AD domains, but samba domains only use DNS for dynamically mapping windows workstation hostnames from NetBIOS lookups to DNS, so non-windows workstations can reach them by name. This is by no means compulsory, though.
There are some ancient clients that don't support using DNS.  But most SMB clients that do not support DNS also do not support TCP/IP.
Netbios or WINS is not required to use Samba. If you disable netbios almost all SMB clients will attempt to use DNS resolution.
I am looking into setting up a Samba domain controller using Ubuntu Server, for some Windows XP/7 clients, and I have one important question: Given the importance of DNS in a Microsoft Active Directory infrastructure, why do none of the setup guides mention configuring DNS to support a Samba domain?
Netbios or WINS resolution is far more commonly used with Samba and DNS is optional resolution method depending on how you have configured your clients.
I have installed an LDAP/Samba server in a test network that I will be attempting to join using an XP client very soon, but I'm just confused as to how the client will actually "discover" the domain - as I know this is how AD domains work.
