We are currently want to demote Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise from being a DC.  Originally, it was suppose to replace our older DC, but we have decided to keep the older one operational.  Since the person who did the server is no longer with us, I am not really sure how to demote the DC.
I guess my question is can anyone point me to the right direction on how to do it?  Is this MS guide what I need to do?
Having said all this, you really should have at least two DCs at all times. Don't migrate to a configuration with a single DC.
You'll want to be sure that your DHCP scopes don't reference the DNS or WINS services provided by the machine you'll be removing the services from. You'll also want to be sure that machines with static IP configurations also don't reference these services.
Just be sure that the machine has as its first specified DNS server the IP address of another computer hosting a copy of the AD domain's DNS and run dcpromo.exe, taking the defaults (be sure NOT to specify that this is the last DC in the domain).
Removing Active Directory (AD) from a Domain Controller (DC) in a single domain environment where there are other replica DCs is pretty easy. Be sure that the remaining DC is flagged as a Global Catalog (GC) server (visible in "Active Directory Sites and Services" in the properties for the "NTDS Settings" under the DC object). If it isn't, flag it as such, because you need at least one GC at all times.
Microsofts technet has a whole chapter on this. One would assume they know the 'right' way of doing this. See the chapter
You can use the netsh dhcp server dump > dump-filename command to dump the DHCP server configuration into a text file (named "dump-filename", in this example) which can be imported onto a new DHCP server using netsh -f dump-filename. 
Step1: After Installing the 64 bit version installer the Role Active Directory domain controller with the Server Manager 
However, if you are not sure of what and how to do this, then consider that you are messing with the core functionality of your network. Tread carefully. Double and triple check.  (Or hire someone to do this for you).
When you say "...we did the AD, WINS, File Server, DNS and DHCP roles. We are going to keep it as a file server and demote everything else.", however, you make me think that you're also looking at moving DHCP, DNS, and WINS off this machine. Removing the functionality those services provide involves some planning.
When it was setup, we did the AD, WINS, File Server, DNS and DHCP roles.  We are going to keep it as a file server and demote everything else.
