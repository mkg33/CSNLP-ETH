Then you call WD, and they tell you to call Dell, and the guy who sold you the RAM is long gone as well.
By the time you've sourced top-quality third-party parts, the price gap may be substantially narrower than you anticipate.
You usually get the same warranty on an HDD by buying off of Newegg, and better pricing for RAM and HDDs.
The only thing you lose on this is extra money, once. What you gain by purchasing certified hardware is total support for the entire system.
For the most part, I buy the more expensive components from the manufacturer (in our case, that's HP).  Sure, for hard drives, I could buy top quality, bare drives for less, but then I'd have to get carriers for them, mount them, and keep a few spares available since I wouldn't be able to call up and say "ship me a new one."
If you're buying high-end servers from a supplier like HP or Dell, you will need to know a good sales person that can give you some decent discounts, as you may end up saving more than 15% on the total price from the one on the online configurators.
If you know how to build servers, you're going to want to buy all the parts yourself from a good supplier and assemble it yourself. It may end up saving you hundreds and even thousands of dollars in some cases.
Just imagine, you bought a server from Dell, and then some drives cheaply direct from WD and maybe some Kingston RAM from a guy on the corner
Other server manufacturers might actually tel you your warranty is void because you installed uncertified hardware and they are no longer responsibe for the damage it may have done. I only know for certain about Dell :)
Then something happens, you call Dell, and they tell you that unless you remove the unsupported stuff from the server, install some supported RAM and HDDs, and then fail diagnostic tests, they cannot help you, because the stuff you have in the server was never tested to work inside it. 
Basically, you're paying for: warranty (and knowing that you'll get a spare for the life of the warranty), and convenience.
One particular manufacturer that I like is SuperMicro. They are excellent when it comes to bang for buck, and they actually make motherboards, power supplies and chassis which are very good. 
If you're buying "high end servers" why would you want to dilute the value of your hardware by putting in generic parts? Part of the value of buying expensive hardware is the support you get from the vendor and the extensive testing their hardware engineers perform to certify hardware. Really that's what you're paying for.
Some manufacturers tend to use their own firmware on certain parts to make sure you can't add on your own drives to a server. 
Some people are under the impression that Dell or HP actually make the stuff inside. This is untrue, as they only make chassis, and assemble parts from other manufacturers, sometimes re-branded parts like the PERC raid cards from Dell.
