When I try to add the plugins, it asks me for my FTP details. I've setup the server entirely in SSH via terminal. I have not used any FTP related thing in it. So I'm clueless about it
Change the owner of wp-content to be the same as whatever user Apache is running as - it might be "apache" or "nobody". You're having this issue because WordPress cannot update itself unless Apache has permission to change the contents of the wp-content directory. 
But, the problem arises when I install wordpress. The installation was smooth but I can't add any plugins or media from the dashboard
As Nada stated you need to change the owner of that directory to www-data which should be the user apache is running as.
I have a rackspace cloud server running Ubuntu 12. I've setup the web server, PHP and MySQL and it's all working with my custom PHPs and databases performing as expected
Next, when I try to add media, it says it does not have enough permissions even though I've granted full permissions to the database user. Besides, I cannot change the wp-content folder to 777 from security point of view.
The images thing is pretty common, I've run into it myself before. I am sure you'll find an answer in their support:
I also had to recursively change ownership for a directory and it's files to wp-data as mentioned above and all was well.
