It sounds like a memory leak. To confirm, use the task manager to check for memory usage right after startup. Then check again when it gets slow. If you do find a process causing a memory leak you can try terminating it. 
It can be solved by using an application that forces the clocks to stay at one level. But you'll have to manually put it back to low power mode to save on power when you're done.
It is likely a memory leak.  Rebooting would flush the memory, thus fixing it.  Check to see if there is a patch for any software you added recently.  If the software's creator is aware of the leak they would eventually create a patch to fix it.  
To determine if this is the issue:  With the same things running check free memory a few times a day to see if it is decreasing.
Alright, I found the ●●●●●●●●●●●● responsible. Turns out ATI/AMD graphics drivers have a bug that causes the graphics card to spontaneously go into low power mode during gaming in some situations. Probably triggered by a media application overriding the high performance game trigger. I noticed my clocks go down when I feel the slowdown.
