Is there anything I can do to get the vm to boot? I am lost for ideas, normally p2v of a basic IDE pc works flawlessly.
When I power on the VM in VMware Workstation 6.5 (or Vmware Player 2.5) it gets to the Win 2000 boot graphic then I get a BSOD with the classic 0x7B Stop error: inaccessible_boot_device. 
It sounds like you have p2ved the individual drive partitions, not the whole disk. If this is the case you're probably missing the partition sector, and the boot block(s)
This blog post explains how to fix the issue on Linux while it's still a VM image. If it's too late for that, my advice is to get yourself a bootdisk like BartPE and run an NTFS rescue program.
In instances where I've seen this before, I boot off of the Windows CD and choose to reinstall.  It will then detect there's an existing installation and give you the option to repair it.  Take that second repair option.  You'll need to reinstall all the service packs again.
To be clear on the 'reinstall Windows 2000' you boot from Windows 2000 iso, don't follow the first Repair link, do an install, F8, then when it detects you already have Windows installed, do a repair from there. See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/263532 for details.
I am using the latest VMware Converter Standalone to p2v a physical Windows 2000 Professional SP4 PC. The PC is a standard Pentium with IDE disk from circa 2001. The disk is 20GB partitioned logically into C: and D. It converts with no errors (I did both disks into one VMDK). 
the reason this happens is the physical disk geometry has changed but the NTFS disk label is still using the old layout.
