Provides connectivity to IPv6 hosts to IPv4 hosts.  Built into Windows and hence very easy to deploy.
The 'easy' answer I can think of for your question is setting up a dual-stack device on your network which translates a dedicated v4 address to the v6 destination and advertising the v4 address on your v4-only network for the service. I am not aware of a Windows approach to this (a windows server version may be able to do this). Linux/BSD can be configured to do this.
Your question confuses me a bit, because you mention a IPv6-only service to be reached from IPv4-only clients, and then call it NAT64. But looking up NAT64 on wikipedia gives me the answer I expect: NAT64 is for IPv6-only clients to reach IPv4-only services.
You do not specify which protocols you require, if it is only HTTP then a HTTP proxy would be a valid solution.
I only know of Linux or BSD based implementations. This is one with source and pre-built binaries for different Linux distributions: http://ecdysis.viagenie.ca/download.html
If you go to http://www.sixxs.net you can sign up for their IPv6 tunneling service which allows you to use AICCU to get a routable IPv6 address even if you're behind an IPv4 NAT.
