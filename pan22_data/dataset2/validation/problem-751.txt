The AJAX console is launched from a link on the cloud provider's website which requires a login.  Exactly how is this AJAX console considered to be out-of-band when it obviously is not a form of physical access to the server?
Out-of-band is probably used in the wrong context here, but nevertheless I'm sure is intended to imply the console is similar to or emulates a typical local console. Most virtualization hypervisors (Xen, KVM, etc.) offer this by way of connecting to an IP that is attached to dom0, thus allowing you to connect to your virtualized node "out-of-band" -- meaning even if the network interface on your instance is down, you can still get access. Obviously this isn't true out-of-band by the traditional definition, but still fits the description of "system console access provided, even in the event of primary network subsystem (hard and/or software) failure" when speaking in a virtualized context. 
The first time I access my server with a new installation of Filezilla or Putty, I will get prompted that I should continue only if the RSA key shown to me is correct.  The cloud provider has advice on their website that I ought to use their AJAX console to get a key out-of-band with which to compare to the one shown by Filezilla.
