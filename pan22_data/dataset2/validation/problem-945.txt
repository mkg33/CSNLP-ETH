My problem is that I'm using the FEBE extension (which creates backups of my profile for recovery purposes) but it needs me to set a folder absolute path to tell it where the backup should be created so that, on windows, it doesn't allow a path without a letter and backslashes like "c:\whatever". But when I open firefox on linux, this path has no meaning and backups are not done.
Is there a way to have one absolute path that's understandable by both OSs? Even if it doesn't point to the same place on each OS?
FEBE also offers integrated cloud storage (thru Box.net) so you can access the backup that way from both the Ubuntu and Windows partitions.  Since you are sharing the exact same Fx profile, it doesn't matter which platform does the actual backup and posting to Box.net.  It's the very same data getting backed up, so you should only have one platform or the other perform the backup (not both).
I have windows 7 and ubuntu on dual-boot and I'm sharing the same firefox profile folder on both OSs, which is located on the windows partition (which is mounted on ubuntu startup automaticaly).
Note: I found two similar questions on this forum (though realating to different contexts) but none of the suggested answers work in this case.
