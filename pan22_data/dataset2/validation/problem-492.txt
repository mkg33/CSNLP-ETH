I also alter my prompt. I found a long long time ago that adding the last error code is just useful enough that I like it. And I like the full pathname in the prompt. And the current screen number, too. And it just makes sense to include the current user and hostname. My prompt is PS1='\u@\h $PWD $WINDOW [$?] \$ '
If i've forgotten to authenticate, it lets me do so without having to waste my typing doing ssh-add after the ssh session.
I also find I have to include export EDITOR=vim because a number of recent distros default to nano which is most annoying to be thrown into by a utility that needs you to edit something, when I was expecting vi. :-/
I use my bashrc on numerous machines, so i've got this little snippet to make sure LS is colourized. This will fix it on OSX machines, maybe even *BSD if you adjust the uname line.
However the system is centrally managed via Puppet, including the password file (which includes the shell setting).
I would echo @pjz's comment about knowing things manually rather than setting them up. Especially if you access numerous machines, like I always seem to do.
Also, I've got a command to backup a file, useful if your about to change a config file and want to make a quick copy before hand.
So one I definitely know is set -o vi because I know the vi-editing commands in bash and I don't know the emacs ones (besides, Ctrl+A interferes with screen). On my own boxes, I put that in .bashrc
