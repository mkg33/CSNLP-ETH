Then try to swap monitors (change their order of 1 and 2 internally in Windows only) and see, if the second one is actually responding.
Another thing to try if whether your second monitor has an "input" or "source" button.  If your monitor is displaying from DVI in but you've hooked up its VGA cable, then you would not get any picture.
Sometimes my second monitor isn't available too and flickrs (?) all around. Then i just turn it off and on again and then it is recognized by Windows.
I was about to try and reset to factory defaults as I read elsewhere on the web might work, but now... I don't need to.
But there might also be a wrong setting that prevents outputting video information on the second DVI-out. You might double check your setting within nVidia Control Panel and the (usually) built-in Intel Graphics Control panel or whatever.
While a DVI-I to VGA connector is also passive (no re-encoding), use of the analog pins in the DVI-I connector signal to the video source to generate VGA (analog) signalling instead of DVI, so that the monitor receives a real VGA signal as it expects.
Check if the current screen settings for your second monitor are actually supported by it (screen resolution, refresh rate).
I just encountered the same problem. Found the solution which is to right click on the 2nd monitor -> Properties -> Under the Adapter tab -> List All Modes and change it to 16 bit.
There exist "video range extender" solutions which connect signals directly to a different cable style, without changing the signal format.  This is useful if, for example, you have long VGA cables permanently installed inside the walls of your room, because you can use the existing cable to carry DVI or HDMI data.  But you must use the corresponding adapter to change the signal back to its original connector type, that matches the signal encoding.  You can't expect to connect directly to a device supporting the new connector format, since it also expects a different signal encoding.
If that doesn't help, change their connections on your PC - maybe the second DVI-out out is somehow ... "broken".
Wow, all I did was press the monitor menu buttons on the physical monitor and it magically starting displaying and no longer blank.
