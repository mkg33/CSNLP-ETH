Anyway, one additional thing you might try, just to be really fastidious about the whole process, is cleaning out your distfiles.  There are scripts out there if you search.
I would guess that the next major "problem" update will be the migration to openrc once it goes stable (it was done on ~arch middle of last year iirc with only a few issues, primarily with networking changes).
It seems like you've got it covered.  The only other tip is to maybe take it a bit slower than a blind wholesale update.  You can always update the packages or dependency chains individually with emerge -DNuav <atom> instead of world (use --oneshot for things you don't want to add in to the world file, like system libs for example).
If your goal is to have the absolute latest of all packages, then yes, that seems to cover all the bases.  I'm surprised this has worked for you for a long time, though, because I would imagine you'd get bitten often by blocks, broken deps, etc.  In the last couple years I've become much more careful about wholesale updating, electing instead to do it piecemeal after viewing the update tree.  Gentoo development seems to have passed its heyday.  Maybe it's because of the rise of Ubuntu.
Note that it's always easier to do if you keep up to date regularly rather than going for monolithic batch updates every couple of months.  Also, to avoid too many surprises, you might find it helpful to subscribe to one of the mailing lists like gentoo-user (WARNING: ~100 mails a day on this list) since pretty much any major update issues are likely to show up on the list with plenty of discussion explaining how to solve them.
