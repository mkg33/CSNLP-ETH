I have setup a VM with Windows Server 2008 x64 R2 (Server Core). This obviously leaves out the GUI but only gives me a command prompt.
http://www.petri.co.il/installing-remote-server-administration-tools-rsat-windows-vista.htm - This link provides details on an update for Vista to do configuration of the server from Vista (my host OS) but I am not on any of the supported versions.
MS documentation for Server 2008 Core has instructions on configuring AD, DNS, DHCP, etc via the command line.  This can be done via local or RDP session.
If you are on Vista Home then you are probably going to run into other problems because Home can't join a domain, but RDP can be used from a Home computer.  This isn't a GUI but will allow remote connection to the cmd line.
Which is supposed to list the services, the CMD says this is not recognized as an internal or external command.
Also, I have the original Core Configurator but as it was pulled from the web I don't think redistributing it would be advisable - but it rocks for setting up the basics including firewall rules and of course dcpromo without the need to prepare an unattend file manually.
