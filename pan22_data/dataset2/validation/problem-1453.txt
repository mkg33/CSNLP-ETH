Simple solution here - create new column use =datevalue(cell) formula then copy the formula into your other rows- a few seconds to fix
This problem was driving me crazy, then I stumbled on an easy fix.  At least it worked for my data. It is easy to do and to remember.  But I do not know why this works but changing types as indicated above does not.
I can do this for the year as well, then create a date from the three components that is consistent. Otherwise, I can use the individual day, month, and year values in my analysis.
This may not be relevant to the original questioner, but it may help someone else who is unable to sort a column of dates.
See Images 1 and 2 for the example... (note - some fields were hidden intentionally as they do not contribute to the example).  I hope this helps...

I found that Excel would not recognise a column of dates which were all before 1900, insisting that they were a column of text (since 1/1/1900 has numeric equivalent 1, and negative numbers are apparently not allowed). So I did a general replace of all my dates (which were in the 1800s) to put them into the 1900s, e.g. 180 -> 190, 181 -> 191, etc. The sorting process then worked fine. Finally I did a replace the other way, e.g. 190 -> 180.
In the export loop when you hold each cell, if it's a date, convert to number using CLng(myDateValue). This is an example of my loop running through all rows of a table and exporting to CSV (note I also replace commas in strings with a  tag that I strip when importing, but you may not need this):
This is still cumbersome if you have many years in your data. Faster is to search for and replace 201 with 201 (to replace 2010 through 2019); replace 200 with 200 (to replace 2000 through 2009); and so forth.  
If you have control over the VBA program that exports the data, I suggest exporting the number representing the date instead of the date itself. The number uniquely correlates with a single date, regardless of formatting and locale.
