You will probably have to change your critical value to something other than 5 to get the same kind of coverage. According to Wikipedia, you'll want the new critical value to be $5\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}$ if your data are iid Gaussian. 
The estimator for the mean would be the truncated mean, and the Wikipedia page for trimmed estimators mentions how to get a decent estimator for the standard deviation from the interquartile range.
How can i fix this problem? Is there another method that i can use to identify thresholds without this issue?
An alternative that might be more difficult to implement, but is probably more statistically appropriate, is to use trimmed estimators for the mean and standard deviation. With trimmed estimators, you throw away the most extreme values in your data (the proportion of which is specified beforehand), and estimate your statistics on the remaining data. 
Instead of mean and standard deviation, you could estimate the median and mean absolute deviation. The median is immune to outliers, and the MAD should be at least more robust than the standard deviation formula. 
What doesn't work with this approach is that if I have more than one anomalous value in a day, they are not detected. This because error, mean and standard deviation are too much influenced by anomalous values.
