I've already tried all the "standard" VirtualBox procedure (PAE yes/no; SATA/IDE; no soundcard; no USB; graphics accel. yes/no).
If I choose the Debug mode, I see some messages and a hint to type exit to boot, but still no success
I also tried run the Live CD in VESA mode: like this it starts, but I'd still prefer to run it from the HDD.
If I start the VM with the first option I get error Failed to find cpu0 device node. I found out that it's just a non-blocking warning and it's unrelated with the real blocking-issue being that "uvesa (v86d) is broken" (the issue was related to Android 4.4: is it still valid on 6.0?)
I don't know if this helps for your case but for me it helped, that I uninstalled the current Version of VirtualBox, installed the older 5.2.0, then I could install Android and it didn't hung at first startup this time. After it was installed and booted for the first time I could update my VirtualBox (again) to the newest Version and Android booted fine like under 5.2.0. It was only the first startup - with configuration - as it seems where you need the older VirtualBox-Version.
