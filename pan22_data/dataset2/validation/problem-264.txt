You might try Synergy. Can't say if that's what you want but there's no extra hardware necessary. Here's a link (URL):
This could be a cheap answer, but what about VNC.  Looks as those somebody figured out how to go from Mac to Windows, you just have to decide which will be "Master".
If the monitor only has 1 input as you have described then you will require a Video Switcher often known as a KVM Switch.
From the hardware point of view, you may try to purchase a Monitor Switch e.g. Belkin Switch2 KVM, Belkin SOHO KVM Switch or some cheaper version TRENDnet 2-Port USB KVM Switch Kit. It's also called KVM switch.
When I tried it a few years ago, it used a fairly large chunk of CPU power on one of the computers (don't recall if it was the master or slave).  I think you'd probaby be better with a hardware option (multiple inputs on monitor or KVM switch).
You might be able to make it work by installing the software on the PC, connecting the monitor to the mac and en/disabling it on the mac to switch the monitor between computers.  It's not clear from the documentation if the software will auto-reconnect or not.
This also means that you will be able to share 1 keyboard and mouse for the 2 computers although if you prefer to keep the 2 (A better solution for a MAC + PC combo as in your case) then you can.
If you really want a software option, MaxiVista might be able to do what you want; but is primarily intended to slave the screen of one computer to a second, not to let you swap a monitor between two computers.  Reading the documentation I think you might need to have a dedicated screen for your PC to control it though, since it only supports using a mac as an extra monitor for a PC and not the other way around.
