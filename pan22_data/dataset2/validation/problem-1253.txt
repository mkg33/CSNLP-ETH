The best two books here are both from Itzik Ben Gan - Inside SQL Server T-SQL Querying and Inside SQL Server T-SQL Programming.
Two excellent suggestions from @MikeWalsh. I would add Grant Fritchey's SQL Server 2008 Query Performance Tuning Distilled along with the excellent free ebooks from Redgate. SQL Server Execution Plans is an excellent reference to start with.
From a different angle, I strongly believe knowledge of internals are important for all aspects of working with SQL Server. To this end, both Microsoft® SQL Server® 2008 Internals and Professional SQL Server 2008 Internals and Troubleshooting are essential reading.
However, when you set the refactoring standards, don't apply them manually, but use a tool to refactor the code
Here's a good book for code refactoring: Joe Celko - SQL Programming Style. I like to compare it to MS Manual of Style for Technical Publications. The latter one you use to write your articles, blogs and documentation; the first one to write your code
If you have problems with code readability (either yours or team's), this book will help you set your own standards. Here's from its review:
Read the Querying one first. Covers all the important information on how queries are processed, thinking in terms of sets, etc. Covers all aspects of querying. The second book goes into programming constructs when working with T-SQL. Amazing books.
