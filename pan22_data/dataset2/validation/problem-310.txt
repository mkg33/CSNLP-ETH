DNAT happens in the POSTROUTING chain, that is, after Linux has made its routing decision. Linux selects the outgoing interface for an IP packet by selecting an entry for the next hop via a lookup in the routing table.
However, I do not know if it is possible to implement this "different interface for every outgoing TCP connection" with it. It would require TCP connection state tracking to make sure a single TCP connection would always use the same outgoing interface. Even if it would be possible, it requires lots of effort to implement and good understanding of TCP/IP networking.
This means, that the interface which to use for the outgoing packet is already selected when the packet enters the POSTROUTING chain. The, the DNAT rule cannot be used with an IP address that is not bound to the outgoing packet's interface. This is why your packets will have the original interface IP address.
To actually get the behaviour you want, you need to somehow alter the routing decision to get Linux to use another interface. Policy routing is the mechanism used to alter the default routing behaviour of Linux.
