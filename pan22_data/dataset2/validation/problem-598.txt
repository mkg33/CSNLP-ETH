Additionally (depending on what your rules are) you should consider doing these calculations as a check before the tower is placed. This will disallow the player from placing towers that block all paths. Or as some tower defense games work, if the play blocks all paths, the units just ignore towers when path finding.
You can likely save calculations by grouping units in the field and calculate a common path for them all. For example if you have a group of units in tile (4,7), they can all use the same path, so you just have to calculate it once.
A* should be plenty fast enough. Each time a tower is placed you should calculate a new path for each spawn point, and assign that path to each unit that is spawned there. You should also calculate a new path for the units "in the field". Units in the field can have their paths calculated as the shortest path to get back on track, as in a path to the new path. Or the units can have their path calculated from their current position to the destination.
