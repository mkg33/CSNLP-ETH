Why does the native resolution differ from the supported resolution? when I input the 1280 x 1080, does the resolution turn to a true 1280 x 1080, or is it simply spoofing me? Are there any other performance quirks to turning the resolution up?
In the title, it advertises 1080p resolution, however, if you scroll down, you'll see in the description:
The input (aka "support") resolution(s) indicate what the projector/display will accept.  Naive users only look for the maximum input resolution, but you should check for support of every possible resoluion that you might use.  
You can mirror output from a 1280x1080p display so you can work in the higher resolution while the projector puts out a reduced resolution version of what the presenter is seeing rather than having to reduce both screens to the projector's native resolution.
When the input resolution matches the native resolution, no scaling is performed and you get an accurate 1:1 mapping.
You actually need to know all the specs, not just one number.  The native resolution may be considered more important to picture quality, but the quality of the scalers and support for the input resolution(s) that you want to use are just as salient.
Because there is more than just one type of resolution.  You're conflating the different types of resolutions.
