Just Move to a cell which is in range (the one not broken of the Range), click on Format Painter and then paste on whole Column. Again it will show Where it has broken, you just need to do a Format Painter to the Cell which has broken the range. Now, this too may seem a bit lengthy, you can just build a simple macro  for this.
You extend the area by selecting the last row/column and "copy-drag" on the small square at the bottom left of the "cursor". This way the "Apply to"-range should remain intact. (Note that this will not extend any formulas on rows or columns like insert does.)
This works for me when I have conditional formatting that's applied to columns, and I usually set the formatting for the whole column, eg. $F:$F. It should still work if you're formatting for a partial range, just make sure that when you're done adding/removing and resorting that all the data you want formatted is still within your original range parameters.
I sometimes also define a name for the area I want to format. It won't be used in the rule, but you can clean the rule up by removing all rules but one and use the area name in the "Applies to" section.
I've experienced a very similar issue. I've made a few macros to add rows, and copy down formulas, and then adjust columns and row sizes to format how the sheet looks. I've found this issue occurs in one of two occasions.
2) When there are merged cells inside the "applies to", and any of the rows or columns get adjusted.
It appears during the merged cell issue, that excel has to unmerge everything, recalculate its conditional application, adjust all the cells (add or delete rows or what not) and then remerge them back. Its invisible to us but that seems to be how it is applied.
I've found that rules are very easy to break, but here's something you can try that don't seem to break any rules.
If you paste without format (Paste > Paste Special > Unicode Text or similar) the special formatting will not be copied, and as such the "Applies to"-range should not change.
