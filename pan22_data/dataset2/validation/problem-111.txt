There are many factors that go into whether or not bounce back will happen; transmission signal strength, wire resistance, cable length, etc.
So, whatever the minimum is, it's long enough to not receive bounce back. In the early days of Ethernet networking, for twisted pair it was one meter. Today equipment is usually manufactured with a number of counter measures to reduce or eliminate the effects of bounce back. I've reliably used cables as small as one foot without problems. But again, that will depend on whether the rest of the physical equipment and software can compensate adequately for the short length.
I'm not sure if the minimum cable length was ever listed in an RFC. Whatever the minimum is depends on several factors.
For a networking signal, if the signal bounces back and is strong enough to reach the sender, then the sender has to figure out if the signal is new, or a reflection of its own transmission.
A basic description of the problem caused by cables being too short is that the electrical signal, when transmitted will bounce off the end of the wire and reflect back in the other direction. Just like throwing a ball at a wall if you're close enough to the wall when the ball bounces back it may reach you.
