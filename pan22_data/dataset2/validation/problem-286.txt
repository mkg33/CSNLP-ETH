You might have a problem with the Server and/or "Computer Browser" services, in which case just restarting those services will solve all your ills.
Most likely it is an issue with the 128-bit encoding that Windows 7 uses. XP is not compatible with it and can't decode the folder contents.
this enabled me to find the shared folder, use shared printer on win 7 machine but it does not appear on the list of machines in the Network Places
To do it straight forward you must have the same account name with the same password on both computers, then that'll work. I did this for my wife laptop that is running Windows XP and she can access shared folders on my Windows 7 computers without any problems.
This is probably because the "Password-protected shares" option is disable that it doesn't work... Also, do you have a password on each computer? If there is one computer that have no password on admin account, sharing won't work, for security reasons.
Ran into the same problem, this solved the problem for me although it might be unsuitable for your environment.
To solve this, in the Windows 7 computer under Network and Sharing Center. in the Home or Work profile, set it to allow computers with a lesser encoding to access the shared folders.
In the Network Sharing Center on Windows 7, you need to put on the compatibility mode for Windows XP.
