After the restart, everything should be peachy keen. If, like me, you just want to rely on your root router to provide WiFi, be sure to disable WiFi on your TP-Link Router. If, instead, you want to use WDS Bridging, there are some additional instructions to follow at https://www.tp-link.com/us/faq-825.html, which is where I got some of the instructions above.
(For example, my Google WiFi app showed the Router LAN address as 192.168.86.1, and the DHCP Address Pool starting at 192.168.86.20 and ending at 192.168.86.250. So I chose 192.168.86.2 for my Archer C5.)
Remember that if you ever need to change your router's settings again, you'll go to the new IP address that you configured instead of the original one.
I just got this working. I just bought Google WiFi in hopes of improving the WiFi networking, but I have several devices on my network that still need to be connected via Ethernet. Devices like printers didn't show up on the same network as the WiFi when I just used the Archer C5 as a downstream router. This is basically the same idea as David's answer, but with a little fleshing out.
