If you're more interested in content that formatting for now, Google Docs would be a good free solution. Multiple people can edit the same document simultaneously.
If you definitely want to use Word, you could use master documents/subdocuments to split the document up. Each subdocument could be edited independently, but would still be linked into the master document. If you choose this option, be very careful to make frequent backups -- it's rather easy for master documents to get corrupted (although this seems to be improved with more recent versions of Word).
Having the document be stored in a Dropbox allows multiple users to edit it sync the changes, though I'm not sure how well it handles concurrency. I think Google Documents allows something like this, but that also may not be exactly what you're looking for.
Take a look at Groove in the suite, it should allow you to do what you need - multiple people on the same document.
If you have 10 people editing the same document, I am guessing you are a large(ish) company with full copies of Microsoft Office.
If you don't need all of the fancy word style stuff while this document is being created, it might be easier to set up a wiki or source control server, then assign somebody to copy it to Word and add the styling at the end of the project. That way, you get the HUGE benefits of being able to track changes and go back to any point in the history of the document.
