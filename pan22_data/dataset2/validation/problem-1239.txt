For my OpenSSL database file the second column corresponds to the expiry and my invalid entry that caused this error was '20160505000000Z'. This particular entry had 2 extra digits compared to all other entries. The 2 extra digits were the '20' of the '2016'. I manually changed this to '160505000000Z' and then this error went away. 
Not sure how it allowed that to be written in the first place, but that is what fixed mine. Hope this helps somebody.
To fix this just go manually modify your database file and make the expiration date look as it should.
'entry 22' refers to line 22 of the database file for the CA - in your case it sounds like this file is 'index.txt'. My error was 'entry 477' which refered to line 477 of my CA's database file.
I know this is a really old question, but just ran into this issue myself and took a long time to solve - hoping this might help somebody in the future. Also, seeing how this is still one of the first results google provides for a search on this error, it seems relevant to post here.
