However when I go to a .php file on a browser (using my VM's ip-address/~username/phpfile.php) it does not display it as it should. Instead it offers to save to file/asks what program to open it with. Interestingly though that dialog box does recognise that it is a php file.
I'm running a Ubuntu Server on a VM, to test out different web forum solutions. I have set up a ~/public_html/ to be accessible with the apache2 web server, and that works fine.
This needs to be done in httpd.conf for the directory in question. It would look something like this:
You need to configure apache so that it will start the php interpreter when a .php file is requested instead of just returning the file's contents.
Prizes go to whoever can explain why? :D (And by prizes I just mean a well done, no actual prizes I'm afraid.)
Turns out files this behaviour was only apparent on files in the ~/public_html/ directory. All php files in /var/www/ work fine.
Check .htaccess for AddType row. I had a custom AddType which caused bad content-type. Firefox helped me debug the issue, but you can also use wget.
