It's either the case that the ports are blocked by a firewall, DNS resolution isn't working or is giving out the wrong address, or the service you're looking to access isn't running.
I have setup an mx record (about 36 hours ago), e.g. mail.mydomain.org, and also one for mydomain.org. I don't know if I need both.
So I'm guessing these ports aren't open, and I haven't configured the server to listen on IMAP or SMTP properly. 
Check that, if your mail client is trying to use SSL to connect, your IMAP and SMTP daemons are actually configured to accept SSL connections.  If you don't want to do that, turn SSL off in the client settings.
Check that the DNS names you're specifying in the client for the SMTP and IMAP servers are correct, and that you can open a connection (using telnet or something) to that host on the appropriate ports (eg. 25 and 143).  If you want, try doing an IMAP or SMTP session yourself in the telnet client and see if it gives out the right responses.
I have installed Dovecot, which I understand handles imap requests for Postfix, but i'm such a newb that I'm struggling to work out if my server is using sendmail or postfix.
The problem is: When I try to add an IMAP account on a mail client, it tells me it the server is not responding. The same when I get to adding the SMTP.
I am setting up my first sendmail daemon on centos, using virtual domains and emails. So far, I have got it working and emails sent from remote servers will make it to the inbox.
The MX record does not indicate much of anything to the client.  Mail clients look up the A or AAAA record for the DNS name provided as the IMAP or SMTP (or POP3) server.  MX records are for providing an indication of which servers are mail exchangers for your domain (eg. which server to send mails to when the recipient is at your domain).
