Click on your each screen, and see the actual resolution and how it's even connected to your computer.
First of all. You should not be using windows to control anything resolution related. You should be using the Nvidia software to control that. When you finally do install (or update) the software, you will have way more control over each screen and what it can display. 
How can I resolve this discrepancy? Could the display be at a different resolution and not the claimed 1920x1080?
I've presently got three displays connected to Windows 10. My video cards are NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060. According to the Windows Advanced Display settings, all three displays are 1920x1080. However, it looks like one display, which is an LG TV, is actually a 'lower' resolution. When I move any app window to that display, it takes up a lot more of the screen space. But looking through any scaling settings I can find, it looks like everything is 100% scaling.
My guess is, one of your screen's isn't capable of 1080p resolution or your settings are wrong. And you should fix them in the nvidia software.
