For what it's worth, I just checked the PDF you linked to with Safari 4.0.4 on Mac OS X 10.6.2 and while there is some Engrish, the PDF it renders flawlessly without any onscreen "garbage". Perhaps you're having Unicode issues (more common on Windows than Mac OS)?
The download of file 1 failed for me, file 2 I could open with xpdf, a fast and open-source pdf-viewer. I guess it can't handle forms, but for pure text and grafic I prefer it for its fast startup time.
Some documents can be protected from being converted to text by fooling the Adobe Reader. For example letters can be drawn in several overlapping shapes in such way that visually they would still look the same, while text recognition software would fail to recognize text. Your document is an example of such protection.
Unfortunately it cannot be helped. PDF documents do not actually contain any letters, but they contain shapes of letters. In other words instead of reading a letter and drawing it on the screen Adobe Reader as any other PDF reading application would simply draw the vector graphics encoded in the file.
One way would be to print the document into an image and let text recognition software recognize it. Higher resolution for the image will improve the quality. This method however is not really handy.
However, some PDF readers come with software that allows to analyze the shape and recover the text by using text recognition. It works same as if you scanned a paper of printed text and used software like ABBYY FineReader to convert it back to text, but due to infinitely high quality of vector drawings results are typically much better than for scanned documents.
Simplest way to get around this is to open the file in a recent version of Google Chrome with built-in PDF reading plugin.  Then you can use Chrome's search feature to find text, and copy-paste works correctly.
