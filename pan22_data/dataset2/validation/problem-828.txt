That's my development server, though, which is under some load.  I'd expect higher numbers if the array was idle, like I suspect yours is.

Just for some perspective, I don't exactly know if your buffered reads are "slow" but I put mine up for comparison.
On a PERC H200 card, caching is forced to be disabled for all physical disks configured into a virtual disk, regardless of the drive type and default drive settings.‚Äù
The default cache policy on a physical disk is Enabled in SATA drives and Disabled on SAS drives. When physical disk caching is Enabled, disk I/O performance is improved, but a power outage or equipment failure might result in data loss or corruption. 
Enable cache directly from the firmware. YOU MUST be running on a battery backup or if power goes out you could be hosed by enabling the cache. Below is a tutorial explaining the full process to do so.
If the server has battery backup you can enable basic drive caching on the Logical Volumes without risk.
I have 4 1TB Western Digital Enterprise 7200 RPM drives on a 3Ware 95500-SX and my hdparm results are
The long answer: The H200 is the old SAS 6iR with SATA 6Gb/s support. It doesn't have the usual features you'd see on a RAID card (battery backup unit, onboard caching, RAID5/6 support). The cache determines how fast your RAID array is (along w/ the # of spindles and type of drive), so no cache = slow performance. Add the 7200RPM SATA drives (which are slow compared to a 10-15k RPM SAS drive) and that's the level of performance you can expect.
