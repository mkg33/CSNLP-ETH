I suggest you to stop these services if they are running and put them in manual or disabled (IF your PC is NOT connected to a Windows Server...)
From your description, it sounds like one of the drivers is having a problem. Hopefully all that is required to fix it is to update the driver. Another fairly easy solution would be to adjust certain BIOS settings depending on what is causing the problem.
Warning: use Autoruns with caution. Don't disable or delete anything unless you really know what's you're doing.
I also had the same problem - Windows 8.1 with i7 4700MQ- quad core -> one core - specifically always core 2 gets hot.
I found a workaround for the problem - after waking up from sleep - go to each windows explorer window that is open and press Ctrl+N -> this  opens the same folder in a new window. 
The processes signatures/checksums are compared to the System Explorer database, There's many useful features but one interesting is the possibility to send any file, program, to VirusTotal...
6) Update Windows and your applications. I suggest you to double check with the online Secunia's Online Software Inspector and set the option Enable thorough system inspection (Java must be installed to run these tests)
Hint: some Windows services slow down Personnal Computers when they are not connected. as a workstation, to a Windows Server such as Server, LanmanWorkStation and LanmanServer.
Task Manager is limited. Use Process Explorer to get a better insight into exactly what is spinning the CPU.
2) From the same, dowmload and install Autoruns (to know what started with Windows) and Process Monitor (for future detailed system checkup like tracing boot process...)
After you have opened the new windows for all -> close the old windows -> Voila! your explorer CPU usage drops to negligible and CPU temp also comes down - don't know why it happens though!
I dont think its a process per say, I just think it is a driver that is having trouble, literally, waking up. 
You may start the services.msc but the best is to run mmc.exe and add services.msc in a personalized "console". (This keep your display setup for the next time).
5) Check if there is defective driver for devices with devmgmt.msc (or add it in the same "console" created for services with mmc.exe...). Check if there's yellow triangle, if so update the driver... If not: don't fix what ain't broken...
