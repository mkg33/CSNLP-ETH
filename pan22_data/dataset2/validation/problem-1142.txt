Using n+1 redundant datacenters and quality hardware may be crucial to how much uptime you will have and how long the lifespan of a server will be.
A single request is absolutely no work (relatively) for current hardware.  5,000 domains worth of zonefiles would fit on your average thumb drive.
I would recommend that you get yourself 4 mid-range servers with redundant disks and set up a DNS infrastructure in two locations.  This way you have redundancy at each site, and geographically as well.  Consider this:  If your location were go to dark, how would you serve DNS for the 5,000 domains?
Obviously one was in a location, and the other in another geographical location, for redundancy purposes. RAID-1 may be sufficient, as long as it's hardware RAID.
The only stats I have on DNS are from my personal server farm (personal site, projects, hosting for freelance clients) as I don't run the DNS machines at work. This is for about 6 domains, with about 15,000 WWW views per month. The servers are both older HP Proliants, dual 1.4GHz pentium, 2GB RAM, and both are hosting more than DNS (also DHCP and a slew of other services). I have a script that pulls query stats every hour. I'm seeing an average of 21M queries on my primary server and 100k queries on my secondary each day. The BIND process doesn't even show up in top.
Also, considering that ISPs offer DNS servers to their clients, the number of requests that actually make it back to the SOA is far lower than the number of people who are visiting your site.  Say, for example, 50,000 people in Eastern MA on Verizon DSL visit your site in the space of 1 hour, that's only likely to generate a handful of DNS requests which you have to respond to.  Verizon would be doing it's own level of caching.
DNS is a very simple protocol that incorporates a TTL (Time to Live) into it's response data.  That being said, a single user browsing www.mysite.com will only ask for DNS once every X minutes (Default is usually 1 hour, or so).  I'm only pointing this out so that it's clear that the number of hits per second isn't so important as the number of unique hits per second.
Personally I'm running DNS for about 40 domains on 3 VMs behind a load ballancer (sadly all in one site).  The machines have basically 0 CPU and memory load on them besides the basic OS.
We've got MRTG style reports for the bandwidth for each VIP, and the two DNS VIPs show less then 1k of bandwidth average (we've got about 40k customers hitting us daily).
