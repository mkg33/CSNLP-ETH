You could use Windows Home Server -- either by buying a HP MediaSmart etc or by getting a copy of the OS.  I believe that it is include in the TechNet subscriptions and available retail.  The P3 you mentioned above would easily run it.
WHS has a drive mirroring technology -- not really RAID but similar.  This mirroring technology allow you to decide which data needs to be stored redundantly.
It has a connector that is installed on Windows client machines to automatically backup the machines.
Freenas is great.  I would look at the rsync options in freenas to get the redundancy you want/need if you don't want to spend the money for the sata card
It may not be quite as cheap as reusing an existing box, but it's likely to be quieter (I replaced the fan on mine - easy and cheap), smaller, and take a lot less effort.
Personally I have a Thecus N2100 which I've been very pleased with. Recently one of the drives died, and when I'd worked out which one it was, I simply ordered a replacement, followed the instructions to rebuild the RAID array, and all was fine again. In the meantime, I still had read/write access.
I backup my most sensitive and critical files (financial, personal records) to matched set of thumb drives that stay in a fireproof safe.  Other stuff (pictures, home videos) go to DVDs. These can easily be stored off-site.
