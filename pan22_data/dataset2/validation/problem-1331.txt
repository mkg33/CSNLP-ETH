My password manager was giving me a message that it could not find default browser so it finally clicked that this may be related to my Drive issue.
I recently moved my back up and sync to another user profile on my Win 7 (I removed laptop from a domain I was no longer attached to).  I had a similar problem, where I tried to start back up and sync and received a blank window (no ability to login).  When I clicked "If having trouble, use browser to login' the browser (Chrome) would not launch.  I do not have IE installed.
I just ran into this issue on Win7-64 with 2FA enabled while attempting to install Drive on my desk for the first time. The 2FA request got sent to my phone (Nexus 5x) stating that another computer was trying to sign on to my account.  I answered YES it's ok, the phone beeped and the notification went away.  The Sign In window on the desk never acknowledged that auth, apparently.  Fixed the issue by selecting "Try another way to sign in" then "call me".  An automated call gives you 6(?) digits to enter into the desk Sign In page, which then worked as expected.
