Try OpenVPN.  I've used it going from OS X to Linux, and they say the server works great on FreeBSD.
You specify the Mode_CFG parameters in a separate section of the racoon.conf file. The setup is fairly straight forward on FreeBSD, if you understand the basics of IPSEC.
OpenVPN is also a possibility, although I've never used it on Mac OS X and so can't comment on ease of set-up. A quick web search reveals a few GUI clients, so that might be worth investigating.
To perform client configuration (mode_cfg) I use racoon as the ISAKMP daemon on FreeBSD.  This is part of the IPSEC-TOOLS package.  It is available in the FreeBSD ports tree as 
And you should be able to make it all work...  I have found FreeBSD to pretty stable as a VPN RAS server, and it is quite quick, compared to the smaller Cisco PIX firewalls (501/506/e)
Having set up IPSec in a simple tunnel mode between two hosts once, I swore I would try and stay away forever. In terms of alternatives to IPSec/IPSecuritas, you might want to investigate setting up a PPTP VPN, as Mac OS X (and other major operating systems) contain a PPTP client built-in. There are two good options for PPTP servers on FreeBSD:
I mostly use either IPsecuritas and pfSense. Or work via SSH Portforwarding. Look for the "-L" option.
This is a fairly straight forward config on FreeBSD, if I understand you correctly.  You want to create an IPSec (presuming tunnel mode) connection between your Apple and a FreeBSD machine, and because you have a dynamic IP for the Apple, you need to be able to authenticate the tunnel some how.  I would presume you are using a PreShared key?
I've used OpenVPN and OpenVPN-AS extensively on FreeBSD gateways and a variety of clients. AS is a commercial option, but the client is better with more comprehensive support than that of the standard OpenVPN client. Setting it up really is a doddle with the instructions.
