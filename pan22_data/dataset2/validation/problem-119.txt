I found if I have other PDF files open while trying to insert a PDF into a Word document I get this message.  If I close all opened PDF files running in my background I am able to insert a PDF with no problem.  Not sure why but that was my solution for my laptop.  I have a desktop and I am able to run Adobe Acrobat and install PDF file into word with out having to close anything.  Could be in my settings in Acrobat.  Hope this helps  
The "Correct" answer suggested here (first search result in google) didn't work for me and gave same error  .  
To insert the PDF into a word document you simply need to open Word select insert object, in the Object windows select the create from file tab and browse to the file you want to insert, select it now you need to tick on one of check boxes below depending on how you want the file to appear, if you want it to appear as an icon you both check boxes must be selected otherwise select just link to file.
While digging for escape routes facing the same issue, I figured this error could occur from a crashing adobe/acrobat program running in the background in Windows system.
