What are the solutions out there to either automate the process or just make it a little easier? Sometimes it's a pain just to find all utils again and read through a lot of old blog-posts on strange installation procedures again.
If you mean a complete reinstall - also the complete OS, Windows 7 - there is a tool for your needs.
Also, when possible, backup settings, export registry keys, etc. after getting things initially configured.  That way you can reimport them quickly after reinstalling instead of walking through dialog boxes twiddling bits.
A little easier? Windows Easy Transfer http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/transferring-files-and-settings-frequently-asked-questions . Make it the first thing to run on a fresh Windows 7 set up. When ET is done, it will also tell also you which applications need to be installed.
Save copies of that information and data, particularly blog posts that might disappear from the internet.  Toss it in a "reinstall" folder on your system.
For the programs I have that require no installation, I have a folder ready to copy to a freshly installed system.
(I'm not quite sure why you would want to just re-install the System. Like most UNIX systems, OS X doesn't really degrade over time. I guess it might be useful if you were really unlucky and got hit with some MalWare.) 
To copy an OS X installation, files and all, you can just do a backup with Time Machine, reboot from the installation DVD using the "Restore System from Backup" option, and then wait. This process is completely automatic.
I would use vlite to make an unattended install, as you can specify the programs that are installed with it. Works perfect in a server environment too. 
If you want to re-install just the System, without touching the Users data, use Time Machine again: restore everything from the oldest copy of the Home disk that you have, that has all the utilities you want. When that's done, use Time Machine to restore the latest Users folder backups.
Whenever I setup a new computer or re-installs an existing one I'm using a day or more to get all the software and settings setup, so the environment is like the one, I'm used to.
