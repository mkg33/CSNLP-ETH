Can anyone speak precisely and non-urban-legendfully on these UPS and power strip interactions, if there are in fact ones worth thinking about?
Granted this is not exactly what you're describing, but I would say based on my experience that nothing should be run "upstream" of any quality UPS. Plugging a power strip in "downstream" of the UPS may not be up to fire code (per @sysadmin1138 excellent response) but it's probably not going to hurt anything.
Strictly speaking, don't hang a surge protector that uses MOVs for protection off a UPS that doesn't put out a real sine wave (most are kinda squarish, line power is a sine wave).
We've had cheap power strips blow up when connected directly to a wall (with poorly conditioned power coming from a bad transformer), and we've had the same happen to a UPS.  When our transformer was on the fritz, the bad power would flow through the power strip, but wouldn't flow through the UPS (we had printers die that were connected to a power strip, but nothing die connected to the UPS, other than the UPS itself). 
Sometimes I hear that you shouldn't plug (UPS brand X / any UPS) into (power strip brand X / any power strip) because of some interaction leading to poorly conditioned power, reduced battery life, massive explosions spattering the room with battery acid, and so on.  Sometimes I hear that it's the power strip that you shouldn't plug into the UPS.  What I haven't gotten is a clear idea of how reliable these recommendations are or how generally/specifically they apply.
The problem might not been the power strips per se. It might be the number of devices you can now hook into one source for electricity. Increasing the number of parallel circuits increases the amount of current being drawn through that power source. The more current, the more heat produced. If you are lucky the breaker will trip before it gets to be too much for the outlet and the devices on the daisy chained strips/UPS. If you are unlucky and/or the wiring is not up to code you will start an electrical fire. 
Do not hang a surge protector off your UPS, as it will waste a big % of your power, it has to do with the way the cheap surge protector interacts with the non sine wave power from the UPS.
In our specific case, the server had a clock that ran ridiculously fast, as in, it would gain 5+ secs per hour. Removing the "double UPS" fixed this.
I have seen some very, very bad server interactions when you plug a UPS into another UPS, and run a server off it.
You must also remember that the flow of electrons is limited by the size of the pipe/wire it is going through. Even if you have great wiring there is always a chance you will reach the maximum capacity of electrons the wire can carry. This means devices will be fighting to grab the flow of electrons. Many will have their digital electronic components fall into indeterminate power levels on the chip power pins (Digital is on or off - it needs input power with a certain voltage on the power pin, if it falls to less power than tolerance it becomes indeterminate). This means the electronics will begin acting erratically or stop functioning.
That said, I'd never plug a UPS directly into a power strip, but probably wouldn't hesitate to plug a power strip into a UPS if the power strip was decent and powering lower wattage items (lights/switches/etc).
