This often happens when the catalog cache is corrupted. Boot into safe mode and delete the %SystemRoot%\System32\catroot2 folder ( do not delete the "catroot" folder! only "catroot2"!).
The system was SP2, I have installed SP3 in hopes that would help, and I've also downloaded and installed the mouse drivers from Dell's site (there are no specific drivers for the keyboard), with no change.
I've tried manually searching for the driver (using the Have Disk option) - the first file it's looking for is in the c:\i386 directory, but that installs a generic HID mouse device; the system then runs the hardware wizard for a new "unknown" device.
I have a PC that up until a couple days ago was working fine.  I moved it from one site to another and now when I plug in the USB mouse or keyboard (the same ones that were working previously) XP brings up the New Hardware Wizard.  Going through it, the correct keyboard and mouse are identified, but XP can't find the drivers.
If you have the drivers and utilities disc. Then install all the chipset drivers for this system, once this installation is complete, restart the system and connect the keyboard and mouse and check the functionality.
Go to the device manager > choose on which device you are facing problem > go to update driver > and then click browse from the computer and choose any suitable driver. 
This happens when you connect one USB device to a different USB port on your machine. If you want, you can try to plug the keyboard and mouse into their original USB ports which would bypass all of this mess.
