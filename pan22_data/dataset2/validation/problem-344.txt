For large scale enterprise-level reporting frameworks, I have heard a number of companies turning to Thunderhead
Weaknesses - none :). Actually, there are a couple. First off, it's a different approach to design and if you want to design in an IDE using detailed property windows this will be different. Second, if you need to build your report in code with the logic there, we're not a good solution (nor are any of the others listed here so far). If you need this say so and I can give you a list of what to look at.
I can't comment on any of them but AlternativeTo.net is often handy when looking for  alternative applications.  The link goes straight to the Crystal Reports page.
I would recommend QlikView for your reporting, i can't think of anything it can't do.  I have been using it for several months now and it's extremely powerful and versatile...
Strengths - You design the reports in Microsoft Word, Excel, and/or PowerPoint so minimal learning curve and you can easily do things that the other reporting systems, because they're banded, find either difficult or impossible. It is also much faster, you'll find report design & revision about 10 times faster. And you can have non-programmers design their own reports.
There is a learning curve involved but there are plenty of free tutorials/videos on their website and a very helpful and active community forum you can post to if you need help with anything.
Crystal Reports have actually commissioned a comparison, although it may be slightly biased towards them. They do state, however,
