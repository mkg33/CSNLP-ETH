Do you have any recommended tools for accomplishing this? I can see something like this being applicable to many IT pros so I'm sure there are some good tips out there.
How much of this is available through powershell I don't know because I don't use it. But I have written a very simple vb.net tray application that just monitors network availability and connects to a network share when the network is available. If you're interested in the bare-bones of the code then let me know. 
This wouldn't be a simple little VBScript thing, but it wouldn't be that much coding either. Maybe somebody could pick up the idea and run with it. There's even sample code at http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=ef8a6228-f11d-4ba0-b73e-dd8dc7dd11e8&displaylang=en.
Presumably the "active network" would be based on IP address/gateway range or WIFI network name, etc.
There have been numerous times I've wanted this functionality, and I'd think there are more than a few people who would like to see it.
The "Network Location Awareness" service (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms739931(VS.85).aspx) in Windows XP (and 2000? I don't recall...) and up will enable this functionality, but I haven't found where anybody has written an application to take advantage of it. I'd love to code something myself, but I don't have enough spare cycles to even begin to think about it. 
Using .net framework version 2 it is possible to use the System.Net.NetworkInformation namespace. From this you can determine:
You could create a batch file that reads the results of an ipconfig command, and have it run every 5 seconds or so...
This is kind of a sideways and partial answer (and not even documented because I can't seem to find the original article), but I'm fairly sure Windows 7 has a property sheet on the printer object allowing you to change defaults depending on subnet.
I'd like to create a script to do various things when the network connection changes. For example, if the machine connects to my office network I might desire it to:
