If you can afford to get a professional to do this then the reproduction should be much better than you could do on home equipment.
I recorded using Audacity to record the audio and also do some post processing.  However I could not get it completely hiss free as they were very old recordings of a relative who had passed away, so there was no way to reproduce it.
My Ion TTUSB USB turntable has an aux in which can be used for a cassette deck or other analog input. Many USB/FireWire audio interfaces will also have these inputs, so if you happen to have any of these, they are good alternatives to just plugging into the line in.
You'll need a converter cable to get the output from the cassette deck to the 1/8" input jack.  They have both 1/4" to 1/8" cables, and also dual RCA to 1/8" cables.
On some cards, the line-in jack is a light-blue color.  If it doesn't have one, the mic jack can be used, but I'm not sure if that will cause problem.
I know very little about Macs, but on the Windows machine, you can use a free tool like Audactiy to record sound from the line-in jack.
I used a Roland Edirol UA-25 to interface the cassette deck of my stereo to my computer (Mac), but only because I had one (Musician).  I could have just as easily have done it using the line in on the standard sound card (usually the blue jack).  
Obviously, on the Mac, Garageband is a good alternative to Audacity, easier to use and with some more features.  Amadeus Pro is another excellent alternative, with some filters designed to clean up analog audio, removing clicks, pops, hiss. and hum.
Fortunately, I work for a very large media company in the UK and their sound department did an amazing job of reading the audio I had recorded and removing more noise than I could possibly using the equipment I had.  Admittedly, the sound studios contain millions of Â£ worth of sound processing hardware and I was very lucky to get this done for free.
