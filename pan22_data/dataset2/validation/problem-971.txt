then logout/login. This chooses xim as the input method (ibus is the default). If you remove your ~/.xinputrc, then im-config can  list the input methods available, even if it fails to select one.
However, we can specify the path to the script as the command, in which we will simulate pressing the same key combination.
I noticed however that no matter what config I tried, the ibus daemon was running everytime after I had rebooted.
In this askUbuntu answer, Kayvan Tehrani shows a setting that works for me in that setting. Set the XMODIFIERS to an empty string before running your application:
The basic idea is this: in the system settings you can specify the command that is started by the Ctrl+Shift+U key combination.
Running into this problem on Ubuntu 18.04, I've tried all suggestion above, but unfortunately none of them worked. I ended up uninstalling the ibus package. 
I tested this in PhpStorm 2018.2 EAP Build #PS-182.3458.35 and I can say that it works, but with some caveats:
However, I've failed to find any configuration panel under KDE ubuntu 14.04 to do the job, and the standard im-config utility seems broken. I finally succeeded by creating a file ~/.xinputrc that contains a single line:
XMODIFIERS apparently changes the way xim and ibus works, and when it's cleared, it disables the CTRL-SHIFT-U combo, allowing it to filter into the current app.
To simulate keystrokes, I tried the xdotool (apt install xdotool) and the xte (apt install xautomation).
I struggled with this problem for two days. I tried all the methods listed here earlier. And it looks like I came up with a solution. But it is very unstable and has bugs.
