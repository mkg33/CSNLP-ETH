I want to create a bar-code for each person. When that person scans their bar-code at the end of the line that meal is recorded for that day. I think it should be easy!
I'm not an Excel power user by any description, please pardon my lack of knowledge. I need to create a spreadsheet to track who eats meals, we serve two meals each day, breakfast and lunch. 
I can create the bar-codes with the ID Numbers. I can make it put the #1 in a cell for that meal on that day. I can not get it to go to the right row when the bar-code is scanned it just jumps down the next cell directly below the last cell.
If that option is not available, you can change the setup in Excel to tell it where to move when Enter is pressed. This will change the behavior to move in the direction you like. Go to File > Options > Advanced . Editing options.
The bar code scanner you are using is likely adding a carriage return after the scan. Depending on the scanner, somewhere in the setup you should be able to change this to a TAB.
