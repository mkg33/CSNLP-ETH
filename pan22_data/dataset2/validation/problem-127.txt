If I logout and then in again I get don't get that login screen, which is perfect. But if i close IE, open it again and go to portal.office.com again the login prompt comes up.
The SSO have never really worked properly, so i'm going to contact them and about it. But before I do so, I just wanted to make sure that it isn't working as intended.
So my question is: Is what i explained above correct behaviour for a properly set up ADFS SSO, or is there something amiss in the configuration?
Isn't the point of ADFS for it to automatically log me in using my AD credentials? In my world that login-screen should never come up. In skype for business all i have to do is type my username+upn and i get logged in for instance.
When i go to portal.office.com and type in my username+upn and click in the password field I get redirected to another login screen (see image below, its in Swedish, but you should get the jist).
After doing some more research i found this TechNet article that got me onto the right track. I did not know that the ADFS Endpoint needed to be in the trusted local-intranet site list. After adding this the ADFS works flawlessly. Will make a GPO for this!
