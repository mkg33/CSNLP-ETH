Here’s my application: I want to set up a non-SuperUser’s computer to turn port forwarding on and off.  There are a variety of applications (e.g. certain games or VNC) that require this user to have port forwarding set up, but due to the security concerns, I don’t want to leave it on all the time (nor is there a predetermined schedule).  It occurred to me that I should be able to record the specific interactions I have with the webGUI interface to this person’s router to turn port forwarding on and off, and then set up a shortcut to an application that runs the script of those steps.  Basically, this would equivalent to a macro recorder, but for http.
I tried locating such an application through Google and I did find one possibility, but thought I might locate more/better options here. 
Is there a tool I can use in Windows to record and then programmatically (i.e. under a script or batch file) replay a specific interchange between a browser (either Firefox or IE) and a website?
I’m doing this on a Windows 7 machine that uses Firefox as the primary browser, but would be interested in solutions under XP or Vista.  The particular router in question is a Netgear (I can edit this to supply specific model), though if the technique I’m suggesting is feasible, the specifics of the router and its webGUI shouldn’t matter.
