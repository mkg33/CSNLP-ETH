4.Click "Use the following IP Address" and then go to the start menu and open "run". In run type in "cmd". Then press OK and cmd should open.
Now you need to find you "Domain Name Server(DNS)". To do that go to Click Here and it should show your public ip. Open up a new tab and then type in that public ip. The username and password should be username="admin" password="password". If not you may need to find that out by doing some searches. When you are on this site you will need to do some searching for Primary Dns and Secondary or even Domain Name Server. All of them aren't the same. Once you find those the order they should be in is the Primary or Preferred and then Secondary or Alternate. Just type these in on the Internet Protocol Version 4 from step 3 for what they match. Then click "OK" and you may lose internet connection for a bit, but then it will work again unless you did something wrong.
7.Now try restarting you computer but make sure you know what your IP Address or IPv4 Address is before you restart. Then open "run" and type "cmd" again to see if your ip changed and if it did try again. If it didn't Congrats!. I hope this helped!
In cmd, type "ipconfig" and a list of stuff should pop up. Find where "IPv4 Address", "Subnet Mask", and "Default Gateway" are all filled up. When you do go back to the "Internet Protocol Version 4" from step 3 and for "IP address" type in the "IPv4 Address" from cmd. The "Subnet Mask" should fill up by itself when you click on it if not fill it in from the info from cmd. Fill in the "Default Gateway from cmd's info.
