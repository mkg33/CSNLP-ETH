I was thinking about getting a dedicated server (I may need the extra power that a VPS can't provide) from The Planet but I don't know to much about how you would operate one. I have experience in setting up multiple VPS's on Linode and Slicehost, I just select my OS in their CP and connect via SSH in putty and do my thing. Is it the same with dedicated servers (just chose you OS from the CP and connect via SSH and put on whatever crap you want)?
The only difference is my colo facility where I own the physical machines. I'm responsible for racking them and the guys on site replace hard drives for me if anything breaks. But other than that you can move your knowledge from a VPS environment to leased server to colocation and back again very easily. 
Most dedicated server environment's where you aren't managing the hardware yourself are very similar to VPS's in terms of build process and rebooting etc. 
Yes it's the same. I use slicehost's VPS's, Serverbeach's dedicated servers and I also have a cluster of 20 physical Dell 2950 and 1950 servers at a hosting facility where I lease a rack. I run Ubuntu and CentOS. They're all very similar to operate. You SSH in, do your thing and sign out.
