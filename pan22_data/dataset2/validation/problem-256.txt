If the users are part of a domain, you can use a GPO to define a software restriction policy which allows only your application to run. Create accounts for the users and give them local administrator rights to the machines (preferably with this same GPO).
This is absolutely possible, PowerBroker Desktop: Windows Edition allows you to elevate the rights of specific applications without elevating the user, you can define what additional elevation is given down to the SID(s) involved.

I'm not sure if it will entirely work for you though as if you give the user sudo permission I don't think you will be able to stop them elevating other apps of their choice. Might be worth looking at though.
Take a look at Sudo for windows. It allows you to elevate normal users to admins for the scope of a single application.
I am not sure how suitable it is for a work/school environment.  but at home this works for me fine for a small number of admin utilities i use regularly.
The best way I could thing of would be to use a runas replacement that saves passwords encrypted .. something like supercrypt.
