A new user may not recognize the differences betwen KDE and Gnome in the screen captures above.  Look at the position of the default panels (top with Gnome and bottom with KDE) not the color of the desktop or the apps that are open.
While installing inxi for just this purpose may seem overkill, inxi can be used to provide a lot more system information with inxi -Fxxxz (where -z masks stuff like your MAC address).
On Mageia linux you can have very easily both environments and also because of that script is written so.
According to original post, the ideal solution for me (and hope someone else) is demonstrated with example:
a) Graphical way, with HardInfo: the answer is normally in "Operating System" > "Desktop Environment", but if not you can look to "Environment variables". HardInfo is ready with all the tested distros, except the one with KDE, but it can be easily and quickly installed (only 2 packages in Linux Mint 13).
The item that appears in more lines should be the answer (if there is a draw the item with "session" should be the solution).
