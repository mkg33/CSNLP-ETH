You can then use FileTypesMan to edit the extension's icon. Browse to the folder where you saved the icons and choose the appropriate .ico file. 
Alternatively you could try to rebuild the icon cache, or reinstall office, but Im not positive these options will work.
Some months ago i messed around and used Types to change some file type icons without making a system restore. I changed the Excel, Powerpoint, Onenote, Word, Access and Publisher file type icons. They look ugly and I realized how stupid I was so I wanted to change back. 
I'm not using Types now, but FileTypesMan. The problem is I can't find the location the dll containing the icons are.
I was not getting the Outlook Icon while attaching a .msg file in word 2016. My issue was resolved after selecting C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\1033\MAPISHELLR.DLL  in Change Icon button.
Select the icons you want to use, right click and save them to your Desktop or another folder as a .ico extension. 
Nirsoft, who developed FileTypesMan, has another program you could try called IconsExtract. I dont have Office 13, but i tried it out on 14 and was able to locate all the office icons and change them with FileTypesMan. 
Using IconsExtact, browse to and search the folder C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Office/Office 13/ (or something similar to that).  It may take a minute but a list of all the office icons should show up. 
If your still stuck, try downloading Office Ico files from the net and loading them with FileTypesMan.
For Office16 I went to the office16 directory (in Program Files x86). There are separate exe (aka Application)  files there for each Office component that end with ICO or ICON (ACCICONS, PPTICO, WORDICON) that have the icons. Couldn't find one with all icons. The inconsistencies (ICONS, ICO, ICON) are not mine btw.
