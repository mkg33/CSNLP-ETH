Can you block them entirely? No. Spammers understand a new domain name has no history to fall back on. It's easy to set up a new domain like this, set up a server, mass phish and reap the rewards (even just 1% of the phished falling for this can be fruitful). Eventually systems on the Internet catch on, but by then the damage is done. Education is your best weapon.
It could of course be a canary... Designed to call home and leave a trail of breadcrumbs back to your front door which may not be the same place you host your web site. This could then be used for a later, more targeted, approach or refined password variable dictionary attack.
None of these are 100% perfect indicators of scams, but each should raise a small flag - and the presence of multiple should make you highly suspicious. If in doubt, verify the organisation is legitimate, look up a contact email address for them (not the address the email came from, usually), and use that to ask if the email is legitimate. If it is, fine - if it's not, you've done them a favour.
This is spam at the least - at worst, it's a scam. Do not agree to send a read receipt. Do not download unnecessary content. Do not click links. Do not reply. Do not pass Go... etc.
As others have mentioned, protecting your contact details in whois information may help eliminate these emails; I'd also like to add some common signs of spam/scam emails:
There is no real way to avoid this crap, but you have your full contact information including mail in the domain record - this makes this extra easy ...
I had the same email today, hence how I found this chain, and followed the crumbs the other way and checked who had been knocking on my websites door previous to the email - which lead me to Russia, Costa Rica and Panama (all IP ranges now blocked.)
