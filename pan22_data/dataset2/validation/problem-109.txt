Yes, hard drives store data by flipping poles in magnetic domains on the disk--at first glance this means nothing is added or subtracted and thus no weight.
However, that's not the whole picture.  The orientation of those domains matter.  There is less total field energy when the domains are 1010101010 than when they are 11111111 or 00000000.  I'm sure everyone is familiar with e=mc^2.  Putting energy into the domains DOES mean mass, albeit an incredibly small amount of it.
It depends on what font size your text is saved in. 24-point font is very heavy, whereas 8-point is quite light. Bold text also increases the weight, and you should avoid saving lots of text in italics, because all the characters lean to the right, which changes the way the disk spins.
My physics isn't up to even trying to estimate the mass but I'm sure it's beyond anything the most sensitive scale could possibly measure.
Depends on where you're doing the weighing.  One of the answers immediately jumps into discussing femtograms, which are not a measure of weight, but instead measure mass.
