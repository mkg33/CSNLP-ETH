Help for SSMSE is not installed by the product. If you press F1, MSDN Online help opens. Pressing F1, you are able to access all F1 help topics, but you do not see a table of contents or an index for the SQL Server 2008 documentation. To add SQL Server 2008 documentation to SSMSE, install SQL Server 2008 Books Online from SQL Server Books Online Download Center. After installing, in the Contents pane of the Books Online, you can use the SQL Server Express filter to hide the content that does not apply to SQL Server Express edition.
Interactive Resolver, which lets you resolve conflicts manually during on-demand synchronization in Microsoft Windows Synchronization Manager, is not supported in SSMSE.
In SSMSE, Object Explorer only supports Database Engine instances. The Connect to Server dialog box prevents connecting to other services, such as Analysis Services.
I do agree with others, that SSMS Express would be the way to go if you just need to run queries.  Some of our analysts manually run jobs on the server, though, so that was out for us.
You cannot update the full-text catalog by using SSMSE. You can use sqlcmd utility or Windows Scheduler to update the full-text catalog.
I feel your pain.  There is not a stand-alone installer for SSMS (outside of Express, sigh).  Might be overkill (unless you have a lot of analysts), but one option would be to create an unattended install of just the Client Components.  We only have a few people that needed SSMS without any server components so I just ran the install for them myself...
You can use SQL Server Management Studio Express (SSMSE) for that functionality.  Below is a list of the limitations that exist when using SSMSE vs the "Full" SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) from SQL Server Management Studio Express
If you have the 2 disk set instead of the DVD or MSDN subscription, just use DISK 2 , it only has the tools
Because SSMSE is a subset of SQL Server Management Studio, all objects that would normally be enumerated for a specific Database Engine Object Explorer tree are still visible in SSMSE. If it is an object for an unsupported item, only the refresh command is available.
You may be able to extract the setup files from the installer to just do the Management Studio install, I'm not sure what dependencies it has.
You can download a standalone installer for SQL Management Studio Express, but I believe to install the full version on Management studio you need to use the SQL setup routine, which obviously has all the other options.
