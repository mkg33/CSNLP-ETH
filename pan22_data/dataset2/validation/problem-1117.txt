I've noticed this both with PostgreSQL streaming replication, 5 minutes like clockwork, as evidenced by the log entries that the connection was lost and reestablished.  Also with ssh, but I haven't timed it there.  Go make a cup of tea, come back and your connection is gone.
This is also what compose.io docs recommend for connection debugging https://docs.compose.io/common-questions/how-to-connect-to-mongodb.html
If you are already doing that, maybe you can debug the connection using the mongo shell to connect to your DB instances.
I have no experience with MongoDB specifically, but I have noticed that AWS will sever TCP connections (each end thinks the other end closed it) after 5 minutes of idleness, and that the keepalive setting does not prevent this.
