It looks like Pingdom are using a really old version of .SE's DNSCheck tool. We removed the test that's failing for you a couple of years ago, for the reason that it's highly unreliable. It gives false negatives or false positives as much as half the time, which makes it worse than useless. It's also not really fixable, since it tries to answer the question "Will mail to this address reach a recipient?", which is both outside the scope of DNS and very ill-defined. So, in short, you can safely ignore this failure.
2) Failed to deliver email for SOA RNAME of domain.co.uk (server.domain.co.uk) using server@domain.co.uk.
It looks as though the two warnings are related: the second field in your SOA field is server.atomicpenguinclothing.co.uk., meaning that the DNS contact is server@atomicpenguinclothing.co.uk. Does mail to that email address go through?
I've set up a new domain on my new server and when testing the DNS I receive 2 warnings that I'm concerned about:
Does anybody have any thoughts on how I can resolve these errors. I have a SOA record in place as well as rDNS (as far as I can see in my DNS), but I can't work out why these errors are displayed. The email address is definitely set up and working too.
Or try testing your domain with either .SE's DNSCheck or the newer tool we (together with AFNIC) wrote to replace it, Zonemaster. Both tools are Open Source, written in Perl and available from Github. Zonemaster is also on CPAN. Both tools have command-line versions if you prefer that to web-based services.
The field server.atomicpenguinclothing.co.uk. is supposed to be an email address which can be used to contact the DNS administrator, with the first dot . getting replaced by an @. Is that a valid email address? 
Because it appears that SMTP port (tcp 25) is not responsive on the MX record atomicpenguinclothing.co.uk.
