I use it for personal pc to pc file transfer(On Ubuntu Hardy). one known issue (and I can bear it with) is it can't handle Unicode(non-ASCII) well.  
The answer is simple: thttpd. It wins hands-down in performance, memory usage, and security. And by security I mean it's secure by virtue of competent design and not doing anything stupid, not that it has all sorts of "security" bells and whistles. It's also near-optimal with respect to size and simplicity.
It will allow you to pretty much do everything you require and is usually very easy to set up,you can even configure the port to use 80 if that is a requirement.
You can also try HFS also called HTTP File Server ( http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/) While its is a windows application, it is said to work well using WINE. Its very low maintenance and even complete novices who don't even know what a File Server is will be able to use it without much effort. It supports drag and drop functionality and you can even control which IP addresses can access the files and supports users accounts and download speed control. 
Please ignore if you are not open to alternatives, but the fact that you are willing to install a HTTP server with no preferences shows me that you want to get the job done of transfering a file more so than how it is done - 
(I know this question is old, but it's a top result on Google and the existing answers are anything but light-weight.)
If you choose a port lower than 1024 on *nix, you might need root privileges, otherwise bind() will fail.
I'm not sure if they meet some of your more off requirements like serving single files, but you can do that with a wrapper that puts symlinks in the http root. If you do this with thttpd, however, you'll have to disable symlink restrictions.
It's light-weight, download the source, and write a Python script(just copy the  quick start part on the home page is enough, 5-6 lines, set user name and password, home directory, etc.)
