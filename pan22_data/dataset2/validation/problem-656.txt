The real question here, I think, is why you would want to create so many partitions in the first place. Storage space is not expensive, SATA is now standard, and there are, IMO, many better alternatives to partitioning a drive 33-odd times.
No, Windows is not limited to only drive letters. You can mount partitions to any NTFS folder. I'm not familliar with any limits thereafter.
For DOS/windows, it cannot support more than a maximum of 24 partitions because it runs out of drive letters (C: to Z:) (plus any partitions with unsupported filesystem).
For Master Partition Table disks the limit is based on the size of the partition table in the Master Boot Record (512 bytes IIRC), which was invented by IBM back in the 80's. Also, certain OSs have their own limits for a variety of reasons. The standard, such as it is, allows the Extended partition to have up to 24 partitions in it. Why the limit? Same as many limits, it seemed large enough to be 'good enough'. Also, in practice at the time the various OS kernels were under development partition counts rarely got that high.
This, by the way, is why many OSs implement their own version of partitioning. LVM gets around this on Linux. GPT is the Windows way of handling partitioning without an old fashioned Partition table. NetWare's NSS file-system runs a lot like LVM in that there is a single 'partition' that is then sub-divided in the media manager.
While the extended/logical partition scheme theoretically provides an unlimited number of logical partitions, all operating systems sets some limit (as far as I know).
For Linux the maximum is limited by the allocation of minor device numbers. For traditional IDE disks there is support for 63 partitions, while SCSI disks are limited to 15 partitions.
Four primary/extended partitions. If you an extended partition you can have any number of logical disks within that extended partition. On a standard format disk the partition table only has room for four entries. If you upgrade the disk to GPT I think the limit changes, though I'm not sure what the new limit is.
