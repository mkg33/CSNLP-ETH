I did menage to get the whole thing to run with "SPI port forwarding" program (http://download.cnet.com/SPI-Port-Forward/3000-2651_4-10764348.html?tag=downloadRatingModule;summaryRatings)
To check if everything works as it should be I am using this site to confirm that my ports are accessible http://canyouseeme.org/ (I also tried some similar sites..). 
I forwarded all ports on my router to my computer ( have also tried port triggering and some other options), I also added new rule to my Win7 firewall (firewall is turned down but just in case). 
Im trying to run my custom game server on my local machine. I used no-ip.com to create a static internet location for my game to connect to. I downloaded their DUC program that should  access my data on that location and deliver it to my computer. 
In order to make it permanent or configure it manually, you need to log in to your router to make the changes. How you do this depends on the router model (you didn't mention it).
I keep getting "Connection refused" from canyouseeme.org... They say it means that there are firewall issues. 
Most likely that program uses UPnP to request a port forwarding from your home router. This is a pretty standard protocol for port forwarding and most home routers support it.
