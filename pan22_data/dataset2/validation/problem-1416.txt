ANTIVIRUS - Generally with antivirus you see on-demand scans. That is, when a file is accessed, the AV program scans it to make sure it isn't infected.  It will also generally run periodic scans of the OS, and will look at tasks being performed to make sure they don't match virus definitions.  This, too, is a software process that takes system resources.  Generally if you're running a Windows server, you want AV on it, case closed.  Linux you can probably get away without running one - the way Linux is architected gives it pretty good resistance to viruses.
Without knowing the exact environment your parents are running on their server, it's hard to say what they should/shouldn't be doing.  In general, though, if they're running Windows, and it can see the internet (or other machines on the network can), it should at least be running AV.  Encryption may well be overkill.  Most of my clients don't encrypt data, sensitive or no, preferring to rely on NTFS access controls, good firewalls, and AV.  Your mileage may vary, though.
ENCRYPTION - Something has to do encryption/decryption on the fly as you access files, save files, etc.  That's generally done in software, though there are hard drives that do encryption as well.  Since it generally IS software, there is some load on the server as it encrypts/decrypts files.  Is that load significant?  It can be.  As with all things, it depends on how beefy the server is, what it's doing, etc.  Would you see a noticeable performance hit in, say, an office of 15 people accessing Word documents off a fileshare?  Presuming the server is fairly new, probably not.  If you had 1500 people accessing the same server, you would likely see slowdown.  So it's a tradeoff.
Both affect performance.  How much they do, versus how much load the server is under, is a balancing act.
