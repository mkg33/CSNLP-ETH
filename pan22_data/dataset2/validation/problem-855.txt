On the manual you have an example of how to use prepared statements with the .net connector (the second one is the C# version). You can use those or MySQLCommands, in this case it doesn't matter much (more on this below):
Please note that this is dynamic SQL and prepared statements or filtering will not be effective against SQL injection. If there is a table in your database called "my_prefix ; DROP TABLE Students;--" it is your responsibility to sanitize that.
Using the language/connector commands, as you probably want to do, is usually the best option for maintainability, unless you have an extremely large number of tables to be dropped.
I have found this question answered but not specifically for C#. The answer seems to be to execute the following statements tailored to my specific database. However, I can't figure out how to use these statements in C#.
Please note that using the mysql syntax for prepared statements to generate dynamic SQL is an ugly hack and should not be recommended.
