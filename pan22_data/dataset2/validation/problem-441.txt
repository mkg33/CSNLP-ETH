Look at the temperature field. The Raw/Data column should have a normal temperature value and the Current/Worst columns should have a “strange”, high value. See several examples below.
At least one other person has similar, strange results (see bottom image); though they may also have a defective drive.
OCZ tool shows only 114 total ECC and RAISE errors. But what does Data column in HD Tune mean? Why the description says that disk had 89.970.873 read errors? It is new disk. I installed it yesterday and it is passing all diagnostic tests in SeaTools, Performance tests in HD Tune Pro and common check in Chkdsk.
The HD Tune data looks quite suspect. For example, I don't believe that you had a temperature peak of 129 degrees celcius. And as you say, the ECC recovered rate is simply ridiculous.
Clearly, HD Tune is doing some fancy work and/or pre-processing of the data before formatting and showing it, and it is not working out quite right. In fact, looking at the raw value of the temperature field, HD Tune is interpreting, and maybe even reading the data incorrectly.
Just like to add that the errors are correctable, so programs don't get to see them but all the same, I would not expect to see any real read errors from SSDs. I would seek further clarification from the manufacturer.
Try another SMART tool (preferably an OCZ one like Harry said). I like SpeedFan. Use that to see what the values are and if the numbers are still weird (eg the temperature field is still showing values similar to 30-129 in the Current/Worst columns and a huge number in the Raw/Data column). If they are, then it could be your drive; either it’s SMART circuitry is damaged, or it simply requires custom SMART software. However requiring custom SMART software highly unlikely since it is a standard and would be very user-unfriendly.
If you are worried about 114 ECC and RAISE errors, the best is to get in touch with OCZ Support, and ask if they advise to use the warranty to exchange the disk. Their answer, if positive, will give you the necessary ammunition when dealing with your vendor.
I downloaded trial version of HD Tune Pro and I'm using it to benchmark my hard drives. In Health tab of SSD I found Raw Read Error Rate property. What does this property say about my hard drive?
