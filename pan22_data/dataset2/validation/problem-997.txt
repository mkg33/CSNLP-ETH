I know you mention WebEx RemoteSupport as being too expensive, but we used the basic WebEx package initially, before upgrading to a corporate solution.
PS I think that NetSupport created an online control of its software like LogMeIn, but i couldnt find it, maybe they've stopped.
Actually it worked well but I understand that it's a more complicated solution than teamviewer, logmein etc.. (that could be used easily also for one-time-assistance)
At various times the company I was working for already owned either or both, and leveraging for support was simple. It doesn't require firewall changes, doesn't require custom software, and even the more security conscious clients were generally allowed to run it without issue.
So when the notebook was in our LAN we could reach the computer using the native control protocol while when it was outside our network its client automatically connected to our gateway and we could see and control it via internet just like it was inside. AFAIK it used HTTP protocol.
A couple of years ago in my previous job we used NetSupport Manager (I think it was v8 or v9). It had a "gateway" function that could bypass firewalls. Actually it worked in this way:
Personally, rather than using specific software, I've used both WebEx and GoTo Meeting to help remote clients.
Add to that that multiple people can join the call and share the screen at once, and it becomes a pretty powerful tool. I could switch between demonstrating from my desktop to troubleshooting the remote one.
Unfortunately I dont remember how much this software costed (they bought it before i joined their team) but i think it was not so cheap.
The sales force used it too - it was a truly global, and cross discipline tool. That might help you sell it to management :)
Check out Fog Creek Copilot.  It gets around firewalls and implements a custom VNC-based system.  Their pricing is very reasonable and I've never had any trouble with it.
