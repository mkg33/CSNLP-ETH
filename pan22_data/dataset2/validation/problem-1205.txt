Since I don't see it yet, I might as well throw in Microsoft Office Picture Manager. If you have MS Office then most likely, you already have this installed. I'm not even sure if it requires MS office to be installed in the first place.
You may want to try Batch Picture Resize, which is very easy to use, and free. I used it many times in the past. You can either choose your option by the menu, or renaming the file to set the resolution.
If you want to resize only one file, of course, Paint can do it. Just take a look in the menu of Paint.
If you are using Windows 7 (question does not specify) then Windows Paint is adequate for this task. 
If you are using Windows XP then avoid Windows Paint completely as it is not very good with JPG files.
I usually use one of the image resizing shell extentions - microsoft has a powertoy for windows xp that does it ( download link )and there's options for newer versions of windows as well. Almost no UI cruft, and almost instant in my experience.
A free, open source and specially written for Windows is http://imageresizer.codeplex.com/ It can do batch resize, too.
If you can't locate it easily, I believe you can simply open up the Run... prompt (Start > Run OR Windows Key + R) and type in OIS and press OK
Microsoft's own Image Resizer PowerToy adds simple right click options to Windows Explorer (link doesn't work in Chrome, open this one in IE)
