Little documentation has been published about the update to netsh and there is little discussion about it on the entire Internet (Google search dhcpstaticipcoexistence gives only 5 results at the time of this answer). But this feature is real.
There is a new property called dhcpstaticipcoexistence in the netsh interface ipv4 set interface command, which can be set to enabled and this interface can be configured with multiple static IPs along with a DHCP-configured IP. However this has to be done with the netsh add address command, not yet possible via the GUI.
Finally DHCP and static IPs can be configured to co-exist on one NIC. This feature has landed in the Windows 10 Creators Update (1703).
I used Win IP Config version 2.7.2 from 2007 running on Windows 10.  Set your NIC to DHCP, Run Win IP Config as an administration (Right Click icon instead of double click for the option).  Then click IP+ and type in the static ipaddress you want.  I now have one DHCP and two static address.  Now I can do my embedded system development and access the internet at the same time with one NIC!
