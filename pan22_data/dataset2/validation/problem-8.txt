At my office we are planning to deploy widescreen LCD monitors in portrait mode. We bought one for testing (Samsung T220 unpivotable, so we adapted a pivotable support for it) and it doesn't have a good viewable angle in this mode, despite the specifications (170/160). In portrait mode no viewing angle is good as it is in landscape mode, even when you are staring it in a 90 degrees angle, one of the sides of the screen is brighter/darker than the other. Anyone know of any LCD widescreen monitor (preferably 22 inches 1680x1050) that is good for such mode?
I have a 1200x1600 (portrait mode) 20" and while I enjoy (and depend) upon the vertical size, it still feels a wee bit cramped horizontally.
I also found that running f.lux highlights the problem much more on panels with bad viewing angles. We run some nice dell units with swivel stands, but they look terrible when rotated.
LG are doing some very cheap LED-backlit monitors at the moment, and the viewing angles appear to be excellent. I'll try spinning one and let you know the model number if it looks good.
