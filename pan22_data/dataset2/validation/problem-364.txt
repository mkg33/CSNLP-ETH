I have an older but functional Dell server box that I'm not using right now; however I don't believe it has the same Adaptec RAID controller. (I'm actually not sure, but for the moment I'm assuming not.)  I'm trying to figure out whether I can take a disk out of my failing hardware and bring the Win 2003 server back up on the Dell hardware.
I have a Windows 2003 server that has hung twice in the last two weeks - the second time after less than 2 hours up.  There is nothing at all in the Event Viewer to indicate any failures.  For a freeze like that with no disk errors, I suspect some kind of failure in my server hardware.
2) How picky is Windows Server about the hardware?  Will it detect that things have change and boot successfully on different hardware?
You can try slapping the disks into the Dell machine, but if your goal is a stable, working computer you're better off installing from scratch on the Dell machine, or ditching the hardward RAID controller on the SuperMicro machine and rebuilding from scratch with a JBOD configuration and using Windows software RAID.
I've tried to do that with at least one Adaptec SATA RAID controller and gotten BOOT_DEVICE_INACCESSIBLE STOP messages. I can't remember which model to tell you for sure. 
1) If I take a disk that was part of a RAID 1 set, is there a way to boot that on the Dell server assuming the Dell doesn't have RAID?
My server is a semi-generic 1U Supermicro with an Adaptec RAID 1 controller.  I'm running two SATA 500gb drives in RAID 1.
