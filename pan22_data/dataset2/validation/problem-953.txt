In Windows 8.1, the right-click option is gone. What's an easy way to manage my wireless network profiles in Windows 8.1 (without being connected to it)? If at all possible I'd like to avoid third-party software for this task, and although I'm sure I can do this from Powershell, I'd like my convenience back.
I found a tool for users to manage their network profiles (change priority, make default, forget, view properties, etc.) without using those command line methods. I believe this is a much more user-friendly solution! You can find it here: http://main.kerkia.com/Products/WinFi/description.aspx.

My Windows 8.1 machine shows "Forget this Network" and "View Connection Properties" when right clicking the network name. 
In Windows 8, I used to be able to right-click on a wireless connection in the "Networks" sidebar and click "Properties" to access the password info, the connection settings, etc. The right-click context menu would also allow me to forget a network on demand (with the "Forget Network" option).
