You can easily restore your 2000 DB to any higher version of SQL Server. The issue you may face is feature deprecation. If you aren't using any deprecated features, the actual DB migration is a non-event for the most part.
I'm trying to budget for how many hours it would take to upgrade a SQL Server 2000 database so it will run on SQL Server 2012. I realize you can't really tell much without actually seeing what we're working with, but all I'm looking for now is a ballpark figure (i.e., is it in the 20-30 hour range? 50 hours? 100 hours?).
I work with a city government arts program.  In 2004, we contracted with a local database developer to develop a system that allows us to track student participation in our after school art classes.  It tracks each student's address, demographics, what classes they enroll in, daily attendance, paperwork/documentation, class progress,  etc.   It was built on SQL Server 2000.
I don't think there are much issues. Try restoring your old database to SQL Server 2012 using Management Studio. You don't need an extra budget allocation for this.
We've upgraded all  our other servers but we still have one server left that's still running SQL server 2000 and Windows 2003 just  because of this one outdated db system.  We'd like to upgrade both SQL Server to 2012 and Windows Server  to 2008R2 on this last server. 
Because of issues with the city's technology systems back then we were not able to install it right away.  When they finally got around to supporting us (I think around 2006 or 07), they gave us SQL Server 2005.  We ended up installing an instance of SQL Server 2000 on SQL Server 2005 which itself runs on Windows Server 2003.  
As of a few years ago, we are no longer under the city's technology systems and manage our own systems through independent contracted consultants.  Last year, we terminated our contract with the original database developer because he wasn't following through on a number of issues we needed addressed over the years.  Last year, we also went through a major overhaul of all our servers and desktops.  
Seeking some advice about an oudated database system we're working with.... hope this is an appropriate place to post this question.
You cannot directly upgrade a SQL 2000 database to SQL 2012. You need to first upgrade your databases to SQL 2005/2008/R2 after that you can upgrade to SQL 2012.
