Where my_image is the name of the image I want to create; my_vhd_url is the VHD URL of the VM disk that you're baking an image from.
The problem is that the image does not show up when executing knife azure image list. When I try creating the server with the image name from the Azure portal, it complains that it does not exist. I'm running Ubuntu, so I tried the Azure cli tools and it doesn't show there either. I installed Azure PS in a Win 8 VM and then it shows up. Feeling encouraged, I installed Chef and knife-azure in the Win 8 VM, but it doesn't show up there either.
The way I got a User image to show was not to use the Azure UI to "Capture" the image, but rather using the Azure xplat-cli. Something like:
I'm pretty sure that the Azure xplat-cli will very soon support seeing images created in the UI, as will knife-azure.
I'm trying to create and bootstrap a Windows VM in Azure using knife-azure. I initially tried using a Public Win 2008 r2 image, but quickly found out that winrm needs to be configured before this can work. So, I created a VM from that image, configured winrm as per these instructions and captured the VM.
