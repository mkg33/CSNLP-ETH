In the chart above, it looks like all-but-one of the inputs are negatively correlated with the output. This implies that as these inputs increase, the output decreases and vice versa.
I have tried the pandas code for trying to find out the correlation between the output and the inputs I am feeding. Here is the code:  
Can someone please tell me whether I am on the right direction of what I am trying to achieve? What is the meaning of the above image?
I was trying to understand which column will affect the result more in the positive or negative or neutral way.   
You are in right way! Length of each box is actually correlation that you are looking for, positive, if box is on the right side from start (null) position, or negative on the left side. You can see that grey box have length 1, which is obvious because output has perfect correlation with itself. Regarding features: it seems, that they all have a small negative correlation (except input4, which correlation with output is slightly above zero), as they are all on the left side from the null. 
In a correlation framework above, the biggest driver of the output is the input which has the greatest absolute correlation value.
