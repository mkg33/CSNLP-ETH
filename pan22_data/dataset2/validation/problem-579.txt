Better late than never! You can also use Cocoon to view Netflix from overseas - the proxy IP is U.S.-based and it is pretty fast too :)
The traffic is not diverted through a tunlr server so you can even enjoy HD content if your internet connection is fast enough. For more details on how it works visit the tunlr FAQ
Do you want to stream video or audio from U.S.-based on-demand Internet streaming media providers but can't get in on the fun because you're living outside the U.S.? Fear not, you have come to the right place. Tunlr lets you stream content from sites like Netflix, Hulu, MTV, CBS, ABC, Pandora and more to your Mac or PC. Want to watch Netflix or HuluPlus on your iPad, AppleTV or XBox 360 even though you're not in the U.S.? Tunlr lets you do this.
Mediahint and Tunlr are good free options. However Mediahint is browser only and Tunlr requires that your ISP has been added to the whitelist in order to use the service. Commercial alternatives like Unlocator works with more services and are free to try.
I know this is already solved, but there's a browser add-on for this purpose as well called "Mediahint". Uses a proxy when the site tries to determine your location and then uses your own bandwidth from then on, allowing you to get the best quality your connection allows.
