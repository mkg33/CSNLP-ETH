If you don't know the network name of your computer, you can find it out as follows: right-click on the This PC folder (or Computer) in Explorer or some other file manager, and choose Properties from the shortcut menu. On that page, look for the 'computer name' text. That's the name you need to enter instead of 'laptop' in our example. Be sure to use the name of the computer that has the printer attached to it, not the one from which you are trying to connect to the printer through the network!
I am trying to share my USB printer on my main desktop machine to the network so that anyone on my network can access it.  Previously, I would just go to the printer properties and enable it in the sharing tab to 'Everyone' but there is no sharing tab for the printer.
Finally got it to work on the computer where I wanted to print from (My Laptop). So after opening the Devices and Printers window and clicking on Add a printer at the top, click on 2nd option "Select a shared printer by name" then click on "Browse". Next screen allowed me to navigate to and select my Network printer that was hooked up to my Desktop via USB. 
Next, Windows will probably ask you to select the printer make and model, install its drivers, etc. Keep providing the information that the wizard requires, according to your specific printer. When done, Windows should add the new printer to the computer, and you should be able to use it to print files. The procedure described above worked for us, hopefully it will work for you, too.
