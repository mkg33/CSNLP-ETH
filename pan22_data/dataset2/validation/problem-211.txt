In scale, unless you are expecting to receive only a particular format, it is machine learning. For the first task, you should first parse the text and then scan it, probably with a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system to extract the information you are after. Having a NER system would work, as you can manually code different types of features that will greatly improve the performance. If you just want to perform candidate matching, then standard bag-of-word approaches would perform decently. 
On the other hand, regex can be great ways to go with, especially if you can predict/adapt to the variability of the incoming data. In any case, they can be used to create your first training data. 
For the second case, things are similar. You can rely in some syntactic analysis of the sentence to obtain the invitation and the time/day of the proposal. This again can be coupled with NER systems. Lately, for both tasks neural networks yielded promising approaches. But, in any case, you need labeled data, which can be cumbersome to obtain.
