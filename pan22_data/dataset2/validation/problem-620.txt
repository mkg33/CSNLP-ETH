IMO certs are semi-worthless because they're always behind the times.  You think there's a cert for running large cloud infrastructure?  There might be one for running vmware farms by now, but what about xen and virtualbox and kvm?
I just wrote my LPI-101 2 hours ago and I totally agree with negu. I've been using linux since late 90s and I had to learn commands and options that I never knew existed for the LPIC-101 exam, even though I would never probably use them in real life. My skills in the real world, (DNS, virtualization, apache, security, samba4 AD DC etc) on linux go beyond LPIC-101 (more like LPIC-102) but taking an LPIC-101 course was helpful as it helped me to better understand some commands and techniques that I never knew existed and therefore did increase my knowledge overall. 
Once you have a few years experience in your chosen field (in this case Linux system administration), it has practically zero value. I see jobs looking for product specific certification (RHEL, Cisco certs etc.) but these are usually only valuable coupled with experience and most companies worth working for will rely on far more than a certification to prove your worth...
I guess it would be ok for a novice sysadmin position. But with intermediate/seniors, I'd be more interested in their work experience and mindset.
Being in IT for 15+ years now has taught me that I would never hire someone for my business based on certs alone, BUT someone that did have some certs and knowledge with real-life experience is what truly matters. Would I hire someone that had zero certs but seemed smart? No. Would I hire someone that had several certs but not much practical experience? Probably not. Would I hire a person that had a combination of both? Absolutely. A good interview with the candidate should sort this out though.
I always thought that training courses, diplomas, and certifications where for people who didn't do the job, but only read about it. I never had time to do any in any of my jobs - the training schedules never matched when I needed the particular skills anyway. 
It shows you have a minimum set of skills at a point in time, and if you are entering the job market I think it does have some value (assuming you are applying for junior or trainee sysadmin positions)
Potential employers are likely to be impressed with a senior LPI qualification, particularly if you work in the contract world.  However, in reality I don't think it's truly a badge that demonstrates your professional capabilities, for anything but a junior admin.  
There are always exceptions of course, as some people are gifted with technology that could actually fail an exam. Many hackers know of concepts at the network or binary level yet could not answer a simple question such as "What is the path of the package cache on a debian based system?"
One significant value in doing these sorts of certifications is that it forces one to look at and experiment with every aspect of Linux administration.  This is especially beneficial if professionally your current role only exposes you to a certain subset of the discipline.
However, for your own development, discipline, and interest, I'd say they're well worth doing.  Especially if you can get your employer to pay for the exams, or you do them for free at a conference! :)
Certs like that only really matter to large companies, because they're an easy checkbox for the HR person to see what you've got.  I'd never hire someone solely because they have a cert and I'd never discount anyone solely because they don't.  If a cert is the only difference between two people, I'm still going to want to interview them both, because it's the skills and your facility with them that matter.
The more senior exams are really quite well thought out, and go into considerable detail.  I would say it would be difficult to pass LPI2 and certainly LPI3 with a purely academic knowledge.  I would, however, state that in my experience the best certification courses are those with a heavy bias towards practical testing, such as the RHCE.
The early LPI exams are easy, but well-designed, comprehensive, and kept up-to-date.  They are also vendor-neutral, which is ideal for junior sysadmins wanting to get up to speed.
Nothing beats real-world experience but a certification program does help hone skills as it forces the individual to study and take the time to learn. All knowledge is good, and some kind of proof of it is good just like a driver's licence, pilot's license etc. You could be an excellent driver yet not have a drivers license, however, a good driver with a proof of license is even better. At least then you can base your decision off some kind of foundation.
It's very popular in the Linux / Open Source world to bash certification programs.  There is every truth that there is no substitute for hard-earned experience, but my experience, both as a Linux and Solaris certified engineer, and as a hiring manager, is that there is value in them.
