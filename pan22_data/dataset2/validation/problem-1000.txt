I am boggled when I click on an application in windows and have to wait 10 seconds for it to respond. I wonder "you can run 16 billion instructions a second, what are you doing that keeps you from responding to my mouse click." Because of that I would be interested in gathering together ideas on how to design an application that could diagnose these kinds of problems. I am no windows expert and wonder what methods others would suggest. Here is what I would ideally like to be able to do:
Recognize any applications, drivers, or operating system states (e.g. the oft-blamed registry) that are slowing down the system and bring those to the attention of the user. Some of this could be garnered using performance counters, other aspects I am less certain of. I would be inclined to use machine learning methods to determine whether the system is bogged down and to help determine the culprit (which is workable as long as I can both contrive examples that recreate the major sources of problem, as well as garner enough data to be able to determine the culprit).
