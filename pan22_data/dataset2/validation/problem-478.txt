Yes, 16TB is the largest you can get with a 4K cluster size, as Greg Askew mentioned. You can change your cluster size, but it takes forever. You can also change your basic disk to a dynamic disk easily via the disk manager. After you convert it, you can expand the dynamic disk group using additional LUNs. The filesystem sits atop the disk group, allocating data to all block device members in the disk group. You can use a linear allocation policy (default), or you may set up a software raid if that is appropriate for this. Linear is probably what you want, since this is coming from a SAN host.
Beware, if this LUN or any other LUN in this dynamic disk group is provided via the Windows software iscsi initiator (rather than a specialized HBA), it will fail to start on boot (requiring manual activation on every boot using disk management). It will work after manual activation, though. 
The boot time activation problem is due to dynamic disk services starting before software iSCSI initiator services.
