I bought CAT7 gigabit ethernet cables with RJ45 plugs (S/FTP PIMF), which should be downwards compatible with CAT6A, CAT6, CAT5E etcetera.
Furthermore I can see my laptop appearing in the router webinterface's network connection tab like so:
And the port status tab shows that everything is normal as soon as I bypass the CAT6A jacks with the orange cables (I'm not sure if its really CAT6A cables, I can not read the imprints):
However, if I connect the FRITZ!BOX LAN1 port with one of the ProSAFE switch's ports (in this case port1), and then connect the switch with one of the CAT6A ports and furthermore connect my laptop's RJ45 with the RJ45 outlet in the room the CAT6A is leading to it says "unidentified network / no internet connection".
Using this setup, I can neither ping/reach the router (192.168.178.1) nor the switch (192.168.178.2) from the laptop that is in whatever room the orange cable leads to (I have tried different outlets in different rooms).
I have had broken cables before but the ones in the picture aren't bent as badly as the cables that stopped working properly after being bent too much.
Did the electrician do a sloppy job or am I using the wrong hardware? How do I connect the four rooms (with a dual outlet of RJ45 each) via the CAT6A jacks in the mediabox?
I have a mediabox with eight CAT6A jacks (at least CAT6A is imprinted on them) preinstalled. The ethernet cables (orange) lead to different rooms in the appartment.
Even though CAT6+ is harder to break than earlier versions I have noticed that the cables are bent really hard, like you can see in this picture:
The "FRITZ!BOX/Homebox Cable" router has only four RJ45 jacks. My goal is to gather all the CAT6A jacks in a single local area network (also enabling WAN via the router ofcourse), using a NETGEAR ProSAFE GS108Ev3 switch.
What I have noticed is that the switch's port that connects to the CAT6A jack is always indicating the LED that says "10M connection active", even if there is no client connected anywhere. I am not sure if thats normal.
When I connect the router to the switch with CAT7/RJ45, and then connect my laptop directly to the switch using the same type of cable I get a 1Gbit uplink (IP via DHCP) and I am able to surf the web and ping the switch/router or visit the webinterfaces of these two devices.
