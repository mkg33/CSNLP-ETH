I am sitting in South Africa. Our Head office is in USA. I need to connect to a Server there in order to create/change/update items on that Server.
You'd either need to open up port 3389 (RDC) on your USA location's firewall & forward port 3389 requests the the USA server's internal IP address, which isn't very secure, or establish a VPN tunnel into the USA location's subnet & simply allow RDC connections locally.
Someething like gotomypc is easy enough to setup and will be secure enough in the interim that you can use it while deploying a better corporate solution such as a VPN or SSL VPN or secure terminal services.
If your office is expecting to remote into another office server on your own network, why would you want to go through the internet? If its on the same network you should just be able to use RDP regularly. If you're not on the network check with your sysadmins about a VPN connection.
I do know how to connect remotely to another Server running Windows Server 2003 on my network. But what i would like to know is..........can i connect to another Server through the internet? If YES.....how can i do this?
For a "cheapo" solution, I would actually recommend something like GOTOMYPC.com .  I say this based on the assumption that you are new to doing remote administration.
