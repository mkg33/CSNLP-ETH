For now, you can use an emulated WebSocket that relies on Flash. gimite has one implementation, along with a Ruby backend. (But the backend of WebSocket is so simple you'll probably be writing your own server for it IMO. I'm really not at all sure what the point of tying that into Apache and the obsolescent mod_python is.)
I've been reading quite a bit about this now, and feel like it's time to put it to the test. Only problem is: There aren't any native support out there. I know it's a bug for both Firefox and Webkit, which means it won't be long (hopefully) before they're in the nightlies. And I know Apache is (kinda) working on websocket support, but they seem to have been beaten by a 3rd party extension (experimental, as they call it).
So. To the question. Has anyone gotten to the point where they've successfully built their own Firefox or Webkit-browser with websockets, and gotten a server running that supports websockets? If so, could you post a quick how-to.
I think it'd be a bit premature to put WebSocket support in the browser just yet, the API isn't finalised.
I've been trying to build Firefox, using the patch from the bugzilla, but it keeps getting rejected. I haven't looked at the 3rd party extension to Apache yet, but if you have, let me know (:
