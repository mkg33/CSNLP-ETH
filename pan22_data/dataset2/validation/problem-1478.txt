ClamAV can do the same but I think for simplicity and just scanning binaries I like how Bitdefender handles this, don't forget you have options on Linux or Unix, you can install both or just opt out and use which ever you think works best for you and your environment.
Bitdefender has a Rescue Disk that boots into Knoppix and scans from there. You could either try ripping BitDefender from the disk, or just use that..
I tried this about a month ago with both clamav and AVG.  I found AVG to be a lot faster, with less false positives.  The downside to both of them is that they don't, as far as I know, clean the registry.  I gather that it is possible to use a WinPE boot disk to do registry cleaning of an offline Windows install using a normal Windows virus scanning app.  There are also various linux tools available to manually hack the Windows registry, but I'm not sure how you would determine what to look for and what to do with it, or if you might risk missing viruses that exist entirely in the registry.
Easy to install on Linux partition or Unix partition and easy to scan your mounted C: drive or other media, in addition to other binaries.
