I've studied the behaviour of the DNS proxies inside home routers extensively (including the DG834), and never seen a problem that was query type specific.
I'm assuming your mail traffic runs on standard SMTP port 25?  If so, you'll want to set some NAT routes for traffic on that port to/from your mail server, and setup your router to use your ISP's DNS servers.  That should accomplish what you are looking for (assuming you want all mail traffic to go through your mail server).
I would expect this behaviour to be caused by a bug in the firmware, or perhaps a very obscure setting but I can't guess at a reason. You've already tried to debug with Wireshark so I'll assume you have some knowledge of networking, and have already pinpointed that the issue is actually with your router.
I don't see anything in the product manual that states that the router supports DNS, so I don't know what you are expecting it to do.
This is quite unusual. I've never seen a home router that treated some DNS record-types differently from others.
I am leaving the mailserver program configured with the Google public DNS server addresses.  It's a workaround but I am satisfied with it.
