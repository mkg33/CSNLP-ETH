This will give it a lower scheduling priority. Scheduling priority's range from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority) the default for nice is 10 if the -n argument is omitted..
or maybe you want to enable binary logging in mysql and run full dump once per week / night, while copying bin-logs to safe location every 1-2hours. and.. read-only slave for backup-only purposes is an option as well.
You could always try not running it during peak hours. Whatever priority you use, the dump is still going to require a lock on all your tables. 
If you have a spare server around that can cope with the write load of your server, you can set up replication to that server, and then backup from the slave server. This also has the advantage that you can stop replication while you do the backup and get a consistent snapshot of your data across all databases, or all tables in one database without impacting the database server. This is the set up I always recommend for backing up MySQL if you have the resources.
