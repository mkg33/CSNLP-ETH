I am using DokuWiki (wiki without db backend, just text and attached files) for three years, recently tried twiki (this seemed to me to be too slow, but it has wonderful plugins) and Redmine (more programming oriented - features, projects, bugs ... nicely integrates with svn/git repositories, has its own wiki).
I've used different tools for maintaining the documents like bitrix, share point etc. But faced one issue in all of them that they provide the full service with the premium package but all have some same and some different features. 
Using it from anywhere is a huge plus in my book.  The web client lets me get at something if I'm on a strange and foreign computer.
I maintain a list of useful documentation links in my browser bookmarks.  On top of that a Documentation folder on my hard drive for the small number of things not available online.  Most times I just Google for the manual in question when I need it since maintaining a local copy of online manuals is a waste of space and more or less a loosing battle.
I use Evernote, and pay for the expanded service (though I used the free version for a very long time).  Being able to email anything, add notes from various browsers, access from the Blackberry, etc. all make it worthwhile.  The paid version holds attachments of all types, which I've found useful over time.  That and it gets rid of the darn annoying ad.  Probably why the ad is there in the first place.
I do cleanup every couple weeks to move out anything I forgot to file in the archive once I'm done with it.  I've tried to start a GTD organization with it, but I'm not organized enough for that yet.  But I'm getting there...
My issue is not only saving or handle my documents, but i was also managing a team in which I need a document handling or document management system. I've found 3 giants in document management industry Laserfiche, AIIM and Onbase. i am using Laserfiche which is pretty good. You can have look to all of them which is better for you
