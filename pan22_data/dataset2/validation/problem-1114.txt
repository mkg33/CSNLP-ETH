If I understand you correctly, you want to set your BIND server as the source of your zones but you want to use other 3rd party servers as the authoritative servers for the domains, acting as slaves to your BIND host?
You will need to have A records set to resolve to these 3rd party server IPs as your ns1/ns2 and also register the vanity NS.
I have my domains then pointed to these slave servers as the authoritative servers (both primary and secondary) for these domains. All this requires is a configuration change at your registrar, eNom.
I have my host server hosting all my zones and providing AXFR zone transfers to a bunch of slave DNS services (there are many available on the internet). You will be able to find guides on how to do this with bind.
This can definitely be done and I have a similar setup. This is my setup (kind of like a CDN for DNS).
I also have a vanity NS setup so that ns1.mydomain.com actually points to the authoritative server IPs and not my host. eNom should be able to setup a vanity NS setup for you.
