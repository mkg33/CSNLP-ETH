Someone has suggested that my browsers and curl have a looser requirement for TLS validation than openssl. Is that really the case? I have a hard time believing it. Can anyone help me explain this behavior?
I have tried to add in -CAfile intermediate.pem (where I downloaded the intermediate certificate from TrustWave). Even though the intermediate certificate does not appear anywhere in my KeyChain, I have exported my KeyChain System Roots into a single file and tried that via -CAfile also. Nothing is working. The only filesystem location I see certificates is /etc/ssl/cert.pem and when I specify that via -CAfile, it still fails. 
BTW, I know this can be resolved by including the intermediate certificate with the endpoint certificate on the TLS endpoint for www.visitflorida.com. Now if we could just find that missing key file!
On a Mac, High Sierra 10.13.5, I'm seeing a difference in TLS certification validation. Chrome and Safari are happy with TLS validation when visiting https://www.visitflorida.com. Also, curl has no complaints and I am NOT using '-k'. However, openssl complains that it cannot find the intermediate certificate when trying this openssl s_client -connect www.visitflorida.com:443 < /dev/null | openssl x509 -subject -noout. I have used both the base openssl and brew-installed one.
