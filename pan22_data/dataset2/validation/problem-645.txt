If that's indeed what's happening, the simplest way to move the LOB data is by recreating the table. You can move the data either with bcp out/in, or by inserting directly into a new table and renaming afterward (or by any other preferred method of moving the data you have). Make sure you specify the correct filegroups for row and text data when creating the new table.
Also as @RobertGannon said you can right click on the name of your database, then go to tasks, shrink, files
Try using sys.allocation_units instead of sys.indexes.  BOL says it's for internal use only so I wouldn't write any long term code on it but for this purpose it should be ok.  It points to the first IAM page of each allocation unit.  I believe it will work better for what you are trying to do.
The error is generic and misleading.  You will also get this error when a PARTITION SCHEME has been assigned to the FileGroup you are trying to remove.
You can then select the "Empty file by migrating the data to other files in the same filegroup" to get all of the data off of a given file.  This won't help you get rid of a filegroup itself, but it will let you condense it down to a single file.
You may have some LOB data (text/image/varchar(max)/nvarchar(max)) sitting in the filegroup still. I got caught up by this briefly not too long ago. Rebuilding a table/index on a different filegroup/partition does not move any of the LOB data.
