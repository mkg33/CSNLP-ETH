That being said, this is rather unlikely. Less unlikely are brownouts due to insufficient power, which could result in data corruption or other errors.
A voltage spike from the hub could damage or destroy any USB device connected directly to it. This is true for both self-powered and bus-powered devices, because the spike may occur not only in the power connection but also in the data connection itself.
Another issue could be a data corruption in transfers that can damage the datas on the hard drive. But not the hard drive itself.
I wouldn't worry too much because data storages have CRC check. If something goes wrong...copy gets interrupted with I/O error.
I use the hub to connect two external hard drives to my laptop at all times. One of the drives is portable and the other one isn't. I recently read about somebody's USB hub crashing and frying the devices that were connected to it. Is it possible if this thing malfunctions for it to supply too much power or something? Can it damage my hard drives or laptop and if so, is there a different type of USB hub that won't do that?
It's POSSIBLE, but I'd say it's pretty unlikely depending on the brand as you said is a cheap one it may occur due to USB does carry a small amount of power, and so I suppose if you had a bad hub that was sending spikes of power down the connector cable, it could cause problems.
I have a self-powered 4-port USB hub. It's about as cheap as can be. I got it 5-6 years ago at the register of an office supplies store. I think it was $1 and it has no brand name.
Modern drives and I/o controllers are pretty smart these days but prevention and not saving money is always best strategy.
