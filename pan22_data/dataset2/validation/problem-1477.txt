If you're planning on using your web server for VERY SMALL SCALE use ONLY, then you can do the following:
Honestly, your best bet is to go someplace like godaddy and get a cheap hosting plan - they can run you as little as $5/month these days.
Unless you have a real business reason to host it at home and the expertise necessary to administer a network at that level, spend the $10 or less a month.  You'll save yourself stomach lining and probably money in the long run.
I did this for a class in which I needed to host a Rails application: The website hits the wild simply by turning on the computer, and gets pulled when I get home from class to minimize the amount of time in which it's exposed to the wild.
Buy a domain and use a redirection service (I used no-ip.org) to take standard http requests (port 80) to your router on whatever port you choose. As posters above mentioned, though, you're likely violating the terms of service, but if you're just trying to share some small bits of content with friends or family and you take necessary precautions to protect your network from the wild, you can probably forward safely.
free web hosting turns up a lot of answers on google, you could put your home server ip/allowed port in an iframe on one of these servers
Third, there are a variety of free or very low cost services for you to host your own blog ranging from blogger to wordpress.com to livejournal for basic blogs to full fledged hosting services like Dreamhost (usually under $10 for the first year) to Grokthis.net ($6 month for fairly nice services).
Second, are you really prepare for exposing your home network to incoming traffic?  Are you ready to manage all the security required?  Can you handle it when a security crack creates a bot network or site hosting illegal material in your home and your ISP and/or the law show up to discuss it?
