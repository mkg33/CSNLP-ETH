I am thinking of setting up a raspberry pi inside a private network to act as a firewall for all incoming/outgoing traffic in that network.
Is this possible? I am guessing that if so it would limit all traffic in the network to the throughput the pi is able to output (and therefore in most cases not very useful), is that correct?
From everything I've read, the sharing of the USB bus between the wired Ethernet and USB adapters puts a definite bottleneck on performance. So yes, you can definitely use the RPi as a firewall, but performance may be disappointing depending on your needs and Internet speeds. I may still use it as my hotel room travel router where Internet speeds tend to be limited to 5 Mbps or so.
I did some informal testing with a RPi in bridged, routed and NAT configurations using a usb wifi adapter to connect clients to the RPi, and the wired 100 Mbps Ethernet to my Internet router. Connecting directly to the router with wifi, I get 60 Mbps download speeds. With the RPi in the path, it drops to 10 Mbps or less. This was without any iptables processing on the RPi.
The idea would be to have a router connected to the network and connect the pi (along with all other devices) to the router and configure the router to allow only connections to and from the pi which in turn would allow or deny them access to other network devices.
I'm a big Raspberry fan - but in this case I would recommend to use the 'BananaPi R1 Router Board' which gives you the right hardware for your task.
This is mostly for educational purposes really rather than a serious attempt at something like this.
