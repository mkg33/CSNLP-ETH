I have the same error on a table refresh - the error "This operation is not allowed.  The operation is attempting to shift cells in a table on your worksheet."
I am not sure if it was the same problem, but I had a similar issue on a large spreadsheet where I had many rows and columns hidden.  I would try to add or delete rows or columns and got a message similar to what you had.  In many cells I had comments, I discovered that although the comments were linked to a specific cell, you could move them and they could be anyplace on the spreadsheet.  If you tried to hide, delete, or insert rows/columns that had those hidden comments you got an error message that would go off the table.  I made all the comments visible, and then moved them to a spot I was not trying to affect and no more problem.
If your table is a linked table (via ODBC connection, linked to Access, etc.) that's causing the error, you can change your connection properties on the linked table to "Insert entire rows for new data, clear unused cells". This solved the issue for me where I had several consecutive linked queries on one worksheet. 
This also frequently happens when your table has too many rows. You cannot add more rows when the table is maxxed out.
Now, another column, fill 4 lines, select the COLUMN (by clicking on the column header) and make a table. Rightclick the table: you cannot insert any more rows.
The root cause is the refresh is adding rows or columns in the table and detecting there's no room to do so - could be empty looking rows but have been used before?  Not certain.
My result - I've converted my SS to have table on top of table (10 in total) on each worksheet - no spaces in between.  The updates now occur without error, and all rows shift around to accomodate what is needed.
The fix - edit table properties (click in the table, click design tab, click properties) -- change selection at bottom OFF from "insert cells for new data..." and onto either of the other options, my preference is "Overwrite existing cells..."
I was getting the same error.  "This operation is not allowed. The operation is attempting to shift cells in a table on your worksheet."
Caution - this will overwrite any standard information in the expanded rows or columns.  However - if there is an immediate adjacent additional table - it will MOVE the table, not overwrite/remove - thanks be to some reasonably minded engineer at MS!
Simple Example: make a new spreadsheet, fill 4 lines, select those, and make a table. Rightclick the table: you can easily insert a row above.
Tried the suggestions, but everything looked correct.  Ended up just converting all 4 Tables to Range and then back to Table.  Don't know which Table was the problem, but it's all good now.  ;)
