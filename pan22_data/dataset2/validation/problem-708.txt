first of all many motherboard manufacturer provide easy upgrade utility for windows only and bootable cd/floppy image.(i am saying this with my experience only and please don't argue on that because your specific motherboard manufacturer provide linux upgrading also.)
I'm thinking of buying a new motherboard for my desktop. I've chosen a model and I've read some reviews on it. A couple of the reviews talk about BIOS updating/flashing and stuff like that. As a moderate hardware guy (I've built computers, but only know the basics of hardware and how they work together) running Linux, should I worry about this. I've never updated/flashed my current mobo's BIOS (maybe it needs to be -- I have no friggin clue).
So are all these reviews specific to Windows users? I've never had much driver issues in Linux (other than ATI graphics cards), nor have I had to update BIOS.
I would suggest reading the BIOS release notes to see if there's anything worth updating ... sometimes they fix major issues, sometimes its minor issues, sometimes they make things worse.
second it is risky process. if you face a power cut during upgrading process(only some gigabyte motherboard provide dual bios system which can recover from this type of situation) your motherboard will not be usable anymore unless you send it for repair to the company.
My experience has been that most of the major motherboard brands have utilities for both Windows and Linux.  Even if they don't, Linux has a strong community where someone else has that same motherboard and probably has found a way to do it.
As for Windows vs Linux update issues, you're only concern is if they release only a Windows executable version. The better brands tend to build and package their own bootable CDs so you can easily update your BIOS without needing to go into your OS. Some brands even make it as simple as putting the file on a flash drive and there's a tool in their Boot menu that lets you update from your flash drive. At worse, for brands that only have Windows only packages, I'd suggest avoiding those brands or looking up how to make a DOS bootup flash drive and using that or BartPE if you have time to research that.
