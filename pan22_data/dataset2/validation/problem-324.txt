Below CPU, the us, sy, id and wa values correspond with 'user', 'system', 'idle' and 'iowait'. Like all other tools listed, vmstat shows you the status at a single point in time. Be sure to refresh often ;-)
I need to remotely retrieve, parse, and report in a Java program the CPU and memory usage of a Linux machine.  These should be done in two separate commands instead of one to decouple them to make it easier if one command needs to be changed in the future.
Apart from that, the "free" command shows numbers about used memory, "df" about disk usage, and "top" about different values.
If you really must parse the output from a console command, you probably want to do as less piping and grepping in it as possible.
These are pretty much questions from a newbie.  (I have looked at the other related questions and answers, but none seemed to be exactly answering my own original questions.)
The "Java way" is to use a library, SNMP comes naturally to mind first but it could be too big a hammer to crack such a small nut.
The "parsing" part of the answer involves playing with standard output and string formatting anyway, unless you use SNMP which (if it is an option) could give you a lot more informations.
The "True Unix way" is to make scripts using available system information commands: free, ps, w, vmstat, iostat, ifstat, netstat, etc (hint : don't use "top", it's for interactive use, dammit!)
As far as memory is concerned, mind that the 'free' above is the amount of memory that is free, without counting buffers and cache as free, so you probably want to add buff and cache to free to get the 'real' free amount of MiB's (i.e. physical memory that is directly available to the system for use).
If you want to call it from a script or application use the '-n 1' flag so that it does not run in interactive mode.
