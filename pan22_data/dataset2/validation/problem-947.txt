There's a old feature of Cisco switches called "Private VLAN Edge" (see https://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk389/tk814/tk841/tsd_technology_support_sub-protocol_home.html). 
The feature is restricted to a single switch (or stack-of-switches), and it doesn't really work across multiple switches. 
That should make all Intra-VLAN traffic visible to the device. That might be a bit more than was intended in the first place, so... 
Now whenever a host with a MAC-address-of-interest connects to any of the ports, it's switchport gets mapped into VLAN B, and to reach anyone else on the subnet (other MACs-of-Interest included) it must go through the inline device. MAC learning and ARPing should be "native" for all systems involved.
Port Macros assign host of interest to VLAN B. Connect both VLAN A and VLAN B to a pair of bridged ports on the router (as above, two interfaces & BVI, or better two-ports-on-switch-module & SVI). 
If the inline device is just intended for analyzing traffic (and not for manipulating or blocking), a custom smart port macro (see above) might just be running a user defined macro that adds another line of "monitor session 1 source interface 0/Y", as soon as a MAC address of interest is discovered on a given port. Of course, you'd need a "cleanup macro" as well, that runs after "line protocol down" of a given switch port. 
Think of it as "hotel mode", where you want to keep your guests' system from talking to each other, but everyone may talk to the router. 
Connect the inline device to a SPAN destination port on the switch, and use VLAN B as SPAN source. Whatever talks on VLAN B will be visible to the now passive inline device.
