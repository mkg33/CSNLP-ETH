The Step function will round down an answer that is lower than 0.5 to 0, and an answer that is higher than 0.5 to 1. However, please note that you do not need to use a binary activation function to output 1 - I advise you to just use TanH or sigmoid and backpropagate a whole bunch of iterations.
I am totally new to Artificial Neural Networks. Letâ€™s say that the model you are trying to turn into an artificial neural network has an output that is triggered only by the exceedance of a threshold: $y\geq y_{1}. $Therefore, you need to find a way to use this inequality as an activation function. Is this feasible?
However, in other comments, you mentioned that you know what y1 is. That is not of importance, the network will act as a black box and will figure out a treshold itself. Don't set up your own activation function just to get the right output - that avoids the whole point of backpropagation.
This is feasable. This is also called a Binary/Step activation function. You must only use this activation function on the output neurons.
