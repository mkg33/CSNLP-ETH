If you don't have any decent jumper wire handy, see if you can find an old chunk of Cat5 solid ethernet cable. Strip the outer casing, separate the strand pairs into individual strands, smooth the "twisties" in the wire out (this can be rough on your fingertips if you're making a lot of jumper wires) and strip off each end of the wire. I've made lots of jumper wires from old Cat5 and even some old 25-pair phone wire (which has some really cool color combinations) and it works very well.
Be careful with Cat6 though - it's actually one gauge bigger and it might be a bit tougher to insert in your breadboard holes. If whatever cable you find, it there's a plastic '+' separating the 4 pairs of wires, it's probably Cat6 or higher.
For LEDs that are farther away from the GPIO pins, let's say the left-hand Red LED, if that was plugged into Row 3, hole D [[ I can't tell for sure in the picture ]] remove the LED from there, run a jumper wire from Row 3, hole D to Row 23, Hole D, put the anode of the Red LED In Row 23 Hole B, the cathode in Row 24, Hole D, one leg of the resistor in Row 24, Hole B and the other leg of the resistor into the ground strip.
Looking at your picture, why not make use of the extra 10 unused rows on your breadboard? I am going to assume that you've figured out that "row 1, holes a-e" are all interconnected, "row 1, holes f-j" are interconnected, "row 2, holes a-e" are interconnected, etc. Your unused rows 21-30 aren't used, so, for example, the anode of the left-hand blue LED is plugged into row 19, hole b. Plug the LED's cathode into row 21, hole D, plug one leg of the resistor into row 21, hole B, then plug the other resistor leg into your ground (-) strip.
