To conclude, one solution would be to make two lists of Individuals. Not only would it be more respectful towards many many people in the world, but you could also get rid of your Male and Female classes: that would make your code more generic while probably shorter and simpler too. Everywhere you have variable names containing male or female, you can replace them by person1 and person2 or individual1 and individual2. Moreover, that kind of genericity would allow your code to be adapted to more complex problems (for example, a problem of Ménage à trois speed dating).
Computationally speaking, I don't have anything to add what has already been said. @amon did a really comprehensive review of your code. However, there are some serious sociological and/or ethical flaws in your code. I would say that, genderly speaking, it could be made more generic:
Never forget that you should treat people as people, and consider how they define themselves before considering how you would like them to be.
