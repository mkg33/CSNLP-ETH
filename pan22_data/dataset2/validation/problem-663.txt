If I upgrade the 2005, will I run into any issues with backwards compatibility?  (Probably a dumb question).
Like lynnroth, I run multiple instances (05 standard, 08 dev, and a 05 express instance) for testing specific things.
What exactly are your concerns with backward compatibility?  Do you have an app that specifically requires 2005?  If this is the case, then stick with 2005 and run multiple instances.
Don't forget that running databases against multiple instances is different resource-wise than running all databases against a single instance.
If your going to do an in-place upgrade, then run SQL Server upgrade adviser which will warn you about any issues you may run into.
If you're worried about backwards comptible SQL you can use various compatibility level values. It's not exactly like running the SQL against a different version of SQL Server, but it makes migrating from version to version easier.
I currently have a machine with SQL Server 2005 SP3 installed.  I would like to add a SQL Server 2008 instance, but I'm not sure if I should upgrade the 2005 or try to install a separate instance of 2008.
