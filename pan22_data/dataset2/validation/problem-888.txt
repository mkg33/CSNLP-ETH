Same issues.  Completely out of ideas, even checked using openssl the new .pem files and they do expire correctly in 90 days (they are from letsencrypt).
His issue is mine to a T, and all things he tried more or less I did too.  The difference was his was solved because he had nginx running.  In my case I have no such reverse proxy server.  So I just cannot get Apache to see the new certs I got using certbot (that was a whole other issue, certbot auto renew didn't work gave errors and so I did a certbot cert only apache and pointed appach ssl-certs in etc/httpd/extra  to there.
Alas nothing, no change, websites still report the expired ticket.  Which was in another folder /live/apo.nmsu.edu-0004 which I moved to tmp.  So not sure how apache is still picking all that up.
I guess you should check what certificates you have in the files pointed to in your Apache configuration, especially that you seem to have some symbolic links involved.
Tried everything else like he did.  Moved the folder the /etc/httpd/extra/ssl-certs and ssl-certs-proxy were pointing to to /tmp, and had those files point to the new .pem location:
