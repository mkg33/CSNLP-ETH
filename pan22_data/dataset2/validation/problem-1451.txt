I hear Transactional NTFS is used by autoupdate, but have no clue why the system would want to place this on an external disk and then be unable to stop it upon safe removal request.
But, just today I went into the disk's Device Properties (from Device Manager or from the Hardware tab in any disk's properties dialog) and found that the the disk's Removal policy was set to Quick removal:
Just out of curiosity I changed the removal policy to Better performance and sure enough after I did that the Safely Remove Hardware eject function worked fine and I could eject the disk without the dreaded "Disk is in use" error. I have no idea why the policy would make any difference since I was trying to safely remove either way but I haven't had any problems since so give it a try.

I've recently discovered that restarting the "Server" service (which will generally require Windows to also restart dependent "Computer Browser" service and possibly the "HomeGroup Listener" service at the same time) allows me to then safely remove the drive. I don't know if this is actually safe to do or not, but it does work.

For this sort of problem, you can get more information about which service svchost.exe is hosting is behind the activity by looking at the stack for a relevant item in the Sysinternals Process Monitor list.

I have had this same issue every time I used my external USB drive to my Win 8.1 desktop. The only way I could properly eject it was by going into Disk Management and then taking the disk offline. It's really painful though as you then have to put it online when you next plug it in.
