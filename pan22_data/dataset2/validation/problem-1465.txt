If you find your RAM filling up with famous candidates like Photoshop or Google Chrome, then you may wish to upgrade that so you can run more at once. Upgrading your RAM also means that your OS won't need to free up the RAM that often, leading to smoother running of applications. If however your RAM can handle your workload but everything is too slow, then the CPU could use an upgrade. You should consult the service manual for your specific laptop to see what CPU's can fit and be supported - not all that fit may work. For example, there are a list of CPU FRU's for select Thinkpads (where the CPU is socketed) that tell you what CPUs can be installed.
It's impossible right now to tell you exactly what to upgrade, because of the vagueness of your question and no information about your workload, but you can do more research on what would make your experience better and upgrade accordingly.
upgrading from a  1GB Elpida  to a 4GB memory chip (KEMBONA SODIMM LAPTOP DDR2 4 GB 4G 800 MHZ PC2-6400 RAM)? 
I wpuld argue that, if you need to choose, get more RAM.  After HDD, RAM is typically the bottleneck that slows down most systems. As most modern systems are designed with an expectation of > 2 gigs of RAM, with 4 being anything entry level and 8 being typical,  RAM will make a huge difference. (Even a typical low-mid range Cellphone. now sports 3 gigs of RAM).
The CPU and RAM are used for different things - the RAM is the amount of random access memory that is available to the system - which directly affects how many programs it can run at once. The CPU's clock speed tells you how many operations can run per second. The number of cores directly affects how many programs you can run concurrently (truly concurrently - different to threads, which is where a CPU splits the execution of programs using a time division).
If you are planning to extend the usable lifetime of your machine, and are willing to practice patience, go for more RAM. "Swapping to disk" is only a makeshift here and will in addition waste CPU cycles while simulating RAM.
In general, the problems one has to solve by using a computer, will grow over the years (...that is, require the manipulation of more data than today, e.g. larger images in digital photography, more chunky apps, and so on).
I apologize if this has been asked before, in this fashion, please point me to the previous questions. 
And a follow up question: How do I know which CPU is compatible with my laptop (Dell Inspiron 1545 PP41L)? Do I just look at the socket type? I know from experience, that Socket P fits into my laptop, but I don't know:
Assuming you are not doing real-time computations (like object detection in live camera images, or trajectory planning in robotics):
With respect if CPU, the third CPU is only about twice the speed if the first one. (The second one listed is about 1.7 x as fast). A basic new entry level sysyem will typically be 3-5 times as fast as your current CPU, but will also include specific speedup functionality not available on a 9+ year old cpu - Im specifically thinking of graphics (video playback and rendering) and AES (encryption offload). For these reasons I conclude that neither chip will give the system the kind of speed boost you might think. Apps which are not CPU/GPU intensive will work anyway. Apps which are wont.
IMHO, unless you gave a specific use case, dont waste any money on that system - its well past its use-by date. Id honestly expect a midern mid-range cellphone to be more powerful. A chromebook or entry level $200 Windows laptop will provide better bang for buck,  usable battery  and better perfornance.
