A VLAN - " virtual LAN" is related, but probably not what you are asking about as this typically involves "physical separation". ( It a bit simplistic, but you can think of VLANS as groupings of related ports which usually can't talk directly to each other. A single port can be part of multiple groups though.) 
From the router OS's perspective, each VLAN tag corresponds to a separate 'interface'. If the main port is named lan or eth0, then you'll have virtual interfaces like lan.2 or eth0.5, each with its own IP subnet and address configuration.
When a single Router is connected to 3 or more networks, can a Router know 2 of those different networks through a single Ethernet port/interface or does each network has to be physically separated. 
(Not all routers support it but) you can have a single interface/port with multiple addresses (in the same or different subnets/networks) associated with it and a router can route between this networks. These are sometimes called "secondary interfaces".
Yes, 802.1Q VLANs are used for this purpose â€“ they tell the router to tag each Ethernet frame with its "VLAN ID" depending on which network it should belong to. A compatible Ethernet switch can be used to split/combine this tagged (multi-VLAN) port into individual untagged (single-network) Ethernet ports.
I have no idea what VLAN are, but if the above is not possible, than I'm going to guess that's what its for...
