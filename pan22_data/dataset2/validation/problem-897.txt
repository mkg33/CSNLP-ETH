Try completely wiping your iPod on the device itself then reconnect. There may be something corrupt that the PC doesn't like.
I ran into a problem like this where my company added a network drive that was the same drive letter the ipod wanted to be.
If it is able to sync on the Mac then my guess is that the iPod is not formatted to work with iTunes on a PC. They use different formatting and normally will prompt you to format it to work correctly on the Mac. If you have enabled disk use then a portion of the drive is Fat32 and that would explain why the PC sees it as a camera but iTunes can't read the library directory correctly.
Not sure if you already did this or not. You can try to restore the iPod on the OSX machine, then see if it'll work with the iTunes install on the windows machine. This will lose all data currently stored on the iPod, so make sure to backup anything that isn't synced through iTunes before hand.
Your Post says Windows 7, so this may not apply, but in XP I recently had to goto the Control Panel, Cameras and Scanners, and change the default action associated with the iPod from open with "Microsoft Office Scanner", to "Do Nothing"  This solved my daughter's issue iTunes freezing during a sync.  Don't know if this crosses over to Windows 7 though.
It may work to reset the iPod back to factory defaults (since it is sync'd already with the Mac and you can pull the pictures off it manually, you shouldn't lose anything). I believe using the "Erase all content" in the settings will do this as well as holding the home and sleep buttons together. Once this is done then it just needs to be connected to iTunes again to be setup and reinitialized. At this point Win7 iTunes may pick it up and set it for sync.
