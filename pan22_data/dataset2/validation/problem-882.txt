If you are wanting to copy a block of formulas keeping all references the same, you can press Ctrl+` (backquote) to show formulas and then copy and paste by clicking the icon on the Clipboard task pane (activate using small arrow on clipboard section of Home Tab). If this is not what you are trying to achieve, a simple example would help.
If I try to follow the steps to cut and paste from a new worksheet I find that all references in formulas stay fixed when copying to the new location including relative references. In fact in Excel 2010  i find that after cutting and pasting formulas, the first row and column contain links to the old sheets but other rows and columns reference the new sheet which looks like a bug??
I just found a partial workaround. It's not as general as the copied-worksheet-and-cutting-range workaround in the OP, but it can be much faster if you just need to quickly copy something. What we all really want here tho is a way to temporarily disable the absolute references while we copy. There could be an option to allow you to hold alt when you paste to ignore every $, like they just weren't there, but they actually still are once the paste is completed.
Due to the total number of columns, XFD# is the last valid cell reference. Make sure the new references generated don't overlap an actual reference in your range of cells or that reference will be broken in the last step. Choosing a letter from a column you never reference in your block of cells to be copied will ensure you do not break any formulas. As an example, if you replaced $ with 'h', $b$42 would become hbh42, which is still a valid reference that can now be copied and will update automatically! 
You can try replacing the $ with 2 letters in some cases, but that has a number of problems of it's own, so it would be easier to find a 1 letter replacement that won't overlap an actual reference.
The following will work with less complexity then writing your own macro and achieves the final result.
Yes, I know I'm not using the Absolute cell reference but as shown in OP's example you don't need it.
