It sounds like your IT department suffers from what pretty much every IT department in a large company suffers from. Building little castles and defending them with your life, not letting others in, being bossy, etc. As someone who deals with other people's IT departments every day, I see it all the time. And it's frustrating.
However it is the IT departments job to ensure that YOU can do YOUR job properly. They need to make sure that you have what you need, when you need it. If you have a piece of software that the business needs to keep running, they have to provide a platform for it to run on. That's their job description. But you need to make sure that they have the information they need to do their jobs.
The basic fact is though that the change needs to happen from within the IT department, and it has to be initated from above them. And if you can get IT to realise that they are not a force unto themselves (as that most of them do not generate income for their businesses this can be quite a slap in the face), and that they are there to support the existing staff and enhance the business, then you'll find that your questions become irrelevant, because everyone will be playing happy families.
So, the IT department are very justified in not putting this random computer on their server network.
If you had come to me, in my organisation, told me you're starting a new project, I would have given you three VM's: Dev, Live and Staging. You would have full admin rights to Dev, and we would discuss what you needed to do your job for the other two. If you needed full admin rights to them, and could justify it, then you would get it. We have our VM deployment down-pat. VMWare makes this incredibly simple - it only takes about 5 minutes per VM to get it deployed.
If you came to me with a workstation class machine loaded to the hilt with consumer grade RAM, consumer-grade HDD's, consumer-grade PSU and consumer-grade RAID, I would refuse to put it on the server network too.
