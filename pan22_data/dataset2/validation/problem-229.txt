What a data center does when you reach capacity really depends on the data center and the equipment they connect it to.  I mostly deal with full circuits, say 20A, and for those it's not uncommon that if you exceed it by too much for too long the circuit shuts down, just like would happen at home if you run the microwave and toaster at the same time.  :-)  But at a 1.5A loading, it'll depend on what the equipment you connect to can do, and how loaded the circuit is.
Give them the specs of the server you are looking at and ask them if you need to reduce your server power draw or they're ok with it mostly being under that.  It's really up to their policies and procedures, but expect that they've seen people come in with over-powered servers before, saying "we'll only use 0.5A usually" but then a process gets stuck and they start using 2A all the time.
As far as the power supply specs, most power supplies are at their peak efficiency around 50% of utilization.  Meaning they convert most of their input power into output power.  So that 570W power supply will only produce around 175W to 200W of usable power to the components at that 236W peak load you are talking about.
