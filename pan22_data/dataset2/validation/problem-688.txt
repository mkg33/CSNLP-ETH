You can still have stateful firewalls on routers and other firewall rules can be added too in a simmilar way as ipv4.
Many universities (and several large companies) have valid, routable IP's on every single computer.  That does not mean there is not a gateway firewall device.  It doesn't mean you can reach that device from the internet either.  Most of the time, the firewalls are set to block all traffic by default.. It does, however, guarantee that their computer is on a globally unique address.
that said, just because you loose NAT does not mean you loose all the benefits (You can still have NAT on ipv6)
The only difference is that you may be able to identify the exact computer from within a private network and if thats a problem you can install NAT.
However, it doesn't at all mean that you won't still have a central firewall at the network edge - the change is simply that it'll be acting as a pure firewall instead of a firewall/NAT device.  It'll just be up to the people managing those firewalls to make sure to avoid accidentally exposure of services; fire up the deny rules!
IPv6 gets rid of NAT, which has certainly been a large part of avoiding accidental exposure of services to the internet from internal hosts.. so in that way, yes, it's a change to how most everyone is doing things.
Getting rid of NAT is a big change to network security practices, and there will certainly be times before too long that we hear about some accidental information exposure breaches due to misconfigured firewalls and IPv6.  But NAT has always been a hack, and getting the firewalls out of the business of tracking all of those connections and fake connections for stateless protocols and port translations will be a good thing in the long run - less complexity sounds good to me!
If you use NAT, things just plain get nasty.. IE, you want to setup a VPN between you and your customer, but you both have internal networks of 192.168.1.x.. this means, you have to then NAT the natted connections, to make them appear to be a different internal only IP, which makes things just get ugly in a hurry. ( I have to do that with 5 other companies we have VPN's with)
