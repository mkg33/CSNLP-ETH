I had this problem in Windows 10 until I uninstalled Logitech's SetPoint software. As soon as I had done that then my Logitech trackball's wheel started working again for vertical scrolling in Chrome and other apps.
What's doubly weird about it is, it'll actually work for a couple seconds after I login, but then inexplicably stop working. I'm guessing there's some software loading up not long after I login that's causing the issue.
Similar problem, similar solution: I had Taekwindow installed and configured to scroll the window under the cursor. But since this is the default in Windows 10 anyway, I just turned it off and things went back to working:
Sigh, guess I should have paid a little more attention. I had KatMouse (http://ehiti.de/katmouse/) installed previously, and that was causing the issue. Leaving this here for anyone who's interested.
I haven't yet tried booting into safe mode, or disabling start up software with msconfig. I'll try those and update the post with the results.
Just upgraded to Windows 10 on my (~5 year old) laptop, and overall I like it; however, I've got one little quibble with it that I haven't yet found a solution too... When attempting to use the scroll wheel (either through the touchpad or with and attached wireless mouse) I can't scroll within certain windows. Specifically, the Start Menu, Settings Screens, the Windows App store, etc. Other windows work fine (i.e. Chrome, Minecraft, Windows Explorer) but not these ones.
