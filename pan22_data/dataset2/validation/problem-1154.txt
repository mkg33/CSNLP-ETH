the problem is that you can not copy the file because you will get an error stats the file is being used... and soon after you close Firefox the file will be disappeared. So what to do?
I am having the same problem as the OP for a long time. At least since 2011 youtube changed the way its videos are cached and since then its hard to find them.
just write %temp% in the address bar then there should be a file which its name contains "fla" and had a reasonable size (depends on the opened video).
My guess is youtube is using some nonstandard Flash cache method, probably on the Flash cache folder itself but I only found that folder once or twice, shouldnt be hard though.
The video will be there in the cache only as long as you are seeing it in the browser, after which it is deleted automatically.
I'm trying to find youtube video (just watched) in Firefox cache folder, but I cant find the folder.
The old way it used to be stored on the regular Windows Temp folder on the Windows use folder. Sometimes, I don't know when, you can indeed find it there, for that I usually use this really lightweight freeware called VideoCacheView because it searches all IE and windows related folders really quick and can copy those nasty 'locked', in use files with just a right click instead of me having to use the command line with hobocopy tool.
to solve this problem you should switch your user and log off the user from another user using task manger. then com back and copy the file and change the extension from .tmp to .flv then open the file. I know that km player can read the file.
It gives "videos from Youtube" as an example, but the same applies to any other content you might find in a webpage.
