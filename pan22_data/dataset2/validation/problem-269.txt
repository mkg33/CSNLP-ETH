Another aspect is that you cannot reduce the size of your iSCSI/VMFS partition on your SAN, however you may be able to reduce the NFS partition depending which SAN you own. A Netapp can reduce an NFS partition (if there's space free of course).
NFS data-stores have been in my case at least susceptible to corruption with SRM. NFS speed used to be a bit better in terms of latency but it is nominal now with all the improvements that have came down the pipe. NFS in my opinion is cheaper as almost any thing can be mounted that is a share.
I obviously prefer iSCSI but, iSCSI solutions or even FC are a bit more expensive. I would mount a NFS and iSCSI DS and run VMwark and see what your IOPs are, that would probably be the best way. As far as NIC bonding, where would you bond at ? The appliance level ( your NAS ) or at the VKernel level ?
All of the benefits of having shared storage in ESXi are available with both iSCSI and NFS.  Beyond that, which is "better" to use is subjective, which doesn't belong here.
A small side effect on your VM's, when you use NFS, you will not be able to see the disk performance of your VM's.
iSCSI bandwidth I/O is less than NFS. iSCSI uses MPIO ( Multi Pathing ) plus you get block based storage & LUN Masking.
More than a single initiator can connect to a single iSCSI target, if the target is configured to allow it.
