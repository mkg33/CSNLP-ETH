This should solve your problem. Basically, even if your windows supports IDE drives, if it was installed on anything else, the IDE drivers aren't used. In order to set them up, you need to follow the article
If this is the cause, a simple repair of the install using the windows install disk should correct disk driver access problems.
Check the disk type under Vmware. It could have been converted to a Scsi disk - for which virtual PC doesn't have a driver. You may need to revirtualize the original disk but choose to convert it to an IDE disk.
have you used disk2vhd from sysinternals.  The only real limitation is the os boot disk should be less then 128gigs!
Have you tried booting the VM with the Windows installation CD and running a repair on the OS that it finds?
If your old PC uses an EIDE (possibly also SATA) disk you can probably just snapshot it and restore the snapshot to a blank VM disk and the VM should boot. See www.drivesnapshot.de for my favourite (free evaluation!) snapshot tool.
