Because PostScript is a programming language, the entire contents of the document must be computed step by step.  While PDF supports a limited subset of PostScript for vector graphics, it is designed specifically as a document format and does not require this sort of computation.
and see if it is any faster. (gv also uses PostScript for rendering, but doesn't convert to PDF.) Or you use Ghostscript directly
Is there a reason PostScript is a lot slower when rendering (tried with evince on Ubuntu) than PDF or  are the reader just a lot less optimized?
I always thought that PDFs and PostScript files are quite similar, even though PostScript is a turing complete language.
It depends on the PostScript code. One could write a 3D rendering algorithm in PostScript and use embedded AutoCAD files as pictures. It will take much time to render while PDF will contain  prerasterized images. In some cases PostScript will be much faster to render. Unfortunately most popular publishing software emits very inefficient PostScript code. But converters PS->PDF are able to optimize their output for fast rendering.
But don't forget one thing: exactly because PostScript is a programming language, you can design PostScript files which are rather short in Bytes, but make the interpreter go through a loop with thousands of iterations (for example to compute + render a fractal) before it displays the file content on screen.
I suspect that evince cannot directly render and display PostScript on screen. Maybe it can only do so for PDF. So it may use a trick for PostScript files: behind you back it converts them to a temporary PDF file and display that one instead.
