One of my requirements involve writing some of the information to a database (ie, execution time, size, URI, remote IP).  For that reason I'm apprehensive about piping to a script and keeping a database connection open.  So I'm leaning towards a nightly analysis.  
I would recommand to don't use a pipe because foreach request you will lost a lot of time in apache to pipe to the script and wait the end of the script to free apache ressource.
You could try using mod-log-sql to log to a database on every request. My preference is to a something nightly when you have lower load, but it depends on how up to date you need the data.
So, if for a reason, you database become very slow to do INSERT, you could have all apache threads/process to be waiting for your script to finish your job and can't be used to process new user request
I have a need to analyze logs generated by Apache2 webserver.  I'm considering either piping the log to a script that will just wait on the stdin for input, or analyzing the logs nightly with a batch job.
