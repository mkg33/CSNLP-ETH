I'm just going to go ahead and post this since i spend three or four minutes on it, but after looking at this code, there is no way this was working as you had it. This site is for reviewing working code, not fixing broken code. If your code doesn't work you need to ask on StackOverflow in the future.
Use a prepared statement. It's not cool to throw variables into your queries all willy-nilly. You will anger the code gods.
Your first condition (i there are records in the table) does not close the thead or the create a tbody.
Edit... you're not closing your table row in the loop either. I'm not gonna bother updating the code snippet.
Your delete button is no button at all, it's an input wrapped in an anchor tag (<a>). That's why it's not working as expected. Either remove the anchor and give the input a type attribute of "button", or remove the input and put some text in there instead.
Here's a quick re-write (assumes you're using PDO - If you're using MySQLi, see the docs to convert the prepared statement to MySQLi)
