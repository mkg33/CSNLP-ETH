## TODO list :
#### (In my view, those are just extras, and it won't be tragic if we don't manage to do everything.)
- other feature extraction mechanisms (just for comparison)
- another method that beats the baseline (so that we have 3 for the voting classifier)
- much more data for additional training and evaluation (we could 'split' the tasks and results: one for the official shared task, the other for the extra data)


## Poster ideas:
- it'd be nice to include a QR code with a link to our full paper (that's what I did in another course and it was very well received)
- also, with the QR code, we avoid the whole bibliography section that will just take up valuable space on the poster
- we'll simply reuse our diagrmas from the paper, it's extremely important that we visualise our ideas/architecture (you've already done this in the group meeting last week)
- I'll also provide a very simple visual explanation of Optimal Transport
