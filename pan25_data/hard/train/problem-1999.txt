The Court historically was supposed to be separated from public opinion as what matters in court is the word of law and interpretation.
That's why the justices are appointments by elected officials and not elected.
It originally was intended to weed out the lessers and bring forth justices who would be unbiased in interpretation of the law.
These fascist bloodsuckers have now taken this ideal and corrupted it for the gain of their own interests.
To use it for empowerment of their political beliefs and not the laws passed by the people's representatives, the actual will of the people.
They're supposed to serve the Constitution, but now they serve what they want the Constitution to be and nobody who can do so meaningfully has checked them.
The Supreme Court has only one job; read a law, compare it to the constitution and determine if the law fits within the constitution.
That’s it.
Period.
It’s also irritating when someone just throws out “precedent” as if there aren’t times when previous decisions don’t need to be overturned.
Precedent is not the only consideration and if the precedent was a poor ruling it needs to be reversed.
Screw the justices, they have to deal with the consequences of ripping rights from people left and right while contradicting the last sentence they just said.
Clown court of the United States.
