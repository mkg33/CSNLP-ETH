I've been physically restrained because I've refused to take a test or do missed homework.
On the other hand, one of my peers was someone who often threw tables at staff.
I get the need for physical restraint, but it's applied way too liberally; if the school psychologist, my parents, and the police are informing you of an alternative solution, that should be the end of it.
Also a caveat: someone not trained in restraint can physically restrain a kid if they are in immediate danger.
For example a kid runs into the street, nonverbal, cannot really communicate or follow directions ("low" cognitively), anyone can put hands on within reason.
It's better to be protected by good samaritan laws rather than be in hot water for allowing the child to be in danger.
this... unfortunately.
I've had to really rail into a teacher for this exact reason.
the sad part is that myself (school psychologist) , the cse chair, and others offered various alternatives/buy stuff for her classroom to handle the students needs but all rejected because it's too much work.
I get the kids can be difficult but strapping them down should not be an immediate/the go-to reaction.
