Against a law that would have banned children from carrying firearms in public without adult supervision.
I heard some people say the argument against the bill is that this would restrict teens from hunting without supervision of someone at least 21 years of age.
To be clear teens could still go hunting, just need supervision.
I’ve got no real issue with 16-17 year olds hunting by themselves.
Sometimes, in rural places, it’s a necessary food source and parents have jobs.
A 14-15 year old with an a ar15 is a whole different thing.
Unfortunately there isn’t really a legal distinction between the two.
That is the dumb part.
Most people don’t have to hunt to keep from starving, but it can really help lighten the burden of grocery costs for lots of people.
I wouldn’t consider hunters and their families statistically irrelevant.
I hunted by myself all the time when I was a teenager.
I had to get a license, pass a hunter safety course, and have my parents permission to use my grandfather’s rifle.
No body ever got hurt, very few animals got hurt either for that matter because I wasn’t very good at.
It wasn’t really a very controversial thing to be engaged in back in the 80s and 90s.
We didn’t need to hunt for food for survival, but every little bit helps.
The biggest difference between now and then I suppose was that there was an assault weapons ban in place, so folks weren’t hunting with ARs.
Maybe there should just be an assault weapons ban again instead of a broad sweeping ban on a legitimate activity that helps people pay the bills.
