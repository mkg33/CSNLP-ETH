When i went to law school they made a big deal about precedent, but these days it just seems like courts manufacture their own bullshit reasons to justify beliefs no matter what prior decisions have held.
The only question is whether the regular legal professionals of the world will actually consider anything a reactionary judge decides as actual precedent, or just sigh pretend it never happened.
For their sanity, I reckon they'll keep doing the second one.
I'll just sue him for serving crappy omelets at the omelet bar at Mar a Lago.
I've never been there, but I'm sure _someone_ has gotten food poisoning ...
I heard about it from a guy who got it from a website.
So it has to be true.
Yes there is.
It's government assistance not a public good no matter how much you try to equate the two.
Which means the public wants means testing applied to it instead of just giving it universally to all borrowers.
Forgiveness with no income limit or debt caps was unpopular and not the political win for Dems you assume it would be.
I think it's fair to say Americans understand running programs has a cost to them, and unless the cost is exorbitant (which doesn't sound like the case at all here), they're willing to accept that tradeoff to accomplish a goal (means testing to target relief).
I'm not sure that's a fair thing to assume; a naive interpretation of means testing would assume that it only ever saves money, because it is only ever presented that way publically.
But you haven't addressed the idea that the public generally aren't aware that means testing comes with an objective cost as well as purported savings.
Without that knowledge, public opinion isn't as good of a pointer here.
