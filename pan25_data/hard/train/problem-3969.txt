Good move.
It's not just that children and other addicts are wasting their own money in this.
The bigger issue is that this is literally ruining gaming, by slowly turning games into fucking casinos.
There's little motive for developers to make good games if they can make 10x more by making mediocre shit fit lootboxes and timers and other crap.
If it crashes we might just go back to an age where actually good games are made to earn a profit instead of scummy practices.
Game franchises like age of empires and sim city made money without loot boxes and folks still play .
Unreal tournament GOTY, DOOM .. etc .
No loot boxes .
it had nothing to do with ethics, the states just like to steal peoples money without ever giving you a service in return because they are absolutely shit at budgeting.
So they tax something to make up for the shortfalls of mismanagement.
They contributed nothing to indie developers who struggle to make games.
They contributed nothing to help online market places like steam.
The problem is that gaming companies are bloated with upper management that are more concerned with profit and stock prices than actually make a simple and fun Game.
In the United States Trump signed a law that instead of cracking down on loot boxes he gave the states the right to tax online game purchases.
