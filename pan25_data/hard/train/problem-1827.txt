Nowadays, to have any sort of meaningful wealth in Russia you need to be a creature of the state.
Half your assets are considered state property.
(If not Putin’s himself, although I’m not sure he sees much of a difference.)
You act in its interests and it tells you what it expects of you, and dipping a toe into Russian politics is entirely off limits unless you’re directed to.
People still have outdated views on the oligarchy as if it was shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when it did indeed hold much political power, but that isn’t really the case anymore as you said.
With Russia's economy controlled by oligarchs, all of whom are effectively Putin's capos, there isn't any viable political opposition that can emerge short of a popular revolution or the death/assassination of the boss.
It’s extremely top heavy.
Except for specific exceptions, the typical wealthy Russian oligarch has no political influence.
Not ‘little’ but ‘none.’.
Wealthy oligarchs are not influential.
That claim seemed odd because I’m so entrenched into the western system where wealth and power go hand in hand.
In the US the billionaires own the politicians.
In Russia the oligarchs are told what to do.
You are also right in that Yeltsin was subservient to the oligarchs during his term.
The leadership structure today is not remotely like that.
If you put heat and pressure on every capo, not a single one will flip.
Despite not having any power or influence in the broader organization, they are all-in.
Unlike the underlings who can flip, everything capos have is because of the mafia.
They have too much to lose and there is no way out.
