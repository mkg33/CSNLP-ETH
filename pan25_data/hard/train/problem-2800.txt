This week, Republican Sen. Mike Lee, from Utah, introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), which seeks to “establish a national definition of obscenity that would apply to obscene content that is transmitted via interstate or foreign communications.”.
According to Stabile, it’s unlikely Congress will pass the bill, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be taken seriously.
“This bill, among our members, has gotten a huge amount of attention,” the director of public affairs with the Free Speech Coalition, Mike Stabile, told VICE News.
“Our members understand this for what it is: It's a threat to their business, to their livelihood.
It's a threat to their community.”.
Some members of the adult industry are worried that a prorposed federal bill that’s going after content that aims to “arouse, titillate, or gratify” sexual desires has the potential to outlaw porn nationwide.
The Porn Industry laughs as Tiny Republican Senator No One Wants to Fuck Anyway Wants to Ban Porn, Obviously Misunderstanding How Immensely Powerful the Porn Industry Is.
Lee's fellow Republicans/Conservatives/Evangelicals might support his campaign in public, but we all know that in private many of them are porn addicts who will never vote to ban porn - at least not from themselves!
The sad thing is there are a lot of morons in the porn industry who actually think Republicans are protecting them from Dems banning porn.
Their argument?
Tipper Gore.
