You're right.
The workers got everything they asked for plus three extra sick days = what a scab.
Guess I'll be voting for Republicans next time--they really know how to treat the working class.
/s.
You mean the "shitty deal" the labor unions already agreed to?
Wait, you're right, they wanted 4 sick days too.
So the "shitty deal" they already agreed to plus 7 sick days.
Man, Biden is such an asshole.
/s.
What about negotiating a deal that the workers already agreed to and giving them an additional 7 days sick leave makes you think Biden isn't pro union?
Biden can veto if he gave a shit but itâ€™s his shitty labor secretary pushing a shitty deal down labor unions throat.
Let the workers strikes and actually win some real concessions.
Betraying labor may result in a strike anyway though.
They can't actually force people to work.
If you truly want to avoid a strike you side with workers.
No, the house passed two bills.
One forces workers to accept the contract without paid or unpaid sick leave.
The other adds 7 days of paid sick leave to the contract.
Instead they are 2 separate bills and it's now up to the Senate.
It's very likely only the first bill passes, meaning workers are forced to accept the contract that they rejected.
