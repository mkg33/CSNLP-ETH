That will force Russia hands to do an all out mobilization, and potentially NATO soldiers to be mobbed since Ukrainian bodies might run out.
As long as Russia can't advance, everything is fine, as without ceasefire, we will continue to throttle them long term.
interesting if you think in an all out war between russia and ukraine it isn't a possibility ukraine run out of soldiers first.
Sometimes I read these articles and I feel like Ukraine is fighting this war with one hand tied behind it's back.
It's hell of a handicap, but imagine if they weren't restricted by politics of the west.
I am not saying we don't help.
I am saying Ukraine needs more so they can do the work of closing their sky themselves.
How many Ukrainian civilians need to die for the West and NATO to realize that they need to close the sky.
If they won't do it, give more tools for Ukrainians to do it themselves.
On the other hand, we cannot give just give the weapons to Ukraine.
They would need months of training beforehand.
And those weapons in particular are not plentiful.
