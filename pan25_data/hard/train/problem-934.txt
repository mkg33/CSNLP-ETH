That's EXACTLY what it sounds like to me.
I was empanelled on a Federal Grand Jury for 18 months and we never had a target of an investigation in for testimony.
We would have everyone around the target that may possibly know anything about the alleged crime and make them testify.
The people who testified would sometimes say things that would cause investigation into themselves and possibly even get themselves added to the indictment or new indictments added.
Nope.
Not allowed to discuss any details.
I guess we could talk about whatever became public after it went to trial but there were several cases that I wouldn't want the accused knowing that I was a part of the Grand Jury that indicted them.
ELI5: Isn't a regular grand jury empaneled only for indictments just a special grand jury with extra steps?
What restricted the special grand jury from making indictments?
Why would they need a whole new and separate group of people to decide on indictments, who weren't part of the investigative jury?
The special grand jury, however, cannot issue indictments.
They can only offer recommendations and write a final report.
Although special grand juries are used less often, they can serve longer and are better suited to compel testimony.
- Which came in handy since Fani eventually subpoenaed basically the entire Georgia State government, Giuliani, Eastman, Lindsey Graham, and many other reluctant witnesses.
It's not known who will get charged, but the decision will be reached very soon.
That much is certain.
