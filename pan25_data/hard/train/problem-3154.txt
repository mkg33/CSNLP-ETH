And it wouldn't have even taken all the classified documents that Trump held in his possession.
Suppose any of us had a single document from Trump's "stash" in our possession.
We'd have been arrested and held in prison pending trial.
We'd be looking at a decade or more behind bars.
Trump didn't take the documents to blow the lid off of anything.
He hasn't tried to release any (to the public at least) to prove any point.
He seems to have just taken them because he thinks that, as the ex-President, he's owed whatever he felt like taking from the White House.
Except for the fact that Snowden took the classified documents for a reason and released them.
He also fled the US showing that he knew what the consequences were for his actions.
You can disagree with what he did or why, but he certainly had a reason beyond "I own these classified documents.
".
Yeah duh.
Arrest him, Clinton and pretty much every politician, Freemason, Epsteins list and so on.
Never gonna happen.
Justice comes in the ens though.
The way I see it, they've shown us that the justice system is not about justice.
So, fuck our justice system.
