Furhtermore, South Africa is part of the BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), a loose economic coalition that is seen as the primary rival to the G7.
This puts their economic interests aligned with those nations, to a certain degree.
What I know is that China is nearly as big a trading partner for India as the US - they're the top two.
We're talking about economic ties here.
And India has long tried to position themselves as a non-aligned nation, not part of the western bloc.
There are strong nationalist and anti-colonialist reasons for India to seek some breathing room.
This doesn't mean South Africa as a nation has a strong connection to Russia today, just that there is something of a residual familiarity.
This is what I find weird, Russia isn't even close to being an important trade partner of South Africa.
China, the US, the UK, Germany and Japan are your largest export markets.
You don't even import a notable amount from Russia either.
Western nations are by far a more important partner.
Of course, South Africa is also a large trading partner with many western nations.
So they position themselves between the sides.
