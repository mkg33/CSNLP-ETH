Variety: ‘Strange World’ Cast and Creators on the Disney Film’s Biracial, LGBTQ Character: ‘You Don’t Have to Normalize Normal.
It Just Is’.
But they’re just not doing that.
Why would they attack schools for the menial things that are actually happening when they can invent much scarier, more bizarre shit to complain about like litter boxes and strippers and get far more of the attention and anger they crave?
The thing is, schools just don’t know how to comply with the Parential Rights in Education Act.
I’ve followed this story very closely since Day 1.
This is the Deep South, there already weren’t many pride flags or pride month celebrations happening in schools when this legislation was written.
I have personally only found two accounts of teachers being fired, and one of them mentioned that they wound up just getting work in the next town over.
This bill literally didn’t do anything.
It was a performance, something Ron Desantis is a pro at.
The best way we can respond is by not letting it anger us, because that’s exactly what he wants to see.
That would be an interesting debacle, but I think that’ll just lead to the further perpetuation of hate and further alienation being both groups.
You just know The Quartering would publish that as “Liberals are literally SUING Southern schools for depicting heterosexuality as normal.
They are ATTACKING straight people.”.
The thing is, the Don’t Say Gay shit is unenforceable and they know it.
So far very few teachers have actually been punished for violating anything in it, because it’s so fucking vague that you could quite literally interpret it as “if you show the children a Disney movie where the prince kisses the princess, you’ll be fired.” It was never meant to actually do anything, because it’s much easier to just rile up your base and make them think you’re doing something about the problems you invented than solving any of the actual problems in this country.
