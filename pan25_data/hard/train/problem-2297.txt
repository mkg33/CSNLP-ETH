has been a common joke for decades- first by Soviets then the rest of the World.
It's usually brought up whenever their diplomats or leaders throw childish tantrums after some unreasonable demands are ignored.
I suspect the intended audience for these threats is mostly domestic, because no one else gives a shit.
tl;dr- US was well within legal right to down the balloon according the Chicago convention.
Even LegalEagle seems to agree, as it wasn't a light balloon and it was operating in another state's controlled airspace without their approval.
The gist of the exception is that you don’t need permission for weather balloons to go into other countries airspace, and those counties agree to leave the weather balloons alone unless they pose a safety risk.
TL;DR, Weather balloons don’t have to worry about sovereign borders.
Don't worry, I don't believe for a second it was an innocent weather balloon anyway.
Even if it was really just a weather balloon, China was still probably testing what it can get away with.
China began scrubbing all old news about balloons in the Chinese internet.
It's clearly hiding something.
