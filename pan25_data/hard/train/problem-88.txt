The longer of it is that Georgia law lays a number of significant election responsibilities at the feet of county authorities.
Some of those include:
"To instruct poll officers and others in their duties, calling them together in meetings whenever deemed advisable, and to inspect systematically and thoroughly the conduct of primaries and elections in the several precincts of his or her county to the end that primaries and elections may be honestly, efficiently, and uniformly conducted.
".
That's the full quote.
It doesn't matter that these people he was racistly calling rapists were illegal immigrants.
He called Mexicans who were coming into the country rapists and criminals because of the racist association between illegal immigrants and crime.
Racism is extremely systemic and pervasive in America, from instances like above to the previous president calling Mexicans rapists.
If you are tired of hearing about it, do something about the racism, not the people bringing it up.
If you're tired of hearing about racism, and tune out whenever someone mentions it, perhaps question why you do that.
It just seems like it racism if you listen to what republicans say about pretty much everything else.
lol “america isn’t racist but if it is, it’s against white people” is the least educated take I’ve heard in a long ass time.
and I live in FLORIDA my guy.
