There are obviously reasons to criticize certain words or actions of the current ruling Polish party, but your audacity about Germany allegedly beig "victim" here is mind boggling.
Polands rhetoric is not somewhat critical but so outside what is even slightly considered normal, that you somehow managed to have the right and left wing of our politicians agreeing that PIS is dangerously unhinged.
Quite the achievment.
I genuinely am curious how you are going to excuse calling the democratically elected chancellor of Germany a fucking NaZi, especially considering he is from the SPD.
I somehow very much doubt that you would care to know the different name off the minister if you read in the headline that some german minister insulted your country.
In my head they are both high ranking politician of a political party, which routinely insults, denigrates and provokes my country and the german people.
I really do not care what dimwitted fool spoke this, seeing as the party itself saw it fit not to intervene on his behalf for this incredibly stupid take.
