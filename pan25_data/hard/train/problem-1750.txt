I mean, not that the Tennessee police aren't doing a bang up job lately.
I can see this being a thing when it comes to transportation in a vehicle.
Every state has different and weird laws about how you have to transport firearms in a vehicle and what is considered "concealed".
yeah like they are making this out to be some extreme thing but if the state has permitted me to carry a handgun, what difference does it make if I have a carbine in my backpack?
The idea that someone could be permitted to legally carry their lawfully owned handgun but somehow is commiting a crime by carrying their lawfully owned rifle in the same peaceful manner is egregious and insane.
Worse, the shooter might be legally carrying himself, meaning there's no way to differentiate until after the shooting has started.
Even If they happened to nab the right suspect, out of the 11 people with automatic weapons in the crowd that day, they have to release him back into crowd, since he was doing nothing wrong, just in time for him to attack.
