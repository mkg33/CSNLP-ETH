US Air Traffic Control also has a union that isn’t allowed to strike.
At least we have paid sick leave and decent benefits, but we have a hard time trying to negotiate for things we do not already have (including safety related requests).
Your source won’t load for me, but I definitely question how many employers “give sick leave” but have their employees in similar situations.
While that’s definitely the lowest 10%, I would bet money on it being higher.
Yeah, that’s what the whole potential railroad strike was about.
The rail workers on call basically 24/7, 365 and denied time off to go get medical care, while also not getting any raises.
Most of the US doesn’t have sick leave, at least not the average worker.
It’s only a thing in white collar, management jobs.
Which is why legislation to prevent companies from doing that shit is so necessary.
The only time I ever had access to paid sick time while working for a corporation is during the height of the pandemic when you would get paid to stay home for 2 weeks with a positive test.
That’s just my experience, and anecdotes aren’t representative of the whole picture, but it’s not far off from what other people go through.
