It’s not weird.
It’s correct.
Bakhmut is only important in that the fighting in the ruins there keeps other Ukrainian cities like Kramatorsk safe and intact.
It’s been a long and bloody battle, which is in line with Bakhmut being one of the most fortified cities in eastern Ukraine.
This should point to evidence showing it is incredibly valuable to hold and incredibly strategic to both sides.
If the city succumbed earlier to Russian occupation, it either was not strategic, or Ukraine has larger issues amongst its fighting battalions.
The battle has been protracted and at great cost to both sides, with the aggressor seeing larger losses.
My prior comment was poking fun at the idea certain sources claimed that Bakhmut was of no strategic value.
Obviously that wasn’t/isn’t the case considering how many forces have been thrown at it, as well as how heavily fortified it is.
Just replied to one of your other comments regarding this same topic.
The city itself is worthless to the Russians, they want the area cleared so they can move their artillery in to position for further incursions westward towards Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.
