It’s entirely tied to income.
I know plenty of trust fund babies with £45k+ student loan debt, who never have to work a demanding job because daddy has it sorted and so that debt goes almost completely unpaid.
The interest levels are eye watering.
Straight out of uni I calculated I would have to be on £75k per year to just pay off the interest, obviously that number has increased year on year and I’m no where near it.
A typical 3-year Bachelors student will graduate with about £45k of debt , on which they will be charged above-inflation rates of interest (RPI + 3% typically).
It's worth noting that a Bachelors will be just under £28k in fees (fees are capped at £9250 a year), but that you will probably spend about the same again on living expenses over the 3 years.
Heavily depends as some may pay a bit more at £11k per year while others well over £30k per year, but yes international students pay more (average 2.5x).
I assumed the original comment was referring to tuition cost for the average student.
