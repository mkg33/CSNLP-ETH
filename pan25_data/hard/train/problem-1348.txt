New Year's is the most important family holiday of the year in both Ukraine and Russia.
Christmas was banned in the early days of the Soviet Union, and then secular Christmas traditions (the tree, gifts, songs and carols, large family meals, etc.)
were moved to New Year's.
In terms of social importance, it's equivalent to Christmas in Western Europe, the US, and other places that follow that tradition.
So while there's no cease fire rule, and it would be silly to expect any level of decency from Russia in this, it's still yet another particular evil.
And please, save yourself the trouble of "explaining" to me that terror-bombing, innocent-civilian-killing Russia bad.
The difference in military eligibility of targets on either side, or the ethicality of either, are not in question for me, but are, as I said, not relevant for my point.
But playing the "But not on Easter/Christmas/New Year Such bad Christians" card is pretty damn hypocritical, since Ukraine has zero qualms about striking Russian forces on the very same days.
Can't have your cake and eat it too.
Ukrainians are defending their country in the grand scheme of things, but for the sake of "Good Christians don't attack on New Year's Eve" it would be ridiculous to call a missile strike on a command center and barracks well behind front lines "a defensive action".
It's very obviously an attack.
