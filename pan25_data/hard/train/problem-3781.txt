This is the infuriating part for me: the idea that he thinks people should love him because he’s the fucking idiot that went to a protest and shot people, but it’s unfair to not like him for doing it.
Are you trying to tell me that a guy who thought he was providing security during a protest, who shot three and killed two people during said protest, and was acquitted on all counts against him, is delusional about who canceled his rally against censorship?
I don’t buy it.
That's what I don't get.
Why is this schmuck the poster boy?
Putting aside the argument over whether or not he did something wrong or whether he did the morally right thing, he still rolled up into a community he was not from and put himself into a situation he had no right, responsibility, or training to be a part of; he was an armed vigilante.
What happens when the next guy doesn't have the same luck or assumptions and privileges that Rittenhouse got and gets himself killed, interferes with a police investigation, and/or escalates a situation out of control?
Is this really the dude you're going to rally behind and defend?

Is Rittenhouse really the person we want to be holding up as a symbol?
