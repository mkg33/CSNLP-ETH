I just found how long he stayed with the trans jokes to be kinda weird.
I think all of us, every single one of us (the human race) are ridiculous and have things that can be made fun of but when you kinda make picking on one group the biggest part of your show it seems cruel.
He has the right to say whatever he wants, and I have the right to go "meh" and turn it off.
Yes, I can't stop watching the train wreck but I don't enjoy the interface or the content anymore.
I just feel like I've sunk too much time into it not to see it to the end.
Elon please, my wife and kids haven't heard from me in 7 months.
Just let Twitter die.
It's not a Twitter thing.
It's a well documented if ignored thing.
He actively swings down at a group that is widely considered (quietly) by law enforcement as "less dead".
But I just don't have the energy.
And it wouldn't matter.
We are few, and nobody cares.
I am angry.
Not with Dave.
But with the reaction.
More than that though, I am disappointed.
Victims of assaults and murders are usually ignored, because we don't matter to the rest of the world.
As for my mental well being?
I'm fine.
I can be use to something, and still be disappointed.
Palest person in the family, but apathy and disdain isn't new.
As my brother says, "Ain't nobody give a fuck about the red man."
Being trans hasn't really changed that.
Twice as ignored is still ignored, unless someone thinks that nobody is looking.
I just don't go out much without family, and stay tf away from cops.
