They just know one day Ukraine will run out of ammo, shells, men to pull triggers and money to buy equipment.
Theyre just wearing them down like they did the germans.
By DDay the Red Army was already in the Baltics/Ukraine and Poland.
It was well on its way to Berlin.
Im no fan of the Soviets, but with no disrespect to Western allied forces, DDay accelerated the fall of Nazi Germany, it wasnt the deciding blow.
I went off on a tangent.
The point is that NATo countries cannot print money for equipment forever.
That support will dry up, even if we want to support it to keep war out of the rest of Europe.
Tough economic times will force a reduction.
We are essentially balancing time, timing of resources, manpower, finances and fighting ability, some dwindling, some in abundance.
If the US enters a recession tomorrow, will voters want to send 10bn to Ukraine when everyone is feeling the squeeze.
What happens if Republicians take the white house?
Same with the rest of an already economically weak Europe.
How long can they get away with just sending surplus equipment?
Those are the questions to answer.
Ukraine is not taking light casualties.
For morale reasons they rightly do not publish them.
One would be foolish to think their ratios can be sustained in perpetuity.
Theres a reason russia is sending conscript and prisoners in untrained and underequipped.
For Russia it's the reverse and several factors combine together to show that Russia went to war with severely understaffed units.
The mobilization that their war doctrine depended on had never been tested and he predicted it would be exactly the disaster it is turning out to be in reality.
