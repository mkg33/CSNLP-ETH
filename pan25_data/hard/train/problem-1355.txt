As a result, Republicans were no longer able to draw egregiously gerrymandered maps that guaranteed their victories.
The commission instead drew a map that was fair to both parties.
As a result, Democrats were able to win control of the legislature for the first time in four decades!
This will be the first time since 1984 that Democrats will control the state legislature in Michigan!
And it’s important to note that this only happened because in 2018, voters in Michigan approved a citizen-initiated ballot referendum that transferred the power to draw voting maps from the state legislature to an independent redistricting commission.
Other states could use Michigan as a road map, but not every state constitution allows for constitutional amendments via direct democracy.
If we had to rely on the state legislature to get this done, none of it would have been possible.
Now we know that it's necessary to do so rather than write rules that they want the legislature to follow.
Laws are only as useful as the representatives who enforce them.
Murder wasn’t legal in the South during the KKK’s glory days, yet lynchings and pogroms still occurred with the active participation and approval of the local authorities.
