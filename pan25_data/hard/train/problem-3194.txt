I voted for him when he ran in 2015, but after seeing him being nothing more than your typical politician, with a rules for thee not for me, all talk no bark.
All I can say is I'm dissapointed.
His only saving grace is that compared to the other candidates he ran against in previous elections, he is only slightly better, which is a pretty fucking low bar.
The instant someone comes along that is slightly better than him, regardless of political party, he's out.
As someone who voted for him, he's better than the alternative (our current conservative party leader is a spineless weasel) but I'm not wild about him.
On the upside he's working to protect and improve our healthcare system instead of letting provinces pursue a US style system of money=care.
He's also standing up for minority/human/LGBTQ rights.
However, some of his policies are divisive, and he's wasting a lot of time and money on nonissues instead of dealing with the most pressing issues the average Canadian is facing.
He's not great for unity, and I think he has lost touch with (or just doesn't care about) the average Canadian.
I think it's also the fact that big/old money doesn't want NDP leadership because their policies tend to give workers a bigger slice of the pie.
Liberal/Conservative is safe, as they both help the big players (look at out telecoms).
