It sure would be nice that instead of responding to violations of personal freedoms with humor and memes, we all got angry enough to make these fascist fuckfaces stop eroding our civil liberties.
What a great time to have free speech so I can call the legislators who prioritized passing discrimination bills the pieces of shit that they are.
Also a great time to use the first amendment to protest this crap bill outside their places of work and outside their homes.
A ban on drag shows?
Really?
How about the Tennessee legislators go and fuck themselves.
Seriously, what a shitty state that will destroy their economy by being bigots and shitheads.
Not only for the profits they'll get, but also because they're stupidly racist & classist.
They want people living there to suffer.
They hate, from top to bottom, the entire idea of democracy, an integrated society, and everything which comes along with those things.
So pulling out isn't the way to fight this.
If anything this is the time to double down on staying in and making noise about how wrong this is.
Those behind this legislation want those corps to pull out.
They want the out of state visitors to go away.
They want the urban cores to go back to rotting and being slums.
