Loooool.
Regulation is non existing right now.
SEC is a joke and Wall Street are robbing everyone in day light.
Try go check the meager fines that are being handed out for all kind of fraud or look how little action is taken in crypto space.
We just had the biggest (or one of) company collapse in history (FTX).
Also it is in no way one of the largest corporate implosions ever.
Multiple larger companies failed during the 2008 crash, as well as more recent examples such as wework and of course there's also Enron, and probably lots more as well.
FTX was just noteworthy for the unsophisticated and blatant nature of the fraud, and for the fact that it punctured the image of the crypto industry among laypeople and financial journalists (who should have known better).
Fraud certainly happened with FTX, but let's not pretend that people in crypto have been fighting for regulations of exchanges.
FTX was not regulated because it was dealing with crypto.
Everyone hates to admit it but regulations are needed desperately in the crypto space but everyone is afraid it will harm how crypto works.
Plus crypto is a gobal asset making it tougher to regulate.
But if you do need to store millions, why would you store it in something as volatile as crypto?
If you don't want to invest it, you'd want to store it in something stable.
Why would gold be worse than bitcoin?
