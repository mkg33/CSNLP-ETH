The stunningly idiotic Russian take is not that Ukrainians can't physically (due to lack of ability) attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine....it's the stated position that it is MORALLY WRONG for Ukraine to attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine.
It is astounding.
"Don't you DARE attack our missile launching jets that we are using to wreck you mutherfuckers, your mothers, your children, your schools and hospitals.
You are morally obligated to let us kill you.
".
Good.
But the NYT articles today have been absolute trash today repeating how this is Ukraine "escalating" the war.
No dickheads, this is self defense hitting the military site that has repeatedly attacked Ukraine in an unprovoked war.
What is Ukraine supposed to just let itself get attacked again and again without response?
The only way the Russian narrative would be supported by Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil is if those attacks hit/ hurt civilians.
If they hit exclusively Military targets, then the citizens aren't gonna be sold that Ukraine is the bad actor.
The ones who WOULD buy the Russian propaganda that some Russian jets being destroyed is an attack against the Russian peoples are the same idiots that swallow all Russian propaganda without a thought.
About now, some russian big-wig will be telling his generals to redeploy antiair around critical resources in russia….
Maybe you shouldn’t have wasted all your missiles against ground targets, civilian ground targets, you imbeciles?
“But sir, most of those are already lost on the battlefield, and we used our antiair missiles against hospitals and playgrounds…did you mean to put up our balloon antiair toys?”.
