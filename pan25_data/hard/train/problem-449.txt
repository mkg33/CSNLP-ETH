Yeah Wagner nazis are shit, but remember which country did the exact same shit in Iraq, Afghanistan and many other countries?
Just remember that whenever you think of how shit these people are when they do it in Mali.
I do agree that whatever happens to Mali is something they need to manage on their own, for better or for worse.
Yeah lack of progress led many Malians to believe that the French were deliberately not trying to solve the problem hence the coup being accepted by Malians as better than the status quo.
The French started slowly withdrawing and then received a formal request to leave by the Malian junta, and that was the end of that.
They left for many reasons, that's just one of them.
The Malian junta refused to hold elections despite France's pressure, and public opinion in both France and Mali had started to turn against the operation due to its lenh.
I remember reading days ago that France left Mali because they opposed the junta's plan to ethnically cleanse the Tuaregs.
Is that true?
