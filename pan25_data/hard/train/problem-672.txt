This is very smart.
Venezuela oil reserves are twice that of Russia.
With Venezuela back in production, the entire world can live without Russian oil.
When we sanctioned Venezuela in 2019, we started buying Russian oil instead.
This is us switching back to buying Venezuelan oil after sanctioning Russia.
We're not pushing oil production from the US to Venezuela.
Venezuela produces a different type of oil than we produce in the US.
We can't easily use US oil in place of the heavier types of oil we get from foreign sources.
The US oil companies have cut back on domestic production of their own volition because a lot of them got burned by oil price crashes during the past decade.
They're scared of investing too much and losing a bunch of money again, so they're being cautious about ramping up production.
Meanwhile, they're raking in profits to make themselves attractive to investors again after a decade of poor returns.
We didn't move away from domestic production.
The US being a huge producer of oil is a relatively recent phenomenon.
A lot of our refineries were built before the US produced a ton of oil domestically, so they were designed around processing imported oil.
Those refineries never stopped buying foreign oil, even when domestic production took off.
It's not a new thing.
We've always been reliant on foreign oil to some extent.
SA still produces a lot of the world's oil and they help against US's enemies to an extent.
Of course there's money funneling in/out between the two country's crooked leaders; Venezuelan gov't is rather poor by comparison.
Money is power.
