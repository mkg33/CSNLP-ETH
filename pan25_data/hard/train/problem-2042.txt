Occupy Democrats spokesperson told PolitiFact this post was referring to changes to a rule about braking systems for high-hazard flammable unit trains.
Occupy Democrats claimed in a Facebook post, "Obama imposed stricter rules on trains carrying toxins.
Trump killed them.
".
The Obama administration enacted a rule in 2015 requiring high-hazard flammable unit trains to be outfitted with electronically controlled pneumatic brakes by 2023.
In 2018, the Trump administration repealed this rule, citing government reports that found the cost of requiring these kinds of brakes was not economically justified.
It is true, that Trump repealed railroad regulations that could have prevented or lessened the severity of the Ohio derailment.
Regardless, Trump lessened the regulation that would prevented this derailment instead of strenhening it.
You keep ignoring the part where despite the technicality that may have kept the railroad from classifying that train shipment as "high hazard," Politifact still rated their statement as mostly true.
You also overlook the fact that if the rule was allowed to stand, the chances are high that the train would have been equipped with the electric brakes anyway.
Operationally it would be cheaper to just use electric brakes on most train shipments, than to make a determination at each pull.
