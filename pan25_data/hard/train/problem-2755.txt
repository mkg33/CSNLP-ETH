When talking about Hitler it's probably not going to reflect well on your perceived sympathies by going down the "well at least he did something about the Jews controlling the media" route.
But you are still ignoring just how much was lost because of Stalin's management of WWII and trusting of Hitler etc etc etc.
Every time I hear reference of the losses of Russia in WW2 it makes me, someone who understands, blame Stalin and not Hitler for those losses.
I'm not saying that Stalin caused Soviet involvement, that he caused the calamity that WWII turned out to be for the Soviets.
It's so damned sad knowing that Khrushchev tried to overturn the cult of Stalin, told the world of his crimes, comitted to destalinisation and what does modern Russia do?
That's right, still worship the total pyschopath who in all measures and means, held back the Soviet Union and comitted some of the largest genocides the world has ever seen.
Hitler youth camps, concentration camps, prolific use of propaganda, killing the mentally ill and deformed, providing Putin with the “blood and soil” claim to invade Ukraine, I could go on…Hitler was the worst.
And this is before we go into the forced famines, industrialisation of the gulag system and other monsterous crimes, even getting them into the mess of WWII that the Soviet union experienced.
