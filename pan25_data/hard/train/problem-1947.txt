Do you expect Europe to do it?
They are not even on the same page as far as what to do with Russia or China.
If you don’t like black rock and whatever stipulations they may come to the table with, then call Germany/France.
Totally like they won’t have stipulations either, assuming they are even willing to bankroll it.
That’s how the real world works.
If post invasion they intend to rebuild, black rock is one of the few players who can pump Ukraine with billions of dollars worth of capital.
I'd much rather governments lend the money to Ukraine to rebuild in stead of some crusty old billionaire taking all the spoils once again.
Yes, I'd rather Ukraine get money from governments than private equity.
That is my main point.
Ukraine will never get money for free, but getting money from a sovereign country with its own currency (ex.
US) has a higher chance for better terms and the possibility of debt forgiveness/cancellation in the future.
It also (in theory) means you can avoid some of the issues I mentioned with private bailouts: a foreign government can't necessarily impose terms forcing you to privatize public goods, nor can it create local monopolies for itself.
