Does it really surprise you?
As a country, we have failed teachers with low pay, low protections, no rights, and overall made it so they can work elsewhere for less stress and more money.
The state government is doing everything they possibly can to encourage a teacher shortage.
This is a pattern you see across the southeastern red states.
Teachers are the new villains and schools are suspect.
I feel bad for the students and the teachers who suffer.
I spit on the admin who created and maintains this mess.
They have applicants all the time and refuse to fill the spots, it's like they think it's their money and are hoarding it.
Not like they get a bonus for saving money on salaries.
No reason why this should be so bad except extreme incompetence.
A few years ago my wife went through the motions to get the temp cert and all that.
She applied to multiple schools and had 2 interviews.
One what normal the other was very good.
The principal and the other 2 panel members said they loved her, they like her education, and everything was awesome but... Oh ya, you don't have any teaching experience so that's going to be a problem.
She did not get the job.
My wife worked at an elementary school in the library and the principal essentially used her as a teacher minus the pay.
She complained and even complained to the contact for her union/collective bargaining and they were like "well it's really hard right now for everyone so you have to do it."
My wife said fuck this and quit.
Fucking principal has multiple vacant teaching slots, had someone that wanted it, was like nah, but made her do the work anyway?
The fuck?
