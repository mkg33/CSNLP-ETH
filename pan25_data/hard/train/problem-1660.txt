Certainly still employed.
The US inspectors are assigned from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, though I think the last I read on the topic the Army guys take the lead (and they're explosive ordnance detail folks, so they know the weapons inside and out, even if the whole job is to take a picture of the bomb, check that the serial numbers match the page, assign a tamper-resistant inspection date sticker, etc.
).
...a treaty they're already in violation of by not allowing US weapon inspectors in to inventory their nukes.
Well they did keep up with the first part of the treaty so I would assume the USA will allow the inspectors in if they requested it.
We allow inspectors to come in to look at nukes as well.
We used to allow overflights for some nuke and other military inspections.
The "Open Skies Treaty" was started under Bush 41 and ended by Trump just after the 2020 election.
He also ordered the aircraft that were built for these observations destroyed, making it harder to resume if warranted.
