Majority of working age men and women didn't vote for it.
The only bracket in which tories are winning in any way are over 55s.
So it's boomers voting for leopards to eat their kids and grandkids faces.
As for Tories look like only party I just lack words for it.
I am poorer in my late 30s than I was in my mid 20.
It's schrodinger's brexit.
It at any given time you can point at something and say "This is why people voted brexit" or "This isn't why people voted Brexit" and be both right and wrong.
Brexit was clusterfuck of made up reasons that don't reflect reality and if something goes wrong people who voted for brexit just shift narrative to "This isn't why we voted brexit, here is other unicorn reason why and if that goes to shit we will shift narrative again".
I think brexit was stupid but itâ€™s disingenuous to pretend that there were not legit reasons some people might be disenfranchised with it.
Then why are the Brexitwat thought leaders so adamant there should never be another vote on the matter?
This is despite the steady increase of opinion against it among those who voted for it.
