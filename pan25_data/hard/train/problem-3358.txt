Being Australian it’s good to hear how much the UA like our Bushmasters, as that’s a home grown success story.
Doing great work over in Ukraine, and hopefully other govts will see how well they perform and start ordering them too.
I mean, we would provide exactly the sort of aid we're providing to Ukraine and possibly more besides.
But we would also be directly involved.
If Australia were to find itself invaded, we would be doing slightly more than providing military aid.
Australia must be thinking about deploying them offensively with forces overseas, which Australia has a long history of doing.
The intent of this purchase has to be offensive, with the idea of deploying them overseas in what conflict Australia may end up in.
Oh we do.
Our over-the-horizon radar is incredible and I was fortunate enough to do some work in the 1RSU control room at Edinburgh.
They can detect waves and wind, and if the atmosphere is optimal, see so much further past Indonesia.
Our coastline is so fucking huge that a few HIMARS are pretty useless for coastal defence.
There is just too much coast line to protect and they would not have the mobility or supporting road infrastructure to rapidly respond to any sea threat.
Not to mention that a land invasion is fairly unrealistic.
