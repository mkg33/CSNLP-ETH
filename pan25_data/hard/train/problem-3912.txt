if you think somehow the ignorant voters are going to suddenly replace ousted candidates with better options, then you are sorely mistaken, or you have such a low opinion of current candidates that you think "everything must be better".
It's pretty hard to believe that people are consciously voting for Johnson and a Democratic governor, AG, and SoS...so, if you ask me, I feel like the majority of people here are just morons voting for the incumbents.
agree with the other comment - all of these limits are just excuses for voters voting shitty people into office.
Gerrymandering affects statewide elections as well, because if the majority of your votes feels meaningless because of it, why turn out at all?
If Arkansas had more voter turnout maybe things would be different, but I understand how demoralizing it is living in a state where it feels like it doesn't matter if you vote.
I moved to MN last year, but before that, I spent my whole life in Arkansas and Texas.
With how sliced up the Little Rock district is now, it's even more of an uphill battle.
The crazies all won in our school district unfortunately.
Live in Central MN.
I'm not surprised, since the voting statistics are like 60/40 in favor of Republicans.
Yeah, in 2018, Republicans got 45% of the overall votes for state legislators.
It translated into a near super majority (they were one vote shy of a legislative super majority).
