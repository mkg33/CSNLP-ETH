Well a .50 BMG rifle isn't subject to any special restrictions in most states.
The M2 Browning yes, but the Barrett M82A1 semiautomatic rifle is completely legal in most states.
So it's pretty clear that only the first should be allowed to have unfettered access to guns, per the 2nd amendment and your definitions.
America has already deemed things like mini-guns are not allowed, so there's precedent on the type of gun allowed to be 'bared'.
So gun control wouldn't infringe on these interpretations as they stand from where I'm looking.
Yes, they do want to take away your semi-auto handguns because they can be carried and concealed.
Yes, they do want to take away your hunting rifle because it's still semiautomatic.
Yes, they do want your bolt action rifle because it's now a "military grade sniper rifle".
Yes, they do want your semiautomatic and pump action shotguns because you can still commit a mass shooting with them.
Yes, your revolver is now just as bad as the handguns they took away before and you can't have those either.
This coming from someone who doesnâ€™t even own one, but the ar15, (and similar small caliber fast guns) are a useful tool.
If the anti-gunners ever had their way we'd be left with muzzleloaders, falling-block rifles, and double barrel shotguns only.
They'd also love to copy the laws of some countries that don't have strong castle doctrine protections for defending yourself in your home, so even that lousy double barrel you have can't be used to protect your family without earning yourself a murder charge.
They will never admit that of course, and they know they aren't likely to succeed, but if they gain ground and keep gaining ground they won't stop at just "assault weapons".
Never give these people a single grain of sand.
