Communism doesn't even exist at large scale.
It isn't a form of government, and in fact one of the major tenants of communism is the abolition of government.
And don't take this as some endorsement of communism from me.
I am not, nor have I ever been inclined to believe that a communist society can function at any meaningful scale.
A Communist party in power, guided by and implementing Communist theory, is left-wing - even if it hasn't achieved whatever you think "REAL Communism" is.
To say "it can't be Communist if there's a state or authority" is nonsense and shows you don't know much about Communist theory.
there are so many people like you who will tell everyone "they don't know what communism is" without outlining or defining what makes China communist.
no one ever said China was communist simply because they claim they are.
there have been full-blown decades long initiatives to aggressively institute a more equal distribution of wealth in China.
one of Xi Xinpings main policies is the well discussed “common prosperity” policy, which itself has been a term with various implementations since Mao.
Pol pot was a “Maoist” with his own (psychotic) methods, therefor that’s two steps removed from communism.
