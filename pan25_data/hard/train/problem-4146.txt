They threatened everyone with nukes if weapons were sent to Ukraine, weapons were sent to Ukraine... and nothing happened.
They threatened nuclear terrorism with the nuclear power plant if Ukraine made a push for Kherson, Ukraine pushed for Kherson and liberated it...nothing happened.
They threatened nukes if Ukraine fired upon "Russian territory", Ukraine sunk their "flagship" of the Black Sea, fired missiles into Crimea, into Belgorod...nothing happened.
There were several threats to individual countries for their contributions to Ukraine like the UK, Poland...nothing happened.
There won't be nuclear war.
If they were going to use nukes they would have already used them by now, if we're going by their "threats".
So if every one of those cuts the pessimistic 2k missiles in half that's 250 full powered nukes, which is enough to end the fucking world.
Anti missle tech throws a wrench into a carefully balanced nuclear peace vis a vi mutual assured destruction.
Russia is afraid this gives US an edge in first strike capability.
Patriot systems are of course not suited for this but they fear escalation and another SDI arms race.
They don't like these type of systems close to their borders and I think made similar opposition to Poland getting them.
