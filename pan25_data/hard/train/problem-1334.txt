539bc Cyrus the Great freed all slaves, installed freedom of religion and established racial equality...
He freed 11 slaves from Missouri and helped them to Canada.
He also fought in Kansas against pro-slavery ruffians.
Two points: 1) being involved in Bleeding Kansas does not mean he was led slave insurrections.
Few if any slaves joined him, and he mostly just led his sons and a few others on terrorist raids that focused on killing pro-slavery settlers.
Key was a slave owner and anti-abolitionist lawyer and was angry that the British offered freedom to slaves who fought with them.
Key's third verse (which we don't sing) says "No refuge could save the hireling or slave from the terror of flight or gloom of the grave".
Taney's racist brother-in-law, Francis Scott Key, helped him get his chief justice position on the Supreme Court.
We should get rid of Key's racist song while we're at it.
We changed his song to remove the racist bits and at no point are we celebrating his racist brother in law, FFS...
