choose one, those aren't contradictory, but the notion of Israel being enabled if not outright created by the UN is a common one among their enemies.
if you want to be pedantic and absurdly detailed - Israel wasn't founded by the "Jews who won the war" but rather the Jews who lived in the mandate of Palestine since before it was the mandate of Palestine, as Zionist (as in Jewish people who advocate for a Jewish homeland in old Judea) settlements have been there since the ottoman empire, Ben-Gurion being the best example.
they formed the structure of what became the state of Israel, did the fighting since the 20s when the Arabs originally wanted to expel them.
Ha-Yishuv, look it up.
48 was the culmination, not the beginning of the existential struggle.
let's be even handed here, Israel is the UN's first project so everyone who opposes Israel tries to use the UN as if it was the fire of mount doom.
Holding Israel to a different standard is what is the problem here, during 2022 the UN condemned Israel 14 times (iirc) and Russia only 6 times?
Are you telling me that Israel's conduct warranted more than twice the condemnations that Russia got?
Did you know that only 45% of all UN condemnations are about Israel now?
This year Israel-Palestine almost broke the top 25 most violent ongoing conflicts!
They need to crank those numbers up.
