The Iranians in this movement are not asking for an American intervention.
Support to pressure Iranian government in the UN, maybe.
But even then that is sketchy because the Iranian regime has been trying to blame the movement on foreign meddling.
US intervention would even dull the revolution because those who are against the US meddling in their country might be turned away from supporting it.
To be perfectly fair, I would be disappointed if the U.S. was not taking advantage of the current circumstances to help influence a regime change, or at least distract the current regime from bombing our allies and developing nukes.
It's very likely that the U.S. is spreading propaganda, hacking, and indeed intending to destablize Iran, as it is most certainly in our best interests to do so.
The Iranian government have been making significant moves this year to make themselves strategic enemies of the U.S. and then all of the sudden this happens?
Cmon.
They definitely have will of their own, but a nationwide protest reflecting that will typically doesn't just happen on it's own.
The practice of manufacturing revolutions has been going on for hundreds of years already, Iran isn't immune to it.
That was before he'd ever made a peep about it but yeah, I definitely fell for the propaganda and don't just know what I'm talking about.
If you think geopolitics works anything like domestic politics or that governments determine foreign policy primarily based on their people's opinions and feelings you're wrong, That's ridiculous.
