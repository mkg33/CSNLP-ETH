Wish the players would join together, have a meeting and tell FIFA and Qatar that "unless you reverse the alcohol decision we will just play kick to kick for 45 minutes then another 45 minutes.
And of course there's also a question of whether it was ethical to ask Qatar to suspend their laws for the sake of football games, and whether it was realistic to believe them when they said they were fine with that...
It's just a really fucking stupid situation with a really predictable outcome, and FIFA doesn't give a damn about the fans because they got their money.
But to the world cup itself: It's a shit show, not only because of Human rights, but because they now seem to enforce their archaic world view on the guests.
Just to calm you down: As far as I know, nothing happened specifically with Qatar Airways.
It's just the airline of an authoritarian fascist regime called Qatar.
And most interesting is that they gradually imposed more and more rules in the past days.
Imagine people that are aware of cultural differences, but assumed the hotels/stadiums will somehow feel normal for Westerners.
And then you're on the plane and Qatar drops rules after rules.
