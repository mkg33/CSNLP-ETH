It’s pretty simple, really, you can’t generate motivation to change by making circumstances worse for people.
Mandate rehab all you want, it won’t get people to stay clean.
They’ll just adapt to living without your help.
All the tents in my city say that they have.
I say this as a guy in recovery 20+ years.
We don’t involuntarily hospitalize people here in CA unless they’re a danger to themselves, someone else, or gravely disabled (and that takes like serious self neglect).
A lot of people who are homeless are poor and unsheltered, not necessarily incapable of living in the community.
If they get into homes, most of them stay there and don’t fall back into the streets if they get support.
It’s more of problem of indifference to poverty here.
Everyone is expected to take care of themselves, and if you can’t, like the guy I responded to said, you must be addicted to drugs, crazy, and need to have someone take over your life.
You’re telling me people might not be able to care for themselves or make their own decisions when they’re addicted to drugs?
People don’t end up on the street because they’re depressed they end up there because they’re going through psychosis or have a drug addiction.
People with mental health issues who turn to drugs can't easily be stopped.
Especially if Vancouver sucks for middle and lower class.
The more you have marginalized groups the more drugs are going to kill.
Of course that's just a small part?
