It does boggle the mind what kind of a ghoul you have to be to even think this would reflect badly on Biden.
If it seems more intense with Biden, it’s only because it’s a mirror of how badly they have to compensate for Trump.
But it absolutely tracks that they’d try and make people believe that Bidens relationship with his children is as exploitative and criminal as the Trump family.
Trying to drag Biden down to that level is the most logical thing possible for them to do.
Horrifying, amoral, and disgusting - yes.
A sham?

Bingo They have been having wet dreams about democratic scandals coming to light or a democratic president resigning in disgrace for a long time.
They were so sure they finally had it with Clinton's blow job and they just completely lost if when it turned out that despite the prudery, no one outside of the most rabidly rightwing partisans gave a single fuck about it.
Clinton was very effective as president because he took a lot of workable rightwing ideas at the time to make deals and get compromises through congress.
