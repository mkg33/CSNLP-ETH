Of course it's extremely unlikely that any company in the EU only deals with Russia, so let's say that company had $10 million turnover in Russia but another $10 million in other countries throughout the world (even that number is so low to be extremely unlikely, but let's suppose).
That company would pay the 5% fine on all revenues throughout the world, so the fine would now be $1 million.
We'll have to see how the actual rule is enacted, if anything is enacted, but by the sound of it, I can't think of a stronger rule they could reasonably enact.
A fine of at least 5% of worldwide revenues is the strongest punishment I've ever read for a company in the post-industrial age.
The idea is to stop these companies from trading with Russia and this is a great way to do it.
There aren't many corporations that could come back from a hit like this.
Nope.
This proposal is a 5% fine on worldwide turnover, not net profit.
That means if your hypothetical company traded only with Russia and had revenues of $10 million, they would pay $500,000 and have a $500,000 profit.
If I trade for 10 million with Russia and nowhere else and make 1 million profit, my fine now is 5% of that, so 50000, and my profit is still 950000.
Doesn't it make more sense to additionally also fine them 1000 percent of the profits they made in Russia..?
Still... if my Evil Incorporated multinational creates a subsidiary that only trades with Russia, there is a problem.
Why not simply make the fine proportional to the crime?
