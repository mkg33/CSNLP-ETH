If you actually read the article, it cites people in touch with Biden referring to him as "Hamlet on the Christina River"...yaknow as in "Hamlet on the Hudson".
That's not speculation.
That's relevant information.
And that's just one thing in the article.
No, you're the one who spoke in absolutes and said the article said all signs point to yes.
Can you cite that?
Because this reporting shows that not everyone in Biden's orbit thinks he's running and some are comparing him to someone who famously didn't run.
These are not signs of yes.
Oh lmao, let me explain.
"Hamlet on the Hudson" was Mario Cuomo, who, multiple times, was leaning towards running for President while waiting until the last minute to actually declare he was running.
And ultimately, he decided not to every time.
There's a famous story about a plane waiting to take him to Iowa to file paperwork that he never got on.
So, political people close to Biden making that comparison is significant.
The authors state multiple times that all signs point to yes, that Biden has always taken a long time to formally announce these kinds of decisions, and that's there's just not an immediate urgency to announce now.
