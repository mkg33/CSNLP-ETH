⚡️In the area of ​​Kreminna, the Ukrainian Armed Forces resumed counteroffensive actions, while units in Vugledar continue to hold the city, - Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
- Russian counter-battery fire attempts to either suppress or knock-out the Ukrainian artillery that is busy dealing with the infantry swarms.
- The Russians send poorly trained, poorly equipped soldiers through pre-sighted Ukrainian artillery killing fields.
- Russian special forces with better training and equipment sneak through the less frenetic holes with less artillery coverage.
It appears that the situation with armored vehicles in the Russian 2nd Combined Arms Army is becoming critical.
This army is responsible for operations at Kreminna, and according to reports, they currently have only 127 tanks, of which only 90 are operational.
Of these, 72 are in position and the rest are in reserve.
Additionally, these tanks are spread out among various units, which means that infantry regiments may only have support from a few tanks (typically a battalion would have 20-30 tanks).
Most of these tanks are T-80s, with about 30 T-72s, and only one T-90 that is currently not operational.
As the leadership left Kreminna, they have called for the support of the VDV (airborne troops) who are currently building fortifications, while mobilization.
units are keeping the Ukrainian forces occupied, essentially trading human lives for time to rebuild defenses with veteran units.
