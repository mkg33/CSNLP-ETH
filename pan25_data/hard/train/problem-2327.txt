It doesn’t seem as if the United States government cares about their sovereignty.
They had their land taken from them, their water polluted and the number of women who have disappeared with no explanation or effort to locate them is horrifying.
That isn’t what I’m saying.
I’m talking about an elected representative from the Nation who is recognized as a member but who cannot vote on any laws.
They (the non-voting members) do actually get to cast votes in the Committee of the Whole (a committee containing all members), but their votes only count if they're not the deciding vote on the matter.
The GOP tend to revoke those voting privileges when they gain control of the House, and the Democrats tend to restore them.
Edit: Nope.
Looks like non-voting members don't vote on the Speaker.
That said, the current Cherokee Nation delegate is a Democrat, so it would give them an edge in a closely split House.
Members of Cherokee Nation, including those on reservations, still get to vote in elections.
They vote for their local congressional and senate candidates like anyone else.
