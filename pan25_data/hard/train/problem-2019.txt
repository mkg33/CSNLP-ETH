They HATE to admit to liability and breach of trust, bc that opens them up to financial restitutions that drain wealth back to the colonized.
Iâ€™m well aware that some tribal nations have negotiated concessions and reparations from the US over individual broken treaties and hostile actions taken by state and federal agents.
My tribal nation received the return of 225K acres of US Treaty Landback by President Nixon/Congress acknowledging their illegal termination & violations of our 1854 treaty outside of the ICC realm.
In addition, we have already won 1 SCOTUS decision in our favor and currently have another lawsuit pending right now on more stolen land which is yet to be decided (there is no dispute that the land was stolen, the issue pending is the return of that illegally privately deeded warranty land into US Fed.
Tribal Trust.
).
Here's the thing.
If you think that is somehow exceptional to America, or that Native Americans were not ruthless conquerors themselves, you are wrong.
You should really take a cursory reading of some of the treaties made with Native tribes before you continue to be violently incorrect.
Take a glance at the Treaty of Canandaigua/Pickering Treaty/Calico Treaty of 1794 where we restored over 1 million acres to the Seneca tribe and agreed to recognize their sovereignty and even give an annual payment of goods.
That Treaty was slowly ignored, and that land was explicitly stolen from native tribes.
No, not all American Indian Tribal Nations killed to claim land from one another.
There are 574 US Federally Recognized Tribes in the US and you cannot treat the history of all of them as a monolith.
Yes, many tribes lived peacefully together before colonists arrived and have undisputed land that was continuously theirs for 20K yrs.
