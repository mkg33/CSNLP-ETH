First rule of business is stop letting people do their own tax returns.
The IRS knows what you owe.
For the normal person we just put a bunch of numbers into a machine and it spits out a return that the IRS is like: “ok that checks out”.
Where billionaires can just claim a bunch of stuff, put in $0.00 and dare the IRS.
Make them pay their bill first and challenge the IRS if they think it’s wrong ( legal expenses paid to the IRS of they lose).
There’s evidence Trump also used the IRS to audit at least two people he didn’t like.
I can’t remember their names at the moment, but apparently the odds of them receiving that type of audit was super super low, so the fact that they both got that audit is very suspicious.
When I first started learning about government in middle school I had assumed working in ANY government position basically meant you had to submit every aspect of your life to be investigated and reviewed to make sure you weren’t doing shady shit.
But then I got to the government classes in high school to find out that presidents release their tax returns only as a courtesy and no other elected officials have to.
I remember sitting there incredulous and thinking that’s just insanity.
Why would you NOT want to check and re-check an elected officials returns to make sure they’re not doing shady shit?
Especially for elected officials, I think they need to be audited quite often to ensure that they are on the up and up since it is so easy for them to abuse their power for political gain.
For public office it is important to know if a preferred candidate is a crook or potentially compromised.
It was discovered that Nixon had been paying an unusually low rate of income tax, around 7% - much lower than many ordinary citizens who were earning far less.
Since then that committee has regularly reviewed presidential tax returns to ensure they’re being treated consistent with the tax code.
