Police need replacement/retraining, but you still need a uh, town guard to adress common crime.
There'll still be random crazies and DUIs for the time being.
The point of a police force existing is also basic deterrence to reduce the feeling of unchecked consequenceless lawlessness (even if there is say "only" 70% chance getting caught it make a lot of people rethinking crime).
The hell they can't.
A willing potus could tell the DOJ/FBI to parse their public social media posts and fire them on that by executive order; not hard everyone posting on a white supremacist group without a mandate as undercover =.
Yes the "militarized swat-only police" budget obviously need to be partly allocated to auxiliaries to descalate, medical assistance and so on.
And they shouldn't be above the law (re prosecuting the obvious gang & racist murders waved with a badge, leading neonazi mobsters to join in bulk to try to dodge the law).
But you still need at least some cops.
Even after booting all the neonazis & corrupt elements.
The neonazis cannot be booted.
American police grew out of slave catching patrols.
The institution is intentionally rotten.
There is nothing they solve that couldn't be better solved with fewer murderous side effects through another method.
