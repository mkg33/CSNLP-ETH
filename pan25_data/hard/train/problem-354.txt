You do realise that Ghana turned to China to borrow money is because no one is willing to borrow Ghana based on how bad their credit score is.
Yes, it affects ghanas credit rating but doesn't mean no one will be willing to lend to them ever again.
Ghana is still a sovereign nation.
They will only give up what they think is not worth the cost to attempt to retain.
China will likely get many things but ghana will still retain as much as they can.
China is probably very unlikely to mobilize their army to take resources from ghana.
I agree, I was saying china is unlikely to invade if ghana says no we won't give up our natural resources to pay you back.
Default means they will take a hit to their credit rating but that's a refactoring of risk, not a guarantee no one will buy their debt.
Well technically the risk of default is already priced in the interest rate.
So a high interest rate (which is collected by the entity giving out the loan) means a higher chance of default.
So actually you shouldnâ€™t be surprised if you get high interest and the other party defaults.
