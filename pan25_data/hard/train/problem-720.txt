It’s all masterful.
If someone told the Ukrainian people a few years back they’d be in a war now they may not have elected an actor/comedian, but honestly it has worked out well.
Wars aren’t just won on the battlefield - in the modern era they’re won in the press, in the chambers of diplomacy and in the morale of its people.
Zelenskyy understands this and is doing a great job, as far as I can tell.
Zelenskyy isn’t dumb.
He knows his PR role right now is almost as important as his national government one.
He needs people to not forget about or get fatigued hearing about him.
Without US/NATO support; Ukraine alone would be in a precarious position.
Not suggesting Zelenskyy has anything other than good intentions here, but I think he and his team know how critically important “connecting the dots” is important from a “your support -.
Or the soldier was asked to do it, in order to connect it with the US visit that was already planned.
Some senior office knew this was coming and absolutely asked some local soldiers to give him a flag today.
They knew.
Ukraine is so fucking good at the information war that it is actually fucking insane and I love them for it.
