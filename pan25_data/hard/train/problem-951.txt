If we flip it around, it is Capitalist for the employee to be able to leave their job for any other at anytime.
Doing so would raise wages and make employers fight for talent.
The fact we Don't have Universal Healthcare is anti-capitalist by nature.
It's hard to imagine how much better our society would be if everyone had Medicaid.
The level of improvement in our health statistics would no doubt be immense.
My only complaint is that dental and mental health coverage was basically non-existent.
I'm doing well now, working in tech.
In theory I should have amazing insurance compared to most people.
I miss Medicaid.
Now I have copays, coinsurance, deductibles, and recently had trouble getting something approved.
I also literally had all the same doctors with Medicaid, so the standard of care was the same, which is quite high.
After I had surgery they called me to check up on me, made sure I had someone to care for me at home and transportation to follow up visits with my doctors.
Can you imagine an insurance company doing that?
They'd rather you die in the OR and stop costing them money.
