That is a crazy reach considering all of the trials and criminal probes hes under right now.
And the fact that he's already had a criminal conviction against his namesake company and the NY AG pretty much has him strungup.
And the special counsel has not slowed things down, has only ramped things up AND is officially sharing info with the 1/6 committee.
The complexity lies in ensuring an unappeallable conviction.
You have to annihilate ANY and EVERY possible defense that can be brought by his team to convict beyond a reasonable doubt.

The process takes so long because they cant afford any mistakes here.
They asked what was so complex.
Have you seen the fuckery the last Trump appointee made a la Aileen Cannon?
That answers the question.
People like her make this complex.
Oh man, come on with your "complex".
Surely directing an armed mob towards the Capitol and encouraging them to fight like hell (with numerous injured and several dead as a result) should be covered by freedom of speech?
The DOJ is primarily guided by careerism, not by the law.
