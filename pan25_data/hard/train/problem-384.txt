Now that they’re using USSR stock, I don’t think it’s going to fair better against “newer” NATO equipment.
Nah it's more than adequate for what Ukraine needs, not necessary to send S tier weapons when older tech does the same for less risk and cheaper for the US government.
I reckon, if there was ever the occasional experimental weapon sent, they would not be left for Ukraine to use.
It would be operated by US forces, so if it was ever at risk of being captured, it would be self destructed.
No way would they let it get into adversaries' hands (the only way they would have any advanced tech).
Better ways to test it than in a highly active war zone with the greatest US enemies nearby.
I would bet anything the US keeps its best stuff at home and never shows half of what it really has.
Let alone the experimental stuff that never gets seen.
Why would they send their best stuff?
The outdated equipment is already miles ahead of anything most countries have, and they would need to be trained to use the newer stuff whereas the old tech is already used by others.
Okay, if our military equipment is outdated then we'll just fund, engineer, and produce even more deadly ones.
That's basically what he's asking for by saying this.
I mean technically he's right.
Our current Air-Defense is outdated.
But it's apparently still more modernized than anything Russia has shown so far, plus we are actively researching upgrades.
The second we have a viable replacement for the Patriot system it'll be gift-wrapped for whoever would like it.
