Which is of course vague enough and make believe enough that Russia can say those conditions have/haven't be met whenever they want.
They ought to try and take the few conditions Ukraine is willing to accept before they end up with no conditions left.
The unrealistic idea in their heads that Russia will ever retain direct control over any portion of Ukraine proper, by force, needs to die.
One of the risks for Ukraine is a loss of popular support, and it is certainly something that is currently not helping Russia.
Ukraine should be the only ones setting the terms, and I think that letting Russia hand on to its previous ill gotten gains even temporarily sends the wrong message.
It would be completely unreasonable for Ukraine (or anyone else) to negotiate with russia because there is zero reason to trust them and zero positive outcomes in doing so.
Ukraine already tried negotiating with russia when they gave up their nuclear arsenal in exchange for the signed agreement that russia wouldn't attack Ukraine.
People who suggest letting Russia have parts of Ukraine, or that we shouldn't be supplying the equipment Ukraine needs, for fear of escalation or dur to inconveniences caused by Russia are enter knowingly or unknowingly helping Putin.
A lot of the posturing by Putin and his cronies that is intended for consumption outside of Russia is an attempt to make people give up on supporting Ukraine, either by trying to convince people that Ukrainian defeat is inevitable, or that Putin will punish those countries that support Ukraine.
