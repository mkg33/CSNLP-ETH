At whatever level, monopoly is bad and competition is good.
Its good for african countries if they can get china and the US to compete for the best deals.
That is one reason China has been a positive for Africa.
Prior to their involvement most of the 'aid' came from the west, and since there was no alternative, western aid didn't accomplish much developmentally and was used to create dependency on the west.
Much of the aid was stolen or misappropriated with full knowledge of the aid organizations.
In addition a lot of the aid was used on minimally effective projects, i.e.
sending 'experts' to lecture Africans about this or that.
China comes along and starts building infrastructure, sparing Africans the lectures and instead constructing things with higher valued-added projects.
So the west either has to match what China is doing or lose influence.
Hopefully this competition can be helpful to Africans instead of merely serving the interests of foreign powers.
I always wanted us to foster better relations with the African countries.
Itâ€™s a massive continent full of resources and people that could add to the global economy.
Granted, Africa is probably tired of the West and Europe involving themselves in their affairs but if we can provide resources and training to the people for industrial jobs, their economy and people get the benefit and we get trading partners who have more to offer the US and the World.
