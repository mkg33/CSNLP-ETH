So, yeah this inquiry is just nonsense to try to make Biden look bad.
But portraying it as these guys having a boner for Hunter dick pics is terrible journalism that pointlessly fuels division.
I just wouldn't find this surprising.
In the end, these moderation decisions are being made by people, and it seems reasonable to believe those people are more liberal than conservative.
They have no major reason to be perfectly unbiased, so I'd assume moderation came down heavier on right-wing stuff than left-wing.
There was reporting on how Twitter handled the banning or suppressing posts by more right-wing users.
Conservatives claim that Biden forced twitter to censor the story.
But Trump was president at the time, and Biden's request was to remove the dick picks, and that's in line with twitter terms of service.
The current hubbub is because the Biden folks asked twitter to remove the pictures of Hunter's dick as that broke Twitter TOS.
I think what they care about is that president Biden somehow abused his power to get them taken off Twitter?
But revenge porn has always been against twitters TOS.
