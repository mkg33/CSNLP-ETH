A remote operated drone is fundamentally no different regardless of how many bells and whistles you stick on it.
It's a gun operated by some guy WAY over there.
Also that's an absurdly shit design, a hot day would result in the drones breaking themselves to pieces on trees.
But looking at it now from a real life perspective, yeah, the design of the drones was really bad, tho they did recharge with sun light.
Better not even mention the flaws of the fortresses... they'd be fodder in a war today, not even fit for static defences.
They were described as only a little larger than a humming bird but would attack in the hundreds on one target and if they found a large group of targets were able to call for more drones.
Imagine the drones that identify people and armour sending telemetry (aotomatically) to call in more drones or artilery.. You could coordinate a strike of 1000s of artilery and drones to hit in the same few seconds.
Just imagine fairly small fixed wing drones armed with automatic 40mm granade launchers flying over enemy trenches and automatically enganging once they spot enemy soldiers.
No EW will help because drone is on pre-planned path and is capable to make his own decision to engade.
