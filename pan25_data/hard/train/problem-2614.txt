Nevada Senate - CMM trails by almost exactly 9,000 votes, but the expected margin of the remaining ballots should put her comfortably ahead.
She is relatively likely to gain the lead in the next batch of ballots from Clark County and if she does, she isn’t going to lose it again.
75-80% chance of beating Laxalt at this point.
Arizona Senate - Multiple outlets have already called for Kelly.
There is virtually no chance that Democrats don’t win here.
From the Republican point of view the Senate is already lost... the runoff won't change the majority leader so what's the point?
The GOP didn't get a red wave (They even lost the Senate haha) and couldn't even celebrate on election day because it's so close.
When it's called that they will keep the house it's going to be such a wet fart of a victory for them hahahahaha.
One beautiful thing about the election taking so long is it totally deflated the gop's expected election night celebration.
It's just a grueling sad long painful red mist at best.
