Basically the article centers around reports from Vadym Skibitsky, who is Ukraine's deputy military intelligence chief, and Andriy Chernyak, who is a Ukrainian Military Intelligence Service representative.
Ukraine estimates that Russia has 280k troops in Ukraine, so a mobilization of 500k would represent a huge escalation.
The new infusion of manpower will massively increase the number of soldiers Russia has deployed in occupied Ukraine.
The Ukrainian military is warning that Putin is planning to mobilize up to half a million new troops.
The Ukrainian military is warning that Putin is planning to mobilize up to half a million new troops in preparation for a new offensive in Ukraine.
What they're claiming is that Russia plans to mobilize 500k troops for a spring offensive and what they believe is that if that offensive fails, it will lead to the downfall of Putin.
None of that is guaranteed to lead to Putinâ€™s downfall, but the possibility of it increases as this war drags on and he brings more troops into it.
Russia has to mobilize more forces, they're not getting anywhere, so I very much believe that portion of it.
The 500k number is dodgy and could be exaggerated or not.
But the article also states that these conscripts would mainly be taken from cities, which would be the opposite of what we've seen so far, in Russia taking more etchnic minorities in the rural states, and shows that at least some of this is untrue.
Maybe if these (ethnic Russian) new conscripts, from bigger cities are forced into bad situations, sentiments in Russia can change politically around Putin.
So, unfortunately I think Russian patriotism and propaganda will be stronger than any audible dissention, left in the country.
