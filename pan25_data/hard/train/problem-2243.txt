At one point I was considered insta famous back in the early 2010’s.
It’s all for nothing because it means nothing.
Reddit, Instagram and Twitter likes / retweets are some of the most pointless metrics in life unless you’re actively shilling shit.
Sure people talk crazy shit on twitter but it is the same as most popular social media.
You can’t just ban it all just because you don’t like the owner.
I don’t think the government can do anything to Twitter, as long as it is not about data breaching, privacy, public safety or national security.
After all, it is a private company, and now it is more private than before.
And then they were a public company.
Anyone can buy into a public company, they have no control over who owns publicly traded shares.
The Saudi stake had to essentially be bought back once it went private and to do so that would have involved direct negotiations with Musk.
Also, Twitter has been on essentially probation with the FCC since 2012 over data privacy issues, those don't go away just because it changed ownership.
