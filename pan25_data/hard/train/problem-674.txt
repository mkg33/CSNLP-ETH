Yeah, I mean, realistically those are the stakes here.
This will go on either until MAGA Republicans abandon their movement to vote centrist, until centrist republicans realize it's MAGA-way or the highway and vote for an actual nazi, or until centrist republicans vote for the Democrat.
The Republicans voting against McCarthy are far right and see him as the establishment (tl;dr he isn't batshit enough on the Trump stuff for them), so the defectors would have to come from less far right GOP members currently voting for McCarthy, but it could happen!
I just realized something: Republicans are going to blame the Democrats for obstruction of the Speaker, because they keep voting for their candidate, instead of allowing the House to do its job by making a compromise with McCarthy.
If it was moderates voting against McCarthy, who is extreme in comparison to prior GOP house speakers, I'd call it moral, but this is just the far right being completely disconnected from reality.
Is it really Morale or is it just the insanity of what is now known as "the freedom caucus," formally the Tea Party caucus.
I mean these nuts are voting for Jim Jordan instead.
They just had the poorest showing for a mid term for a party opposite a first term President in modern history.
Moderates on both sides did best in swing districts, and many democrats win Republican leaning districts because of extreme right wing candidates., and the representatives aligning with all those losing candidates want to take their Party further in that direction?
