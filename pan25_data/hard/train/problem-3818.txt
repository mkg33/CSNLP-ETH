I've been noticing it's like every week or so, another minister, cabinet member, judge, or government official is sacked.
In nearly every case, non-government Ukrainian-based news sources can point to specific acts of corruption from these officials.
Edit: corruption exists everywhere, my point was more to question the capacity of the patriotism to really improve things in Ukraine.
You see this in tons of countries, including the US, and even if we assume Zelensky is completely genuine in his desire to fight corruption I'd wager Ukraine is decades away from any sort of results on that.
You'd have to battle the mechanisms by which corrupt people end up in the positions they are, foster a culture of holding corrupt people responsible for what they do, strong laws aimed at preventing corruptions and courts actually willing to prosecute.
The core of the corruption here are the courts: we have tons of thoroughly corrupt judges (some are even from Yanukovich times) in key positions that make it hard to get rid of it, and they're the reason that charged felons get away from punishment even after special anti-corruption police takes them to the court.
People forget that there are two types of corruption: the "day-to-day" one ("побутова" in Ukrainian) that's basically there to allow people to cut annoying bureaucratic corners or avoid some minor fines etc., and "systematical" one, where we talk about the big business intertwine with politics, or government employees extort business.
The first one was a plague in USSR and still haunts most of ex-USSR republics, but this is precisely the type that was mostly dealt with in Ukraine.
