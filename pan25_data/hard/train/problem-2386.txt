Only if they were to go really in-depth on it.
After all, that's all part of intersectionality, which would be an important topic in an African American studies class.
This is meant to be the the equivalent of a college 101 course, which is meant to introduce topics that fall under the umbrella of African American Studies.
There are queer black historical figures, and it as issue that African Americans and the USA at large have been grappling with.
So again what does that have to do with African American history.
Lol I took African-American studies in college and this was not a topic.
We learned about the history not about sexual orientation.
Let me say it slower.. Queer theory.
Queer theory is a way of thinking that dismantles traditional assumptions about gender and sexual identities.
That has nothing to do with African-American history.
This course is African American studies, not just history.
Furthermore, African American culture has its own unique history and practices in regard to "gender and sexual practices that exist outside of heterosexuality".
