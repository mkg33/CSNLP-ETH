Yep.
The USSR made the Alpha sub out of titanium.
That let it dive deeper and travel faster then US counterparts.
But it was incredibly expensive to produce.
In 1968, 1 Papa sub prototype cost 1% of the USSR's GDP.
So the US just made torpedoes that could destroy the new USSR sub.
The USSR never was able to mass produce the titanium sub panel so they were all custom hand made pieces.
Most US subs had hulls made from HY-80 steel, the SeaWolf used HY-100 steel and is rumored to be able to dive just as deep as the titanium USSR subs.
The Alfa class (Soviet sub) is the only submarine ever built with a titanium hull.
The US has only ever used steel hulls.
The titanium hull performs better in every metric, but welding titanium on the scale that you'd need to for a submarine hull would be INSANELY expensive, and that's not even factoring in the supply chain issues the US would have to overcome to source the metal.
You have to have a noble gas filling the facility you're welding in to keep reactions as inert as possible throughout the process.
Titanium is highly reactive and will become brittle if you weld in a normal environment.
And you have to constantly check during the process whether or not embrittlement has occurred.
Humans can't breathe Argon so every welder (and inspector) has to have a personal air source inside the facility while fabrication is happening.
Welding titanium is INSANE.
