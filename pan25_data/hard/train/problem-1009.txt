I think it's because there were more significant things going on in that timeframe - from the use of nuclear weapons to internment camps for Japanese Americans.
But the point of contention isn't with sanctions in general, but with them not being targeted at the government or even the government's economy.
Even if Russia decided to sanction Washinon, it would still be weird to target McDonalds over this.
What do burgers have to do with the US government's policy?
I think the way you're presenting the situation is muddled.
Like, no one here is arguing that it's the first time sanctions are being used.
And what's interesting here is not that the sanctions are being used at all, but that they target a person, not the country, the money is being spent, not frozen, and the US isn't even at war with Russia (while it was at war with Japan).
Or the Japanese were hated by everyone, so acknowledging this would mean the Western sanctions on Russia by no means set some kind of precedent, and US can't be reliably told to be abusing their power.
The only thing that's new is it's the first time they've been imposed en masse on such a (comparatively) large economy.
Sanctions, however, have been used throughout history.
