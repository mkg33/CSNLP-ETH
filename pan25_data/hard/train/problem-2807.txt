Not necessarily true.
Most Russians say they are apolitical because it’s literally illegal to say you don’t support the war.
So people just say they don’t care about politics at all to strangers.
At least, this has been my experience as a Russian.
I gotta say, though, I am surprised that there are so many people supporting the war.
I was surprised too at first, but a comment someone gave me said "Propaganda can be considered as a weapon."
Which is true.
Propaganda is a weapon.
One of the fathers of modern advertising, PR and wartime propaganda is .
He took the groundbreaking research of his uncle, Sigmund Freud, into the working of the human mind and twisted it.
Bernays applied his uncles research to PR, advertising and propaganda.
Bernays wasn't the only one though.
In a perverse and twisted way it kind of is though.
There will be ultra nationalistic Russians who believe the propaganda and/or want Putin to restore the Soviet Union to make their lives better who sadly agree with this action.
Sorry, at this point if the Russian people aren't intelligent enough to sort out their country, any punishment they take for allowing Mini-man Putin to remain in power is on them.
Fix your shit.
