Pretty sure they were facilitating FSB operations anyway.
That's without taking in account, I assume, all the pro-Russian preaching in Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk.
This bit if news concerns the Russian Orthodox Church, which very much acts in concert with the Russian government.
The real comparison would be if the Pope declared war on a country and actively preached for it to be invaded.
Would that country be justified in limiting the practice of catholicism?
Of course it would.
The Russian Orthodox Church is supporting the enemies in a real war.
It is hostile to Ukraine's very existence and celebrates a murderous expedition.
Its status as a religious organization does not make it special.
This should he celebrated as a win for secularism.
It's not about secularism, it's about human rights.
The right of Ukrainians to practice Orthodoxy is threatened here.
Since when did the Western liberal support stomping out people's rights?
Not every Orthodox church is in lockstep with what is happening in Moscow.
