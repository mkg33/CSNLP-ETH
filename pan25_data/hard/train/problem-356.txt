Highly unlikely that the libertarian voters choose to side with Walker.
Chase Oliver is a pride-attending trans-ally, his voters will either stay home or vote for Warnock.
Further, I’d be interested to see the number of people who went to the polls for Kemp and simply voted (R) just because they were there.
Those voters are also unlikely to return for someone like Walker.
I think Kemp not being on the ballot will really hurt Walker though.
No reason for R-leaning independents to really show up because the only thing Walker stands for is banning abortion entirely and that is, as we’ve just seen, incredibly unpopular.
It’s been a day; things are just starting.
Dems are gonna go all out for a 50/51st seat, especially looking at such relatively spectacular midterm results.
There’s actually a good chance that democrats will already control the senate before the election.
I think that likely helps Warnock, as a lot of republicans in GA are not excited about voting for Walker.
I live in GA and can confidently say that the people who voted for Walker know he’s not qualified.
They don’t care.
They just know he’s running as a Republican and that he’ll vote exactly the way his Republican puppet masters tell him to.
That’s all they care about.
These are same morons who re-elected do-nothing Kemp.
Four more years of no Medicaid expansion.
Yay.
This state is ridiculous.
