Don't forget the illegally conscripted Ukrainians in occupied Russia being forced to fight and die against their countrymen (mostly die because Russia uses them as cannon fodder), cause what Russian dictator doesn't love a good old war crime!
BTW, the war against Ukraine was always justified with Ukraine "historically" belonging to Russia, so it's not like the ideology is completely ahistorical in the sense that it doesn't reference former glory.
Even the Soviet Union is still somewhat of an implicit rallying point, though rather in the subtext, it's no coincidence, that Russians brought a whole bunch of red flags to Ukraine.
Russia and Russian nationalists has also been pretty upset about the "loss" of Crimea ever since the collapse of the USSR.
They haven't been able to shut up about it ever - it's why you hear all these things about how "Crimea was really a symbolic gift to Ukraine, it was really Russian" or other bullshit talking points.
"Retaking" Crimea was a big win domestically for Putin and is part of his actions to "fix" the wrongs that he sees various Soviet leaders as having committed.
Notice that Putin explicitly does not call for the return of the USSR, but rather the unification of the Russian people.
The claim that he makes is that they are an innocent people who, through no fault of their own, were separated by decisions imposed on them by the incompetent final leaders of the USSR.
