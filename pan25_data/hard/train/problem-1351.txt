Proximity to Whiteness matters in the US.
Which is how you get an Amy Barrett versus a Ketanji Jackson.
Conversely, this is how you get a Hershell Walker versus a Raphael Warnock.
Work twice as hard, be twice as good to get half as far and still have your competence questioned...the reality of being a Black professional in the US.
When considering who has it harder between Black men and Black women, I think it's really a question of which one has greater proximal power (proximity to Whiteness).
Their point is that being a woman is belonging to another marginalized community, and the intersection of race and gender has a greater impact than either of those factors on their own.
Black women face barriers that Black men do not, and have to work harder than their white counterparts and male counterparts.
There’s a reason a common sentiment is that Black people have to work twice as hard for half as much.
A Black woman has to work 3x as hard at least.
She’s overqualified to be on the court.
That would just overload the courts.
They'd still have the authority to issue rulings, they just wouldn't be able to strike down laws.
They would just continue to ignore those laws every case, citing them as unconstitutional every case.
