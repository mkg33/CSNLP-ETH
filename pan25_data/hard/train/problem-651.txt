Because it convinces their idiot voters that they are actually "Doing Something".
They are incapable of the critical thinking that would tell them that Republicans are all evil and not acting in the interests of anyone not in the 1%, so Republicans have nothing to fear, Ever.
Republicans are always doing this performative bullshit to rile up their base, even if it wonâ€™t go anywhere.
Sadly it seems to have some effect on republican voters.
Democrats need to start playing the same game, they should propose that all of the former confederate states just be turned over to African Americans as a form of reparations, it will be illegal to assign gender to children until age 21, and all republicans are now required to drive to the southern border and pick up a family of undocumented immigrants and give them housing.
Also federal minimum wage is now $175/hour.
Also all school children (public, private and home schooled) are now required to pledge loyalty to satan every morning.
Finally, Florida shall be turned over to Cuba.
