Also the wind farm you talking about is 20 years old and needs to be decommissioned and will be rebuilt in another spot with a bigger and more efficient wind farm.
The current government renegotiated the deal with the mining company recently.
They now moved the deadline for coal from 2038 to 2030.
8 YEARS earlier.
Also the mining company previous planned on bulldozing 9 villages and smaller towns.
That is now reduced to just this one village.
So the government made the best out of the situation and negotiate a better deal over all.
To be honest looking at how no government seems to really care about it, I don't think we will solve it anytime soon.
With measures taken in the west we might delay it a bit, but not for ever or solve it completely.
Life in the global south will be worse than today, and as long as we choose EVs to be a savior, even tho today they create far more CO2 in their supply chain than they can set off after being build, we will not solve anything.
It's not illegal.
But the rule of law applies to everyone, even the company you don't like.
They own the land, which they bought from the landowners.
They have permission from the government to dig for coal there until 2030.
So when you go there and occupy the area the police can and will eventually remove you if the owner of that land wants it.
And throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at the police is not a peaceful climate protest.
It's a climate and social justice protest.
If media wants to cherrypick news about famous individuals, they should at least get the context right.
Otherwise it's to be considered click bait even more as normally.
