She’s so pathetic.
She looks at one party advancing the rights of all people and passing some of the largest bills in such a long time while the other party toils in its recent failures and is inundated with racism and thinks “fuck really neither of these two will work for me.” Absolutely, woefully, and pathetically a coward and money-corrupted politician.
She was a green party member who switched to Democrat to pretend to run as a progressive and then proceeded to block and hold up important legislation on behalf of Republicans for two years and now she's an independent.
Well she's going to continue caucusing with the Democrats if she wants to keep her committee assignments, so functionally nothing will be different, and she'll probably keep voting as she has been.
Really all she's accomplishing is laying a trap for the DNC come her election time, trying to shield herself from a primary by playing spoiler.
Her most likely strategy is to effectively blackmail Democrats into foregoing nominating their own candidate and throwing their support behind her, similar to what the party did in Utah with Evan McMullan.
That's pretty much the worst option.
Unless she's an even bigger idiot than she's proven herself, she'll still caucus with the Democrats.
She'll just be a royal pain-in-the-ass while doing so.
Everyone in the Democratic party already hates her (and those who didn't certainly will now after this stunt), but they'll put up with it.
All a spoiler candidate has to do is peel away a relatively small percentage of Democratic voters--or independent or Republican voters willing to vote for a Democrat--and she throws the race to a Republican.
