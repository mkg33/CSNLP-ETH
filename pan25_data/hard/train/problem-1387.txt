This article looks like it was written by a third grader, the conclusions have nothing to do with stated facts and the comparisons are lame.
It's an icbm.
Not a particularly special one beside the ability to do fractional orbital bombardment, just a missile.
It's capable of lifting ten tons into a ballistic trajectory, meaning it can deliver nuclear payloads up to 15 light mirv warheads.
The rockets speed and range have nothing to do with warhead yield.
You have to drop it out of an aircraft because it’s way too big to fit in a missile.
You can’t fly bombers over war zones anymore, they’ll be shot down way before they’re in range to drop bombs.
Except they don’t have a warhead that large in service so if they ever finish that piece of shit it will be in the 5-25 megaton range.
The U.S. only has a single type of warhead (the B83) over a megaton because it’s just not necessary and more precise targeting (as seen with the W88 fusing) is preferred.
SIOP-62 type overkill is assigning many warheads per target to assure high probability of kill whereas a 50Mt nuke only serves to suck up resources and delivery platforms.
Assuming detonation, a 50Mt bomb does not offer appreciable target destruction assurance over a weapon in the single megatons for almost every circumstance.
What would offer improved target destruction assurance is more bombs/warheads so penetration chance for a given target is higher with multiple independent platforms assigned to it (and so they can cover each-other increased the PK of each of their original unitary targets).
