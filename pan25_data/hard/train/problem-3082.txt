I really wish democrats would stop calling republicans conservatives while there might a be few real conservatives in the republican party they mostly in mass could care less about conservatism.
free speech means that the government has no right to regulate speech unless said speech would severely impact the public good the last part has been adjudicated in the supreme court and added on but essentially only such speech that would (not could) lead to violence or national security of the highest order does the government have the ability to stifle speech in most cases.
But free speech doesn't mean you have the right to face 0 consequences for what you say, it merely just means the government itself can't ban your speech or hold you accountable (within reason ofc, like you can't insight a riot) for what you say.
Something something private sector, can't remember what conservatives always say about the private sector...
Even if it was for revenge or to create an atmosphere where conservative ideas can thrive, banning anyone with opposing viewpoints goes against free speech.
The freedom of not associating with high risk entity sound like freedom of speech to me, and they will complain about been deplatform, as if going to r/Conservative or truth social to express leftist views wouldn't immediately get you banned.
Freedom of speech for them means thier speech should be restricted in no way, including the ability to make violent threats and incite acts of terrorism with what they say.
It also means that thier opponents should be restricted from the same freedom of speech they enjoy.
And finally, it means they have the right to force thier opponents to listen to what they say, especially if that means companies will be forced to carry their lies.
