Hello, Reddit!
My name is Adam Winkler and I'm a scholar of constitutional law, the Supreme Court and gun law.
I've taught constitutional law and led Supreme Court simulations at UCLA School of Law for two decades.
See my answer earlier on why these laws are bad policy.
In my book Gun Fight, I discuss the appearances issue with assault weapons bans.
I'd add that one reason GVP advocates focus on these weapons not handguns is because the Supreme Court has held in the Heller case that we have a constitutional right to have handguns.
So what sense would it make to try to regulate those?
No, we're not talking about the noun "regulation."
We're talking about the adjective "well-regulated" and what that meant in the 1780s.
You're confusing "well-regulated" with the current meaning of the term.
In the 1780s, the term was more akin to "properly functioning" than anything to do with regulations.
What do you think of Brian T. Halonen's findings that the meanings of the words "Well Regulated" refer to something being in proper working order?
Except in no other part of the Constitution does it use "well-regulated" as opposed to simply "regulated."
There's a rather distinct .
Why do you ignore it?
