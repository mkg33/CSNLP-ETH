Colorado has mountains and makes its most tourism money in the winter currently.
A Disney park with a ski resort component that could flex between both summer and winter activity would make billions.
Mountains and winter are good for winter things like skiing, not amusement parks.
Disney doesn't care about the other tourism in the area they're in, they care about traffic in their park exclusively.
Most of those states would bend over backwards to have Disney movie to their state and give them the concessions Florida won't for the jobs and taxes it would bring in.
Florida can afford to be a dick, other poorer states couldn't.
Sounds like a lot of money for Disney to spend for things they can't operate year round.
That's my point.
They don't want to be somewhere where their water attractions have to be closed for half the year or snow can shut down operations.
It's not logical for them.
People plan Disney trips months in advance and what happens if there happens to be a blizzard that week that makes 75% of the parks and rides not able to run.
Yeah but they could just go somewhere else that doesn't have those issues is my point.
There's a reason there's no Disney in places with cold winters.
