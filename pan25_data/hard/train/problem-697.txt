From what you just told me, I'm very sure that facts will also not suffice to convince them.
My father is a Bolsonarist and I'm already tired of explaing and showing evidence of everything wrong with Bolsonaro and his government, but his anti-PT feelings already made him blind to criticism and nuance, so I just gave up, I haven't talked to him after this Sunday but I do hope that at least after what happened he noticed he might not be cheering with the correct crowd.
If these people admit they were wrong, and that Bolsonaro just lost, they'll have to admit that they lost (because they've tied themselves emotionally to Bolsonaro), that their movement lost, and that, just maybe, all the borderline fascism they've been rationalizing for four years was just cheap fascism, and no different from its prior, discredited iterations.
Make no mistake, many of these supported Bolsonaro during his government and deserve A LOT of criticism, but unlike the GOP a majority of the right-wing in Brazil is firmly against these terrorists and accepts the election results.
This is also true for many of the right-wing (such as the speaker of the house) and center-right parties (such as the governor of Rio Grande do Sul) - even though they're formally opposition to Lula's government, they're all against the terrorists, in favour of the democratic process and ready to condemn Bolsonaro's cult.
To be fair, unlike in the US a lot of the right-wing in Brazil is not only against the protestors but they're in fact part of Lula's left-wing government.
Most of leftist parties in Brazil use red as their main color, so it would not be surprising to see a lot of it during this kind of protest.
