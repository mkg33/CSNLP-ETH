Yeah, nazism never really went out of fashion.
For many people, they were only against it because they grew up hearing how awful the nazis were, but they were never truly taught why the nazis were so awful.
They hated the aesthetic, but not the actual ideology.
Which is exactly why so many far-right political parties have gained a lot of momentum as of late.
They present nazi ideology while holding back just enough so that they and their supporters can deny it when confronted.
Are you saying the banned people are Nazi like or the government that bans political opponents?
Australia at one stage tried to ban the communist party, it was defeated at a referendum.
I feel that when ideas and movements are banned they become more dangerous.
Expose them to the light of media and opposition scrutiny.
I don’t expect any political message to be accepted without consequences.
I believe all political idea’s should be shown the ugly light of day so that better ideas can take their place.
I have faith in the voting populous delivering us a good and fair government without the need to ban parties or ideas.
Does it matter when both have killed tens of millions and the one that looks better to you on paper has killed and suppressed countless more millions than the other?
At what stage does the reality of millions of people being killed draw you to the belief that both the left and right extremes of politics warrant our fear?
Here’s my take.
Australian voters were asked to outlaw the communist party.
We rejected the proposal because we felt it was incompatible with the nature of our democracy.
The people said that outlawing ideas and ideology was incompatible with western/Westminster style of democracy.
