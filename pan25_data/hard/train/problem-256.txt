Not to split hairs - I agree with your broader point - but there's a reason they didn't listen to Barry's warnings in 1981: they were still following Barry's lead from 1964.
It was his campaign that birthed the Phyllis Schlaflys of the world who helped form the very same "Moral Majority" he rightfully railed against in his later years.
, but it does a decent job of drawing connections between Reagan's rhetoric in 1980 and Barry's rhetoric 4 presidential cycles previously.
His famous quote about how every good Christian needed to kick Jerry Falwell right in the ass was spurred first and foremost by Falwell's opposition to fellow Arizonan Sandra Day O'Connor's nomination to SCOTUS - something far more personal to Goldwater as a sitting US Senator from that state than broader disagreements on political views.
I don't want to discount what good Goldwater did in his latter years - as a lesser known example, there's a good bit in former Tempe Mayor Neil Giuliano's (once R, now D) memoir The Campaign Within that talks about the support Goldwater gave him after he was forced to come out as gay while in office in the late 90's - but bringing up that "I hate political preachers..." quote obscures the fact that he was one of the first people to electorally channel that Pandora's Box to start with.
The party for the most part didn't shift rightwards between 1964 and 1980, Goldwater shifted leftwards.
Goldwater did indeed shift somewhat left.
It isn't impossible for leopards to change their spots, but it's so uncommon as to be noteworthy when we see it.
Unfortunately, there is no nucleus within the GOP to drive that change.
The few who tried were tossed out.
Of the shamefully small number of House GOPs who voted to impeach Trump, a shamefully smaller number - just 2 - survived the recent election.
