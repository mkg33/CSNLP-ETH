This is spot on.
They are aggrieved conservatives who feel that they are not represented simply because their party is not in control of government.
At best, it's whining.
At worst, it's an attempt to install an undemocratic government and enforce a single party vision of oppression masquerading as "freedom.

It was never about those things.
It was just a pretext to cause a disturbance and try to remove the democratically elected government and replace them with their own stooges.

Unless they plan to apologize for being assholes last year and offer to do some community service, nobody is interested.
It already has.
And those who haven’t died from it will likely one day get complications from it.
But at least they didn’t fall for the mask and vaccine propaganda.
