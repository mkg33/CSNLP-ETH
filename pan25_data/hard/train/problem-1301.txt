You’re arguing that these people deserve support from affirmative action, but the person you’re replying to agrees with you?
Class based affirmative action would still support poor black Bostonians, it would just support poor white people more than rich black people.
"it would benefit disproportionately white people because there's a lot more poor white people than other groups.
".
That’s the thing.
All these people want to get rid of affirmative action without any steps being taken to ensure that all Americans actually have an equal chance.
If all kids received the same quality of education K-12 that would put all Americans on an even play field, but they don’t because our public education system is based on property taxes, zip codes, and decades of systemic racism such as redlining.
Based on our current political climate, we’re decades away from achieving that but they’re eager to just rip off that bandaid now.
But these same 2A people watching 50 years old federal protections being removed so rapidly and callously are kidding themselves if they think it's not going to happen to them.
