They need something to show for the entire Eastern theater of the war since Lysychansk 5 months ago.
Especially since all the withdrawals from Kharkiv, Kherson, and (possibly upcoming) ZNPP have made Russians forget even those few victories, and the public opinion is gradually changing to "Russia is losing."
Putin needs a recent win to have any chance of ending the war on non-disastrous terms for Russia and himself personally.
Not saying Putin would manage to accomplish that (Ukraine has a good chance of pushing Russia out of the entire Kherson and Zap oblasts, all the way to the Crimean border), but these I think are the current plans.
Pretty sure Svatove is the new Kherson where they do a protracted interdiction campaign that doesn't capture much territory but degrades the Russians to the point they pull out all at once.
This is all about the promotion of Yevgeny Prigozhin, and its seemingly telling that no one within the Russian command structure has been able to resist the move and point out how strategically insignificant it is.
Presumably Putin has signed off on it too, which makes me wonder if he's concerned a bit as well.
can't afford to alienate Prigozhin.
