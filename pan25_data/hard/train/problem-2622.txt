They aren't granted by the Governor, but rather decided by the Board of Paroles and Pardons, and only after a sentence has been served.
Right, that's how the special grand jury operates.
They issue a final report and recommendations.
It's noteworthy that the investigation is essentially over now and Fani Willis can make a decision on whether to seek charges from a regular grand jury, which won't take long.
The final decision on whether to press charges, however, ultimately rests with Willis, who would need to present evidence before a separate, regular grand jury that has the power to indict.
Fani Willis still ultimately has to make a decision whether or not to pursue an indictment at a regular grand jury.
She can even do so if the special grand jury doesn't recommend anything.
But this one is open and shut, has documented criminal intent, testimony from the governor, Secretary of State, State Congress members, Trump’s own lawyers, and a dozen others - and GA state charges are particularly unfavorable for Trump’s actions.
I do think the House Committee report--and presumably the Georgia grand jury findings--has enough to convince any reasonable jury that Trump knew he was lying, and therefore knew he was pressuring Raffensberger to commit a felony.
So I'm cautiously optimistic.
But I can't be 100% confident about any case that rides on proving Trump believed a reasonable thing over a crazy thing.
I wouldn't want to be the prosecutor who has to prove Donald Trump didn't believe a crazy conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately it's less clear cut, legally, than it seems.
Technically his words do say something more like your first statement: his defense will argue that he said he believed there were hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes, and he just wanted Raffensberger to find enough of them to prove the election was "stolen" from him.
