Damn, really it been that long?
Alright, I guess.
But, I still stand by my point.
I would vote for someone with real political experience.
Not tv personalities or former football players.
How some people are still in power after supporting January 6th is way beyond me.
Shameful and amoral.
As a woman, I speak for all women stripped of their rights in other states.
If they are pro-life, then great, keep the baby.
If not, then mind your damn business on what a woman does with their body.
Simple!
You can't say politics aside when a senator's term is 6 years.
Voting for their experience, policies, and beliefs is the way to go.
Not by sudden health attacks and speech impediments.
Fine, we can stick to the topic.
However, Jan 6th is still related and relevant.
Considering the fact that both parties are fighting for a majority of the seats and how they'll handle the situation further.
I respect your opinion and I'd rather have someone who can keep their nose out of women's health.
Seeing how Roe v Wade turned out and how quickly my rights were stripped is disgusting.
Trusting some tv star with no experience and who doesn't want to codify abortion is far from what PA needs.
I would hope that John Fetterman has a good team surrounding him.
I’m for John Fetterman and hoping he wins.
That said, competency after a stroke is a valid question for a voter.
I’d argue that he proved he’ll be competent to hold office in recent weeks.
I’d also argue that Dr. Oz never proved competent at concerning himself with the interests of his base.
