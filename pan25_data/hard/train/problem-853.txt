Whats even more interesting is that they employed a former SS special ops dude ( who rescued Mussolini from a mountain ) to hunt down some Nazis working for Egypt.
They spent a lot of time hunting nazi's around the world, and assassinated a load of people after the munich olympics.
Just gonna hijack how high up this is to mention Mossad used to employ Nazi Hunters.
I still think the idea that there was an entire, albeit small, group of dedicated folks hunting former Nazis across the globe is so fucking interesting.
That said the demand for the job has declined in the last 35 years for obvious reasons.
Edit: since im getting a lot of comments about movies and what not I figured id link an interesting HBO movie from 2001 that is about the German Final Solution and how it was deliberated.
It has a fantastic cast and was informative to say the least.
Highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject.
I said it in other comments but i will repeat it as much as needed.
I am no fan of Israel.
I just find the Nazi Hunters and the idea of it as a profession very fascinating.
I understand Mossad and Israel have a nuanced history.
I want to avoid that discussion here because frankly it’s unrelated and I am woefully ignorant of the illegal antics the Israelís find themselves in.
