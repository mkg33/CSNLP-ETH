How is this strawman?
Clearly was implied by the OP that Qatar lecturing on women's rights is hypocritical.
Then /u/maowmaow123 replied that "People know jack shit about Qatar and claim they don't give women any rights", as if that was mentioned in the parent comment.
Really, they were upset that Qatar was criticized in a snarky way, but couldn't come up with a similarly "witty" (by reddit standards, anyway) response and thus were forced to make up a strawman.
In truth, they were responding from a position of rhetorical weakness, hence the exaggerated language and hyperbole.
They want to appear as liberal as Western countries in order to deflect or downplay criticism of their policies.
See: FIFA's/Infantino's line that "if we criticize Qatar, we'd have to criticize our own history first" and the corrupt MEP that praised Qatar's rights record in the European parliament in exchange for cash.
People here love making up strawmen arguments, and then when they are downvoted, claim that "the truth" is being downvoted.
