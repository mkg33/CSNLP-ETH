Nah, the US is on track to hit new records in oil production in 2023.
With supply chains clearing up and demand coming down it doesn't seem like we'll have oil issues for a bit.
Now, with fracking + slower growth in US oil demand, the US satisfies most of its own needs and arguably doesn't need the SPR.
But since we have it, it's handy for stabilizing prices and warding off oil-producing dictators.
Canada is a huge net exporter of oil, so it has never needed to build a strategic reserve.
The US strategic petroleum reserve was created to let us handle an embargo if needed, after the US tapped out its early oil boom and became an oil importer in the 1970s.
To replenish the national reserve the Government does not outlay any cash: it's all in-kind sales by US oil companies.
US oil companies owe around 10 - 18% royalties on every barrel pumped.
So normally if they pump 10 barrels of oil and sell it, they send 10% of the proceeds to the treasury.
For the reserve, they send a barrel of oil instead.
