I hate this framing.
The magazine capacity limitations were an afterthought of this bill.
The REAL danger in it is allowing Oregon’s notoriously racist state police force to have complete control over who is issued the required gun licenses with no oversight or authority to keep them in check.
When the Gestapo drags me and all of my trans sisters to the gulag, I’ll be sure to mention that one time my opinion was close to an NRA talking point.
I’m sure that’ll get me off the hook.
I'll go with that.
So to say 'you used to be able to own a large one of those, but now you can only own a small one', that to me is definitely limiting.
And if the smaller one is overall less effective, then yes it's starting to undermine.
And I think encroach applies also- when something used to be broadly permitted and is now restricted, that seems like encroachment to me.
In Heller v. DC (2008) they ruled that "arms in common use at the time for lawful purposes"..."typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes" are protected by the 2nd Amendment.
"The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia".
The 2nd amendment could quite easily be applied to individual citizens starting armies and owning automatic weapons.
A strict constitutionalist would call Title 2 unconstitutional as well.
By what standard are they unconstitutional?
I’m seriously asking this question and everyone here is just parroting back the word “unconstitutional”.
But the law right now is completly unconstitutional as written.
It is essentially a full ban on gun sales.
All firearm sales need a permit, but there was no provision for time to set that up, or a budget for it.
We need him control, but this law was possibly the worst execution of it.
It is so bad I was thinking someone on the far right wrote it knowing it wouldn't pass, and if it did the court would stop it.
But they did something for gun control.
