Any apology and recognition of the mistakes of the past will make it better for the future that is being planned.
Good thing that Netherlands has done it.
I hope other colonial powers(English, French, Spain and Portugal) starts apologising and returning the loot and artefacts of African, South American and south Asian countries.
And before sending any artifact back, maybe we should make sure that they aren't lynching their own people for being a different colour (looking at you South Africa), and maybe start building a developed country?
Because i'm 100% sure those artifacts would just be stolen and sold to the medium bidder.
No country as they are today existed back then.
Every single country evolved for fucks sake.
The difference is that some countried evolved a lot faster than others.
If those countries apologized in modern times, good for them, that's great and all but I don't really see the reason for doing such things.
No one, except for some virtue signallers and people who can actually profit from that, cares for what countries did centuries ago.
Oh for fucks sake... Don't people have more important matters to worry about than centuries old bullshit?
And by the way, even if they were not as developed as european countries they were not "just tribes", there were empires with undeveloped cities, mostly helped by colonialism (Ghana Empire p.e).
