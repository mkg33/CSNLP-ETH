I hope the Democrats hold firm and put up 212 for Jeffries every time.
The Republican Party has spent years engaging in obstruction, bad faith negotiating, election denial, and the courting of radicals.
Many House Republicans are furious with a band of far-right rebels who they say are holding the party hostage by repeatedly rejecting its nominee for speaker.
Moderate Republicans' resistance to going around a small group of far-right rebels could signal how the group will approach fights on must-pass bills with the party's slim majority.
But there’s one thing they’re so far unwilling to do: work with a faction of Democrats to elect a centrist speaker to govern the narrow GOP majority and teach the rabble-rousers a lesson.
Why is it that the “enlightened centrists” are always going like heh why don’t the dems vote for a republican to solve the problem.
Instead of saying hey Jeffries has been getting the plurality, why don’t 5 moderates from the republican vote for him instead.
Seems to me Democrats are missing a huge opportunity here…they could each take turns being nominated for speaker, and one-by-one each get more votes than McCarthy.
23 minutes ago: McCarthy tells me he thinks the vote tally on the first vote will “pretty much” be the same until they get done negotiating.
“Nothings agreed to until everything’s agreed to.”.
