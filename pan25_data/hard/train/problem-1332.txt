BUT before that, they very much were buddy/buddy, so much so that when Mongolia ASKED to be annexed by the USSR, the USSR refused, partly because they did not want to cause issues with China.
according to some rumors, the Soviets were planning on nuking China after their border war in the NE and stirring up troubles and separatists in Xinjiang went poorly.
Of course, the Soviets didn't go all-in, but the PLA held their own against a vastly superior army.
You can make the argument that the Soviets actually would have been justified in going to war (at least more justified than invading Ukraine).
Back then, the Soviets were kind of jerks to their socialist allies in Europe.
Zhou Enlai eloquently said the Soviets were as bad as the Nazis when the Soviets sent troops into a Warsaw pact nation in 1968ish (forgot which one) and called for a People's War against the Red Army.
So when China painted themselves as victims of Soviet aggression, no one believed the Soviets.
Even Chinese historians today believe that China was not entirely innocent when it comes to how the conflict started on those islands.
Also, I read that during the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guard stormed the Soviet embassy and beat up the staff there for not being socialist enough.
I doubt China would support this, because they were Russia in that scenario in the dynasty era.
Ironically, Russia was one of the countries that ganged up on China back then.
They know the Russian are probably as nationalistic as they are.
Put the Russians through a century of humiliation, they're gonna want revenge when they get back on their feet.
Or they're gonna go nuclear scorched earth rather than go through that.
So, in that undeclared war, the Soviets, according to the rumors, planned to nuke China when their attempts to cause separatist tension in Xinjiang and military operations in the NE failed.
