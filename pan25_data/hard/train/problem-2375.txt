The problem is that, by the numbers, Texas is significantly less Republican than it projects.
The split is somewhere between 60-40 or 55-45 % red versus blue, which is within striking distance of flipping.
Hence why Texas is simultaneously one election from flipping and a dozen at the same time.
Demographics are moving democrat, but the election becomes correspondingly more rigged every election to compensate.
It's not impossible we'll see a situation where Texas flips blue in presidential and gubernatorial elections, but highly unlikely we'll see it flip in federal or state legislature elections.
Not unless Gerrymandering is federally regulated.
However Republicans consistently hold majorities-even supermajorities (2/3) of the seats.
The reason is that Texas has some of the worst Gerrymandering in the country and is barely a democracy at this point.
The Texas Democratic Party has nobody to blame but themselves for losing elections.
And it's not even that Republicans are all that popular.
NOBODY in Texas actually likes Abbott, Cruz or Paxton.
Not many people actually liked Perry either.
It's that the Texas Democratic Party is so poorly run, that a lot of Texans don't even know who the Democratic candidate is, let alone want to vote for them.
If they can't beat fucking Abbott, Cruz Paxton, or Perry, then they're absolutely incompetent.
If you can't win a meaningful election in almost 30 years, and lose an election by DOUBLE DIGITS because you STILL can't get your base to vote after a power grid failure, a school shooting, and losing abortion rights, ESPECIALLY during a midterm where practically every other state had record turnout, maybe it's not completely the voters' fault.
Maybe you just suck at motivating your base to get out and vote.
A lot of people just can’t be assed to vote.
They have the world’s information at their fingertips.
The choice to not vote is solely on the voter.
