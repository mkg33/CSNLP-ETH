Well that's part of it.
It didn't have to be this way just because of communism, but it happened this way specifically because of Stalin.
Stalin ruled by fear and created this culture that became a staple of post-Stalin Russian culture.... shoot the messenger.
If any bad news came up the chain the people reporting the bad news were severely punished.
To this the leadership of the Ukrainian SSR would send reports up the chain of great successes.
Every single year they reported they had more surplus crops than they had.
Which was fine in normal years because Ukraine produced more than enough crops for everyone.
But they had one year where they didn't have a great harvest.... more than enough to feed everyone.
But as usual, they inflated their numbers.
And so the Russian leadership extracted everything they thought to be surplus.... which wasn't surplus at all.
Pulling all that wheat out of Ukraine and causing people to starve.
The reason for that is that the entire Soviet Union was hit by a famine.
Even regions beyond the soviet union like Eastern Poland or Romania went through the famine (lost hundreds of thousands of people) and those regions were not in the Soviet Union at the time.
I absolutely understand Ukrainians calling it a genocide, there's definitely elements of those policies that made it harsher in Ukraine, but to make it ethnically based it's a bit more controversial.
So if he's asked to be more specific about the comparison, you can expect almost at a 100% he'll answer by it was an "unintentional genocide" which is not only false, it would be yet again another attempt to excuse russia's behavior in Ukraine which is a deliberate ethnic cleansing.
