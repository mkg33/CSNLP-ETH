”I didn’t say I was “sworn” in… I just sat down by myself, sat on a rusty nail and “swore” rather loudly “in” the chamber.”.
But congressman-elect, we have the clip of you saying specifically “I was sworn in.” How many lies do you intend to tell?
George Santos shared a falsehood on his first day on Capitol Hill: that he had been sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives.
While the statement on his official website drew instant criticism because the New York Republican has been accused of fabricating key details of his biography, he wasn’t the only one to send out an erroneous announcement.
The mistake shows the potential pitfalls of scheduling press releases on the assumption Washinon politics will go smoothly.
(D-Wash.) was elected Senate president pro tempore Tuesday, becoming the first woman to hold the job since its inception and putting her third in the line of presidential succession.
The Office of the Chief Administrative Officer for the House of Representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment overnight Wednesday about why the messages may have posted to the lawmakers’ websites.
Santos’s statement appears to have been taken down online, while some others remain public.
