Leaving aside that there’s no way that bill survives a filibuster, even if it was passed and enough states committed to make it work then SCOTUS will take up some case from voters in Idaho who say it violates there first amendment rights.
The legitimacy of that sort of case is irrelevant for this court, they can just throw out laws they don’t like.
And you're basically arguing futility, saying there's no point to doing anything because the Supreme Court will always thwart it.
But the solution to that is to elect better (read: Democratic) Presidents and Senators, who will nominate and confirm better federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, who will then uphold laws like the NPVIC.
It's really hard to draw conclusions from midterm voter turnout due to all these confounding factors, in addition to everything I said in my linked comment above.
Perhaps I am wrong… but it was my understanding, those reasons I listed… have always been the reasons for the electoral college vote in the first place.
At work right now so I don't have all the details but there's a bunch of states that have already passed state laws saying their electoral college votes would go to the candidate to wins the popular vote.
This will go into effect once enough states have signed similar bills to have enough electoral votes to decide the winner.
