Any guarantees they make now will just be discarded once it's convenient for any reason they can come up with.
Russian Security guarantees are absolutely worthless, so no one in Ukraine will be willing to cede land to them to get a promise of not being attacked again in the future.
Remove the romanticism behind the war and Ukraine, and you're left with a strong likelihood of land being ceded to Russia in exchange for an end to the war and long term security guarantees.
So here, too, Poland should simply give Putin the territory he wants as a means to achieve a temporary peace, and neuter NATO in the process?
An end to this war that sees Russia gain territory will only incentivize the next unprovoked land grab, as we’ve seen again, and again, and again.
I’m not sure what you’ve seen that suggests to you Russia is capable of effectively scaling up their military for global conflict.
Where does it end?
Presumably when it’s your territory they’re trying to take.
What country do you call home?
Would you recommend giving 1/10th of it away in this situation?
