The most dangerous, likely outcome is sectarian violence similar to the Troubles in Ireland.
A full blown Civil War just isn’t plausible.
The military is not likely to fracture, and with how big the military is, if a civil war started, it’d be over the moment the military stepped in.
Right, and those factions all fell into one side or the other once the war started, which is the opposite of what you are saying.
A modern civil war in America would not look like Syria, it would look like 1860.
Contrary to popular opinion, we're not close to a civil war.
This is because we can avoid that war by making our government functional again.
We've got "political leaders" like MTG and Boebert actively riling up the base.
Not for political advancement, but for the ego boost that the publicity gets them.
The only thing, IMO, that stands in the way of things escalating into a traditional war of armies is that the split really amounts to urban vs rural and it's harder to draw battle lines between those than between something like north and sourt or even midamerica and the coasts.
