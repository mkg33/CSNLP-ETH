Difference is that Russia/USSR had a good birthrate in the 1920s and 30s to support the population.
If you look at the curve since WW2, the population still hasn't recovered.
The current birthrate is basically at replacement, and if you count emigration, it's negative.
A good chunk went to Armenia.
The Armenian GDP was projected to grow 3% in 2022, but was revised to north of 10% due to the influx of Russian money.
It's estimated that somewhere between 300 thousand and 1 million have left, and those that did were some of the most economically active.
The other tricky part is that the economy in 1930s and 40s did not rely on value added manufacturing and service.
It was basic industrialized labor and agriculture.
That's no longer the case, and most economic activity is driven by skilled labor.
The segment of the Russian population that's responsible for a huge chunk of this activity has escaped mobilization, took their skills and money with them.
Basically, the WW2 demographics don't apply and it's much worse now.
On top of that, the US was providing more support for USSR than we are currently providing Ukraine.
I also am pretty sure US and our allies can and will keep supplying Ukraine for at least the next 5 years if necessary.
And I don't see Russia keeping up this amount of death and sustaining their own economic damage for that long.
So I don't think they will be able to keep those territories.
I do think Putin is feeling the pressure, and has been trying to find a way out that doesn't involve giving up the territories they've occupied.
If it's option number one, I could see him maybe actually resigning and leaving it to his successor to pull out.
It's hard to see him giving up that power though.
