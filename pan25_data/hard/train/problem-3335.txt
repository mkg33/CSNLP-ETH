This is just a guess: I think that Ukraine will be able to target massing military units by the border while they "ready to conduct training exercises".
The strikes that have been happening in Russia have been done using Ukrainian made weapons, so they'd have to do the same to strike troop concentrations in the new year.
The political barrier is that the US has asked Ukraine not to strike within Russia's borders using the weapons supplied by the US.
Now that Russia has already invaded them, there is no political barrier to dropping bombs/missiles/drone-grenades on concentrations of russian troops canon fodder on the Russian side of the border (or in Russian temp held parts of Ukraine).
Ukraine has plenty of Territorial Defense Units near Kyiv along with whatever artillery and anti-air / anti-missile systems are watching the Belarusian border.
So even if Ukraine does need to pull some troops back to defend Kyiv it probably wonâ€™t make much a difference to the ongoing counter offensives other than slow them down by a few weeks.
Annoyingly whether Russia does this or not, stationing extra troops around the Northern border could force Ukraine to move more troops to defend it thus slowing the advancement down in the South.
