Ukraine has already been attacking military targets in Russia proper, so that's definitely something they'd continue to do if Russia refuses to give up.
Sending troops in any significant number over the border seems unlikely tho.
Neither Ukraine nor Russia seem to show a lack of manpower anytime soon.
The issue for both sides are mostly material, which much depends on how aid Ukraine will get and how large Russia's weapon stockpiles actually are.
If the Ukrainians want to fight to the last Ukrainian against the Russian menace, what's so bad about the west arming them and benefiting from it?
Yes, they're thinking to buy the tanks they're leasing from Germany and send them to Ukraine, with the logic that they will best fulfill their purpose of deterring Russia by serving in the war.
I think they haven't yet decided to do this.
Those will be very important, but will take longer to transfer since they need to be stripped of advanced armour and systems (or export versions sourced from Egypt or Saudi Arabia).
