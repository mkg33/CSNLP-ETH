Does anyone think South Korea and Japan do not already have all the pieces of several nukes, either already assembled or able to be assembled in a day or two?
It's a threat - even Japan opened the debate on militarization and developing nuclear weapons because of North Korea.
South Korea is moving towards, if not openly announcing their intention towards a policy of nuclear hedging.
This is different from being a para-nuclear state, as instead of being technically ready to produce at a moments notice, they intend to be ready to do so, and publicly acknowledge that intent.
Japan is considered para-nuclear, as its long assumed they don't just possess the capacity to produce nuclear arms at will, but to do so immediately, but do not maintain a stance which announces they intent to ever do so.
This is also technically different from Israel, which is near-universally regarded as a well stocked nuclear power, but maintains an unwavering policy of strategic ambiguity towards its nuclear capabilities.
Nuclear hedging is what makes neighbors the most twitchy, as it seriously changes dynamics and war planning.
