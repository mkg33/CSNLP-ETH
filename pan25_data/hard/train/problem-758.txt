DeSantis will have to be much more neutered, because he'll know somebody holds his leash.
He needs the the GOP machine to help manufacture his power, Trump in many ways did not.
That's one of the interesting qualities of Trump that I think appealed to so many people.
For better or worse (And let's be honest it was almost entirely worse) Trump was an actual outsider, coming in and stirring up shit, criticizing long-term powerful people on both the left and the right, and was not beholden to the GOP leadership.
Trump just insulted everybody, and he could get away with it, because it played to the narrative that he was his own man.
The GOP rallied around Trump eventually but there was always a battle, and he was never owned by them, he was never controlled by them.
Fox News needs a new Messiah to kiss the feet of and they are ramping up to make DeSantis that guy.
He's business friendly, a bit closer to the classic conservative, plays the narrative cards that appeal to the voters, and is far more educated about the bureaucratic hurdles related to governing.
He has no "brilliant businessman" narrative.
He doesn't brag about sleeping with models.
He doesn't shit in a gold toilet.
He's a bully sure, but he's not punching down in quite the same way.
His one move is to be a bully.
The Republican base will eat it up but you need independent votes to win a national election.
Independents just aren't going to get riled up by "owning the libs".
