Problem with that, a majority of Chinese citizens are vaccinated.
But the vaccines available in china, (none of which are based on phizer of moderna) are not effective at all against the COVID variants that are going trough China.
Yes, China should cooperate with the West to either help with their own vaccine creation or take vaccines from the West.
At lest thank god people from Asian countries wear masks when they come here.
In my 3 years of being a receptionist they always had their masks even when the mandate in our country was long lifted.
And West had tons of time to have vaccinated.
And if people choose not to, it s like not taking a helmet into a battle.
Like I have 2 doses, and my dad has 3, and my mom has 0.
Chinese travel in groups and travel with agencies.
I work in a hotel, and Chinese, Japanese, Koran or Vietnamese always come with a full bus, and when I ask their guide where they're going, they always tell me they are touring Europe for a week.
Hell, to this day, there are people who refuse to get the vaccine even when their neighbours die left and right.
