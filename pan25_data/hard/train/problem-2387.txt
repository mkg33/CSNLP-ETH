Edit: you edited your post, so I will preface by saying I wrote this when you only argued infrastructure in your comment.
I make 50k a year.
Definitely not 1%.
I just ordered a brand new Bolt.
Why?
Because my ICE Audi costs 35 cents a mile and I drive 25k miles a year.
For the same cost as I'm spending on gas and maintenance, I could simply have a newer more valuable car (my Audi is worth about 6k now after 200k miles) and I can increase my net worth while consolidating my vehicle costs into one payment each month.
My charging is free at my apartment.
Do you understand that this is only for new cars, and that you will still be able to buy a a used car if you can't afford a new one?
The fact that you don't take toll roads when not going to work shows that it works dude.
Tolls discourage use during certain times or using certain routes.
You got a source varying toll prices have been used for mitigating traffic.
IDK about the only time i go on tolls is when i go to work which i canâ€™t control what time that is.
