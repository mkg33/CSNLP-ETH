The Trump administration certified Iran's compliance twice in 2017 before pulling out in May of 2018.
Even as late as 2019 after the US withdrawal the IAEA certified compliance.
You can make up whatever BS story you like, but it doesn't change the facts.
At this point it seems over and done with.
However I'm pretty sure the US public will not go in on another middle east war so there aren't a lot of options.
We found a diplomatic solution.
Trump killed it.
Finding another looks like a remote possibly as we have lost credibility.
At this point Iran will align with Russia and China and may develop a nuke.
The US public will not support another war.
So soon we may say hello to the next nuclear power, as we did with North Korea.
For example, the US should encourage China to station nukes in North Korea in exchange for no NK nuclear program.
Same with South Korea.
They get to have US nukes but controlled by QUAD.
The US killed the nuclear deal.
Why should Iran think they wouldn't kill the next one?
Fool me once ....... Also Biden had the chance to resurrect the original deal when he got into office.
He refused to do it, opting to push for more concessions.
That's how we got here Trump, followed by Biden.
