The pictures of some mostly untouched buildings in the affected area, because those followed the standards, tell a very tragic story.
Because it's easy to think of all the lives uselessly lost in the first moments, hours and days, but the suffering and burden of those who remain will be great too, and those can be helped.
Same on the other side of the border in north-western syria, where sending help is much harder due to the political situation.
No building up to even the existing code in Turkey should crumble with a 5.6, and on the same idea the big 7.8, while major and scary wherever it would happen, should not have caused this much damage if the existing regulation had not been waved, ignore or bribed-around.
Where is he in Turkey ?
Because the heart of the devastation is in the south east of the country, near the Syrian border.
Chances are your friend is in the most tourist-y areas near Istanbul on the other side of the country, no ?
Sure, the main tourist resorts are in the south, Mamaris, Lara beach etc.
They've not been affected so far, but it is still a risk with aftershocks still occurring.
Not one I'd like to take..and I love visiting Turkey for holidays.
