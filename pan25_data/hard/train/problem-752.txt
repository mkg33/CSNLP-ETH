It won't be.
Regargless of the outcome it will only get worse.
Also with current position of the allies there is no way to end the war, since our army is not allowed to properly strike back, and it can go on like this for decades (look at Israel-Iran conflict).
But even if it's not, and somehow russians will be defeated, the damage is already done, both by russians and by our greedy, corrupted government who would put every citizen under a train if it will grant them extra income.
Should have.
Also, should have been more than one unit.
But, sadly, this war is too valuable for various military complexes to test weapons (and maybe also launder some money in the process), so they will be really careful to not end it anytime soon.
They may also be intended to just deplete air defence munitions, but that seems futile given the volumes of new systems they're receiving â€” particularly Patriot.
The truth no one focuses on: why not use drones and missiles to degrade military capabilities, is it because Ukrainian military is to a hard target to breach?
I think this is the truth.
So instead, the Russian Imperialists, attack civilians, women in hospitals, children in schools.
Putin is so brave, having others rape women and children, slaughter the innocent, having people thrown out windows who disagree, is this was passed for greatness in Russia?
If it is the Russia people are truly in decline.
