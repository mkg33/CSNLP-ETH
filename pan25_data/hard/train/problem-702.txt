We know this, but Belarus isn't exactly a bastion of free critical thinking and it could be spun as a warning to stay out.
If you think reddit is bad, these pockets of the world view the world through conspiracies and deep states.
It's hard because they've traditionally been used as pawns, and now and again they're entirely right.
Respectfully, I can't tell if you're confused about what's being discussed, which is a warning that Russia plans to fake an attack in Belarus and blame Ukraine.
I think it's possible to support Ukraine while also acknowledging that they are involved in the information war too and take their official statements with a grain of salt.
But God forbid you use nuance on worldnews, you'll be downvoted to hell for not blindly believing every word out of Kyiv.
Shh, we must blindly believe every word that comes out of Kyiv or else you're a Russian bot.
A nation at war would never exaggerate or stretch the truth to their own advantage, right?
Russia is the only one that uses propaganda, never Ukraine.
How exactly would that be propaganda for the Russian people?
Are you arguing that Belarus being attacked would spur the average Russian in some way that the current propaganda isn't?
To be fair, Belarus is an active participant in this war, acting as a launch site and invasion corridor for the Russians.
Ukraine would be justified in attacking Belarus already.
Think about it sensibly though, why would Ukraine commit a terror attack on Belarus when they are already preoccupied with a full scale war.
It just doesn't even make sense.
Piss off Russia.
