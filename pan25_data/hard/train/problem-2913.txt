Source: Was on exercises in all temperatures, ranging from +25°C to -38°C, the most miserable ones were those in the 0 to -10°C range in my own personal opinion.
You are welcome to disagree, of course, as this is nothing but subjective on my part.
Also got slight frostbite on one of said exercises due to my own negligence.
This is my take as well.
I was conscripted in the far, far north of Norway a number of years ago: One thing that stuck with me was one of my officers (Who was from the north himself) telling us that it's more common to get frostbite in temps like that (I think he said 0 to -5) due to negligence in attire, as well as it being "wetter" due to the higher temps.
If you read a temperature of -15°C or colder, you tend to dress accordingly to the weather, whereas -3°C doesn't seem that bad in comparison until you've been outside for 14 hours.
Temps of let's say -20°C are dangerous and uncomfortable in their own right, but the preparedness for those temperatures is usually higher.
In my experience, being stationed outdoors in near-zero temperatures is more dangerous.
There are ways to keep warm if you can stay dry.
Much harder to stay dry if it's barely freezing.
Then again, all your equipment starts to act up when it gets cold enough...
