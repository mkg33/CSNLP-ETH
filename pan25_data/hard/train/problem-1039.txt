Yeah, Ukraine need weapons.
Sadly our new government didn't invest into our own military developments aver 2019 president elections.
Now we need that help otherwise Ukraine won't exist.
People adjusted.
Most of the small businesses have generators.
Households that can afford it have batteries and stable internet connection(GPON).
Electricity just went back.
The Internet was available during all that time.
And I had a great cup of coffee that morning.
We are lucky that we have amazing people in the ZSU(our army).
Also the United States and Europe help to keep us going.
We are just not so lucky with mindless neighbors.
Crazy how lucky I am just to be born in Ukraine and not in Russia.
I had that chance and my parents moved to Ukraine just before I was born.
Maybe you should learn what really happened and happens in Ukraine borders.
Do some research on their president and their government because it is not my duty to educate you but, it shows how well the western media is brainwashed.
I am a Ukraine who now lives in the USA but had to leave Ukraine due to its corrupt ways directly effecting my family.
Also a lot of Ukraine’s are nazis to a stand point not all just too many to keep count though.
It’s like the same problem America faces with white supremacy.
