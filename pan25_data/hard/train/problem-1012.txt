The biggest change is how the president and others are reacting to these revelations now and how the country populace really is treating corruption as unacceptable.
If he ends up dominating everything and believes corruption more or less has been rooted out, I'd hope he'd step down and let a political landscape of equal opponents suffice.
As long as he isn't using this anti corruption drive as selective enforcement to crush internal opposition (a la China's Xi).
The line from celebrated war leader to power hungry autocrat is incredibly thin after all.
However, the thing about societies that have had endemic corruption for generations like Ukraine is that everyone with even a modicum of influence or power is also corrupt, including those doing the corruption hunting.
That's why it's so difficult to root out.
It is difficult, but possible.
I think Zelensky, used the Servant of the people show to offer a mirror and a vision of future to the Ukrainians.
That is an important first step.
The Maidan protests, and the fact that he was elected based on this vision is an evidence that there's a buy in from the Ukrainian people.
The war could be an important catalyst that will speed up the process, but assistance and help from the west will be essential.
We must not betray their trust in us and our system of government and rule of law.
That's not the point though.
What is really interesting and helpful is the level of ingrained corruption in the society.
Also the influence of Russia on Ukrainian politics.
It is really funny at times and really sad at times.
True tragicomedy.
