Support the movement by actually having sanctions target every IRGC/IRI official & their families.
Kick their kids and wives out of Canada/UK/EU & expel their diplomats.
Seize their assets abroad too.
How about support our human rights movement by helping us get rid of our shitty leaders, rather than doing something that’s likely going to end that movement and probably expand this war to the Middle East?
From my perspective, unless attacks are done covertly - bombing these sites is likely going to undermine our goal of having human rights in Iran.
And probably pull a few other countries in the region into direct conflict with the blowback.
The only thing stopping them is they don't want a domino effect leading us into a world war, as countries pile on joining one side or thebother for their own gain.
Yeah the difference is the consequences.
The US could turn Iran's military infrastructure to glass over this, with little criticism and probably no direct military consequences.
If Russia tried that with a NATO country it wouldn't go the same.
I don’t think Russia could afford to strike NATO because of the fallout, but ofc they could and we would get closer to WW3.
Maybe they would try to intercept shipments or damage transportation infrastructure for NATO supply lines like rail etc.
