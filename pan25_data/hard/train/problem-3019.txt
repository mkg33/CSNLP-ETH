I don't blame you.
It's more surprising seeing teachers STAY at this point.
How this country treats its teachers is shameful and disgusting.
I hope you find or have found fulfilling employment that compensates you adequately, if not much better.

This.
This is why I’ve always been a strong advocate for tracking.
I know it’s such a dirty word in the world of education.
But in all honesty, the high level learners are not always going to help pull up the low learners, and in fact will usually be bored as fuck and start acting out.
Tracking has the added benefit of making lessons much more closely aligned with each child’s abilities instead of having a over view lesson and then a crap ton of self guided work so teachers can then go do one one one or small group work.
Someone is always going to get left behind this way.
Add to that conservatives seem to be hell bent on breaking public education here.
Beyond just the whole “see it doesn’t work, vote for me and I’ll prove it” ass pain that happens.
But the end goal seems to be to break it beyond repair to justify school vouchers, enabling public funds to be used to pay for private schools.
Which don’t have to follow all the same standards public schools have to follow.
Not just that, at some point with in my life time public schools became primary day cares centers.
This became especially evident during the pandemic.
We really thought the whole thing would start a conversation on actual sick leave and PTO, and begin to include child care with that.
