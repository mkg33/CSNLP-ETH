I voted for Fried in the primary before I moved, and would have voted for Crist (again), but the FL Dems have no leadership, no plan (other than hope John Morgan runs) and no future.
It sucks.
Damn that sucks dude.
Signature matching is BS.
If you looked at all the checks I would sign for just one round of bills, there would be like 5 different signatures lol.
For anyone wondering about the “red wave” that only seemed to happen in Florida… DeSantis cheated HARD by extreme racial gerrymandering, and disenfranchising voters who completed their sentences, but might have owed money to the state.
Also, mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day, but received after 7pm, were NOT COUNTED and tossed out.
I requested a mail in ballot almost 3 weeks before election, received it the Friday before election.
I called the supervisor of elections and asked if they would even get it by Tuesday 7pm.
They said “it’s possible”.
Ended up paying $30 to overnight it but I have talked to multiple people that didn’t get their ballot in time.
