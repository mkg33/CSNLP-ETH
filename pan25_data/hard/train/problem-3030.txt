You're completely missing the point I'm making...the article you linked is not a conclusion drawn from an investigation.
It's the opinion of a few people who saw some pictures.
Everything?
That's hardly the case.
There's also evidence that suggest it's a KH-101.
Let's just wait for an investigation instead of parroting conjecture we find on twitter.
Initial findings SUGGEST... this is not the results of a completed investigation.
This is based off of photos shown on Twitter indicating it could be a piece from an S300.
They're citing a US official.
Well today we have seen US officials claim it was a Russian missile, fired from Russia, then we saw them claim it wasn't fired by Russia but still a Russian missile, then we saw that maybe it was a missile fired from Belarus, then possibly an S300.
out of their ass, since the general consensus now is it was a Ukrainian 5V55 missile from a S-300 that went off course when trying to intercept a Russian missile and landed in Poland.
I \think\ we are talking about the possibility of Russian missiles fired by the Russian military stationed in Belarus hitting Poland.
This doesn't necessarily change anything, but it does add an extra layer of complexity.
