Yeah, imagine being angry at corporate shitheads blowing up the world and profiting off of sanctions, coups, drone strikes, police brutality and austerity policies.
Yeah, so angry about it that you could jump right into bed with those other corporate shitheads blowing up the world and profiting off of sanctions, coups, drone strikes, police brutality, and austerity policies.
They destroyed NordStream 1.
While it was running, Russia lost money on every cubic meter of gas that passed through NordStream 1, because they signed a deal to provide gas to Germany below market price in order to entice Germany into agreeing to the deal.
Russia had been trying for 10 years to transition from NordStream 1 to NordStream 2 (which has none of those price controls).
And now they blew up NordStream 1 and left only NordStream 2.
The remaining pipe has the capacity to replace what Nordstream1 used to carry.
Also, Nordstream1 would not be too difficult to repair.
The explosions happened in 47m of water, if I recall correctly.
