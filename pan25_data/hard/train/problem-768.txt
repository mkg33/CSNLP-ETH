I think a united Scandinavia isn't going to happen simply because it's too late at this point.
The question is more whether everyone is going to fully join the EU now.
There's no reason to be making a union within a union.
Everyone liked the idea, including the US.
The treaty was signed and ratified... but the French refused to ratify it.
The US wanted West-Germany to re-arm and what would become NATO was being floated around.
The French neither liked the idea of a US led alliance, nor an independent German army, so they made their own little EU army idea.
That's kinda my point, France wants to create a united EU army, but you can bet your ass they plan on being in charge of it because no one would reasonably do otherwise.
It's not a matter of not being able to play nicely with others, the British wouldn't have been the leader of the Allies, and then a significant member of NATO if it were otherwise.
It's a matter of influence, military policy and practicality.
The country in the EU with the most current independent foreign conflict experience is France since they still hold significant influence and interests in Northwestern Africa.
Their current military policy and doctrines are one of the only ones in the EU with an allowance for foreign interference.
You can bet that if a united EU army ever came into being, they would want to maintain that political and doctrinal stance.
Obviously for some things that makes sense, they are one of the only European powers capable of projecting any military power beyond Europe itself.
But anyone who thinks they have purely altruistic reasons for their stance is kidding themselves.
