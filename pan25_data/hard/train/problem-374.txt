What I find interesting is that the Soviets were close to a breakthrough around Viipuri and there were no more Finish reserves.
Finish artillery was also out of ammo.
Sweden and the UK both were not interested in joining the war.
Germany even threatened Sweden that if they gave allied forces the right of passage then Germany would invade Sweden.
Oh and also Sweden for the most part has great defensive terrain and Russia is struggling to fight in a mostly flat country.
Sweden also has a strong military already and there is no land border with Russia.
Russia would either have to go through Finland or Norway first to get to Sweden or do a large scale naval invasion.
Either option is impossible for the Russian military.
There was a fight between the Soviet military and the communist party.
If the military got their way I doubt that the Fins would be able to hold on for much longer without Soviet troops entering Helsinki.
The Red Army didn't want peace as they were now winning but the Communist Party wanted to end the war because of the humiliation.
The matter was put to a vote and the Communist Party won and Finland was forced to sign the unfavorable peace treaty.
When the Finish president signed the treaty he said "Let the hand wither that signs this monstrous treaty!
".
Yeah.
Bidens release of strategic petroleum didn't lessen the prices OR make a profit.
Nothing matters, give your money to Lrrr.
