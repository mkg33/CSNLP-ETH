I'm a Finn and I think this is definitely a wise choice.
Personally I have no faith in Erdogan saying something else today or tomorrow anyway so it's better to just wait for his tantrum to end and join with our neighbors to the west.
It's also likely he is putting himself as the wannabe candidate so that Erdogan doesn't have anyone else to attack.
He may be acting like a lightning rod to draw all the rage of Erdogan.
So far it works, Erdogan hasn't spoken against anyone else.
Normally that process takes around 1.5 years, but Erdogan may accelerate this to use it against him.
On the other hand, a move like that would transfer all of mayor's supporters to the second candidate (the opposition leader himself) who can then rightfully claim to be the only choice, because the first choice is banned.
So Erdogan may actually have to deal with having the mayor as the opposition candidate.
Independently of all these, whoever wins the election will definitely ratify the memberships of Sweden and Finland.
Even Erdogan needs the west to survive, he is just using the power move to drive his base.
Once the election is over, even if Erdogan cheats his way to power, he will accept the applications to NATO.
Imagine the pressure that Erdogan is going to get from the rest of NATO until July.
He'll get zero economic support, zero military sales and or/equipment transfers and basically be put in the diplomatic freezer.
All of this doesn't help his party get prepared for the May elections.
