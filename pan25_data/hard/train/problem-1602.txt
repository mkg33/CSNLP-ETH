Then why do they keep talking about Christ?
Christofacist is absolutely the correct term, as it is a major tenant of their agenda.
It really is of no import that they misunderstand the teachings of Christ (intentionally or otherwise.
).
It is.
But that seems to be where all of these recent right-wing bills that allow citizens to sue other citizens, like Don't Say Gay in FL and the abortion bill in TX, are coming from: by turning the legal system into a tool for right-wing activists to attack other citizens, they can claim the government is not the one restricting speech and thus not a 1A violation.
And then claim they are for freedom because they are giving parents the freedom to...force their ideology on entire school districts.
And bills like "Don't Say Gay" are meant to create chaos and invite parents (aka well-funded, right-wing activist groups called things like "Mother's for Freedom") to sue so that the GOP politicians can claim they aren't the ones enforcing the de facto speech bans.
But, considering FL already gave parents the ability to pull students out of classes for content they dislike, there is no "parental sovereignty" at play.
By allowing parents to sue the school, they are allowing conservatives to weaponize the legal system to control education for all students and further the tyranny of the minority we see play out so consistently in America.
Classic tactic used throughout history, especially when fueling moral panics, to convince themselves they are the "civilized people" and their chosen enemy are "uncivilized people" to justify the use of behaviors against said enemy that would otherwise be considered uncivilized.
Ah, yes, blatantly restricting free speech while claiming to care about free speech (when it comes to ensuring the ability of Conservatives to break social media TOS and spew violent rhetoric).
The fact that Charlie Rufo is part of his group of lackeys trying to further destroy the FL education system tells you all you need to know.
