Many countries already pay Brazil to maintain their rainforests.
It got real awkward when bolsonaro started chopping.
However: remember that the comment my original comment replied to was about the concept of reimbursing Brazil for slowing deforestation.
So I mentioned an example of it in practice, as well as an example of it being used to pressure the Brazilian government when they didnâ€™t meet targets.
Which countries try to counteract by paying the Brazilian government money for slowing deforestation.
Most Deforestation in Brazil isn't due to companies, it is done ilegaly by thugs, the remaining is the example I just gave you..
It's not cattle, the industry that spearheads the deforestation in the amazons are the illegal logging operations.
Down the line some idk how many years they may turn into crops for cattle.
The cleared land is mostly used for cattle grazing.
Crazy enough it's not even needed currently, there are many areas with at most one head of cattle per square kilometre.
But it's ideological, and landowners clear the forest simply to call dips on the land.
