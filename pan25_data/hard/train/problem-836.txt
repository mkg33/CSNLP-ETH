A 12 year old isn't a farm.
The trolls you encounter on the internet are often part of these farms.
These troll farms are super disruptive.
I am from South Africa and Twitter here is full of hatred for the west but the public consensus is far off from that- most of the accounts spreading the information are named after influential people but have hardly got any photos that prove authenticity.
I am sure Russia uses operations like these to influence the masses on various platforms.
So where was his powerful Russian meddling troll farm last elections?
The only reason he comes out to say this is to sow doubt in the future US elections and to make him self and Russia seem a lot more powerful and capable than they actually are.
This is propaganda 101.
I mean it is propaganda.
Whether it's true or not doesn't really matter anymore, they don't need to medel in your elections if they can just make you think that they've done so.
Their goal isn't to make trump president, their goal is polarization and destabilization.
By all accounts they have been very successful in that.
