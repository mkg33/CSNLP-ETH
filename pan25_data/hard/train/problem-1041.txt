"it's a series of tubes.
And if you don't understand, those tubes can be filled and if they are filled, when you put your message in, it gets in line and it's going to be delayed by anyone that puts into that tube enormous amounts of material, enormous amounts of material.

We have had literal sitting state GOP government officials writing manifestos about "killing all men" who resisted and enslaving the women and children for labor and sexual servitude.
If people think it's bad now, wait until they pass a "moral puritan" evangelical law to round up and kill everyone who looks at literally any type of porn.
If they can't prevent you viewing porn with the current laws, they will keep on going until they have jammers on every corner because it's what Jesus would do!
I know I'm being argumentative but seriously the idea of 'hey lets make it illegal for adults to expose kids to porn' is nowhere near as scandalous as everyone here is making it out to be.
Its exceedingly weird that people here seem to think there's absolutely nothing wrong with children of any age looking at any porn they want to.
Yes violence and gore porn is unfortunately acceptable in media which kids have access to.
It’s American’s hypocrisy roots on display again.
DNC is anti free speech and anti small government.
