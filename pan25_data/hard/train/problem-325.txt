The greater maximum velocity of motorised bikes means head injuries are just one of the life-threatening injuries you can sustain from crashing one of those.
Unless you're hit by a car, on bicycles the biggest risk is head injury, usually from hitting the ground.
What is the percentage of dead in car crashes that are caused due to head trauma when people were wearing seatbelts?
As a percentage of total fatalities when wearing seatbelts.
Drivers already have mandatory helmets.
They're very advanced, complete with airbags to slow down a person in a crash, crumple zones to absorb kinetic energy, and straps to secure a person's body.
These helmets even have roll cages in case someone lands upside down.
That's a cage, not a helmet.
And despite said cage head trauma is still a massive issue in cage crashes.
So it is evident that cagers need more protection in form of helmets.
Their cages should also be covered in bright reflective material and glow like Christmas trees so that they can be seen better, especially at night.
