We aren't Jewish, but once sent one of our kids to a Jewish preschool.
The place had security built into the building and the architecture, staff trained on security and an armed roaming security staff member.
When the kid started going to public schools I felt like we had lost so much security.
School shootings are still a threat but the public school buildings can be ingressed or egressed by ANYONE from 365 degrees and no security guard.
If something were to happen it would just be "call the police and see how many victims were created until police showed up.
".
They get it.
Jews are the most solidly blue voting block in the nation after Black women.
But yes, even then there are some fakakta Jews who vote Republican, but they're way in the minority.
Most people who have opinions on Jews whether they are left or right view Jews, like black Americans, as tokens or those who only exist as minorities of a larger majority.
Another factor is the good/bad faith communication of the majority where the contradictions arise like be anti-Zionist but not being anti-Jewish.
