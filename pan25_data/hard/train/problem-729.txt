Iâ€™m not a doomed or gloomer.
But Dems just figured out, this election, how to even do a bare minimum of what progressive/more aggressive democrats asked them to do.
The GOP play smarter politics than the Democrats - they play dirtier and the Democrats keep doing exactly what they want; hold the center.
Why do you think they keep moving the goal posts?
Compare your country's population and the political parties to most others - you have a pretty progressive population being forced to choose between one conservative party and one bat-shit insane party.
No, it's from living in a country where most conservatives are slightly more left-leaning than most of your democratic party's moderates.
The Democrats are closest to the center among center-left parties worldwide, but in no way are they right of center.
Our democrats are centrist in terms if the US, but if you compared policies and ideals to politicians in other countries, they would actually be more center right at minimum.
"Moderate" (read conservative) Democrats are, at best out of touch and at worst actively against what the voting public wants and cares about.
Actively ignoring this and saying that unity can only be done behind moderate leadership will only exacerbate the system that spawned Trump.
