Lmao.
How do we not have record crime when you have Buisness leaving cities because crime is so high.
Maybe you’re just blind or live in a small town.
But I live in a blue city and I see crime everywhere.
Cities are dirty then ever and the drugs are everywhere.
You can think crime isn’t happening but sadly it is.
Yes, as a conservative I care about crime.
Does that make me a bad person?
I feel like it’s a logical thing to care about especially living in a city.
Plus Most business owners are conservatives and they are the ones was mostly effected by crime.
I care about American businesses the most.
Sooooo I’m not really sure what your point is.
Crime is bad and i worry about it.
I don’t support the left because what have they done for crime?
They left is way more lax on punishment, bail and crime is worse in blue run cities.
Maybe you should do some life experience and visit these cities and you’ll see.
