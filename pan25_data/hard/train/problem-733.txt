This is just a safe comment from a few to make them look good, it’s just rich people virtue signaling.
Nothing is quite as cringy as a billionaire virtue signaling.
The entire corporate apparatus that created their amassed fortunes relied specifically on lobbying both sides of the legislature to perpetuate the tax loopholes that sustained their wealth in the first place.
How stupid do they think people are?
Uh-huh, I can see it now, hundreds of Billionaire protesters chanting in the streets “Tax us now, Tax us now!”.
They've said the same thing for at least a decade now, yet they do EVERYTHING in their power to fight any increase in taxation.
Exactly.
Yet for some reason there's a bunch of temporarily embarrassed billionaires here sticking up for them like we should be grateful they said words.
Yeah, its a bit weird to talk about CEOs in a thread about billionaires anyway - most CEOs are normal rich, not ultrarich.
The owners of Walmart, the actual ultrarich people, make 2,250,000,000 (2.2 billion) per year - they could afford to give each employee a more significant $1000 per year without becoming any less rich.
