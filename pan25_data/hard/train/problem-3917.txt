It baffles me everytime I read that.
In Germany the doctor tells you to stay home and your employer better not even ask how sick you are.
When I go to the doctor most of the time he will ask "how long do you think you need?
End of the week?
".
Yes.
I'm so sure that 10 Republicans would vote to nationalize the railways rather than watch the economy tank so they can blame Biden and dominate the 2024 elections.
Great plan.
Just due to inflation alone, railroad workers would be in a far, far worse position than they are now if they went on strike.
As bad as the economic fallout may be it's not much in comparison to what fighting for labor rights used to look like.
They used to actually fight, much of what we take for granted was fought for at the muzzle of a gun.
Look up the coal wars, the battle of Blair mountain, the Ludlow massacre, etc.
At least this is peaceful.
It seems to me that if that strike were to occur in this country everyone would be pissed at the rail workers for not showing up rather than being mad at the people who treated them like shit in the first place.
Because by taking the action they did, the real message is that the rail companies never have to worry about a strike ever again, because the politicians will always act to shut labor down.
