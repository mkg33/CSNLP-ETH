Where I live, NHS mental health referrals are about 2 years to see a specialist.
Cardiology?
1 year unless you are at immediate risk of death.
emergency room waiting times are about 6 hours standard and can run up to 10-12.
They released the stats and it was in a 'critical' situation for so long that they just changed the defintion of 'critical' to make it stop showing up that way.
That might have made sense a decade or so ago, but our social programs have been utterly gutted by successive Tory governments.
Our NHS is in a failure state in many areas.
The basic private healthcare here is really bad.
Your average person here doesn’t even have the wait forever option.
You legally have to have health insurance or get fined.
This leads to people having garbage health insurance.
The vast majority of Americans have “health insurance” that doesn’t make going to the doctor free.
Going to the doctor is still very expensive in this country.
The whole medical insurance industry can die in a fire for all I care.
It’s a scam.
I actually work in the medical devices industry.
All the healthcare they get in the UK and EU is free.
The question of who will pay for it is very different.
Everyone gets good care from what I am aware of.
Is it state of the art?
Maybe not.
But it’s good enough.
Yes.
A lot of healthcare is good enough and the “state of the art” isn’t a lot better.
