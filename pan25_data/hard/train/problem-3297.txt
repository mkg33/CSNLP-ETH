And the empire before that, Russia has always been like this going back centuries, and it's one reason they are identified as a sort of 'lumbering bear' in artwork and culture.
Not really, they can get a lot of luxury goods, and indeed goods of all sorts, from places like India, Iran, China, Cuba, S. Africa, Venezuela and other pariah state economies like North Korea and Syria.
They even have a competitor to SWIFT.
The west, Obama particularly, was far too slow to react to Putin.
I think we were all a bit slow to react to Putin.
Its not just about luxury goods.
Its about freedom to travel, buy houses in exotic western countries, bang hookers, etc...
Production cost are low yes.
But Russia is a petrostate and needs oil revenues to fund the govt.
Especially during wartime.
They need 80$ oil to fund the govt without a war going on.
They have already entered into a deficit with the sharp drop in oil prices.
The Russian oil just displaces oil elsewhere.
The oil will still flow.
Long term, the outlook isn't so good without western oil firms running their fields.
With the loss of western oil fields they have to figure it out the hard way.
