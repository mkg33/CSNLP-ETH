The definition of "drag" in that bill is so broad it includes trans people, and makes "performance" include basically just existing with people around.
Based on this wording however, I believe this transcends just trans people but anybody who would perform a role that is different to their own gender correct?
" Brought forward by Republican Rep. Jared Patterson, whose district includes the Dallas area, House Bill 643 seeks to include drag as sexually oriented material by redefining drag performances as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a gender identity that is different than the performer’s gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances or otherwise performs before an audience for entertainment.”.
Also, doesn't this break people's right to privacy?
Now whenever a performance is performed anywhere, to prove someone isn't breaking the law, they would have to provide birth records to confirm what they were assigned at birth coincides with the characters gender that they are performing.
