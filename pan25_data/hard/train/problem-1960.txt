Unfortunately not so helpful advice when, a) we're heading into winter; b) not everyone has ground or balcony space to start a garden.
Better off turning to food banks if available.
There's no shame in getting a little bit of help and when things get better, give back by donating to that food bank.
I am privileged to not really understand how people are missing or skipping meals due to money.
Why not make your next meal the largest bag of rice you can afford and at least have rice?
It's about $2.50/kg.
Make meal 2 an equally large bag of lentils.
I dunno - I'm sorry if this comes across insensitive.
I've never had to worry about food.
I do not need to stockpile food, but have no problem eating the same thing over and over.
So when I see something for sale for cheap, I will buy a lot and eat over time, reducing my food bill substantially.
$1.77/Lb for pork shoulder?
give my 20lbs and I will cook it, add red beans, and rice.
$60 for a month of food.
Add frozen veg and maybe double the price.
