CIA being left unchecked is capable of killing someone infinitely!
Consider 600+ Fidel assasination attempts and Havana syndrom retirement benefits.
Fidel's case fed and feed a lot of American families.
If CIA actually get down to take out Putin we will never get rid of the bastard.
Oh no the US sent an assassin to kill Putin... How could this have happened with his massive security around him and in his office no less.
To think this random American who can't even speak Russia somehow made it all the way to Putin's office and shot him in the back of the head with no one in the building aware until he was dead.
Alternatively they blame it on Edward Snowden and claim he killed Putin as some long game bid to assassinate him.
"The sun...
I forgot how beautiful it and the blue sky can be.
I could gaze at the bright heavens for the rest of my days."
- Russian Oligarch, moments before falling out a window to his death, probably.
What if Putin were to fall out of a window unexpectedly, or accidentally shoot himself in the head twice, or have a bizarre gardening accident?
