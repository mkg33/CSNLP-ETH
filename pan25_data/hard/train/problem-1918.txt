There were two bills.
One that required the rail workers to work under the agreed wage increase agreed by the workers and 8/12 of the unions and another bill to give the rail workers paid sick leave.
But, of course, it was Biden's fault... Definitely not the Republicans that voted for the corporations and deny the workers simple paid sick leave.
If it's one bill and republicans vote it down, now the workers strike and that can easily be blamed on republicans.
It's the "optics" angle you talk about but on steroids.
Now with Republicans clearly and obviously responsible for the strike real pressure can be put on them to change their votes and pass the package the workers want.
There is no point in pressuring Republicans to be more pro labor it's not going to happen.
Republicans are undoubtedly the worst choice of our two choices.
That doesn't mean as individuals we should accept and support everything Democrats do just because they are not Republicans.
It's ok to offer criticism and to demand better.
That's how we make progress.
