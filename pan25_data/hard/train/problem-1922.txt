Last year, my uncle asked if I had any room in my safe for an old plinker which had been under his bed for ages (he had some remodeling planned, and didn’t feel comfortable leaving it there while strangers were in his home while he was at work).
Anyhow, I’m now in possession of the firearm that introduced me to shooting sports when I was… idk, seven?
I had completely forgotten about the small, magazine-fed bolt action .22 rifle that my grandfather taught me with as a child.
I’m now 41, and Gramps has been gone from this world nearly two decades.
I've shot older.
Spray a little oil on it and it's good to go.
If it's really rusty, a copper brush and more oil will get it going.
It's a little sad.
Some of these heirlooms were a grandfather's or great-grandfather's war trophy.
It's a piece of the family's history.
A very personal one given France's situation in WW2.
I know this joke gets made often, but one really should have an understanding of the French losses during WWI, when most of the major battles were fought by French, on French territory.
French lost , conservatively, 4% of the country's population during the war.
Imagine if USA lost 12 million military members.
(We in fact only lost about 100k in WWI and 300k in WWII).
Verdun was a battle started by the Germans to literally bleed France to death.
18% of French soldiers in the war died.
Imagine hearing stories your entire life about French losses in war.
Stories your grandparents told of riding and dying with Napoleon in Russia.
With fighting the aprussians again just a few decades earlier.
