As an exmormon, I read that as "the priests and teachers" which in mormondom is what they call the groups of teen boys at age 16-17 and 14-15 respectively, and thought..."This tracks."

Oh, and definitely no more non-consensual sex assignment surgeries on intersex children.

Ie.
There is a married couple and one or both are transgender, but the state has passed a law to disallowing gender-affirming care.
The married couple then are discriminated against as the government is obviously not respecting their marriage.
If a married transgender person cannot get the gender-affirming care from the state based on their identity, then wouldn't the state be discriminating against the person and their marriage.
Gender affirming care for cisgender people is explicitly allowed, it's only for providing care that conflicts with the person's assigned sex.
However breast reductions for cis women would be banned and things like mastectomies to prevent/treat cancers would be severely restricted as the patient would need to prove it was for cancer care rather than gender affirming.
Someone in another thread pointed out that a breast augmentation and reconstruction after cancer is gender affirming care.
