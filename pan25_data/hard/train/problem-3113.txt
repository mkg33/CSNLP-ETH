"Fruit development normally beginsÂ when one or more egg cells in the ovular compartment of the flower are fertilized by sperm nuclei from pollen.

Yup.
My favorite biblical passage to bring up whenever someone wants to ban "sexually explicit" books is the story of Lot's daughters.
They were hiding in a cave with their father after Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed.
Except, they thought the whole world was destroyed.
Luckily, there was wine in the cave so they got their father drunk two nights in a row, slept with him, and then had his babies.
Any kiss that involves an LGBTQ character?
Extremely sexually explicit!
(Though the Republicans in charge will need to read the passages a few dozen more times in private just to be sure.
).
While we are at it.
Milk is white - you know what else is white and expressed as a natural consequence of sex ?
Semen.
So no more animal based milks.
The abominations that are nut milks must be stopped as well because nut is a colloquial term for a man's ejaculate and nether regions.
