Getting to Mars is a matter of human achievement and research opportunities.
There are virtually no economic drivers to reaching Mars or building a base, but we'll do it anyways.
There was no economic driver for the initial missions to the moon either.
It is order of magnitudes simpler to mine asteroids.
I know people are pretty cynical and may never believe this, but I do believe we are going to land on Mars as a matter of human achievement.
There's nothing there for us economically.
Any mineral we could possibly find would probably also exist in asteroids, or be too expensive to bring back to earth on any kind of scale.
Asteroids are waaaaaay more economically viable to mine, and we already have the technology to mine them.
Ok but you also can't move planets closer to earth.
Commercial mining of asteroids would involve first bringing them into earth's orbit, which is actually quite straightforward.
We already have all the technology to mine asteroids, it's just not economically viable yet.
Meanwhile even getting to Mars, let alone setting up mining colonies is going to be a massive undertaking.
Hell, you'd probably never have to work a day in your life if you were able to smuggle a couple of rocks from Mars and sell them.
Then smuggle back the mars opals in your rectal cavity.
That way, you can auction of Opal Anal Beads Made on Mars to the highest bidder.
