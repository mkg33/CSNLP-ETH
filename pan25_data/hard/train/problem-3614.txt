I went to his campaign stop in NW Colorado last year.
The man wouldn’t commit to ANYTHING!
He’s the epitome of a mealy mouthed politician.
Why do you think he's neoliberal?
Remember that even the most centrist Dems, folks like Manchin and Sinema, still voted for major expansions of taxes and government programs for the poor, healthcare, climate, and economic recovery in the end, which goes against the ideas of neoliberalism in an academic sense.
After all, if you take a clear stance, that just makes it easier to criticize you and possibly to alienate the swing voters who matter.
Good to hear.
He's a very centrist democrat with just the sort of appeal that can be best for that district (which is pretty damn red, probably only getting close in 2022 because of the weak incumbent).
It is an extremely red district but it seems there’s enough pissed off, anti clown caucus Republicans in that district to make it a close race, plus I believe redistricting made her district slightly bluer.
So that + Dem presidential year turnout makes 2024 a slightly easier race for him likely.
