They deleted it and then added a long sentence saying criminals can be ordered to do community service or other programs that historically have been used for reformation and rehabilitation.
Sounds to me like this was a nothing change and the status quo of slavery prison work programs are going to remain.
Why include that sentence at all in a slavery amendment if itâ€™s not meant to be a carve-out?
Why include this in the amendment at all if it's not meant to be a carve-out for slavery?
Why not just strike out the old language and be done with it?
Oregon's constitutional article on "Slavery and involuntary servitude" now has a sentence empowering the courts to force criminals into court ordered programs.
It definitely sounds like a criminal exception to slavery to me.
Is the current penal system getting pretty darn close to slavery?
Absolutely, and there desperately needs to be a change, but blaming the 13th Amendment is useless.
The first step to solving a problem is to define it, and if your definition is wrong so will your solution be.
I know exactly what's going on, and I oppose it, but that doesn't mean it was legal in the first place.
It's illegal to drink and drive, but the fact that people drink and drive doesn't mean the law doesn't exist.
The law exists in its application, and it needs applying.
Yes, but the of statutory interpretation limits a modifying phrase to only the term immediately preceding it.
In this case, it only applies to involuntary servitude.
The 13th Amendment gave the option to apply indentured servitude as punishment.
Giving someone community service doesn't strip them of personhood/citizenship/inherent rights and render them property.
