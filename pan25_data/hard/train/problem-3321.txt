Gotcha, thanks for taking the time to write this up.
I completely forgot about the Tea Party movement against Obama in his first term.
I guess it is interesting thay there wasn't a giant sweep as expected.
I've been a bit out of the loop, but as of now does it not seem like Dems lost the house and are fighting for the Senate still?
Then you look at senate, where it looks like Dems at most will lose 1 seat and at best May gain 1?
It’s near unheard of for a profile for how badly the party would struggle normally given the aforementioned economic issues and Biden approval.
But as it stands it looks at most like Biden will have lost maybe 10.
While this is enough to switch power over to Republicans in House, it’s a drastic difference between expectation and reality when it was predicted they could have lost triple that based on historical trends.
And that’s just in Congressional levels, there are some places that had Dems flip state level elections like Governors, leading to, for example, a trifecta of controlling Michigan state government.
