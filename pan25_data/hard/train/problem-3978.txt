The real issue with this is that when you send a letter, nothing happens.
MEANWHILE, penalties and interest continue to accrue -- penalties and interest that you don't owe.
So every time you send a letter, you have to also protest the latest round of penalties and fees.
As a small business owner, I am praying that the IRS gets more employees (exceedingly few of them are "agents.
").
Duh.
Stupid Republicans have been voting for people who significantly lower taxes (remember the GOP Tax Scam disguised as tax ‘reform’) for the wealthy and corporations for four decades.
Don’t pretend useful idiots in the left haven’t abetted this also - always screaming in support of “income tax” increases - when the really rich don’t have ordinary W2 income.
The very rich are quite happy to see the working class attack the professional class (their imagined rich) while their own wealth and income streams remain largely untouched.
Just see the rabid responses on Reddit to a person actually earning 300k (eg a doctor or Silicon Valley engineer).
Those people are not the problem - but you wouldn’t think that.
