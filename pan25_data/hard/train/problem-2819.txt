in Toronto's, used to be best restaurant, Alo, they charge $50 per person when you make reservation.
When you show up that $50 goes towards your bill, if you dont show up you forfeit your $50.
in place i work, if you show up on time of your reservation and for some stupid reason there no table ready for you, you get free glass of prosecco and tiny appetizer, at the bar while waiting.
and we are not by any means fancy restaurant.
That's maybe just not the vibe the restaurant wants to go for though.
Imagine a really nice, formal dinner place.
Think the type of place that you would go on a wedding anniversary, or to celebrate a graduation.
People usually don't just casually show up to these places.
They book weeks or even months in advance.
Sure, a casual restaurant in a bar district may have enough street traffic for no reservations to work.
But for many small restaurants that won't work.
If you have a 35 seat restaurant and don't aim to fill all the seats, i doubt you'll be doing especially well.
If the kitchen gets bogged down preparing orders, i think it's more a function of either staffing issues or menu choices.
If you can't turn out food in a reasonable time, fix the staff or fix what you're offering.
How much of a fee are they going to charge that's going to make a difference to either themselves or their clientele?
If this is a tapas restaurant seating only 35, i can imagine it's not cheap.
A $20 fee isn't going to make a dent in their lost income over a cancellation, and it isn't going to mean much to someone likely to spend $100+ per person at their table.
But if the restaurant tries to make it a more meaningful fee, they're going to really piss off clientele...
Either way the restaurant forces you to pay something for your reservation.
And you cannot reserve through other channels.
