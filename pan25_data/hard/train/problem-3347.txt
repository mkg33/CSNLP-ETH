Promise legislative things the Dems will pass for them in exchange for a moderate GOP representative who allows some Dems to stay on some committees and entirely shuts down the GOP performative witch hunt plans.
I think the dems only need to flip 5 people to have a majority vote on the matter, and there are republicans in districts who could still do well if they sided with dems, as it's pretty apparent that republicans just want to do nothing and obstruct as much as possible.
Get someone that all of the Dems can really around, and either try to get a few to jump ship, or just enough to abstain and prevent one of theirs from getting majority.
It's getting a republican candidate to agree, and getting them five votes from their own party which is the hard part.
So you're looking for a sane republican (in the tradition of years gone by) who still has five votes of respect on their own side of the aisle.
Then you'd have to find Republicans that would also agree to it.
And honestly you're more likely to get the crazies to bring a non-congressperson in than a centrist one.
And the crazies hate liz.
