Yes.
They are doing this knowingly and willingly, their last meaningful act as holders of the house majority, after voters JUST turned out to help them keep the senate.
They're strike busting while masquerading as pro-labor.
Without their intervention, the workers could just exercise their right to strike for better conditions.
Now, explicitly because of them, those workers might be forced to take a worse deal if both bills don't pass.
If that happens, then major companies will take note that if you fail to negotiate and it ends up in Congress, there might be even further punitive changes to better help the side of Labor.
If they don't do this then they get blamed for the economic collapse, so which is better at helping to put more Dems in power longer to pass more pro-labor laws in the future?
It’s like Democrats are being forced between saving millions of jobs or passing sick day resolutions despite there being another party in Congress that is stopping them.
Do you know how Congress and the executive branch works?
Because they can’t magically make 7 sick days appear.
