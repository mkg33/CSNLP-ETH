There's also an immediacy test.
If you tell a group of people "we've got to stop this by any means necessary" and then they march to stop it three months later, it will be hard to prove that your speech caused the action.

Whether he's "bound to uphold the Constitution" is 100% irrelevant to his First Amendment rights.
His inciting speech is protected speech until it becomes "an incitement to imminent lawless action," where such action is likely.
You actually can say words that would do just that, until those words become an "incitement to imminent lawless action," where such action is likely.
What I find interesting is that "likely to incite or produce such action" should probably be viewed in the context of the amplification of that speech.
In other words, if you tell 10 people "someone should break so-and-so's damn neck", the odds are not likely that one of those ten will do it.
But if you tell a million people?
It becomes a lot more likely, statistically speaking.
