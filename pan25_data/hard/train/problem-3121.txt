They’re saying the war is Putin’s fault, was completely unnecessary, and that within the scope of war Russia has been unnecessarily brutal.
Also, Russia’s actions about wanting peace are a load of bullshit and is them wanting a ceasefire over the holidays so they can rearm, reinforce, and prepare a new spring offensive.
Ukraine isn’t falling for that and is going to keep hammering them while Russian troops that do not have proper winter gear will freeze to death.
Russia is losing the war and is in no position to make the demands that they are.
Hell… they don’t even fully control the areas they are demanding outside of Crimea.
So unless Russia learns to compromise their troops will continue dying until they are pushed out of Ukraine.
This creates an impasse and Russia will be able to sat they made efforts towards peace but it was Ukraine who rejected the offer.
Ukraine might even lose some support if they don’t accept Russia’s “peace” offerings.
It’s a gambit by Putin to undermine Ukrainian support and make Zelenskyy into the bad guy.
It's now or never to try and deplete and humiliate Russia for their war on Ukraine.
He will just try again in a year or two.
He's seen what he can get away with.
He knows NATO or any other Ukrainian ally will not step in.
Compromise now and you will regret it later.
He's a manipulative snake and lies daily and just can't be trusted.
