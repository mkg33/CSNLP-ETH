FYI, we don't know what variant of the Sea Kings are being sent.
Nobody has mentioned the anti-submarine version, although it is possible.
That requires the dipping sonar etc.
All that said, it would make sense to give the Ukrainians that capability since it's clearly something they need since the Russian surface fleet is no longer a threat.
Anyway, the scenario in which this protects Ukraine is when Russia fires missiles near the border, so that Poland can claim that they were protecting their own airspace.
That doesn't mean strikes on that energy infrastructure is being normalized, Ukraine has been getting more air defense weaponry as a response to those strikes.
What it means is people are giving different actions different weights.
That's a reality of life.
I'm all for giving even more to Ukraine, these are the best spending of my taxes I've seen for military uses in decades and will reap dividends for decades, but expecting things won't get different weights in terms of attention is a bit unreasonable (that might be too strong of a word, but it's as close a word as I can think of now).
That seems like a pretty narrow view of why a believed strike on Poland got attention.
It could have been a spread of the war to a NATO country, which has all sorts of repercussions that even strikes on energy infrastructure in Ukraine doesn't come close to.
Additionally, every time there's one of these large-scale missile attacks, at least one country to Ukraine.
These fucking morons haven't made the association yet.
The result is also "goodbye Soviet era garbage", except this time T-62s, 72s, etc.
