A few will stay if he loses the primaries but most will abandon him.
The thing about following a “strong man” is that you switch easily when a “stronger man” shows up.
If he loses the primary he will lose his base too.
When he loses his base he will finally be prosecuted.
But that will be small solace considering that after the SC rules the wrong way on Moore v. Harper we will still lose our democracy in a soft coup.
Desantis has the capability to succeed where trump failed.
If trump and DeSantis run against each other the best thing would be for trump to narrowly lose to DeSantis.
Trump will rail that DeSantis stole it from him and his supporters will either protest vote against DeSantis, or trump will run 3rd party guaranting a dem win.
If Trump were smart he'd sink Desantis's reelection campaign so if Desantis tried to run in 2024 Trump can just call him a loser.
With any luck, DeSantis will beat Trump in the primary and then Trump’s ego gets the best of him and he runs third party and siphons votes from ol’ Ron.
I would be so happy.
