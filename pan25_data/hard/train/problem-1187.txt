We don’t really know the scope of everything, so that’s a big assumption to make that our atom count amounts to a hill of beans in the grand scheme of things.
Also, how many atoms are in a star?
I’d imagine more than a human but I don’t really know.
Just that saying that we are significant due to the amount of atoms in our body isn’t a good way of measuring significance since the scale of the universe (and what can even be considered a “big” number) is unknown.
The problem with saying that this or that makes it more likely that life exists elsewhere in the universe is that we don't know what the numbers are, only that they're big.
Exactly, all of the bases in RNA and DNA can be produced by lightning strikes in Earth's early atmosphere, and we've known that since 1952, so the proper reaction to discovering them on meteorites is "so what".
It's not having handfuls of random amino acids that matters, it's having a naturally occurring process to bootstrap evolution.
Graham Cairns-Smith, for instance, wrote a nice book in 1985 outlining how this could theoretically happen through the action of flowing water on clay silicate crystals, the point being not that this definitively happened but that something like that could have happened.
But they don't seem to be self-assembling.
Or if they are, the "supportive environment" is doing a lot of the heavy lifting.
We don't know how they assemble.
Certainly if you put them in a jar and shake it, life doesn't start.
Maybe it would if you did that for a billion years, but maybe it needs something fancier than shaking.
It appears to have happened just once in billions of years.
It seems to be an extremely unlikely event.
The former explanation would suggest life is significantly more rare than the latter would.
It also suggests that the latter would mean all life is made up of the same stuff and divergent evolution is the only significant factor in intelligent species differentiation amongst life on other planets.
