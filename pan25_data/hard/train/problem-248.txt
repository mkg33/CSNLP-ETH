So to be clear, NZ law already states that itâ€™s illegal to discriminate against someone based on their age from age 16.
So this decision applies specifically to 16 and 17 year olds, since the current voting age is 18.
What this ruling is about is it that there is no solid justification put forth as to why a 16 year old can't vote, but an 18 year old can.
yes i totally agree with you on this one because i don't think so at the age of 16 anyone is able to cast vote.
And let's face it, a lot of those 100k teens would be voting along the same lines as their parents, so they wouldn't be gaining nearly as many votes as you might think.
If the 65+ age group feels somehow marginalized by the lowering of the voting age, they may vote for other parties who are not in favour of it.
Given the voting rates in the 18-25 age bracket, it might not be in their best interest to lower the voting age.
They are making the argument that these inconsistencies, especially pertaining to voting rights, must be considered and amended by the NZ parliament.
