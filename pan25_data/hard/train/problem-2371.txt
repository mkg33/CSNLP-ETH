I think he resigned in disgrace, but it seemed to indicate that Paris can't have many well placed assets in Moscow, since it emerged that he advised Macron that Putin wouldn't invade because it was such a stupid idea.
For all their intelligence failures in other fields, they've been bang on with this one, and frequently give the impression of being two steps ahead of the Russians.
Like, suppose western intelligence isn't sure what the Russians are planning - it's a 50/50 between them bluffing and an invasion.
If you go on TV and say "the Russians are absolutely about to invade", you're inviting the Russians to prove you wrong.
On one side, I was of the opinion that Russia truly wanted to invade, so it's easy for me to dismiss this man as an idiot, classic reddit style.
On the other hand, I cannot disagree with his reasoning that "invading is such a stupid decision that I don't think Putin will take it".
He overestimated Putin's intelligence it seems.
I think Putin underestimated the damage the various accusations of Russian influence had done.
Sure everyone that voted for Trump or Brexit rejects that Russia had anything to do with it but it makes it damned hard for people to take a soft line on Russia.
