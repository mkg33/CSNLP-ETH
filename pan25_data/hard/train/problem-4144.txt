I think the salient question here is, "Will FIFA deliberately not play in/withdraw from a country or community that does not respect basic human rights?
".
If my actions, justifiable as they may be, caused my team to be penalized, I would stash the armband somewhere and only don it after the match, when a yellow card would be irrelevant.
It's not exactly a ban, but players wearing the armband would be given an immediate yellow card (this was apparently just announced), so all the teams are saying they'll comply.
LATE EDIT: Two things - first I guess the full penalty would be a yellow card if you wear it on the pitch, and then you would also have to remove it and would get a second yellow (and therefore a red) if you did not immediately remove it.
So really it is actually just a ban.
I just wanted to explain what it meant for it to be "banned.
".
True.
But they decided to compete to host an international sporting event.
It's not like hordes of exposed-shoulder, rainbow flag waving fans randomly showed up at the airport one day.
