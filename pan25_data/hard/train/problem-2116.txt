For sure, and that's even with efforts from our legislature last election redrawing the districts to heavily favor Republicans.
The state still has two Republican senators whose seats aren't really in jeopardy and is pretty much a lock to deliver 6 electoral votes to an R in any presidential elections in the near future.
Johnson County (basically the center of Davis's district 3) is far and away the most affluent part of the state and honestly doesn't have much in common with the rest of the state.
The area has consistently grown over the last decade and if you're young professional working in the Kansas City area then Johnson County is probably where you'd want to live.
Based on current trends I wouldn't be surprised if this district stayed blue for the foreseeable future.
If you look outside that pocket, the reality of the state is much bleaker.
Other than the two main college towns (Lawrence and Manhattan), everything else is pretty deep red including Wichita and Topeka.
What the KS Democrats have effectively done over the past two election cycles is tie the Republican candidates to former governor Brownback and the Republicans have been stupid enough to run candidates affiliated with him.
It's hard to overstate just how catastrophically bad his policies were for KS, particularly the deep red rural areas.
I'll give the voters credit for at least realizing that and wanting to stay away from it even if they vote R elsewhere on the ballot.
Step 3: Just enough voters realize they shouldnâ€™t do that again, and they realize it during the 2018 Blue Wave election and elect Laura Kelly by a razor thin margin.
