Lets not count the chickens before the egg hatches.
There is still a long way to go with this war and a lot of lives to be lost unfortunately.
While Ukraine has been good, I think tbe lines have stabilized and I don't think both side will make any huge gains in the near future.
This war will end with negoiations.
No it will end with Putin and Zelensky in talks with the west mediating.
The only way it ends like germany and Japan is if Ukraine invades Russia and force them to concede and you know that won't happen as well as putin won't just roll over and accept defeat.
You raise a good point, and more people should be careful to not think that Russia is already militarily defeated and we can slow roll support for Ukraine.
Ukraine is already past where the Russians expected them to be past Kherson and troops freed from the fighting in Kherson applies to the Ukrainians as well.
They probably didn't expect Ukraine to retake Kherson and that Maiurpol is likely to return home by sometime in 2023.
