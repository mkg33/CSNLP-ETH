I heard an NPR interview from the leader of one of the unions that voted against the rail deal.
He was pretty reasonable.
He wasn't even asking for 7 sick days.
He was asking for 4.
And he said, "Fine, take away our right to strike, but at least give us the thing that we'd strike for so that we don't have to strike.
Just give us a few sick days in return for taking away our rights."
He sounded so defeated.
The interviewer asked, "Why are you ok with shutting down our economy?"
The union leader said, "We know a strike would have repercussions, but we need our sick days.
We're desperate.
That's why we'd strike, but why is the blame just on us?
Why are we the ones who have to leave with nothing?
Why isn't any of the blame on the rail companies?
Why don't they have to make any concessions?
".
So its not one or the other.
Force the Rail companies to give the Unions what they want.
Instead, Biden is forcing the Unions to take what the Rail companies want.
"Union anger at deals, and at Biden But the membership of four of the unions rejected the tentative deals.
The other eight unions are prepared to honor their picket lines and go on strike as well without a deal or Congressional action, and Biden’s voiced sympathy for the demands about sick time didn’t satisfy some of the union leaders Tuesday.
".
Yes it is.
Congress passes a single bill that forces the Rail companies to provide sick time.
Done.
Strike averted, economy saved, workers get what they deserve.
Instead, this is a transparent political move that pays lip service only.
Democrats can claim they support labor but always knew Republicans would vote it down in the Senate.
