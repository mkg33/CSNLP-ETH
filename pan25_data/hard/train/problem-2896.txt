I mean we will see how much influence Belarus actually has over it's army.
Considering there is a Belarusian military unit in Ukraine fighting Russian that can always return home I doubt they actually deploy or it lasts long than Belarus government.
Also a civil war in Belarus would force Russia to divert military power to Belarus.
I think now we can see the Russians have an attrition based strategy, they must want to pull the Belarusians into this.
What I'm saying is Belarus is trying to make it seem like Ukraine is building troops on it's border.
Then in the coming weeks it's going to be mysteriously attacked by Ukraine unprovoked bringing Belarus into the war officially.
The red flag false flag being the Ukrainians building up and "attacking" Belarus.
I think this is a red flag red flag false flag operation to "justify" more Belarussian and Russian troops to the border to reignite a northern offensive.
This way he can appeal to Putin, that he helped the war effort without actually committing any troops and inviting destruction on his country, by distracting ukraine troops from the russian war front.
Also nr.1 already happened from the beginning, russian soldiers tried to rush Kiev from the Belarusian border.
That's why the Ukrainian soldiers are there in the first place.
