That was the thing that jumped out at me too, like wtf?
It would be one thing if Ukraine was in the EU and this was seed money for some form of reconstruction post-war.
But it sounds like the EU is just going to take the money.
I'm not sure what the expected returns on investment would be on something like this, but I'm sure it's nowhere near that 300 billion total.
Yet I have 300 billion in assets I can leverage as collateral in loans and to put in a balance sheet.
I mean.
It's also weird for balance sheets.
Give me 300 billion of someone else's money.
I promise to give them all of the returns.
This is weird to me.
Why invest and give profits?
This seems like a really round about way to essentially take the money for your own use.
If the EU invests it.
They will without a doubt take fees from the money under the guise of needing to pay people to invest it.
That $330 billion in money will net some bankers some nice fees and some nice bonus checks.
All while locking the money up for years and trickling it into Ukraine.
