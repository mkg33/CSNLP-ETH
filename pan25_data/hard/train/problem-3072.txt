Also, who’s to say what’s “wrong” and what’s not?
Most consider it wrong, but that doesn’t make it the objective statement you phrased it as.
However, nothing can be objectively wrong no matter what it is, because “wrong” is a subjective statement, just as “right” or “good” are.
There is no such thing as “objectively right” or “objectively wrong”.
We may subjectively agree about what we consider “right” or what we consider “wrong”, but that doesn’t make those things objectively so.
“Right” and “wrong” are inherently subjective judgements, no matter how common one particular stance on an action or decision may be.
additionally, the first person to bring up the concept of objective vs. subjective wrongness was yourself.
the person you initially replied to did not say it was objectively wrong.
they simply said it was wrong.
if you believe that there is no such thing as objective wrongness, then you should have no problem with their statement, as it must be their own opinion.
if you believe their opinion that genocide is wrong is incorrect, argue with that, don't attempt to set up a strawman about moral objectivism.
I'd love to hear your explanation of how genocide can be (morality wise) good, to counter an 'it's objectively wrong' argument.
For it to be unable to be called objectively wrong, one needs to be able to prove it can be good (subjectively or otherwise).
