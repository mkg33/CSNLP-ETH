The real core issue is Xi.
He reversed China's previous direction which both makes them a less valuable partner to the west and threatens their economic rise.
So China acts not for the benefit of China as an entity, or the Chinese people collectively.
It acts for the benefit of Xi and Chinese policy is policy designed to make it easier for Xi to rule them, short term and long.
The stuff about Taiwan and Hong Kong is just Xi offering nationalist rewards in exchange for the financial rewards he's been taking away.
Basically the same play as Putin but less incompetent.
These countries have huge populations because they are poor.
They are literally benefitting from western medical advances without having the economic structures that tend to put the brakes on population growth.
As they advance economically their population will fall, in fact China are already facing this.
The demographic collapse of China has been discussed ad nauseam for the past 25 years and will be discussed at lenh for the next 25.
It’s not some secret, it just hasn’t materialized and likely won’t be as catastrophic as people think.
Dude, it hasn't materialized because no one has said it will materialize yet.
Demographics have lag time, explains exactly why it hasn't materialized yet.
