Jeff Flake and Rusty Bowers - while not left-leaning in the national scope of things - are a lot closer to sanity than non-Mormon firebrands like Kelli Ward and Paul Gosar.
Joel John and Tyler Pace - both LDS - were 2 of the last 3 GOP state legislators I'd have been comfortable calling "moderate" in the Murkowski/Romney sense.

Abortion?
LGBTQ rights?
Equal rights?
