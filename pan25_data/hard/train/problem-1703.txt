You don't get "sworn out" of office.
Your term expires at a set point in time, and once that time hits you're no longer President.
Usually the outgoing President attends the inauguration of the incoming President, and once that new President is sworn in the outgoing President is shipped off to their home after some photo ops.
But once a new President is sworn in, the former President no longer has any executive authority.
There's a huge difference between classified military documents and what was likely found in Biden's home.
So far as I know, most of the stuff in his home was specifically relevant to his time as Vice President which could include some briefings, but likely included hand-written notes from meetings he attended as VP, or things as innocuous as his daily schedule.
All of those things get slapped with classified status.
Biden likely filed away some briefings or notes from a speech in a folder, and they were later deemed classified.
It's not like he was just rolling around with documents that contained nuclear secrets or sensitive intelligence from abroad.
We assume classified material means everyone gets quiet and serious... but in a lot of high level government meetings almost everything is classified.
When they say for months they don't have classified documents, and a raid is conducted due to lack of cooperation initially, and they still DO find classified documents after all your lying, it's a big deal.
It is not a crime to accidentally misplace a confidential document, so long as the accident is genuine and not a false cover for stealing, concealing, or deceiving the federal government.
Trump could have avoided a lot of criminality by following proper procedures, but then, the large number of classified documents cases the FBI found with the contents missing indicates he has already sold most of the classified documents he took, and that is the highest possible level of crime here.
