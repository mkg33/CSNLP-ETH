It's very important to remember that Roe v Wade was also important to men too.

I wish the Democrats could get their messaging agreed on gun control.
There seems to be everything from "we need everyone armed to keep the police honest" to "ban all weapons, not just guns".
If the Democrats could get some consistent policy as a baseline party platform, it might let them start picking up the more moderate firearm enthusiasts.
Yeah, I hope the Dems take a lesson here and continue to nominate and run moderate, relatable candidates in lean-R and moderate districts.
