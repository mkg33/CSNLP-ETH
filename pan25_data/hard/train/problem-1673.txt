I personally don't use Tiktok, or generally most social media apps.
But there's nothing particularly noteworthy and some things are even incorrect in that white paper.
I have strong objections against TikTok, but honestly, that white paper looks very superficial, to say the least.
In particular, their objections to MD5, SQLite, and reflection are hilarious.
MD5 is perfectly fine for any hashing that's not required to be crypto safe, such as generating a random file name.
SQLite is used on device, so it doesn't matter that the arguments are user defined, since it's their own data in the first place.
Reflection is not necessarily a security risk, in fact it's very commonly used in Java/C.
While I don't disagree your sentiment.. "Meanwhile China doesn't even let their kids use TikTok."
is deceiving at best.
Yes, they dont have access to TikTok.
They use DouYin, which is basically the exact same app, run by the exact same company.
Indeed, very valid point.
Only ByteDance knows, but I fear that even if actual security issues were found, unless clear malice could be proven (highly unlikely, imo), nobody would listen anyway.
Just as an example, LastPass was renowned for abysmally bad practices almost a decade ago, and it is still one of the more popular password managers.
The public mostly prefers to err on the side of convenience, unless the cost is obviously high, and with such an insidious threat, it rarely is obvious.
Basically, this is a very superficial and nitpicky analysis.
It can all be boiled down to "They're using X, Y, Z, which could be sketchy, but we don't know".
If a student would come up to me with such a report, I would not give them a pass.
The fact that it's full of spelling errors doesn't help it in the credibility department either.
