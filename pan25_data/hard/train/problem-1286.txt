Why wouldn’t you start out with very small objects and keep getting bigger until one gets shot down?
Then only one is detected.
Plus they started out with something with the radar signature of a commercial jet.
I don’t think they’re idiots.
This idea really doesn’t make sense when you think about it.
I guess it's possible that they truly have no idea what it was, though that also seems a bit weird.
We'll probably just have to wait for further information.
I don't know, considering that the US picked up the debris from the first one, they probably have a very good idea of what it was capable of and China would be aware of that, making a stunt like that pretty pointless.
Based on the size and lack of maneuverability, I suspect this isn't going to turn out to be anything noteworthy unless China has decided to send millions of completely useless balloons just to see how many dollars the US can spend shooting them down.
Big takeaways from the article: No maneuverability, tens of thousands of feet lower than the last one (40k feet over US airspace), several times smaller than the Chinese balloon.
