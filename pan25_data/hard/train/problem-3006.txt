If the planned judicial reform is adopted as it stands, France would be forced to conclude that Israel has broken away from a common understanding of democracy.
If Israel isn’t going to be a democracy then we can’t support them anymore.
The entire justification for us providing them with money and weapons has been because they were “the only democracy in the Middle East.”.
Complaining that Israel will not be a democracy when you are trading billions of arms with Qatar is stupid.
This just shows that Macron is virtue signaling.
Says the guy that has zero problems with Qatar.
Israel is a democracy, the changes in the law are not passed yet, you would know if you read the headline.
Not saying the system would be perfect, but the proposed change in Israel doesn't seem so unreasonable to me.
Especially considering that both sides of the Israeli political spectrum seem to agree that some change to the overpowered supreme court in Israel is warranted.
Overriding any law for any reason is kind of what we elect people to do at the end of the day.
Whether or not Israel or any country has a supreme court at all doesn’t really change whether or not it is a democracy, as long as they continue to have free and fair elections, which they do.
