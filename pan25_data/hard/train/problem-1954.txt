That Pence believes his family was in danger and still kept mum about it until after the midterms is astounding.
Even more so when members of his own party were willing to let him be hanged.
Power must be a hell of a drug.
So, in short even having a system doesn't matter if the people using it lack integrity or are more loyal to each other than the country as a whole.
I think you nailed it.
Yeah you got it.
It’s funny I was watching CNN with my mom (who is retired and is addicted to cable news) and Mondaire Jones laid out how the NY Democratic machine under Coumo was insanely corrupt and basically responsible for the deomocrats losing the House.
He laid out every step and the host just kinda nodded and immediately asked about trump.
Like their only move is creating hysteria instead of inspecting real news.
He knows that the corporate media will give him a chance to rehabilitate himself as long as it’s in opposition to Trump.
And I don’t say that in some weird trump defense.
It’s just the facts trump now only has fringe media on his side, but he had an unshakable core of support in that party’s base.
He will almost definitely win the primary damn the general , and all these people will slink back into line because they have no moral compass.
I saw he’s going to have a townhall on CNN to which I reply WHY.
Why is corporate media trying to rehabilitate Pence as some sort of legit politician as if he didn’t serve for 4 years as a loyal VP.
They just failed to understand that he fed on the free negative press, which just supported his, "I'm better because I'm not part of this corrupt system!"
message.
What scares me is that the republican party is trying the same tactic again.
He shouldn't be publicly shamed, he should be quieted.
The most dangerous thing you can give the man is a spotlight.
