Only after he does as much as he can to burn the GOP to the ground.
I'd much rather see a harsh primary and RNC electorate count with him pushing election lies about their primary and then have him narrowly not get the ticket and then have him start a MAGA party with some down ballot MAGA people who he picked who also lost their GOP primaries who get like 10% to 20% of the vote leading to the GOP losing states that are normally lighter red like NC, TX, great lakes states, etc...
Some states have “sore loser” laws that prevent candidates from running as independents if they just lost a primary, but even getting on some ballots would be enough of a spoiler to cost the GOP the election.
Maybe instead of running 3rd party he just screeches about being treated unfairly, the elections being rigged, and encouraging his supporters to just stay home.
This way, we can see who the sycophants are in the GOP siding with him up to the convention, and then, he can split the ticket by running independent in the general election.
I'd rather he run as a Republican throughout the primary, and only when he doesn't get the nomination, he runs independent.
