They had just upgraded some radar installations and apparently could spot it.
The radar cross sections are rather quite small and the movement patterns wouldn't be something the systems would be keyed in to track.
Now they are.
If infrastrure and the like is properly designed to mitigate it, it's less of a problem you may think.
The biggest issue may be those with pace makers.
No.
The US airforce actually tested airborn dispersal of biological agents in like the 50s over San Francisco and found its not an effective vector.
This was with actual planes, not ultra lightweight air balloons so the dispersal would have been more concentrated and closer to the ground.
The balloon you would need to spread germs is pretty much the opposite of a spy balloon that wants to be high for good camera + comms coverage.
Wouldn't a balloon be an effective vehicle to spread airborne biological agents, in a discreet manner?
I'm not suggesting that's what they are used for, but testing the approach using regular balloons, might be useful for knowing whether the method is viable.
