Yes, imagine a new country with one state suing another.
Who hears the case?
Has to be a federal judiciary to resolve issues that involve different parties in different states as well as apply the law as written.
Yes, BUT if all constitutional language could be subject to contemporary reinterpretation, there goes any concept of settled law.
So now you support treating the Constitution as a living document, interpreting it as changing with the times?
In your previous comment, you acted as though originalism is all that stands between us and chaos.
Then later comes 2A.
This, of course, doesn't prevent personal self-defense uses of guns, but it certainly doesn't look to mean the right is enumerated, either.
To me, taken as a whole, the Constitution is explicit about being armed for serving in militias, and silent on an individual right, but allowing for the possibility for states to grant such a right, as you said (basically in inverse).
To some extent the question is whether there was an unenumerated right for individuals to keep firearms prior to ratification of the Constitution.
Given the prevalence of firearms in private hands before the Revolutionary War and since, it seems difficult to conclude there wasn't.
Re your 2A argument, given the ACTUAL presence of privately owned firearms in the colonies in the 1770s, it was clear by facts on the ground that the people already had firearms in their personal possession.
Did that imply an unenumerated right to keep and bear arms?
