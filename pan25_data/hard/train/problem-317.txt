They are in self made prison, before hamas they could enter israel freely and israeli people went to the Gaza beach.
Fighting israel caused all of this.
The same in the west bank.
Before the sixth day war israel didnt think to attack Jordan.
Cause and effect my friend.
Few thousand years ago jews could walk freely and there is a lot of archeological proofs for this.
The fact that they choose to try to kill the Jewish nation at its start and that Muslim nations dont want them is their cosmic problem.
It's only an issue because the Arabs attacked Israel when it became a state with the intent to destroy Israel.
I don't forget this conflict started decades ago- but it started by the Arabs attacking Israel.
And it will continue until the Palestinians recognize violence isn't a solution and that peace is the only way forward.
The problem, of course, is that attempting to live in peace has never been an option the Palestinians ever entertained.
Had they bothered to engage in peace talks they'd be in a much better position.
They'd still he able to peacefully walk into Israel with the original borders intact had they attempted to live peacefully and not engage in an ethnic cleansing and genocide of Israel.
Let's not forget that's the reason for this conflict and why the borders are what they are.
Because none of the neighboring countries of Israel, and the Palestinian couldn't live with the thought of Israel existing.
No decent person or country can support Israels occupation of Palestinian Territory and building settlements on them.
Israel should be supported in its existence under Territory recognised by the UN ie 1967 borders.
