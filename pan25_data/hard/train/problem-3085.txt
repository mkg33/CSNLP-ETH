There's a non zero chance that Russia will get re-invaded by Zelenskyy's army after they're pushed out of Crimea.
No, if Ukraine is to achieve victory, Ukraine is going to have to attack Russians, in Russia, on Russian soil.
The war will have to be brought into Russia.
There is just simply no other way.
Ukraine will have to kill those they must, and talk to those they can.
There is no other way... if Ukraine is to be victorious.
You vastly underestimate the Russian government's grip on information within Russia.
Additionally, you vastly underestimate how prideful(to a fault) the Russian people are.
If the Russian government tells them that everything is going well, most will believe it, in spite of the mountain of evidence to the contrary.
Russia keeps telling its populace that all is well and good, the "special operation" is going all according to plan, all goes well.
Ukraine has to show them the opposite is true.
Ukraine has to kill them both on the field of battle and OFF the field of battle, and make a problem so big that not even Russia can hide it, ignore it, or explain it away.
While I support the Ukrainians in this unprovoked fight, I certainly wouldn't put Ukraine on a pedestal and assume they wouldn't target any Russian target at this point, because shit happens in war, and that is just the way it is.
Ukraine has to act as “good” as possible or it would start to erode the general global attitude of “Ukraine needs help because they’re being attacked.” No one is gonna give aid to someone being belligerent.
