If you want to understand what is going on in Europe, imagine this: Mexico (a sovereign nation who supposedly has the choice to form their own alliances) is inviting Russia to form an alliance and establish a military presence in their country, and it sounds like Russia is considering taking them up on it.
Do we wait for Russian arms to arrive, or do we get a head start on dealing with it?
Surely we wouldn't just allow Russia to box us in because "Mexico has the right to choose"?
A diplomatic solution is the lesser of two evils.
Take "completely defeating Russia so they aren't a world power anymore" off the table (because it's a nuclear holocaust), and consider how we get from where we are, back to a state of coexistence.
Let's not forget that we even have countries in Nato, who are actually in dispute over a similar situation to Ukraine/Russia who are treaty obligated to protect each other, but hate each other.
And assume Russia will respond to western military alliance/presence in Ukraine the same way we'd respect Mexico's sovereign right to invite Russia in next door to us if they decided to (you know darn well we would stop it at all costs).
If you refuse to look at it from the enemy's perspective and offer them an outcome we would accept in their shoes, you are seeking war, not peace.
In 1940 only our troops were at risk and nuclear ICBMs did not exist.
America was mostly isolated from the war in our homeland.
