I don't know how any one in their right mind can have watched the way the Republicans and Democrats handled the impeachment hearings and not see it's apparent that some (not all) Republican State Senators and Republican House Reps are clearly compromised.
They weren't interested in any due process, evidence, or serving the American people and weeding out corruption, wherever it lie (regardless of party affiliation) but were seeking to just shit on a legitimate process, intimidate witnesses, and dilute the focus of the issue(s) at hand with nonchalant BS.
That said, it's so apparent to me that the Republican party is highly influenced by outside interests (Russians, Chinese, all of the above?
WTF do I know?)
All I know is that it seems to me that it's undeniable that between two evils, they are the greater of two evils and have less interest in serving the American people VS their democratic colleagues.
That isn't an attack necessarily on all Republican candidates or those holding office OR Republican registered voters OR those who subscribe to a more conservative mentality or opinion...
Yes, there is corruption on both sides.
There is and always will be corruption of officials in any government, in any country.
Yes, the two party system sucks and yes, Democrats aren't perfect as a party and sometimes their legislation isn't great either, as with any party, in any country ever...
I'd agree the republican party is compromised, but I'd laugh in the face of anyone who claims the left isn't as well.
