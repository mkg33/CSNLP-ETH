By voting not to hold the lead conspirator of the coup guilty, despite having knowledge and evidence to the opposite, he became an accessory after the fact.
On top of obstructing the bipart Jan6 committee.
He wasn't an impartial bistander, he was a key enabler of the coup attempt and the subsequent cover up.
It makes sense if you recall the violent coup that almost ended our democracy that had happened not even two weeks prior.
And from what was revealed afterwards they were still plotting after Jan6, members of his cabinet had to resign and they were considering invoking the 25th.
Yes, she did resign... but some argued it was to remove herself from the cabinet, so she wouldn't be caught with a decision whether or not to vote to remove Trump via the 25th Amendment.
I too wished McConnell and more of the GOP would have voted to remove him; it would have eased many people's minds, and more directly placed the blame on Trump, but impeachment itself was largely performative.
Trump only had 2 weeks left in office, and everyone at the top was assured that Trump basically had no tangible power.
It made little sense or difference for Pence to be President for 2 weeks.
McConnell isn't McCarthy.
McConnell has gone against Trump in just about every bill that passed over the past two years.
McConnell doesn't seem to give a fuck about Trump.
If I'm not mistaken, she was one of the people that immediately resigned from Trump's administration after Jan 6.
