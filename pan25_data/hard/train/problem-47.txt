Is that how something would backfire?
It seems like a natural consequence, but nonetheless does not diminish the innate value of the legislation to protect the animals.
Not only is it dangerous, but it’s not fair to such a smart and complex animal to keep them in captivity, deprive them of their natural familial bonds, and restrict their autonomy.
It’s either misguided or selfish, it’s not kindness to the animal at all.
Domestic dogs are the only wolves who have entered into a contract to share our homes with us, the rest of them want to stay free and independent and will suffer when they are deprived of that.
Wolves are at home in the wild.
Don’t keep them from their home.
Didn’t know it’s anthropomorphism to say that keeping intelligent wild animals is usually bad for the animals’ well-being.
Is it also humanizing animals to point out that owning something that can kill you and taking risk that kind of risk with it is also shitty for the animal?
If it kills you, it’ll almost certainly be destroyed, and it’ll be entirely your fault.
But no one should care about that whatsoever, right?
Because according to you caring about the well-being of animals is the same as pretending they’re human.
I've always wondered what is the actual deal with people who would rather own a dangerous wild beast than a normal pet like a dog, cat, or rabbit.
Is it a mental health thing, or what?
Fair enough, and I'll clarify my point of view by saying that being an animal caretaker/trainer at a zoo, aquarium, or animal sanctuary is totally fine and I can see the appeal.
Crucially though, these facilities have experts on staff and need to comply with safety regulations, etc.
Also, you'd be getting paid to do that, rather than paying your own money to do it.
