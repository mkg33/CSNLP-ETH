US federal agents actually escort ships carrying cocaine into ports in Miami, then it's loaded onto cargo planes and distributed throughout the US in aircraft that are sanctioned and protected by the CIA.
This among many other surprising strategies was revealed in the Senate intelligence Committee Report on CIA Torture which was released in December of 2014 and which almost nobody read.
Not in the USA.
In the USA, consumer behavior differs from other countries where drug legalization programs reduced consumption.
"With the current research, it is suggested that legalization of marijuana and subsequent opening of dispensaries have little to no adverse effects on crime rates, specifically in the long-term.
Wu and colleagues (2020) found that property crimes decreased following Colorado legalization in 2012.
In Washinon, property crime, larceny, and violent crime rates dropped, while aggravated assault saw no change.
Lu and associates (2021) saw no long-term changes to crime rates within Colorado or Washinon following legalization of marijuana.
Although there was a statistically significant increase in property crimes in Colorado immediately following legalization, they were suggested to be driven by an increase in larceny that occurred prior to legalization.
In Washinon, there was a statistically significant increase in property crimes, burglary and aggravated assault, but only in the short-term.
No long-term increases were reported".
