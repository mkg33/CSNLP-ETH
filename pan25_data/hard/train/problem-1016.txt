And in order to succeed the filibuster must be removed and either Conservative SCOTUS judges replaced or two new judge positions added to the Supreme Court.
Sadly the only way to protect everyone’s abortion rights is for the Federal Government to codify it, something that won’t happen with Republicans/Conservatives having control of either Congress and a SCOTUS that is mostly in their pocket.
Sadly, the only way to protect abortion rights is for the people to keep electing those who will keep protecting abortion rights, including, and especially, those who nominate and confirm people to the judiciary.
Codifying a right to abortion nationally is that much easier and people aren't idiots, they know that if things continue to swing right with the current day manifestation of the GOP that they will not stop at abortion and it will only be a harder fight.
It will absolutely effect the run off, of course it will - people are emotional creatures, the fact that the right just got fucking spanked over trying to take us back to the last century and are still going hard for trying to pass laws that are going to kill women is what takes precedence.
That assumption is precisely why the GOP just got fuckin' spanked.
We're talking about Georgia here, they are only just beginning to turn into a swing state.
Of course it goes to run off.
It's actually kind of silly to think it won't.
Since when is the public perfectly rational?
How will this put a damper on an already red hot enthusiasm amongst dems in Georgia exactly?
And just because dems will lack 60 votes does not mean that this will not continue to keep their base engaged on these issues - the opposite effect in republican voters in rural areas was actually noticed for the mid term election, so I wonder what the timing of this will do to their enthusiasm combined with the piss poor showing on the midterms overall for what was supposed to be a red tsunami, as they say.
