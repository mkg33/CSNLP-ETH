People I think forget that he’s run for President before, even money says he did it those times to fundraise and that he’s doing it this time to help pay for shit, then when desantis shows more support he will drop out and say he’s focusing on bigger shit or something after taking that money.
He doesn't have the ideologically motivated, well financed, people to actually do the things you need to do to run for the presidency and he's not gonna do it himself, so his threats would just fizzle out.
It seems that it's happening with his republican campaign.
Probably.
I've said before regarding his threat to run as an independent if he lost the 2024 primaries:
The people that actually controlled and ran his 2016 and 2020 campaigns are gone now, he's incapable of the discipline to find a new, competent staff, and further he narcissistically believes 2016 was a success all because of him, not anybody else, so he doesn't need to do anything to succeed.
Edit: And that's without discussing everything on the criminal / legal side of things he's having to deal with.
That and the fact that there's a long list of crimes that he may be going down for soon and he has a history of pinning his crimes on people that work for him.
