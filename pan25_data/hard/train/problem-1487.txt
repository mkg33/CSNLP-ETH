The evangelicals are not stupid, they will not give up their chance at power just because 20 Republicans are throwing a playground tantrum over not getting enough publicity.
Republicans acting surprised that the people who didn't care if the government shut down or we defaulted in our debt as long as they got a political win don't give a fuck if the mainstream republicans lose as long as they collect a win is hillarious.
So... not saying that the House Republicans are alpha strategists, but what if they are willing to let Jeffries be the Speaker just so that the GOP, who are still in the majority, can clog everything up and blame the Democrats for all of the stalemates?
So, to the holdouts case, they can either have no power under the GOP, or no power under a Dem leader who will not have a majority to pass anything and they can deflect onto him being unable to get things done.
If they end up giving Jeffries the gavel, he'll have it worse than McCarthy; They don't have to vote with him just because they caused him to be Speaker.
If McCarthy won't give them committee assignments, then they're not going to have them under Jeffries either.
