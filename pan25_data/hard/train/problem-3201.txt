It's not like California where Democrats win by 15-20% in the governor's races.

But god DAMN was I nervous.
For a couple weeks before the race, forecasters were saying that the Republican was favored.
Oregon has not elected a Republican governor since 1982, and I really wanted to keep that streak going!
Look at all of Oregon's governor races over the last 20 plus years.
They're all within 5%age points.
Tina is up 4 now, and there's still a lot of vote left to count.

She didnt deserve the win.
The dems in our state have become corrupt with power ignoring the will of the people.
They needed a kick in the pants which they didnt get.
