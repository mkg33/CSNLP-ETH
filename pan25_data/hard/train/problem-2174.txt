Hmmm looks like the russian economy is tanked even harder with the war and there is a high probability that this will end with the pike in putins ass up the way to his head.
Sooo great job.
That's pretty much how it has always worked.
Except substitute EU for the U.S. You think the sanctions on Iran and Iraq were supposed to be fair or something?
The global financial system is a tool of U.S. politics.
Always has been (since WWII anyway).
Cost us against who, exactly?
The West and its allies still control the entire global economic system.
Even China, the closest thing America has to a rival, isn't openly supporting Russia, because they don't have alternative markets, partners, financiers, investors, etc.
The Kremlin’s right about this, just not in the way they think.
Zelensky’s already said the war ends when Ukraine recovers every inch of occupied territory, including Crimea, and Russia is made to pay reparations.
That’s what the Kremlin meant, I guess: Zelenskyy can decide if the war ends once the Russian banditi are thrown out of Eastern Ukraine and Crimea or when they have successfully taken Moscow lmao.
For once, Peskov the Kremlin mouthpiece is right, Zelensky will end the conflict when every last Russian soldier is killed or kicked out of every inch of Ukrainian sovereign territory.
The reason the war in Ukraine “could be a lenhy process.” is because Russia will never win, only defeat and utter humiliation await Russia at the war's end.
