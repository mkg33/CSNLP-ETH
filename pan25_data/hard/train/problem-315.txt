Despite the narrative that Crimea belongs to Ukraine, that only happened in ww2.
Before Crimea was independent, and in the early 90s they voted for independence from Ukraine before the ussr dissolved, and voted to be an independent nation after.
They ultimately decided to join Ukraine, but the relationship was always strained, and independence from Ukraine remained popular, as did joining the Russian federation.
Basically, half the people wanted out of Ukraine anyway, the other half were ambivalent but fed up as a result of the revolution, Russia was popular, and opportunity knocked.
Because Ukrainians never thought Russia would just swoop in and annex their territories because Ukrainians decided to get rid of one of Russia's puppet presidents in Ukraine.
They thought Russia would honour the treaties and agreements they signed, they thought Russia respected their sovereignty.
Unfortunately they were dead wrong.
Because Ukrainians didn't resist at all, not the military, law enforcement or civilians.
They were basically caught by surprise especially considering the political chaos in Ukraine at the time.
