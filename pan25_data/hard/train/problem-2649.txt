The problem is that both major parties are very good at convincing the masses that the country will die if the other major party wins.
Every election in my lifetime has been called the most important election in our history by one or both major parties.
It's tired and old and doesn't really say much good about democracy.
What good is anyone's vote if it's just between two pieces of crap and we aren't supposed to actually vote for anyone worth a damn?
That only will happen if people stop voting out of fear and start voting for the candidate they actually most agree with regardless of party.
It's a self fulfilling prophecy.
The only way to make a real change in the system is to go ahead and "throw away your vote" by voting third party.
As more and more people do each election cycle, it will convince more and more people to do the same.
At the very least, the "spoiler effect" will make the losing major party realize they have to actually earn votes and not just take them for granted.
This only rewards the greater of the two evils and two parties is the natural outcome of any first past the post voting sysytem.
