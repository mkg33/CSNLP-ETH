My guess is Meadows is about to be named as one of the witnesses in Willisâ€™ Grand Jury investigation who is suspected of lying under oath.
((I hope!
).
Eh.
Top witnesses are commonly interviewed towards the end of an investigation, when prosecutors have a good sense of all the facts.
Prosecutors want to go into these interviews knowing what questions to ask, what threads to follow, and knowing, more or less, what answers to expect.
The DOJ already interviewed Marc Short and Greg Jacob, Pence's Chief of Staff and lawyer, and at least two other top Pence aides, before a grand jury almost a year ago.
They have had Meadows' phone records for at least 10 months.
Not to mention testimony and/or siezed phone/communications/electronics from nearly every Trump lawyer, advisor, and aide, and Eastman and Clark, and Trump's PAC, and everyone who financed or planned the Jan 6 rally.
They are not going into the Meadows and Pence interviews expecting to find new bombshell information: they know all about the discussions and events that took place in the White House surrounding Jan 6, the fake elector scheme, the pressure placed on Pence to refuse certification, etc.
At this point they are, in all likelihood, just looking for corroborating testimony to wrap up these branches of the investigation.
It hasn't been that quiet.
At least a few times per month for the last two years we've gotten news of significant steps, subpoenas, court battles, etc.
as the investigation has moved steadily forward, step by step.
