Yeah, that's fine, pay isn't everything.
I got no problem with them holding out.
It's really not the point though, which was how Democrats really aren't as pro worker as they would like everyone to believe.
I'm sorry, but if you really think the Democrats are pro labor you have no idea.
Republicans are definitely anti-labor, the Democrats are also anti-labor.
They're just a lot better at hiding it.
I shame Republicans everyday for being anti-labor.
I'm gonna shame democrats for being anti-labor too when this was a stupid move.
So we split the bill and here is the chance to call out the republicans for being anti-labor and what are people doing?
The bidding of republicans in blaming dems.
Either way Republicans are gonna spin it to make the Dems look bad.
At least in the latter situation, the Dems actually stood with the union.
The act of splitting it into two is a union-busting move because it was pretty obvious that if you put up a bad bill and a good bill to Congress, Republicans will always vote in favor of the bad bill and against the good one.
