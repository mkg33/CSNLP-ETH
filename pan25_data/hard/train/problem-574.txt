\1 Make cops carry insurance against any lawsuits similar to how doctors have malpractice insurance.
\3 Get rid of internal affairs departments that are just made up of cops investigating themselves.
Police departments should be audited and overseen by civilian oversite so if you have to make a complaint against a cop you're not just reporting it to one of their buddies on the force.
\2 Have cops licensed similar to CDL truck drivers where if you do mess up it gets written to a permanent record that follows you so you can't just up and move to another department in another city with a completely clean slate.
If you mess up bad enough no more policing for you.
Someone should tell the DOJ they should be warning the police agencies to pucker up, cos they coming after ya.
Maybe the DOJ should change something about how people become cops so stupid fucking shit like this stops happening.
It’s time for police reform, full stop.
Stop branding it as “Defund the police” and call it “Police accountability” or “Law enforcement reform”.
I’m fine with fully funding law enforcement and believe a strong police force is necessary, but with that funding comes more responsibility.
You should be paid very well as an officer, but they should be held to a higher standard and be monitored much more than they are now.
Of course a full solution is much more comprehensive and nuanced that this, but these basic tenets is where I believe legislators need to start for the public to regain trust in our local police.
Also, criminal liability needs to be reformed as well.
Penalties are enhanced if a civilian commits against a law officer.
It should also work the other way.
The public have put our trust into our law enforcement to uphold our laws.
If police abuse their position and commit criminal actions against civilians, they should face enhanced criminal liability.
