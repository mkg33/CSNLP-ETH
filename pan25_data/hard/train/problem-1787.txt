I have never heard any arguments that it is about covering negligence.
It is always presented as a solution to murders and violent crime usually by making gun ownership more expensive.
Everyone.
The same as any other crime we have to pay for.
Think there should be specific fund for these victims, increase the sales tax.
We can all pay into it.
Except its not like cars at all.
Cars aren't an enumerated right.
Cars have issues with very high rates of accidents and that is not the issue with firearms.
The issue with firearms is intentional criminal violence, which insurance generally doesn't cover.
Cars only require the insurance to operate on public roads, you do not need insurance to simply own a car.
As a note though, cars only require insurance when driven on public roads.
So this would be more equivalent to carry guns needing to be insured (which MIGHT have more than a snowball's chance in hell of passing).
There are some things that could be thrown into the bill to garner support as well, namely deregulation of silencers, SBSs, and SBRs.
