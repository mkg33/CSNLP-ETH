If Starbucks closes a store because it wasn't safe, then shouldn't the former employees be able to sue Starbucks for having an unsafe working environment?
i think that argument would be hard to make since Starbucks took action and resolved the unsafe situation (albeit in a way employees might not appreciate, but shutting down the store certainly is a remedy to unsafe working conditions).
Or we could be less biased, they want to be successful in whatever they're trying to accomplish, and unionization dramatically reduces their ability to nimbly participate in the market.
I'm not saying unions are always bad, but it's pretty unscientific to just presume unionization always benefits the worker, and even more incredulous to presume that benefit is worth the potential aforementioned downsides.
Here is a thought, the anti union propaganda, that's says corporations can't fire a union worker no matter what is actually a hyperbole response to them being unable to fire a union worker for just any reason "totally not about being union" (but in reality was because they were union and the company is just looking for a legal excuse).
