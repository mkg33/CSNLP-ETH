Tl;Dr: F-35 is the best jet.
It can land on US helicopter carriers, Ergo US has like 20 F-35 capable ships.
Why does the USA need aircraft carriers?
Same reason - power projection.
Carriers are the biggest, baddest things on the high seas, and navies are how nations exert hard power over places far from their borders.
Right now, the USA has the biggest navy and most carriers by a massive margin, so they get to have all that influence to themselves.
China sees itself (probably correctly) as the biggest and most likely competitor to the USA's global hegemony, which means they need to compete in power projection, which means a big navy, which means carriers.
Ultimately, to fight the US, and not just get choked off, China would need to be able to fight the US navy even away from its shores - not necessarily "threaten the US coast", but definitely in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf.
And that is going to take a pretty significant fleet, because China can't really hope to get a fleet to those seas without its enemies noticing, and they can't send everything and risk none of it getting back home...
In the event that China and the US get into a serious confrontation, there's little doubt that the US would move to interrupt seaborne trade with China.
There's... not a lot that China can do about that at present.
They have a significant missile force that could threaten US carrier groups near their shores.
(The efficacy of that force is open to some question, but it'd be foolish to assume it was wholly ineffective.
).
However, China does most of its trading with countries well beyond the reach of its missile defenses, and in those waters, the US navy is essentially unchallenged.
Oil shipments, in particular, would be choked off in their entirety.
The current Chinese navy wouldn't have a hope in hell of pushing through an escorted convoy to the Middle East and returning.
