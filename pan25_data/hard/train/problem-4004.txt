The federal government should begin to seriously consider labeling the GOP a domestic terror organization, especially if this incident is linked to right-wing actors/conspiracy theories and/or the GOP refuses to outright condemn it.
This is a good point, and is probably the only point I’ll accept for the media not calling this terrorism.
From what I’ve read on the matter, all signs point to this being a terror attack, but perhaps the media/authorities don’t want to jump the gun because, if and hopefully when they do declare this an act of terror, the right/GOP is going to use this as another “see, the Libs are at war with us They’re calling us terrorists” rallying cry.
