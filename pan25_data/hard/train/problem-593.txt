Without a majority in the house, Dems wonâ€™t get much legislation passed.
However, retaining control over confirming appointments is a massive win.
Only if moderate Republicans pull off a coup and build a coalition for the speakership with the Dems.
Otherwise, the speakership will be decided by the Republican Party plurality of crazy.
And without the speakership, Dems have no control over the house agenda regardless of how many Republicans would join them in moderate legislation.
Republicans, for whatever reason, ASSUME that if Democrats take control of the legislature, that they (the Democrats) will treat Republicans like Republicans treat Democrats when Republicans are in power.
Democrats don't eviscerate oversight committees in order to make hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars disappear.
Democrats don't file frivolous lawsuits to keep relief funds from reaching their intended recipients.
Democrats don't send out police to assault conservative protesters and drag them into the backs of unmarked vans.
Democrats don't reorganize the governments of blue states to ensure that Republicans never win again no matter how many votes they get.
They aren't losing because the GOP is avoiding any kind of internal reckoning, they're losing because they've got a base that has been radicalized to the point that they can't nominate people who will win as long as Democrats show up to vote.
Their reckoning came and went, and the conservative wing of the party lost that fight years ago already.
