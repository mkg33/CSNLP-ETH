The church sold the land to a corporation it thought was Palestinian-owned, and wouldn't have sold it if it had realized the corporation was actually Jewish-owned.
The mentioned that the church was previously criticised for selling 11 hectares to 2 israeli settler corporations, tge land that was leased for 70 years isnt mentioned as being sold.
Okay so I've read this article like 3 times, it says that the land is owned by Greek Orthodox Church and then states that the church has been doing deals with Israel for selling/renting their lands.
Other than that it doesn't clearly say why it was seized and what is the Church's reaction to that alleged seizing.
Because they realized that in todays times you just need a big and flashy headlines to get people's attention.
You can literally put a picture of a Koala as the article's sole content and it wouldn't make a difference; the masses would still draw their conclusions from reading just the headline.
Have you read the article besides the headline?
It basically says nothing but that the church could have made a deal with Israel to purchase/rent their land.
I take it it's a purchase of Palestinian land and that this is illegal under Palestinian law.
If that were to be the case, how has the operation been carried out with the consent of the Palestinian authorities?
Somethings that I still need to clarify is whether this was a purchase in Palestinian land, what court did the ruling, if it were to be Palestinian land, why did this court side with the buyers given that it's illegal under Palestinian law, and why are now Palestinian authorities protesting this ruling.
