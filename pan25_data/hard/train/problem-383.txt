Yet not a single peer reviewed study has shown any other mechanism.
You have to be truly stupid to embrace the talking points of petro-states that keep lying about this.
And yes, that includes Red America, as much of their economy is based on fossil fuel extraction in Texas, the Dakotas, West Virginia, and Oklahoma.
They lie because it's in their financial best interest to believe that lie.
If they haven't done peer reviewed science, they are simply opining.
There is virtually no work actually being done in the field that supports any other conclusion than anthropogenic climate change at this moment.
Meanwhile, on planet Earth, the hundreds of thousands of scientists who actually study climate change, AND THE OIL COMPANIES WHO DID IT, admit that climate change is real, it's man made, and that we have to do something about it.
Weird that the overwhelming majority of actual climate scientists agree man is playing a huge role in climate change.
97% of scientists agree that global warming was upon us or climate change.
That figure is actually skewed massively.
Look at the data yourself instead of looking to side with the populist opinion.
I would postulate you have limited knowledge on the subject and comment for upvotes.
If you look through historic data you will see that we have been living in a goldie locks zone as far as temperature is concerned we used to have wild swings.
Look at Professor Randall Carlson.
