I will flat out refuse any automatic tip included.
If they are upfront about it and I know before hand there is a small chance I will eat there.
If its not made clear before hand I will not pay it.
I most definitely won't eat there again.
I will also make a small scene about mistreating employees and hanging the garbage on the customers with a little bit about unionizing.
I have no problem speaking up when a business owner mistreats their employees because the worst they can do is ask me to leave, which is fine because I won't do business with a place that mistreats its workers.
You’re describing a company mistreating its workers for your refusal to tip, or lack of right not to tip.
Everybody knows 20% gratuity is the standard today for decent service.
If you’re not prepared for that, please stay at home.
You’re not doing the people in the industry any favors with this rhetoric and most would be incredulous that you act like you’re hoisting the banner in their name.
Some restaurants attempted what you speak but suffered because their competition did not.
Danny Meyer restaurants come to mind.
The effect is 3-fold; prices are set higher than their competitors, consumers feel locked in to a high rate despite their experience and many operators cannot resist the temptation to use those tips to pay non-tipped positions.
In time, the top sales people walk rather than face reduced pay, causing staffing problems at the very least.
There’s plenty of professional service people out there at every level.
I push back against the idea that servers should all make the same wage at a restaurant or have their wage set at the discretion of somebody not making the sales.
More and more it is.
Especially after the pandemic.
There’s a lot of levels of service, with very different skill sets.
For some, I wouldn’t want the 20% auto-grat because it would be a pay cut.
On others, especially where it’s high volume and low check averages, I’d take the 20%.
