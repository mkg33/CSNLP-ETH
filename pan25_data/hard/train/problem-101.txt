It's happening in front of our eyes.
There were kids when I was teaching who would enter my upper levels without even knowing how to type or how to read grade level.
It's upsetting.
The lack of teachers are meaning that schools are having to basically be taught by a screen while in school, because they don't have a math teacher.
It is vile and despicable how this is happening everywhere.
Yup.
I had that happen so many times last year.
A kid went away for months, came back, and then left again.
No one knew where they went.
They just dropped.
Our state DHS is so understaffed they can't even investigate.
Our schools are so understaffed they even thought to bring DHS workers to the schools to keep them open when half the schools shut down due to astronomically high covid cases.
We are in full suck in Oklahoma, and there are countless kids suffering here.
>Certainly, there are responsible homeschoolers who have developed sound programs to educate and socialize their child.
But without requirements to provide sound evidence of learning, a sudden spike in homeschooling should be a cause for alarm, not celebration.
Itâ€™s bizarre that parents have the ability just to award a high school diploma in some states without actually having to prove their kid would get one through testing.
