Lester Holt (NBC), David Muir (ABC), and Norah O’Donnell (CBS) would beg to differ.
Any one of those three channels, 6:30 on a weeknight.
Give it a try.
In your scenario Walter Cronkite costs more than the Flying Nun but people would tune into Cronkite and the network would hope the watcher does not change the channel, end up watching the Flying Nun and the advertisements and that would recoup the costs spent on the news?
That does not sound right.
From there, you're right.
Fox news started embracing a false narrative (much more carefully) because they were losing market share when their viewers started seeking confirmation of their beliefs rather than the truth.
I am glad that a wide range of outlets have decided to pick up this story about how Fox News knowingly lied to its viewers and how it only exists as a propaganda outlet for the Republican Party.
Of course, this while situation doesn’t stop the new situation that Fox has created themselves - ultra right wing news that peddle lies even more than Fox.
There though, hopefully the case against Fox creates various precedent, opening these shit holes to legal attack as well.
