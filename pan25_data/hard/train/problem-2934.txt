from the first time i did heroin there was nothing at all that could alleviate my need for it - it felt like a necessary part of my life like food or sleep.
i can testify first hand that buprenorphine obliterated my cravings for opiates and allowed me to get enough time under my belt to get my life together.
when i last kicked H i was fortunately in LA where bup/nar/sub are all pretty readily available at most pharmacies - and cost about a dollar a dose iirc.
pro tip: if filling a script for opioid-treatment (suboxone, et al) try to stay clear of any big name Rx in favor of smaller local pharmacies - thank me later.
Idk if they still do this but back in the day smaller pharmacies would sell suboxone scripts like dealers to people without insurance.
If I had a script for 60 I could buy all 60 @ $3 or 30 @$6 and so on down to a single running $15-20.
But once they had the script it was locked in at that pharmacy and you were paying on the scale to get the rest.
It had its benefits but felt fucking shady.
