That was sort of the legend of his Afghan war service the media broadcast — that he refused that kind of treatment and deployed against the wishes of the palace and his family.
He had a fake name over there and was in actual combat and was only removed once his cover was blown and it was going to be leaked to the media.
He was allegedly angry about having to leave his squadron or whatever Brits call it.
I’m not giving you an opinion one way or the other, just that this was what the media was reporting during the feeding frenzy after he was brought home and everyone found out.
As far as the pearl clutching from the military about how soldiers don’t talk like that and he’s stabbed them in the backs — have they met themselves?
Go read any of the countless autobiographies out there from soldiers and try to pretend they don’t talk at great lenh about who they killed.
In my experience the military folks that talk about kill counts are the ones that never did much of anything….
I’ve known a fair number of servicemen and servicewomen who have seen combat and not one has boasted about their kill count.
