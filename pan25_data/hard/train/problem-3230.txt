These Canadian vehicles are great for Ukraine (according to the Ukrainians who have used them), but they won't be helpful in forming an armoured division.
We need to send some of our 200 LAV-2 armoured personnel carriers (infantry fighting vehicles if the autocannon is the main distinction) that we're retiring, if not some of the 600 LAV-3s we have.
We didn't send the IFV/APC versions of those vehicles, hence the wording in my comment.
It's suboptimal that the Army will have to wait longer for their equipment, but really, they are not even the second line of defense when it comes to protecting Canadian soil.
The RCN and the RCAF are the ones patrolling our border, so it makes sense to divert equipment from the Army.
If anything, this is actually the most optimal way to use Army equipment: send it to Ukraine to fight the only arctic power that can threaten us.
Itâ€™s either that or ukraine is severely running out of ammo for their Soviet equipment (or spare parts) and they need to quickly change to nato stuff that the Allies can help with support and ammo.
It would have been easier on Ukraine for just one NATO ally to dump half of its military equipment into Ukraine while the rest of the alliance backfills that one country from their own stocks.
