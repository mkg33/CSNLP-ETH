If only there'd been 6 visible planets instead of 5.
Then we'd have 8 day weeks and could split things evenly.
I did 4 tens for about 10 years, and recently went back to 5x8s.
The weekends are short, but that extra 2 hours after work makes a huge difference in my time off during the weekdays and honestly I'm back to preferring 5x8s.
Beyond how the heck do these companies still manage to compete with such poor labor utilization, how are people not bored out of their minds just sitting there all the time?
I'm really shocked at how people apparently sit around at work so much and companies just... let them get away with it to the point that losing 20% of the labor hours for the week has minimal effect.
Then again, one of the major points regarding shorter work weeks is that many employees aren't doing the 40 hours' worth anyway, as it's too much to ask.
I read in another comment that we’re specifically talking about reducing a 40 hour, 5 day work week to a 4 day, 32 (for example) work week while still paying the same salaries so assumed this is what we were talking about here.
There are no hour limits for salaried/non-exempt employees either, so my comment about the number of hours a person is expected to work for their salary is still accurate.
Edit: Small edit to clarify I meant salaried/exempt employees (under the FLSA), rather than non-exempt employees paid on a salaried basis.
No, I assumed most people wouldn’t need to understand salaried/exempt vs. non-exempt but paid on a salaried basis under the FLSA for this thread.
