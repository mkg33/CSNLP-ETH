Republicans voted to remove Rep. Ilhan Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday, a move that was clearly hypocritical and explicitly retaliatory—and decried by Democrats as racist.
The party-line vote to remove Omar, a Minnesota Democrat and the only Black Muslim woman in Congress, from the powerful committee came, was the latest promised vengeance from newly minted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
“Do not insult our intelligence by suggesting this is about antisemitism,” California Democrat Adam Schiff said before the vote.
It's disingenuous to pretend like that's the full extent of her undeniable anti-Semitism.
She's been repeatedly criticized by members of her own party for her bigoted, shameful, irresponsible statements.
She's been criticized for making statements about the government of Israel and pro-Israel lobbyist groups that wilfully obtuse people can misconstrue as antisemitism.
Or a corporate Democrat who screams that any criticism of Israel is anti- Semitic .
Bi-partisan willful blindness and slavery to AIPAC from both parties.
