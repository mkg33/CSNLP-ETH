Very much agree.
Maintaining a beachhead as well as an almost constant chain of supply to an island is beyond a tough task.
Bring in the certain possibility of bombing runs and naval artillery from Taiwan and whoever else joins the fray, you got yourself a new corral reef made out of Chinese equipment.
For China to take Taiwan it'll have to either conduct a brutal air war in which the island is bombed until the rubble bounces or they'll have to land troops on the beach-heads.
Taiwan's own anti-aircraft capabilities might need some work, but as the entire country is comfortably within range of US airbases on Okinawa, China would have to fight hard for air superiority should the US become involved.
All of which means that, in order to take Taiwan, especially out from under American protection, China would have to be willing to take MASSIVE losses, not just of men, but of difficult to replace military hardware.
If China doesn't launch any expeditionary armed conflicts, the odds of reintegrating Taiwan by military force are essentially 0.
“Dan Grazier, a senior defense policy fellow at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), sees an outright Chinese invasion of Taiwan as extremely unlikely.
Such a military operation would immediately disrupt the imports and exports upon which the Chinese economy relies for its very survival, Grazier told CNN, and interrupting this trade risks the collapse of the Chinese economy in short order.
China relies on imports of food and fuel to drive their economic engine, Grazier said, and they have little room to maneuver.”.
