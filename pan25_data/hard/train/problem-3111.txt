But now?
With people turning on him and praising Desantis?
Dude could be fuming so bad he'd announce a third party bid to destroy the GOP out of spite.
I would honestly push this and fucking fake support for Trump if it means I'm taking away from the GOP.
If the GOP had any sense, they would be distancing themselves from Trump now.
The majority of the country have spoken.
They are tired of his negative and toxic politics.
People are tired of Trump.
I don't know how anyone can think otherwise.
Almost all of Trump's election denying supporters lost their bids.
The GOP better stop looking for others to blame and instead start looking at the guy who is now a 3-time loser in elections.
The country doesn't want Trump anymore.
Fourth, Desantis doesn't need Trump.
He's building his brand as all the racism, all the wrongheadedness, but with 1/10th the scandal and self owning.
Third, Desantis also sees what happened to Mike Pence, who was %1,000 percent loyal to Trump until Trump wanted called on him publicly to break the law in a history-changing way.
All Pence did was not break the law for Trump on Jan 6 and now Trump is cool with Pence getting murdered.
Yes, I know what I said.
Still, Desantis' abuses of power and rake-stepping don't compare to Trump's.
