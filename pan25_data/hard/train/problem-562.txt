Not surprising in the slightest, countries here need to be aware that they are in no way gonna get special treatment regarding this (not defending it!).
The government there is determined to control the narrative.
When the HongKong protests were going on, they had a massive disinformation campaign going on.
Telling mainland citizens that the protests were IN FAVOR of HK reforms and a tighter grip by the CCP etc.
There were a few hundred protestors in Shanghai that had anti-CCP chants, the rest of the overwhelming majority is protesting against the Covid measures and not against the CCP.
People are protesting in China but the overwhelming majority are protesting the Covid measures not the CCP.
That's a fact.
So yeah.
It's not really the most observant question to ask why the Chinese almost never protest, and don't feel much incentive to protest.
There are better ways to support the Chinese people than shaming them for not standing up for themselves given the immense risk and faint, barely-there reward.
