Abject nonsense, assisted by heavy gerrymandering in a lot of races.
Honestly should give you even a little more optimism: They're trying every legal (and who knows, maybe some illegal) stop to come out with more ballots, and are _still_ failing.
I've been trying to be optimistic about these results and being glad that the Democrats are actually winning these races sot there's something to build on, but the other nagging part of my brain can't help but be irritated that these races are close when the opposing choice is abject nonsense.
But maybe Dark Brandon will see the blue crush of this election and realize the non-crazies actually outnumber the crazies, and call the Republicans who obstruct out on their bullshit.
Obama always just took the high road and never said "the government is shutting down because the republicans would rather fuck you than work with us".
Maybe it's time Biden does something like that.
Wow.
I guess he did.
Yet I had the perception he didn't point enough fingers.
My perception was wrong, but it's important to try to set perception as much as it is to do the actual thing.
So I guess I'd say I hope Biden names and ashamed like Obama did but at level: Karen.
I can't believe it was ever this fucking close.
Lake is an absolute crazy woman, and Hobbs not only has actual experience as the secretary of state, but the SOS in 2020 who had to not only handle the election, but handle the temper tantrum of a poor loser, his 17 lawsuits, 3 recounts and all sort of other crap.
