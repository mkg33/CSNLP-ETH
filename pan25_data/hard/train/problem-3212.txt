It was hilarious to see Trump so angry that SCOTUS wasn't going to override state election results after he made a big point of installing justices who were not likely to do that.
Counting votes doesn't count and 60++court outcomes don't count unless it is GOP SCOTUS giving them all kinds of guns to kill each other no matter how crazy they are.
They are trying to take over everything with guns and lies, all in pursuit of lower taxes for anyone earning over $400,000 (Only people Biden's taxes affect) Too bad because most of those supporting these lies earn way below that and could use lower cost medications and better infrastructure.
Final goodby for 3 Michigan students today, 5 still recovering from GOP's need for military grade guns and known abusers allowed their 2nd amendment rights by GOP SCOTUS.
GOP doesn't just condone killing innocent young college students because they have to have military guns, but condone Fox news liars even after Tucker's confession he lied by promoting fake support (he knew this was untrue and confessed (he feared ratings) for the untrue fantasy that Trump won.
