That’s just not true.
Their population is over 70% vaxxed and their vax doesnt prevent infection as well as ours (which also isn’t great at it) but it’s equally as good at preventing serious illness.

The Chinese vaccines work, although not effectively as Western ones.
Their main issue is that a majority of their older populations have not been vaccinated, even though most younger Chinese were vaccinated.

Well you can, but something is definitely stopping you.
And of course vaccine efficacy isn't the same as vaccine effectiveness, as Pfizer et al.
has no control over the research results on effectiveness.
