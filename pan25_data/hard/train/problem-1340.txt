I was watching CNN today and the protesters were literally chanting "we don't want vaccines."
I feel as though the general sentiments of these protests are confused at best.
My understanding is that China has in fact had issues getting a homegrown mRNA vaccine going, and they've had a lot of trouble with the new variants.
Add to that that going into this a big concern in China has been that a lot of elderly people over there are avoiding vaccination -- I was reading something in The Economist earlier this year that some like half of all elderly people in China were unvaccinated?
...1 case a day?
!
Add to that that, as I just mentioned in another post, there's a disproportionate number of elderly people in China who aren't vaccinated, and yeah, it's a serious issue they have on their hands.
Most countries have people who aren't vaccinated but it's time to give people's responsibility in their own hands.
It's easy saying lockdowns are pretty warranted when you don't live there or have to live with the consequences..
