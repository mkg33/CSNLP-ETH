You really want to set a precedent that having classified documents stored inappropriate is all fine and dandy as long as you return them when found out?
Not saying Trump and Biden’s case are anywhere near equal, but the “as if Biden actually did something wrong” line irked me.
It's been so weird watching the clickbait hungry media pursue this as if Biden actually did something wrong.
I wouldn't say that it's fine and dandy.
Describing it as inappropriate is accurate.
It's just nowhere near justifying all these headlines to me.
I'm also recalling Hillary Clinton being absolutely crucified for even the possibility of this, while Trump's actual criminal behavior has been met by the GOP with a stiffled yawn.
Yet another result of how sane, competent and by comparison relatively boring this administration is.
If you care about making things better for the poor and middle class, it's pretty exciting.
But that's harder to generate headlines from.
People have a hard time believing in the possibility of sincerity.
