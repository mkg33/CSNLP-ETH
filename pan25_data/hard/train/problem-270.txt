You’re mistaken, private companies and public companies have different rules.
This is essentially the only (plausible) reason the SEC has rules about accredited investors - because they’re allegedly more aware of the risk and able to absorb them.
Solar City being public has no bearing on this if their shareholders voted to be bought, which would be mandatory.
But I think Tesla is making money from that so it’s hard to say he didn’t help shareholders in that instance.
With Twitter it’s like he’s using Tesla employees - so their payroll etc.
It seems co-mingled and that’s not good and doesn’t benefit Tesla shareholders in any way.
Long story short, the industry no longer needs Tesla.
It was great while they were great but now it's not.
Electrical charging was cheap even two or three years ago, but it wouldn't take a financial mastermind to realize people can pay AT LEAST whatever gas costs per mile....
Gas cars need to leave, yes, but as long as EVs are cybertrucks and electric hummers, that isn't vital - that's capitalism.
What's "vital" are walkable cities, public transpo and biking infrastructure.
