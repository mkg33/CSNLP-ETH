You are indeed quite clear in demonstrating that you have no idea of the basic reality of law that a grand jury is not even remotely a finder of fact.
The role of a petite jury is to find facts, after hearing countering arguments from both prosecution and defense.
Another critical difference is that a grand jury hears a one sided argument, unlike a petite jury which hears a counter-argument from the defense.
Why would I substitute this Grand Jury's opinion for thinking for myself given I have access to necessary facts needed to reach a conclusion?
Why do you?
Yet your basis for complaint is that Clinton didn't commit perjury.
Think about that.
All your rationalizations don't change the fact that Clinton was asked if specific acts occurred and truthfully answered that they did not occur in circumstances where it was illegal to not answer truthfully.
Given you know Clinton was asked about specific acts and truthfully answered that question, none of which constitutes a crime, why other dishonesty would you make this "if you commit a crime" argument?
While legally speaking Clinton did lie under oath and was subject to disciplinary action; we all know that every politician lies under oath in this country.
Bernie may be the only one that doesn't and that's cause he's more in your face about truths.
That being said, the American populace was naive and rather innocent.
We didn't know the mechanics going on behind the scenes, and we thought politicians were for the most part truthful.
We weren't as educated on the political lobbying, campaigning, and strategic planning as we are now.
