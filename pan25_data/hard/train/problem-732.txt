The worst thing about the Trump era is that it gave racists permission to be openly racist again.
I don't have any allusions that there weren't racists earlier than that, but at least there was some shame involved with it and people kept it more on the down low.
Now you can be elected governor of Florida (twice!)
by being openly and proudly racist as if it is no big deal.
White people always say "there is no racism.
So stop bringing it up" There IS still racism!.
My fucking white family still uses the N word behind closed doors.
And they aren't the only white people who do that.
I'm not going to sit here and ignore that.
I'm sorry they are scared of the truth, but it's reality.
We will never ever be a better country if we continue trying towhitewashh everything about us.
Being in fucking denial is no excuse.
The very fact that a White man is pulling this shit against black people EXPOSES that racism is still very much a real thing in this country.
White people have no right telling black people what they can and can not teach.
Do you not see how racist that is?
Once again a white man is trying to oppress black people.
What he is doing is the very re-examine of the white oppression they are trying to hide and deny they do.
