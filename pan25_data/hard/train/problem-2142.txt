This is so stupid, Covid mostly affecting elderly was known from the beginning, so if that were true then China wouldn’t have any hard measures in the first place similar to the west.
Just use your brain.
lol Covid is rampant in literally every single country on this planet, the only difference between China and the rest, at this point, is that for China that wasn’t the case the last years.
This ain’t a China only thing mate, Australia for example banned flights from India when they had their huge Covid outbreak killing many thousands during the height of Covid.
Yes Covid is already out in the world but that doesn’t mean millions of infected travelers aren’t a threat to the people and healthcare systems of other countries.
If you can’t recognise the difference between western nations living in a normalised post-Covid world and a nation of a billion people having a massive outbreak where millions are infected each day with a very high predicted death toll then that speaks to your own biases.
