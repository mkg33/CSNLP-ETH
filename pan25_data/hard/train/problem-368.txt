If i could offer my 2 cents, learn to respect your right to say no to some kind or evil offers if you absolutely cant agree to it.
Learn to turn away an offer and, in some cases, turn away from the party or person when you cant come to some kind of agreement that you know you want or don’t want.
Only identify what saying no means from the start and what, if anything, you might say yes or no to because it will help you to identify other possible paths to an agreement and can ultimately help you determine when to actually say no.
And it will help you .
In negotiations this is called a BATNA or a best alternative to a negotiated agreement.
The best case in this example is to tell China to politely and diplomatically fuck right off and shut them down.
They’ll be told to diplomatically fuck off, however, the machine, the Xi machine, could care less.
That means the community needs to show solidarity, as in mutual strenh defending the freedoms of its total population- harass the bejeezus out of the fuckers.
Run these so called citizen support center personnel (Chinese version of KGB, EastEnd Stasi etc) out of town.
Give no quarter/ take no quarter.
U.S. soil is not Totalitarian soil.
Just a random knee jerk stroke.
