That is the point.
Democrats just want to say they tried.
If they wanted to actually enact change they would have done it while they were in control of the House.
It could have been put through at the end of the House session so it could be voted on in the Senate after the the new session of the Senate was started.
It’s about 5 senators short of passing the Senate…never mind the house.
Something like this won’t happen until the Dems have super majority in the House and Senate.
Hell, they don't even want people picking Senators.
They've been trying to repeal the 17th Amendment for decades.
It doesn't matter.
The GOP doesn't need a true majority (or even a plurailty) to win, especially once they can change election laws sufficiently enough so that their skewed and gerrymandered state legislatures can pick the President.
They land on differing sides of the Federal vs State powers debate depending on what kind of narrative they're trying to push.
States have the power to ban abortion but not legalize marijuana for example.
They can make their own concealed carry laws that other states have to respect and abide by (and at times their state laws can override those of other states), but states shouldn't be able to make their own laws about environmental regulations and if they do no other state has to abide by them...
