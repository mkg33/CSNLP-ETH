Canada had a illegal occupation and after a month of peacefully trying to get them to leave they temporarily froze bank accounts of a few hundred people.
Every country in the world freezes bank accounts, it happens all the time to criminals most places just need a court order and that account is frozen.
Countries freeze bank accounts of criminals when those accounts are being used for illicit criminal activities i.e money laundering and have to go through a court process.
Not supporting the anti-vaccination protests just saying it sounds a lot like what Canada did to it's own residents.
Edit: You might not like the parallel that I'm drawing between Iran and Canada.
The idea is that stupid ideas like this are not restricted only to third world countries, and yes I understand on any scale that Iran is worse than Canada.
But we can't say it's a stupid idea here and then praise it in other countries.
Canada froze bank accounts without court orders through the emergency powers act they passed.
Not surprised Iran is trying to force compliance by restricting access to banking, just don't understand why we act like Canada should have a free pass.
The Iranian government at that point would have to take a(nother) page out of Russia's book and impose strict limits on bank withdrawals, which of course will inflame the whole situation even further.
