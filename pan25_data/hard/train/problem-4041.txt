It definitely would I think.
My work has a use it or lose it sick policy, and while it's only a couple of days, I absolutely make sure it's used up before it resets.
I'm usually so burnt out/tired that Friday evening doesn't feel all that different than a regular weekday outside of the fact that I'm not dreading work and can sleep in.
Seems the 4-day work week and benefits like that are somewhat more common with European/international companies.
There's no way corporations wouldn't just cut pay and then make you work 8 hours "overtime" per week with your overall pay staying the same (or decreasing).
Article: "With exploding technology and increased worker productivity, it's time to move toward a four-day work week with no loss of pay.
Workers must benefit from technology, not just corporate CEOs.
".
yes.
i'm scheduled 4 10s, but really i'm scheduled for 11 hours (one hour lunch break, which is nice), but i actually work 12 hours a day.
i HATE it, but i LOVE my 3 day weekends.
every weekend i am so happy and peaceful and every day at work is full of dread and anger and panic.
i hate not being able to run errands.
i was supposed to today after work but i worked 12hrs 25mins and was too tired.
it sucks.
but my weekends are so good.
a love hate relationship.
