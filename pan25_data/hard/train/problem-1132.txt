You're making a mistake in your definition of "best candidate".
To those republican voters someone who will toe the party lint to keep anti-lgbt and other culture war fights going IS the best candidate.
Your and my grading rubrics don't apply one tiny bit.
I get so annoyed seeing people on the left continuously cry about how republicans keep voting for such awful candidates and I just want to scream "awful candidates TO YOU!
To them the candidates are exactly.
what.
they.
want.
".
Same.
I am independent and itâ€™s been over 10 years since I have found a single republican candidate, local or national, that I wanted to vote for.
I continue to be registered as an Independent, and I like to weigh the merits of each candidate regardless of their party.
But the Republican Party has swayed so far away from just being philosophically conservative into being outright fascist that I can't in good conscience fill in the circle next to a name with an "R" next to it.
Even if you're a moderate conservative, you endorse the worst of your party by continuing to run as a Republican.
It's so clearly party loyalty over everything else, so why not run [Republican Candidate] for Senate?
Misguided anti-elitism combined with wanting simple answers to complex problems.
They don't want to feel "talked down to" while also being told everything they want to hear.
So someone that knows as much about important topics as they do, who will stick to the script of talking points, is their ideal candidate.
