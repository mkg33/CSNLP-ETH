So because she isn't ready she should get sterilized or have her partner be???
Like I don't understand the logic here????
Since she wants to be ready to be a parent that means she should give up the ability????
I would think being real about the situation shows her maturity here???
?
So you know that she wasn't on birth control how??
Because I was on birth control when I got pregnant (all 3 times) Everyone is different and there are people who it just doesn't work as well on.
And yes, the "my methods of birth control failed and I can't afford to be pregnant" is one reason people get abortions.
Let's get real: Most people use abortion as a form of contraception.
Oops I'm pregnant I'll just get it taken care of.
Abortions should be reserved for urgent issues, such as when the pregnancy could endanger the mother's life.
Even with protection, it's important to remember that there is always a risk involved.
If you don't want to take that risk, then don't engage in activities that could lead to an unwanted pregnancy.
Yes I'm sure all the married couples who don't want children are going to follow your advice of "just don't have sex".
Totally rational.
If they secede, their future will be indistinguishable from a Middle Eastern theocracy.
And we all know what happens to those countries.
