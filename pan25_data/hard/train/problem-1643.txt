Both things are true at the same time.
The social factors that drive mass shootings and that drive more “normal” gun crime are entirely different, and require different prescriptions.
Note also that there are different definitions of mass shootings.
ProPublica seems to use a very restrictive one, as they only counted 19 mass shootings in 60 years in Texas.
What fraction of all homicides over the last 60 years is that?
Can you share some examples of the thousands of crimes committed with guns each year that were committed with ghost guns?
Or is this ghost gun argument merely a boogeyman?
Also, many people are law-abiding gun owners until they pull the trigger.
Every criminal starts out law-abiding.
Great, so we have a number we can work with.
So it’s .
So… less than 5% of guns used to commit crime.
So, it’s still fair to say the vast majority of illegal guns started out as legal guns.
And where did those illegally owned guns come from originally, I wonder?
Did they materialize out of thin air?
Maybe they were harvested from an illegal gun tree in Mexico?
