Yea it’s a loophole republicans will use then block any legislation that tackles the issue.
Dems have done it too but republicans excel is getting a majority with a minority of voters.
It was extremely effective in 2012 (based on the 2010 Census and the gerrymandering done from that), and got republicans a 33 seat lead even though democrats received 1 million more votes overall than republicans did.
A huge point that everyone needs to know is that gerrymandering is a fundamental foundation of the Republican Party, it is literally called "Project RedMap", it is in their party documents, developed by the Republican State Leadership Committee, and the Republican Party spent 30 million dollars initially to start the project.
“One potential takeaway from [the midterms] is that the US is a center left country with a gerrymandering problem.”.
"We have redistricting coming up and the Republicans control most of that process in most of the states around the country.
That alone should get us the majority back.” - Rep Ronny Jackson (Republican).
A direct quote from a Republican that they intended to use redistricting to get the majority back… and that’s not enough evidence, of course.
