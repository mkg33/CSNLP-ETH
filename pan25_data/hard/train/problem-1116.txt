I wonder if it was a case of western airlines not really flying to Iran because of sanctions and hostility, so Ukraine was one of the easier stopovers.
The whole thing with supplying Russia with drones is quite mind boggling to me Ukraine was one of the few countries in the west that Iran had a somewhat good connection with.
You’re comparing an attack on a weapons facility to what Russia is doing in Ukraine?
Bombing apartments and leaving grenades trip-wired to children’s toys?
Torturing and raping everywhere they go- you don’t see any difference there?
Israel and Iran have been exchanging small strikes for years.
Iran doesn’t want to risk an all out war with Israel because if they actually went to toe to toe Iran’s military would be quickly wiped out, so they do these little tit for tat strikes instead.
It is a very different situation to Israel destroying a weapons factory in Iran.
(Assuming that it was Israel who carried out the attack.
).
Russia invaded Ukraine with the intent of toppling its government and annexing its territory.
It's already succeeded in some areas and it has been accused of acts of genocide and of intentionally attacking civilian targets.
