I don't think he wanted an equal.
My point is that Stalin knew going in that he was going to have conflict with Hitler, their alliance helped them both prepare for it.
It really is crazy though to see how much warning Stalin received from his intelligence network, and others, though.
.
And.
Adding that the Second World War happened because of Nazi (ie: Hitler) imperialism.
Even that ungodly amount of deaths is but a (significant) fraction of the people killed because of Hitler.
Yeah, but those deaths are mostly because they didn't prepare and sent people in without gear to die by the masses... because they thought Nazi Germany was their friend and they would split up some of the eastern European land.
USSR and Germany were more like allies when the war started.
Russia helped Germany develop some of it's initial weapons and copied some of their advances in the process.
It was only later when Germany turned on Russia that Russia joined the allies .. for their own self preservation and that's about all.
Well Stalin did try to buddy up with Hitler until Hitler attack him and he ran to the allies for help... so Stalin was always kind of part Hitler and Putin is too.
Except that in real life Stalin tried to make a deal with Hitler for parts of eastern Europe.
Hitler instead turned on Russia and Russia ran to the allies and US Lend Lease.
Russia was ready to give Hitler a free pass as long as they got some land out of the deal.
