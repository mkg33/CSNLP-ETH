In order to do this, they wanted to first bring them back on active duty and then court-martial them.
The proper and expected response would have been something like “Go for it, bring me back to Active Duty and let’s hold a court martial.”.
Think of what would come out of getting people on the stand.
Maybe they would have tried to exert Executive Privilege but it would have gone worse for Trump.
GEN Milley did him a favor.
This said, I am proud of Gen Milley.
I believe he would not have followed an unlawful order such as this or the ones we are aware of that trump wanted.
Thank You General!
From the moment I knew there were retired military officers being traitors/part of the insurrection, I actually yelled at the TV\recall them, put them back in uniform and court martial them.
A commissioned office in the military is "owned" by the military for LIFE I am an enlisted veteran.
The only reason they would have to recall me would be if my job was in critical need.
I was an aircraft electrician\'74-'79.
Chances are zero for recall for me.
Too old now.
If a commissioned officer's expertise is needed they can be recalled for the needs of the country, for LIFE.
