...It isn't.
A percentage of your money goes to taxes, which the government spends on things.
Including war efforts.
Knowing your money is funding Ukraine and not Russia is good.
As for why they don’t just give Ukraine the money, then?
I can’t say for certain, but I assume it’s some sort of insurance to make sure they don’t just take the money and either surrender or try to bribe Russia into withdrawing.
Not that they suspect Ukraine would do that; just SOP.
I think it's also a way of showing that support for Ukraine won't die anytime soon.
This is important because if support for Ukraine dries up it could also send a message to China that the west is weak and that they only need to wait a year or so and any support for Taiwan will dry up as well.
Speaking of tax deductions the Ukrainian government has already stated that farmers do NOT need to report the value of any captured Russian tanks on their taxes.
I know it's something a lot of people were worried about so I wanted to clear up any confusion.
