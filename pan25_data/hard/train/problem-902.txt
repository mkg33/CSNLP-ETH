The grandparents won in both the juvenile court and the Milan court of appeal, which in 2019 ordered meetings between them and the children in the presence of a social worker, while warning the parents of the potential psychological damage to the children from depriving them from seeing their relatives.
The parents argued that the meetings were not appreciated by the children owing to the ongoing family tensions and so appealed to the supreme court to have the decision overturned.
Confused how they think a child can make an informed decision, and not just a decision they will regret when older.
On top of all of that, which should already just be common sense around consent, the kids when theyre older can change their mind if the old ones havent died yet.
Who in this situation do you think should have more control over who the kids are allowed/forced to spend time with, the childrens parents or their grandparents?
It is baffling to me that someone would find court ordered supervised visits with grandparents estranged from both parents to be LESS damaging to a child than just letting the parents raise their children around who they see fit.
Grandparents are extended family members, not immediate.
