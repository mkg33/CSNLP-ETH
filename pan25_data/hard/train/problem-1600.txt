Quote from Humeniuk: "Yesterday we reported about 260 square kilometres and today over 3,000 square kilometres have been liberated.
Though there are still areas where enemy forces might linger.

On the evening of 11 November, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were in Kherson; other Ukrainian forces were on the outskirts of the city.
On 9 November, Sergei Surovikin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian occupation forces in Ukraine, announced that Russian troops were leaving the city of Kherson.
The Office of the President of Ukraine said that the Ukrainian government saw no evidence that Russia would retreat from Kherson without a fight.
To put some perspective on 3,000 square kilometres (1158 sq miles) this is 80% the size of Rhode Island.
I was already measuring the land liberated as Rhode Islands.
So far Ukraine has already liberated two Rhode Islands worth of land in the Kharkiv region and at this point I'm pretty sure they've taken back over 10K square kilometers.
