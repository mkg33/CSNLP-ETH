May or may not be true.
Without passing judgment on their morality Russia is an arms and power broker in that sphere.
It's possible to have arms and training arrangements without being allied per se.
I don't think everyone should start looking shifty eyed at South Africa until we learn more about it.
South Africa isnt siding with Russia.
They are just not siding with anyone and continuing on with their lives.
When Swiss do it, oh they are so quirky.
When South Africa does it, eviiiiiil.
Africa is more happy with China than the recolonization of Africa from IMF and America.
West kinda shot themselves in the foot with these “we will give you money, but you have to follow these insane conditions that will change you as a country and make you part of us.
And dont forgot the insane interest”.
At least Chinas like cool, heres money, its ours until you pay it off.
Dont worry about interest.
It was massive support, what are you talking about.
All of the ANC was armed and trained by the soviets.
Black liberation in Africa was literally soviets arming and training them, while US was funding the white govt.
Its why if you look at old photos of the ANC before the apartheid govt fell, they are all legit Marxists and have massive banners with the hammer and sickle.
Mandela, Joe Slovo, etc.
