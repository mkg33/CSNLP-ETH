There’s actually a lot of good stuff in the Quran, especially for the time period it was written in.
The problem is that it’s a religious book, and those always have fucked up bad shit alongside the good so it’s basically a net neutral.
That, and like most religious books it was written over a thousand years ago, and none of them are really fully compatible with modernity.
But there are religious charities, and there are people who live a more moral life because of their faith.
Do I think they need their faith to live a moral life?
Absolutely not.
Do I think there’s an inherent link between morality and religion?
No.
The morality is inherent to humanity, as is the propensity to exploit power structures like is done through religion.
It’s all human shit, religion is just one of the masks we wear when we express our human nature, both good and bad.
Dishonoring of the family is not a religion thing and burning women it is a shitty thing and obviously we dont do this.
The fact people get angry enough to kill people for the burning of a stupid book is more disrespectful and offensive.
I’ve never understood why people get so upset about a book being burned.
Especially when it is on the other side of the world.
It’s fine to have a belief system but it’s not okay to get upset about other people not thinking the same way as you.
