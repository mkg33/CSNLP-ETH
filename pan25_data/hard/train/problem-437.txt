Whether or not Russia's nuclear ICBMs still work, so much as an attempted launch on anyone and NATO will steamroll their way to Moscow.
Especially after seeing the state of Russia's military as it is now.
Can we dispell this myth that Ukraine is protecting Europe and the world from Russia?
Ukraine is protecting itself and the rest of the civilised world is injecting a buttload of money, weapons and intel so it can be effective.
Way better stop thing earlier - we are just lucky the Ukrainians are awesome enough to hold the line with NATO support.
Anywho, the stance I’m talking about isn’t just about the war in Ukraine, take a look at NATO.
The US is pretty much your army, macron says he want to beef up his military, i agree.
What do you mean we don’t hear about it???
US government and military has always used private companies and it IS talked about, at least in the US.
Think about Boeing, Northrop Grumman, even Space X.
It’s hysterical how many Europeans are jaded to this.
Completely ungrateful for what the US has and does provide to them.
The US literally acts as their army on its own dime, while they sit back and criticize.
What about Russia, ya numb nuts???
Plus, if US were to militarily intervene, it’s be ww3 and the euros would complain about that action as well.
