She's not doing it to appeal to anyone.
She's doing it to make herself exempt from a primary challenge.
Which means she'll have to fight a Democrat in a general election... And probably lose the seat to a Republican when she splits the vote.
Edit: also i would like to point out that 2024 is likely to be a bloodbath for democrats in the senate.
Not only will sinema split democrat votes with Ruben gallego or whoever democrats decide to ru , resulting in a possible republican pick up, but democrats have to defend Montana, Ohio, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as well.
Republicans will be defending very safe seats.
Iirc independents make up something like 40% of registered voters in Arizona, with democrats and republicans being split at roughly 30% each.
As long as she caucuses with democrats, she she will have the backing of Schumer and the dscc.
This allows her to push her corporate agenda while larping as a “centrist”.
It’s honestly not the worst strategy in the world.
What makes you think that?
There’s more registered independents in Arizona than democrats.
She just needs to appeal to the centrists in every party.
Ron Johnson just got re-elected with a 37% approval rating.
So if corporations love her so much, she will have unlimited corporate cash, in addition to dnc money, Chuck Schumer pac money, and dscc money.
