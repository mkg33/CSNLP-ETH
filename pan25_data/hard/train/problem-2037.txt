Like there's been actual majorities for things like medical debt forgiveness, rent control, increased teacher pay, expanded welfare programs since the Clinton days yet you're being held ransom by a governing system which has incapacitated itself completely.
Your democrats aren't really left wing by any standards, while they are far better than the alternative I don't understand why you have so little power over who actually becomes president and what policies get prioritized.
We stop letting people repeat the "both sides are the same" horseshit, the "democrats don't do anything when they have power" bullshit, and all the other disinformation meant to suppress left wing voter participation.
At least here in the US the issue really isn't the number of people who accept leftist ideas, it's getting those people to actually show up at the polls.
If you don't think engaging in a massive disinformation campaign to not be held responsible for their pollution at the vast expense of humanity (both personal and business expense) shouldn't constitute a criminal offense then you're a morally depraved fool.
