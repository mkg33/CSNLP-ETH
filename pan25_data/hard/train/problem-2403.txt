>Al Capone started one of the first soup kitchens.
The kitchen employed a few people but fed many more.
In fact, preceding the passage of the Social Security Act, “soup kitchens” like the one Al Capone founded, provided the only meals that some unemployed Americans had.
Sorry to hear you live in Portland.
Seems like most people complaining about addicts and this article just don't have the money to move out of a bad neighborhood.
There are a LOT of low income and houseless people who aren’t on drugs, I feel they shouldn’t be punished because some people use meth or other drugs.
The problematic meth addicts are the people who get the attention and are the ones noticed in day to day life instead of the vastly more numerous group of low/no income group struggling discretely.
Everybody raving about drug addicts in this thread and here I am a social services professional telling you how many actual low income families and individuals who are not drug addicted could use this help.
It’s the age old argument that because we might be helping the bad crowd, we shouldn’t help anyone at all, which is bullshit.
