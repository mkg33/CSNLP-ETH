This is so distasteful.
“If they don’t like it here they can leave”.
Come on man, the west is a diaspora of different cultures, races and ethnicities.
Western ideology is intended to be welcoming and democratic.
Imagine fleeing violence to encounter more violence.
Only the latter is in a place that was considered presumably safe for your people.
Again I really don’t want to condone violence whatsoever from any side in this issue.
But there are systemic issues that led to this.
A judge released this man (for whatever reason) when he was on trial for committing heinous violence (with a sword essentially for that matter) prior to his trial for that offense.
He took that opportunity to hurt people.
So don’t just say go home if you don’t like it here.
The west is built on the movement AND settlement of various groups of people.
They have a right to be angry, and it feels like you think they shouldn’t be angry….
I get that they're pissed.
It still doesn't justify attacking police.
As for the release of the perpetrator for the earlier attack - it unfortunately happens in many countries where sentencing is relatively lax.
France isn't only country where violent offenders (even repeat offenders) have gotten what seem like light sentences.
