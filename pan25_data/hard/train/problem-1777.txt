Iran's revolution is going to fail for the same reason the Belarus revolution failed--they're not willing to kill for it.
Ukraine's revolution succeeded because they were willing to kill the regime's enforcers and assault the regime's leaders--with knives and sticks and farming equipment if they didn't have guns.
Risking civil war is the only way to defeat a totalitarian regime -- ask your grandparents.
They are going to call you terrorists no matter what you do.
There's almost nothing you can do to lose international support, unless you start executing captured/disarmed regime footsoldiers in the streets -- and even that might not be enough to lose support.
Everyone wants to see the Iran dictatorship fall -- except for Putin and Assad.
They absolutely won't.
There's just zero chance of that.
You gain more foreign support when people see you're willing to fight.
Because the real secret is most governments, NGOs, and international corporations do not care about how you win.
They just want to back the winning side.
Show them that the regime will lose, and the regime will start losing more international support.
What will kill the movement is a civil war when civilians become armed and lose international support.
IR is dying to brand the minority groups as terrorists and in fact already releases propaganda about capturing terrorists.
