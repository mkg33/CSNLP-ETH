Unlikely.
The workers got a lot in this deal and a lot of workers wanted to sign it already.
It is doubtful they will get enough to strike over this last issue.
If the workers want to direct their anger at someone it should be the GOP.
A few more votes and they would have gotten the contract they were asking for.
In a reasonable world they would have voted again on a 3 day sick leave policy and split the difference.
One party actually could have voted for paid sick leave and did not.
What you are saying is the republicans agreed with the dems to not vote on paid sick leave and nobody leaked it.
Because they (democrats) passed two separate bills, probably knowing that the bill with the sick leave would fail in the senate.
So it’s kind of their fault.
That being said we can’t forget republicans role in this especially since some like Cruz and Rubio are trying to pretend to care about workers and in general from what I have seen the right is using this as an attack on Biden.
They aren’t any better.
