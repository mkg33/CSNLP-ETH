I don't have any stats to back it up, but anchor, correspondent, and commentator are all different things.
It wouldn't surprise me at all if anchors are evenly balanced but employed and guest commentators are not.
Fox is scrupulous about having an even mix of attractive white female anchors and distinguished looking white male anchors but my gut is that their commentators are skewed towards male.
I get Fox News women all look disturbingly similiar, but they aren't just one woman spouting this same garbage, which all stemmed from wildly off polls, not some sort of gender bias.
Sure women do (turns out you were wrong about what I accept, can’t wait to hear your next predictions on what I think)…but Republicans didn’t blow the midterms because women voted for them.
Quite the opposite.
Again, you’re talking about the exceptions instead of the rules.
There are good white men, and shitty Black women.
That said, if minorities and women were the only people voting, Trump would not have been a viable candidate.
Shitty white men were the primary reason he was close, and no other group was as responsible.
Sorry that “you don’t want to accept it,” but that’s a fact.
If they were ignoring it, pundits wouldn’t have been talking about a red wave before the election.
I’m simply pointing out the obvious reason there wasn’t, even though it wasn’t obvious to the pundits and newsrooms around the country.
I couldn’t help but notice how many men, even in liberal media, thought that women were going to forget about abortion less than six months after losing their rights.
Women have object permanence, but you wouldn’t know it listening to men talk about it.
The country is going to continue to lean left until this is changed, and male pundits and male-dominated newsrooms will continue to be perplexed by it.
