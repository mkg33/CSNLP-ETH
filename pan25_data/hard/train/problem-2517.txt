"U.S. President Joe Biden stated in February 2021 that his administration will pursue cannabis decriminalization as well as seek expungements for people with prior cannabis convictions.
It can still be found on his campaign website under sentencing reform.

This.
Most people in federal prison for drug charges did a lot more than smoke a joint.
Just because marijuana itself has been decriminalized, doesn't mean the criminal activity surrounding it has been legalized.
And to be investigated and charged at the federal level for drugs generally means you are doing a lot more than just smoking a joint.
If you are in federal prison on drug charges it isn't for smoking some weed or having a couple grams of it in your pocket.
No one in federal prison are being pardoned because there are literally no one in there to pardon under joe's plan once or if enacted.Those people in there are on high level charges, and they were never getting any pardon.
The President can only pardon people for federal crimes that they have committed.
Why is the President operating within the confines of the law a PR stunt now?
