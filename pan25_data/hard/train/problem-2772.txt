For Russia one of the most important uses of their resources has to be to convince the GOP to abandon Ukraine.
It's Russia's best and probably only chance of having any sprt of success.
Also if the United States were to abandoned Ukraine.
It wouldn't just be Ukraine but all of NATO and European allies as well.
I don't like the headline because it lumps all Republicans into the same camp when it comes to Ukraine.
The majority of Republicans do support Ukraine.
Heck, even Mitch McConnell and Lindsay Graham support Ukraine.
Sure, Trump does not, but he is in the minority on this issue, along with the other corrupt whackos.
And I totally disagree with the premise.
For example, the $40 billion dollar aid package (largest one) passed the Senate 86-11.
None of what you cited deals with Ukraine or the Republican stance on Ukraine.
Instead, you appear to be using this as an opportunity to bash on Republicans/conservatism for something they're not guilty of.
It's ironic to me that the Republican party went from McCarthyism and the Red Scare to this in less than one lifetime.
But then again, the red scare was never about Russians, it was just the newest way at the time for Republicans to oppress the people they didn't approve of.
The red scare is better described as the time Americans nearly went full french revolution on the oligarchs running the country.
