Is he planning on digging a bunch of tunnels?
Because you aren't moving 200k troops anywhere near Kyiv without it being blatantly obvious when every western nation on earth has their spy satellites pointed at Ukraine.
First of all, I don't think Ukraine really has the capability to push all the way to Moscow, lest we forget the war is mostly a stalemate with probably a small advantage to Ukraine, and that's in their own friendly territory.
And 3rd, that would probably qualify as an existential to the state of Russia.
In case you didn't know, that is what the Russian nuclear doctrine considers to be the threshold for pushing the big red button.
I know it sounds silly and Russia probably isn’t that stupid to use a nuclear device in any capacity… but I feel like they’re getting desperate and almost all bets are off at this stage.
I am no military expert, and I don’t think this will actually happen… but seeing the recent events that are happening is making me slightly worried that Putin is actually considering a nuclear option here.
