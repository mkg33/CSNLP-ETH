Russia is still profiting, but at least the arms aren't going to Russia itself... at least on paper...
Theres 0 chance of India selling these weapons on to russia, that doesent help their strategic goals.
Not defending russias current actions but russia has been an amazing friend to India.
Helping them domestically alot and during the 1971 war of Bangladeshi independence and the indo-pak war that occurred then, the US was defending the Bengal genocide being carried out by Pakistan (killed more than 2 million and declared all women regardless of age "public property") and when India invaded then east Pakistan to librate Bangladesh the US sent a fleet to stop India and sanctions.
The USSR sent out a nuclear fleet to deter the US from anything extreme and allowed for the end of the Bangladesh genocide, establishing Bangladesh, and crippling the terror state that is Pakistan.
America literally dispatched an entire Carrier Strike Group too intimidate us into letting Pakistan carry out genocide and raping and pillaging in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), something that caused hordes of refugees to flood into India.
Know the one single country that stood with us?
Russia.
Again, we aren't doing it out of a sense of revenge or getting back at the West.
We're doing what we're doing because we were forced into deep ties with Russia.
You can't just up and say "oi we no longer friends, me wants 'Murica now".
We might actually get Iron Dome, or version of it, from Israel.
India and Israel are close allies with ever deepening ties.
Defense against radical Islamic militancy being a strong common thread.
Because the West consistently sided against us time and again; and we were practically forced to rely on first Soviet and then Russian support for basically surviving?
Consequently we have close ties with them, and a large chunk of our defense infrastructure came from there in the past.
