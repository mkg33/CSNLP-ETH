There’s plenty of shit to complain about tucker for, but there’s no point in making stuff up.
That’s not the quote from the lawyers.
Also that case was about an isolated story, not mass shootings.
Most mass shooters weren’t criminals before their mass shootings.
They were people with problems who had easy access to guns they’ve been told their whole life will protect them from their problems.
So what do they do?
They use their guns to try to solve their problem.
Scarcity affects usage.
Period.
Diapers, water, electricity, condoms or guns.
The easier it is to get, the more it will be used.
If it’s easier to get a gun, it’s easier for criminals.
Or as is the case with most gun violence, it’s easier for the mentally unstable who then become criminals by using their easily obtained gun to hurt or kill others.
Additionally, what the " only criminals will have guns argument deliberately ignores, is that crimes involving gun use are punished so harshly that it is an effective deterrent to criminal use of firearms.
But the personal identification of the shooter in no way eliminates the potential impact of hate rhetoric and loose gun laws on the atrocity.
