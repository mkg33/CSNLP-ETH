Israel ranks roughly 90th out of about one hundred eighty countries surveyed for ethnic diversity.
Is fully half of the world that is less ethnically diverse then Israel trash?
Since when did Israel not fight its own battles?
Out of all the wars and conflicts Israel has been in, I canâ€™t think of any time that US troops were sent to fight for Israel.
But isn't the US for example, also much worse than Israel?
I have given specific factual example for why that is.
Obviously most are doing some shit, so in your opinion are all countries on planet earth trash?
Or is it just specific racism towards Israel (Plus maybe a few other specific countries you are biased against)?
I was asking specifically about why do you call the whole country of Israel trash because of a specific policy you don't like, and if you apply the same standards to other nations.
No, I am asking you how you determine that Israel is a "Trash" country and the answer seems to indicate that you judge it to completely different standards than most (If not all?)
countries of the world and also spread easy to verify false information about it with the same breath.
