Jefferson literally said things should be changed/amended every generation.
“Some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched.
"Some men look at Constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, & deem them, like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched.
they ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment.
I knew that age well: I belonged to it, and labored with it.
it deserved well of it’s country.
it was very like the present, but without the experience of the present: and 40. years of experience in government is worth a century of book-reading: and this they would say themselves, were they to rise from the dead.
I am certainly not an advocate for frequent & untried changes in laws and constitutions ... but I know also that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind ... we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.
".
Yep.
Thanks to u\Sega-Playstation-64's comment, I got curious and found the same source you did breaking down in a lot of detail the claim and evidence (or lack thereof) for the claim.
There's plenty to criticize Bush or any president for; there's no need to make up something when there's so much to legitimately discuss.
Edit: Fixed because I didn't realize I wasn't allowed to name-link another user when I first replied.
