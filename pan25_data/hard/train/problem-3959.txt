As someone who lives in China and survived the Shanghai lockdown, zero covid was a nightmare and the international news was full of horror stories.
Now all these people on Reddit who probably don't live in China are up in arms about this more relaxed approach to covid.
What is it that you guys want?
Do you want China to remain under permanent lockdown and its people to suffer just so you can laugh at us from outside and criticize what's happening?
I laugh my ass off at these kind of articles, trash talking China's covid policy whether they are tightening or loosening.
Have they considered the unmitigated disaster that is the US's covid "policy" which has lead to over a million deaths despite being the first to have MRNA vaccines?
China has already developed MRNA vaccine.
I don't get why "the west" is seen as so superior when the US still had over a million covid deaths so far despite being the first to use MRNA vaccines.
Here we have highly dense and aged populations that is not highly vaccinated and hasnâ€™t gotten Covid antibodies the hard way.
They are going to experiencing the exact same spikes that everyone else did.
But at a much lower and further removed vaccination rate.
Numbers out of hk show that their jabs are only marginally worse than Pfizer jabs to prevent deaths.
We used to just lockdown villages and wait for the disease to clear or everyone to die.
There is nothing ridiculous about trying it.
China hasn't made that "sacrifice" yet.
A ton of its elderly are not vaccinated, nor do they wish to do so.
So it's looking at hundreds of thousands of deaths if they let covid sweep through like everyone else.
