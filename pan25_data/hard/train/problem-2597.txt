If Donald Trump is actually as rich as he says he is, it's all being done illegally and off the books.
The CFO of the Trump Organization was literally just convicted on this.
They tell lenders the property is appreciating and they tell the IRS the property is depreciating.
The reason he has fought so hard to keep his financial records from becoming public is because he's a fucking fraud.
He's not been a legit businessman since he pissed all his dad's money away in the 80s and 90s, through his own incompetence.
He hasn’t had any actual money since the 1980s…forty fucking years ago.
If he had never been put on that fucking dumb TV show, to rehab a dying network with a dying old man who regularly pisses his pants and can’t hold a single coherent thought….none of this would have happened.
One of the two main political parties in this country thought it would be a perfect vessel to take total power.
I am ashamed of our citizens, that we can’t care enough to be bothered with holding people in power accountable.
Ultimately, our democracy needs some serious fixes.
Republicans who supported Trump need to be held to account.
Lastly, we need to start engaging constantly in our society and stop getting distracted by bread and circuses.
