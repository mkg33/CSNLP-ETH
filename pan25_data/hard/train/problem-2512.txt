There's "forgive and forget" and there's "this is a demonstrated weakness in our economy that Russia will attempt to use as leverage again if given the chance".
Nah.
Germany thought they were tying Russia to them just as much as Russia were tying Germany to Russia.
It wasn't lack of a capacity for long term thought, it was just long term thought based on an incorrect premise.
They've been disabused of that notion now.
In the very best of outcomes for Russia, their market for gas in the rest of Europe will be very significantly reduced for the long term.
It will not completely phase out gas, but the market for it may be smaller when Russia is back on it, and it may be less of a leverage for Russia.
Would be interesting to find out if Europe ever goes back to the huge dependency on Russian gas.
My guess is that it will, but probably not very soon even after relations are normalized.
Or maybe if there is a green energy revolution, it won't be such a critical issue any more.
We forgot about so many things in the past and the allure of cheap energy or new business markets will cause another “boom”.
My grandparents would have never imagined Germany or Japan would become such developed and trusted nations.
