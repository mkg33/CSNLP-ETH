Maybe they shouldn’t have played that card because once that’s the established narrative for domestic propaganda, there’s really no reason for NATO countries not to just send a shit ton of weapons.
For me, if NATO just reversed what they said, it just forces Russia to end their narrative, as they would therefore be accusing their own allies of being involved in the war too, which is something they wouldn't want.
An analyst I follow said something about how NATO and the US are actually terrified of a direct confrontation with Russian forces.
Because they have vastly overestimated the strenh of the Russian military.
Meaning they're ten times more prepared than they need to be.
Like, total air and sea control inside a week.
In a straight fight they'd wipe the country out so fast Putin would start sending out nukes.
If Russia strikes any NATO country with nukes, it’s game over for Russia.
Putin knows this.
That’s why i don’t believe they will unless their homeland itself is invaded and the invasion presents an existential threat.
The only real possibility IMO is them using one in Ukraine out of desperation, which would lead to a conventional response by NATO annihilating their military outside their borders.
And likely regime change within Russia as well.
That would be Putin’s ultimate blunder.
