Given the disparity in fleet sizes, the US Navy efforts to have one or more attack subs shadowing every Russian sub as soon as they leave port are probably more successful than not these days.
Some surely still slip away and hide successfully but the reduction in arctic ice makes it a lot harder for them to hide from air and space assets as well.
Not to try to convince anyone that a retaliatory Russia sub attack is off the table as some of the memes about Russian nuclear readiness would hope, but it's not the 1980s submarine war anymore.
Its really shocking to hear people from these countries spot Rhetoric like, "we joined the russian navy to protect our homeland against nato expansionist threats".
I've also heard they flew close, almost strafing runs, over NATO ships doing military drills in the Baltic Sea as if they were trying to provoke an attack.
They also simulate bombings on NATO targets.
Sounds like a great time to simulate a missile strike on the bombers.
Keep a spare supply of dummy missiles loaded with rainbow colored paint for just such an occasion and make the planes look gay when they return, ez.
