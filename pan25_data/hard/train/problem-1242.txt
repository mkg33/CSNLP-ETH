It doesn't make you think why it wsa being created in the lab in the first place?
And it doesn't make you question if it wsa an accidental leak or on purpose?
It doesn't make you wonder if the government knew the entire time how the pandemic began?

"Our data from the CDC today suggest that vaccinated people do not carry the virus.” - CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.

Okay, so in off the cuff statements it was said a couple of times, but unless you weren't paying any attention whatsoever to any other media and knew absolutely nothing about any other vaccines, then you would probably be smart enough to realize that there was still a chance you could get COVID even if you were vaccinated.
I think you misunderstood that quote though, he was speaking to one specific person, they got vaccinated and didn’t catch Covid, so technically he wasn’t lying or wrong.
You must have just misunderstood why he was talking to.
