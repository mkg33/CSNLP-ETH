My comment stands.
Charges for murdering and torturing people says nothing about whether or not authorities support the environment, so summarizing it as a win for the environment is both an unfounded claim, as well as an insensitive one to their families/supporters who almost assuredly see this first and foremost as a heinous crime against their loved ones rather than nature.
I think it just ends up being a rabbit hole when you try to explain why this is more fairly described as a case of criminal justice rather than environmental justice, since, as you said, there's no sensible way to compare the 2.
Diminishing the seriousness of environmental justice certainly wasn't my intent though.
I'd tie it to a corrupt justice system that has failed indigenous people.
I doubt the victims of such a system start/end with environmental activists.
In fact I'm sure many indigenous people don't give a flying fuck about "environmental justice" and see the more pressing issue as being one of basic human rights.
It's correct in a sense, but the companies from those rich countries didn't explicitly asked for indigenous people to get tortured/murdered in the process.
