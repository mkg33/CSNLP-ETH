I don't know why they would considering we have been and continue to support Pakistan militarily since they committed genocide in Bangladesh.
If it's actually true and India supports Russia's war in Ukraine then that's indefensible, but that's not necessarily true and all signs point to neutrality.
Still though, historically India has every right to be wary of United States foreign policy in south Asia.
Edit: Also for the record I have a lot of criticisms of Indian politics just like I do for every country.
All I'm saying is that with the United States history of supporting Pakistan I'm not surprised to see people of India perceive the US as a threat.
Historically the USA support for Pakistan had nothing to do with India, and just didn’t care how India felt about it.
India wanted favorable relations with Russia and picked a side.
The past has shown that Russia stands by India’s side, while the US supported Pakistan while they were in a war against India.
It is easy to understand why India wouldn’t just immediately switch from Russia to the US, especially when Russia is still India’s largest arms supplier.
But whatever, India will continue to support Russia and the United States will continue to ignore it.
I think it’s less hate USA for supporting Pakistan and more that USSR and later Russia and India have been long time allies.
Don’t support or like what the current administration is doing with Russia.
But also I understand how this came to be.
