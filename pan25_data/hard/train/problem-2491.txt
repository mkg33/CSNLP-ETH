The enrichment work you have to do to reach weapons grade is about twice the amount you need to do to reach reactor grade.
Edit: My point is that Iran has the capability to enrich to high-grade for years now.
The "closer than ever" talking point is kinda tautological and redundant.
Yes, they had set-backs due to sabotage and assassinations of key persons, but if Iran really, really wanted to build nukes they would have done so years ago.
Here is the news flash, Iran is not trying to build a nuclear weapon, because if they were, they would have already built them.
So they are closer than they were when they handed over enough fissile material to build 8-10 bombs at the start of the current deal (the one Trump pulled out of)?
Well, they did hand over most of their nuclear material stockpile and then did effectively stop research/enriching for a couple years... until the US decided to rip up the nuclear deal.
Now Iran has no reason to stop - why would they trust the US to not renege on the deal a second time?
Besides, Biden has.
