Really the only one of the 3 points the author mentions as the reason for decreasing population rate that can be addressed is immigration.
And well, lifespan, but I don't see that as having that big an impact on the topic of population increase.
Not that I'm saying we shouldn't be working to increase lifespan, just that the arguments in favor of population increase don't tend to favor an increase in older population lol.
Both of those things are very easy to fix.
The housing crisis in particular doesn't really apply here unless we are asking immigrants to try and purchase property in Manhattan.
Edit: but that doesn't mean others don't make their choice based on financial reasons.
Just because some people make unwise financial decisions doesn't mean everyone does.
Just because some people make poor financial decisions (choosing to have a child without being financially stable or able to afford it) doesn't mean everyone has to.
Yup, but don't say that while you're making enough money to afford it but don't want to sacrifice luxury or lifestyle that is unsustainable with children üëç.
No but you‚Äôre trying to say people are making excuses when finances are a perfectly good reason for many to wait on having kids.
It does not mean they don‚Äôt want kids.
