Between the insurance crisis and climate change crisis and this, I have no idea why anyone would want to live in this state.
Even from a Floridian Republican standpoint, he's utterly useless.
What practical thing has he done for them?
All of this Culture War BS does nothing.
It's so utterly baffling that they're unable to see this as pandering without substance for anything other than his blatantly-visible presidential campaigning.
No room for any quippy remarks this time around, just have to be candid with it: DeSantis' Florida is insanely fascist.
We can start by calling out anyone who defends supporters of fascism who refuse to acknowledge all GOP supporters are awful human beings.
Of course centrists, moderates, the apolitical and willingly ignorant are going to side with fascists at the end of the day, mostly be refusing to even recognize that evil.
But everyone else who does recognize that the GOP is 100% a fascist ideological organization and that anyone who supports them is a fascist as well, should also recognize that anyone defending supporters of fascism isnâ€™t too far off themselves.
