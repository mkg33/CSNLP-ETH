If you've ever worked in a professional environment, the word "remind" is more of an operative word for "you will be punished if you forget.
".
So here we are.
I'm at a loss as to what can be done at this point.
Since there are so many selfish folks out there who don't care about COVID and its consequences, all I can do is make sure that I and my family are taking every measure to protect ourselves.
Ugh, I'm sorry you went through that.
I also believe the vaccines saved my dad's life last year.
He had Moderna and the first Moderna booster and picked up COVID in rehab about 2 months after that.
We didn't know and the hospital sent him home in hospice to die.
It was very grave, and then 3 days after he was home, he woke up and said "I want pizza."
Deep down, I think I knew from that, that he was going to be okay, but we were still wait and see.
He was eventually discharged from hospice and he's still here with us, and will hopefully be able to celebrate his 88th birthday this may.
I honestly don't think anything Bernie would have done if he were president would change the behavior of those people.
(And before I get six hundred replies that Bernie isn't a Democrat, I know he's not.
But he does hang out with them and get invited to all their parties, so that's close enough).
