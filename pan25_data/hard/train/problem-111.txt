Russia/Wagner are again trying to intimidate their canon fodder from surrending to Ukrainian forces by making them think that Russia has people in Ukrainian cities to abduct and kill Russian "traitors".
Now there is a video of Dmitry saying he was abducted in an Ukrainian city before he gets killed with a sledgehammer.
We literally have video evidence of him being returned to Russia in a POW exchange so his killers forced him to lie about being abducted in an Ukrainian city.
Dmitry Yakushchenko surrendered to Ukrainian forces and was returned to Russian forces in a POW exchange on December 1, 2022.
There are videos of him in that POW exchange so we know whatever happened to him must have happened in Russia or in parts of Ukraine under Russian occupation.
The other thing being posted was that he was a POW that got exchanged for Ukrainian POWs.
This might again lead to inquiries from human rights groups as to what led to him being exchanged for Ukrainian POWs and his subsequent death.
The interesting thing is he says he is from Crimea (he even has a Ukrainian accent).
I would assume that Ukraine wouldn't want to exchange their (former?)
citizen for other Ukrainian citizens even if he is a traitor (i think it would be important to investigate what led him to fight for the Russian side).
A few things, it's good to see they are now acknowledging how their actions have now led to practically all of Ukraine being anti Russia.
And they also now do not tolerate any pro Russia nonsense like they did prior to Feb 22.
I would not be surprised if not even a visa is possible for them in Ukraine in the future and they used to have free access.
