There have been voices against it, just not the ones you want to hear.
Plenty of people in Israel don't like it either because it escalates problems in the region.
They're just taking the opportunity of Syria collapsing to conduct strikes.
By your logic if Syria attacked Israel on a weekly basis, it would be legitimate because they are "at war" because of a conflict 50 years ago.
Just because you don't like a government doesn't mean you can just go around attacking sovereign nations left and right.
Otherwise their is no world order and no one is safe.
Hence Russia invading Ukraine.
Syria is allies with Iran.
It's illegal to conduct strikes on a sovereign nation without their permission.
That's the equivalent of Russian striking our bases in another country because of a proxy war.
This could be a major escalation between Israeli-Russia relations as that air base allegedly houses Russian troops.
Quite likely a response to Iranian involvement in the Ukranian conflict and Putins speech yesterday that he wants to "deepen ties" with the Iranian regime.
