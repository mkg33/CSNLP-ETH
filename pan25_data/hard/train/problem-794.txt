because the right wing politicians, media figures, and religious leaders have been calling for the death of LGBTQIA+ people.
I find it extremely ironic that the people who organize in churches and have sermons about the sins of lgbt people every week are pissed off about grooming.
The ones that setup youth camps, Christian athlete associations, bible study in schools, missionary programs,etc.
Christians are the king of grooming!They have been grooming children since the start of Christianity into believing hateful violent and cruel ideas.
But as soon someone thinks it’s time to educate people on why that hateful rhetoric is wrong in an attempt to shield themselves from the violence suddenly they are pedophiles.
It’s fucking disgusting.
If republicans think reading books and dancing in women’s clothing is as bad as using guns to remove the sinners then they are exactly as psychotic as they sound.
Brilliant!
They talk about how gays are doing drag shows and reading books to kids (like that’s even a bad thing).
Meanwhile the shooters father is a meth head mormon republican who more than likely groomed him into a hateful killer that literally murdered people.
I mean the very reason that the gay and lesbian community feels the need to educate kids on gay and lesbian issues is because there are right wing religious zealots that are literally calling for them to be murdered in the streets.
