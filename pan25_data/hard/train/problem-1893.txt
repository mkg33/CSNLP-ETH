Absolutely.
Of course the minority should be represented, and of course they should still have a say in things.
THEY have regressed so far, and they are a minority of this country.
The majority of us are sane and want to move forward, but our system of government affords the minority a great deal of power.
What really gets me is how many things the senate does that are just "procedural rules," i.e.
things they just made up themselves and do because that's always how they've done them.
So much of the senate essentially functions on decorum it's flabbergasting.
Additionally, the senate is a complete joke.
Wyoming gets as much say in senate proceedings as California.
Each Wyoming Senator represents fewer than 300,000 people.
Each California Senator represents 20 million people.
I'm for protecting the rights of the minority, but up to a point.
Because of how our system is structured, Democrats are vastly underrepresented while Republicans are vastly overrepresented.
Even in the House, the proportion of actual votes that both parties receive do not reflect the proportion of seats.
