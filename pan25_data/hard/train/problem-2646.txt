Russia literally can't let Ukraine win because it'll mean a massive encroachment of forces that prevents them from ever regaining territory there ever again.
If Ukraine wins... can bet your ass it'll have several NATO or US military bases established and a massive uplift in missile defense systems and long range missiles.
Russia will be able to send missiles, rockets and artillery shells into Ukraine FOR THE REST OF HUMAN HISTORY.
Ukraine CAN'T join until the war is over.
All Russia has to do is never end it, and Ukraine will wither on the vine waiting for NATO and EU membership.
And exactly for the reason you give, Ukraine must join both the EU and NATO after this war.
Let's see Russia threaten Ukraine when it as well as other countries have their missiles pointed at Moscow.
Let's just agree to disagree then, the internal pressure in Russia is growing and the west have agreed to start providing offensive weapons to Ukraine.
I agree the war will not be over in the next 6 months but in a year or 2 I find it hard to believe that all of these combined pressures will not cause Russia to crack.
Every day that this war continues the rest of the world solidifies their resolve that Russia must no longer be a top military power.
