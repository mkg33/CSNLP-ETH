That being said, your overall point about Lousiana having a rampant crime, corruption, and injustice crisis is correct.
We still imprison about 1.6x as many people as the national average.
Louisiana's share of the US prison population is about 4.1%, with only 1.3% of the overall US population living here - so, 4x more than it statistically should be.
Sadly, it's very endemic to the state and I doubt it will get better anytime soon.
As a fellow Lousiana resident, that number is egregiously wrong.
As of 2021, Louisiana's incarceration rate is , or about 1.1% of the total population.
Currently, 4.6 million people reside in Louisiana.
An incarceration rate of 20% would mean that 920,000 of those people are in prison, which is more than 75% of the .
I think it's close to 20% of the total population is in prison.
That means if you walk into a 1st-grade classroom, you can point to four or five kids and they'll be in jail statically.
Crazy.
As someone who currently lives in Louisiana, it's true.
There was an article today that stated something like 27% of prisoners are held over their release date.
We put more people in jail than any other state (except for Oklahoma, which recently passed us up this year), and we have one of the highest incarceration rates in the world.
Our legal system is horribly broken, and everyone knows it.
