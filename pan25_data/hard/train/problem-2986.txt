Yeah, it’s just the extremes on both sides and everyone else that gets caught in the middle.
Neither side is really pushing for a reasonable solution either.
Each side wants it their way or no way and all of the people that just want peace get caught in the literal crossfire.
It’s sad honestly.
There was a quote in a book called Interventions by Kofi Annan who said it pretty well as to why there haven’t been cut and dry agreements is because “the maximum they can offer is less than the minimum the Palestinians can accept.”.
BTW, freezes on settlements have been offered to the Palestinians before (even by Netanyahu and these were refused by the Palestinians as “insufficient”).
The Israelis have proposed numerous compromises that have all been summarily rejected by the Palestinians.
The Israelis have shown a willingness to compromise for peace despite being in a position of strenh, the Palestinians have shown a refusal to accept any compromises despite being in the weaker negotiating position.
I would say I think at least the Israelis seem to be willing to move toward and offer a maximum.
It seems to me that there is no movement from the Palestinians toward that that minimum they will accept - it is what it is and that’s that.
