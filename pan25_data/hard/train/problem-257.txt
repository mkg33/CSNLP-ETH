I brought up MAD in another subreddit about the whole nuke situation and I got ripped apart about how Ukraine isn’t NATO and the treaty wouldn’t apply, yada yada ad nauseam.
You folks didn’t know shit about Ukraine a year before, while both Russians and Ukrainians have lost friends and family members there, families split apart both figuratively and objectively speaking,relatives killed, and im not taking about soldiers here, and NOBODY knows how to stop it.
I’ll never get to see my Ukrainian grandparents from Krolevets, Sumy Region again, as they both died of a heart attack during invasion, lots of people are missing, it’s ugly, its dirty, its war.
That just confirms you’re all talk and no balls, and don’t know shit about security services, police practices that involve your family and friends, kangaroo courts, Russian prisons, torture and absolute lack of justice.
It’s easy being brave on Reddit, it’s not so easy when you have your family, elderly parents, children and friends that can be taken hostage.
