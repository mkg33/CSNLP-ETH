The new measures also include an EU embargo on Russian seaborne crude.
Only Hungary and a select few others are allowed import via pipelines.
The countries importing the biggest amounts via pipeline are Germany and Poland, with both countries closing those pipelines.
There are still many countries outside of the G7 and Europe that require Russian oil and won't be able to buy more expensive oil.
Currently, benchmark Brent crude is trading at about $86.
If the price cap was set at 30 like Poland suggested, Russia would probably stop exporting oil driving up prices even further and leave many countries without oil.
The idea behind the oil cap is also to either force Russia to sell oil at a minimal profit or have them waste ressources on building their own shipping and insurance evosystem.
This is economically complicated but allowing Russia to sell at a cap is probably the best way to limit their total oil revenue.
By setting a price cap at $60 with an expected cost of $30-$50, the move seriously limits the profit Russia can make, especially if the market price is around twice that.
So Russia has a choice: sell to their historically biggest customers at a steep discount and then have other customers demand the same price, or go without any money at all.
