tl:dr --- The US is noticing that some countries are beginning to falter in support for the Ukrainian war, with the majority of the rhetoric behind this decline being that Ukraine is not trying to do peace talks.
Basically this is just the US asking Ukraine to make a diplomatic gesture that Ukraine is trying every avenue for peace, the US knows these talks will not accomplish anything, but it makes for a good optics and makes it harder for people to stop supporting Ukraine since it's doing EVERYTHING it can, even if peace talks would be pointless.
The move is not intended to push Ukraine to the bargaining table, but instead to ease international fears about supporting an indefinite war, The Post reported, and is a sign of the increasingly complex foreign policy strategy being employed by the White House.

"In an effort to bolster international support for the ongoing war, the Biden administration is urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reverse his previous stance and signal he is open to peace talks with Russia, according to reporting by The Washinon Post.
The Biden administration is encouraging Ukraine to support peace talks with Russia nearly 9 months after invasion began to ease int'l fears about supporting an indefinite war, WaPo reports \ This could've been a better title.
Offside thought, there's no way to know if the Biden administration is pushing for this as a way to strenhen flagging support for Ukraine, or if they're actually hoping for a settlement with Russia as one possibility in the future but explaining it as such in order to not catch too much fire for it.
