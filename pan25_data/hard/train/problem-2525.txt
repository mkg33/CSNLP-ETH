Nah, Ukraine has been very vocal that they need tanks and IFV's to be able to conduct another offensive on the scale of the "Kharkiv Blitzkrieg" around spring time.
My guess that the Ukrainian Forces already have enough tanks for the counter offense, but they need new ones after they destroyed or broken, because of offensive operations.
This is why the USâ€™s Abrams tanks are not recommended for Ukraine and the Soviet era tanks are encouraged to be sent to Ukraine, even as these relics are still powerful, but extremely vulnerable to RPGs or similar AT weapons.
Do all of the Ukrainian tankers have a good enough understanding of English to operate the tank and possess the very specific terminology the tank itself uses that American soldiers are taught at Fort Knox?
The odds are Ukraine is not going to do this, they need tanks NOW and if they don't have the specialized tools and warehouses of repair parts to fix them, these tanks would be considered disposable once they break down OR are taken out by Russia.
