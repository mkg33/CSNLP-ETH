Not chinese.
The Russians have india by their balls w.r.t defense.
If they decide to stop giving spare parts to India, our defence is fucked..so india cannot stop any normal trade unless sanctioned by US.
US diplomats understands this.
Also US don't want Russia to move closer to China.. its 3d chess played out here..not tic- tac like reddit thinks it is..
Good thing redditors do not run international diplomacy..comments here are so short sighted.
India supplies leather = india bad.
But don't think about what would happen if India doesn't supply leather...
Also, the companies are only selling raw leather.
Calling out companies that are exporting raw leather that could get used to make boots in Russia by Russians is over reaching.
Also, India is one of largest, if not the largest, leather exporter in the world.
Some of their leather will get used by people you don’t agree with.
Actually, the article doesn’t say shit but accuse “right wing” government of not aligning with the Western countries.
The one company they pointed out is supplying boot products, not finished boots that would meet military standards.
If anything, these are COTS products (commercially off the shelf).
