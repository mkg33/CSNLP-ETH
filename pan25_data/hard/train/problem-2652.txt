Yep.
Anyone who has been through serious depression will put up with nearly any side effects because there’s nothing the drug can do to you that isn’t still better than being in the pit of despair.
When you're experiencing a long period of extreme depression and hopelessness the dulling of that feeling is a good thing to me.
The problem is the lenh of that feeling (again it was for months).
However I absolutely missed those small moments of pure excitement I would experience when I wasn't having an episode and when I went off the meds for a while it only took a year before I had anothee long depressive episode and went back on them.
Now outside of that depressive episode I was generally a pretty emotional person in the sense that my emotions had very wide ranges throughout the day (common with adhd).
I had to go on medication and it took me out of that depressive episode (which lasted for months).
It's hard because while the medication certainly helped get rid of the hopeless feeling that anyone with depression knows all too well, I also lost those small moments of pure joy I would experience outside of the depressive episode.
It did indeed dull everything.
I'm back off them for now and have been for a year with no problems but it's a tough choice to decide if I should risk another long period of no energy and no hope at the expense of the relatively small, but frequent, moments of pure joy and excitement, or if the dulled emotions are better overall.
It's a tough choice.
