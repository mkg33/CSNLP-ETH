Nominally Israel and Saudi governments have no issue with each other and have been working with each other for quite some time.
Saudi Arabia doesn't normalize relations because most of their population hates Israel; but on a political level, both are US client states and honestly quite close.
Lots of Middle East governments have been normalising relations with Israel but their populations at large still detest Israel and that won't change anytime soon, not while the whole Israel/Palestine conflict is ongoing.
For now it hasn't translated much to governments which are still heavily supportive of Israel but that isn't going to remain the same in the future if more and more of the population aren't supportive of it.
And even in the West traditionally supportive countries of Israel is sliding away from good views on Israel, general population wise that is.
Rising dislike in Europe and the US even, where even politicians are taking previously unheard of criticism against Israel.
And this isn't a hive mind thing or a leftist nonsense, among the general population it is shifting against Israel, sadly much of it is shifting towards literal anti semitism as well with growing amounts of it in both Europe and the US.
This is outside the halls of academia.
Social media being the fuel behind most of it.
None of this is hard to find.
