Russia can try and outlaw the price cap as hard as they damn well please.
The two biggest remaining markets for Russian oil (China and India) are both already buying well under the cap price anyway, and that's to say nothing of the utter lack of capacity in the shipping industry that is neither flagged in a country that agreed to the price cap, or covered by an insurance company based in a country that agreed to the price cap.
EU and a few others imposed a price cap, saying you can't pay more than a certain price for russian oil, also they in reality can't move oil to other customers further away at a higher price as it also applies to the ships and their insurers.
My thinking is that if the EU has to back down from the price cap due to the effects on their economy, Russia can dictate terms on restarting the oil deal, which I would assume would cover the fines from the breaches of contracts and other compensation.
It comes down to who blinks first.
Also, OPEC could also tighten the supply even more.
also, I did not know about the oil industry and the effects of stopping the oil drilling.
thanks for the info .
if Russia stops production completely and takes all their oil off the global market, it would cause the oil price to jump drastically.
If India pays 'normal' prices now (say, 80 dollars), it would be cheaper than the elevated prices with messed up supplies (maybe 150+ dollars).
India is still going to buy it all, even if it's "normal" price because others will charge more due to increased demand.
India gains nothing long term, but if they'd take the short term lose we'd all be better off in the long run.
