Maryland in all likely hood will also be a Blue trifecta for the first time since 2015 (the race for Governor has been called for Wes Moore but not all state legislature races have been called yet.
On the other hand dems had a super majority in both chambers going into the election so it's very unlikely it will flip to republican control).
The Republicans kept control of the State House of Representatives, but their majority got reduced from 24 to 3, based upon current vote totals.
So that means 203R and 197D.
The NH State House tends to have a certain faction of R extremists in it, so it will be interesting to see how the body functions given the close split.
There is a very very strident contingent of far right extremists in NH unfortunately.
To their credit, they are very passionate, very aggressive, very vocal and very committed... way more than any other political faction here.
They take no prisoners for sure and compromise is not there thing.
If you were to participate in political social media forums up here, you would think that the state is exactly like Wyoming or Oklahoma, etc., in that you would think the state is almost entirely controlled by this group.
However, that is not really the case.
There really is a fairly "silent majority" that is measured and more reasonable, that does not engage as visibly.
I kind of understand that because it is difficult to interact with an often hostile, passionate contingent...
I have the scars to prove it... ;-).
The Democratic US Senator and 2 Democratic US Representatives crushed the competition and retained their seats.
Democrats swept all three parts of government even though my Republican district legislators held their seat.
I'm hoping they add abortion rights in the state constitution.
