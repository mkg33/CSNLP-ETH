Exactly my thoughts.
Blood is in the water and China is waiting to get a piece of meat.
If nothing else, China will take full advantage of Russia in the future.
Could be that in the event that happens NATO is clear to just glass russia...and if fallout hits china, in well.
Not saying nato WILL go nuclear but if it did china wouldnt be able to claim aid for the fallout caused.
My argument here is if Intel shows russia will seriously launch nukes everywhere if we get directly involved in any fashion.
Basically tell them to respect our 1st strike doctrine at that point, since they already launched one in a war of aggression without cause, if Intel networks said russia will launch a their nukes world wide it would have to be done.
Well wile Nuclear weapons being used is a legitimate concern, its always good to remember that they were used only once in actual warfare and it wasn't Russia that did it, neither is Russia the country that holds the highest number of nuclear weaponry.
Edit: oh yeah, sorry about that, the downvotes are because I said that they were used only once, but actually they were used twice, right?
