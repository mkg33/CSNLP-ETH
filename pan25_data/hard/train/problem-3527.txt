I can think of some reasons.
If these are more significant surveillance intrusions that prompted such an aggressive response, it really starts to droll up war drums at a sensitive time.
Russia is going bats, China being China... countries trying to join NATO, we're supplying lots of money and weapons to Ukraine, and we're still very much within a global pandemic aftermath with economic uncertainty.
These kinds of conditions are ripe for global conflict, and I don't think Biden really desires to be the face dealing with that.
It's one thing to say, "Oh yeah, they had some dumb balloon but it gains them no new info, so we just let it slide."
It's another to say "Yeah so these ones were not only threats to airspace but also had some tech that posed a significant risk to national security and they're sending dozens whereas before they weren't".
The question in the latter case becomes "Okay.
So what are we gonna do to respond?
".
Yeah.
I have to imagine the objects were always up there, but nobody shot them down until the China balloon.
not gonna lie the fact they were quick to call the other one a chinese spy balloon yet not say anything about the others other than refer to them as 'objects' is pretty strange.
Chinese spy balloon becomes a media story and now all of the sudden everyone has to actually follow all those annoying rules or get their GoPro shot down by an F-22 lol.
I'm still not 100% sure we're not just shooting down all the hobbyists that don't bother to put a beacon on their balloons now that the sensitivity is increased.
