I don't think there's such a thing as an "apolitical" military.
If, say, tomorrow Modi orders the military to go ahead and seize the Supreme Court and arrest opposition, the military will have two choices: To obey the state or to disobey it, and both of these are political positions.
Another point is that the military is not a monolith.
So if the aforementioned scenario does happen, the most likely outcome we'll see is that a portion of the military diobeys, while the other doesn't.
The size of these portions is what decides whether or not India remains a democracy.
Believe it or not, people in India do favor democracy and the right to choose who governs them.
Add to this the fact that this country is extremely diverse, it is nearly impossible for one person to rule over them all.
Modi gets away with a lot of these shenanigans unfortunately because we honestly have no better alternative right now.
It's not like people vote for Modi, they are voting for the least incompetent party right now.
This all being said though, BJP (Modi's party) does not rule over all the states in India.
It's true that BjP can use the president as a proxy to control the military.
But fortunately the Indian Military is apolitical and does not show bias.
Atleast not yet.
People are simply discounting the point that India is EXTREMELY diverse.
Each state is like a whole new country.
We all know what happened less than 100 years ago when someone tried to rule over India.
India is just too diverse for one party to rule.
If he does try to take control by force, there will be major civil unrest.
And Indians just do not like being ruled.
India had a very close brush with being ruled by an authoritarian leader before and it simply did not work.
