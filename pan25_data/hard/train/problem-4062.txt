That would be a perfect play book from a dictators around the world - Our country is better (Republicans don’t get it) - Republicans are running on blind hate and treason!
Sorry if this offends you or whatever, but out in the real world the Republicans are comprehensively a basket case of crazies, grifters, and fools.
Anyone who can’t spot these obvious charlatans for what they are is, at best, painfully gullible.
Your options are smart, self-interested, or spiteful.
Choose two.
Of course, smart people can be fooled into thinking that something is in their self-interest, for instance if they genuinely believe however mistakenly that they’ll come out ahead if Republicans win, but let’s just lump “smart” and “has accurate priors” into the same category for the sake of convenience.
So if they’re not smart enough to understand the concept of making more money even though they’re being taxed more, don’t you see that’s kind of a ding against them being smart?
It’s not self-interest that truly motivates Republicans, it’s power.
Plain and simple.
Having the working class grow faster relative to the rich is less preferable to them than taking a marginal hit to the income of the rich in exchange for keeping the working class down and income inequality skyrocketing.
Why?
Because a society dominated by the ultra-wealthy is a hierarchical society, and they want the ingroup to have a monopoly on that unlimited power, while the outgroups get banished to the political and economic wilderness.
