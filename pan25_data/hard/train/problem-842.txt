As in part of the storyline or when they end up on your team in competitive play?
In my experience they're often some of the biggest shitheads to play with online as well.
"Guy who swears at team and calls them all loser n____r f__s is upset his culture is often portrayed as the villains in gaming".
It's funny because lots of countries often seem upset when the US portrays them as villains in film (with the US/West being heroes) yet ignores the many other variety of movies also portrays fighting against corrupt elements in the US or Western society.
Not exactly the US itself, but the only American in the film was definitely a villain, and he definitely represented the US government.
Because the us is arguably still the heroes of such stories, its just the noble people of America vs a villainous government.
There are vanishing few stories that I can think of where the conflict is us vs an external nation with the us being the villain.
Edit:at least in terms of what ever makes its way to American audiences, im sure its much easier to find such stories the the middle east or south America.
