Yesterday tego rockets hit Poland and killed 2 people.
At first there was big panic (especially in the internet) but now it slowly is clarified.
It were not Russian rockets but Ukrainian AA (as it seems now).
Ukraine firing a Russian made mistake seems sus.
My guess is a false flag op to draw NATO into direct conflict with Russia or Russia accidentally/provokingly fired the middle and NATO is scared to acknowledge it because they don’t want to engage directly with Russia.
Just a guess, but I have a hard time believing the Ukrainians were firing Russian missles, accidentally hit Poland, then blamed Russia publicly.
The first time I've heard about a missile being dropped in Poland, I was skeptical about all comments pointing to Russia being responsible for the so-called attack, because if Putin had really wanted to threaten NATO with such provocations, he would've done it as soon as his war in Ukraine wasn't going according to plan.
To be honest, it was a matter of time before such an accident happened in the vicinity of the Polish border with Ukraine, considering how imprecise Russian and Ukrainian missiles are.
If Russia wasn’t sending missiles into Ukrainians, mainly hitting civilians, do you think Ukraine is responsible for an anti missile defense system misfire?
Clown.
You don’t know about war, do you?
Deadly accidents DO happen.
Us national guard shot down a Canadian aircraft during the Afghanistan war.
If it was Ukraine that did hit Poland, then it would have had to have been a dense missile.
Meaning the missile that hit Poland wouldn’t have been launched if a missile threat didn’t happen.
If this does happen to be a badly launched missile to defend against Russian missiles, I think it’s a clear message we should give them missiles that don’t miss.
