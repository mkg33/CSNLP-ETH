Ukraine is pretty far down the totem pole in regards to having a modern military.
In either case, Ukraine is not Afghanistan and is already a western democracy.
There is close to zero chance that letting Ukraine fall to Russia will work out better for the US, NATO or Ukraine than giving them the weapons and training they need to win against their autocratic neighbor.
But even that is only a short term measure, because it’s becoming increasingly more and more unlikely that Russia will be able to hold back Ukraine.

It’s pretty screwed up, but it was the most cost-effective way of progressing Russias interest - to cause the USA to fight against itself.
If Russia wants to expend Russian troops that way, then so be it, but continually pummelling their army will continue to weaken it.
Russia can still end this, by simply withdrawing their troops, but Putin does not want to do that, because it likely means him becoming deposed.
The best thing would be for the Russian troops to turn around, withdraw from Ukraine, and depose the present Kremlin leadership.
