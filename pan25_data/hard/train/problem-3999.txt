They say it because they did not get human right violation to them or their family, since they do have a power now, but when ots happen to them, i am sure they are would be the first to yelling about human right.
How despicable can you be, when you're talking about human rights, then start threatening with cutting off food, you're just proving my words, you're someone with a superiority complex, and once faced with your own violations you lashed out, this is just sad.
Egypt pays for these grain shipments and it could obtain it from other states, I am just calling out how stupid his/her argument is and how much of a hypocrite he/she is.
But what's even more interesting, you keep digging holes for yourself, you've stated that "so you can make people suffer without accountability" that's a great point, but the West always got away without being held accountable, from the collation that destroyed Iraq to what is relatively recent NATO's military intervention Libya, and that's just two random encounters, so yeah, talk about accountability, the West should set an example and hold itself accountable for its violations before calling out others, that's crucial if there's any actual will to actively promote human rights, but at this point, this is just virtue signaling and posturing.
What a strawman, you've clearly glossed over the main point, that you yourself made, you've made an argument that Egypt doesn't have the right to interfere with the decisions made by the EU because they're not part of it, which prompted my response, but apparently you have an issue in comprehension then went on with your superiority complex to give me a preach about morals and human rights..
So they can come out with a resolution on Egypt when it's clearly not a member of the EU or the continent itself, but the Egyptian parliament which is actually a representative of Egypt, cannot respond?
What kind of logic is that?
