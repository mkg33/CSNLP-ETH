Will take a while.
The gas storages around Europe are still full of gas that was bought for high prices.
It’s likely that even a year from now, some % of the gas storage still expensive gas bought last autumn.
The lower this % becomes, the lower prices will become.
Let's not pretend that they're trying to lower prices as quickly as possible or at all.
If competition doesn't force them to drop prices back down they will simply keep them.
In the most competitive industries prices will fall first.
Its the ones where 1-3 companies control everything that prices will stay put.
honestly, I hope it stays this way with the price levels.
A former secretary-general from nato mentioned in an interview recently that the reason for gas prices to drop is because of less need ( less economic growth ) in China.
If china needs more gas next year or in 2024 people in europe very likely have to deal with higher prices again.
btw i’m no expert so i don’t know if it currently is the main influence on the prices.
