Putin met with a panel of "aggrieved military widows" earlier during the war in Ukraine, and I believe it was later shown that most were state crisis actors.
Now we’re seeing Russia use the Makiivka barracks strike and support from a Putin aligned “widow’s group” as grounds for full mobilization.
And we ask our President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin to allow the Russian Army to conduct a large-scale mobilization that will meet the situation that has developed on our borders.
In Russia, there are tens of millions of men of military age who we have to rely on and to engage the enemy.
But what can our men do, sitting at home, without capable command, supplies and uniforms?
Mobilization is what will give them a chance to survive.
We are the soldiers' widows of Russia.
We are the ones who did not hide our husbands behind our skirts.
We are those who are ready for anything for the sake of our great Victory.Today, all the world's evil has united against Russia, the entire Western world has taken up arms against us.
Either us or them, there is no other choice.
Discussed in another sub, it's likely so.
I found this widows group's Telegram.
They are called Солдатские вдовы России.
The channel has posts advocating for better financial support for war widows amongst other things: clarification of status of widows of mobilized prisoners, how to report deserters of the mobilization, etc.
From the other posts in channel, there's no real sense of ownership of discussions.
I think they're real, but hardliners, but others believe it's a Kremlin job.
Now is not the time to be cowardly, now is not the time to bargain - when Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin issued Order No.
227 "On measures to strenhen discipline and order in the Red Army and prohibit unauthorized withdrawal from combat positions", which we remember as the "Not one step back" order, he did not think about some ratings and the grievances of "dissenters" - he thought about Victory.
