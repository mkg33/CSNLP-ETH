My god, you're lucky you didn't do worse.
I stubbed my toe once and ended up raiding the capitol building.
People got killed and I shat in the building while chanting about hanging some guy can't remember his name my memory doesn't work well enough to remember who.
At least the government was understanding and I got less time than I would have if I had been caught with 8 oz of weed.
/s in case it isn't obvious.
It's not that unclear.
South Africa accepts common law, in addition to the statute defined law, so laws that seem vague like this in writing are pretty well grounded in precedent and judicial opinion.
South Africa uses common law, so standards set by legal precedent remove most of the ambiguity seen in the statutory definition.
So, as you say, the community has played a role.
For example, one of the tests for whether crimen injuria occurred or not is whether a different, reasonable person in the perceived victim's position would have been degraded.
This objective test is don't defined in statute, but under common law, but I think it's demonstrates that there isnt really that much ambiguity.
Precedent has been set for these kinds of cases for everything from cases of stalking to racism, so it's rare for a situation to crop up that is open to a lot of misinterpretation.
