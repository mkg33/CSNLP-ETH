I feel like Swiss neutrality is kind of pro-Russia.
It feels kind of like a crime of indifference; just think back to Nazi Germany and how we call out people who lived back then and didn't support the Nazis yet decided to do nothing.
We mostly just blame them for going along with the Nazis due to their indifference.
By not allowing arms that are going to Ukraine to pass through their country the Swiss are complying with the Kremlin's demands via indifference imo, even if they don't realize it.
Switzerland is denying all arms shipments to Ukraine declaring that it goes against their policy of neutrality.
Here, we're not speaking of the principle of neutrality directly, as selling arms to third country doesn't mean they are involved directly in the conflict (in opposition to if they offered or sold them directly to Ukraine).
But more that they have laws that prohibit their weapons to be used in conflicts and prohibit the reselling of such material to countries at war.
That being said, for neutrality reasons, went this law to be abolished, the same opportunities should be given to both parties (therefore also Russia).
