To be fair, he was a Republican for 4 years (1997-2001) and a Dem before and after, getting elected to state Senate in 2006, so he was probably a political switch, but I imagine the first switch was one as well.
This doesn't mean his current views align with the broader Democrat party, they certainly don't.
Truth is that most Democrats are closer to Republicans than they are to progressives in regard to policy.
Trump is an extreme example of Republicanism on steroids, and even with that, policy under Biden doesn't differ from where it was in the Trump years by very much.
Oh look, progressive organizations pushing for their members/progressives in general to support Biden in the general election.
Much like how progressives are more passionate about preventing insufficiently left wing Democrats from getting elected than they are about preventing far right Republicans from getting elected.
That's because a lot of New York "Democrats" are actually Rockefeller Republicans who want to vote for moderate Republicans, but moderate Republicans don't exist anymore, so they're forced to vote Democrat instead, and they drag the party rightward.
The former Democratic governor of New York propped up centrists who broke away from the Democratic party, formed their own 3rd party, and used it to give the Republicans (who lost the election, mind you) control of the state legislature, all so he didn't have to sign on for a $15 minimum wage and the New York Health Act.
The governor and these democrats youre defending all decided they prefer republican governance over democratic governance.
