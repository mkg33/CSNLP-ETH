My father was not even allowed into the hospital to visit me at my birth and was unable to take a single day off from work to bond with me as a newborn.
That bond with both parents is equally important for infants and we routinely hurt our children by not letting them bond with their dads.
Also, please explain why your statement is not heteronormative because gay couples that adopt face way more hurdles for family leave than women do.
That group is the working class.
Dividing us by gender just pits us against each other instead of uniting us against the capitalist class that's exploiting both men and women.
Now that you know my truth, please explain to me why this statement that "it disproportionately affects women" is not complete and utter bull$ +?
My reply was to point out that while both genders are negatively affected by this, that does not make it gender neutral because one is and has been more negatively affected.
If this is to be a gender neutral issue, as in we all recognize that both genders are significantly harmed by patriarchal gender stereotypes, then we must also do that do all issues involving sexism.
I am absolutely all for that and think we should.
However, in doing so, we can not deny the differences in levels of harm, or we will not be able to find solutions that fully support both genders equitably.
