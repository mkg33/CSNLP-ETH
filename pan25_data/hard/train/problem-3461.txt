Compare that to Snowden who took extra precautions to ensure intel involving individuals who could be put at risk was not revealed.
In Snowden's case, a big factor was the exercise of editorial control to scrub the information provided of anything that could put people in danger.
Assange didn't do that.
Wikileaks release people's social security, medical, banking, and credit information.
Even if the more serious charges were dropped, the guy is still guilty of a boatload of federal crimes that have nothing to do with making the US government look bad and everything to do with nonexistent editorial standards.
That's because, in a move that has not endeared him to the US Government, Assange and Wikileaks increasingly became tools of Russian misinformation campaigns from 2015-2016 onward.
After the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced its assessment that Russia was behind the hacking operation, Assange continued to deny that the Clinton materials released by WikiLeaks had come from Russian hacking.
According to media reports, Assange told a U.S. congressman that the DNC hack was an “inside job,” and purported to have “physical proof” that Russians did not give materials to Assange.182.
If you look at the documentation over the past six years, it looks like the US Government wants to charge Assange with things like computer hacking and conspiracy.
What's unclear is if they really have any good proof connecting Assange to such actions.
In a lot of ways, Assange himself seems to allude to most of these accusations being true.
I'd believe them.
He's like a lot of people in his sphere honestly.
Lots of bluster.
Lots of self importance.
Very little appreciable thought going on.
