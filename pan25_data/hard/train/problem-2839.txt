That being said, the B-52 is probably the closest example of the ship of theseus paradox in real life.
After it was rewinged and its internal structure was altered and just about all of its systems are gradually being replaced.
And they've been around for so long that most people don't remember what it used to look like before the cockpit was changed.
This is the most change we've seen in the air force in decades, going on all at once.
F-16's are being upgraded, B-52's are getting new engines alongside other upgrades, F-15 EX's are being bought, F-35's are being bought, the NGAD program/Project Mayhem/Loyal Wingman competition are all underway, a range of new missiles and other weapons/systems are under development, etc.
It depends on what we're talking about.
Jets have a u shaped curve to cost for example.
They start off expensive, drop in cost per unit as economies of scale kick in, and as they age they become increasingly expensive to maintain.
At a certain point it's more affordable to buy new platforms, and you can't upgrade old air frames/platforms forever for a few reasons.
And yeah, in general new tech (especially cutting edge tech) is expensive.
They are expensive.
No doubt.
But like a lot of things it is worth taking a step back and understanding these industries employee millions and millions of Americans paying them good wages which they then spend in communities.
