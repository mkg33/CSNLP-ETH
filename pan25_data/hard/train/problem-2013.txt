If they thought there was even a 1% chance it was actually from outside our planet I really doubt we’d have heard about it.
This is definitely something less interesting.
Hmm that's a really interesting point, very interesting.
Kites...just like Benjamin Franklin.
A kite with a key, the key to all this maybe, or maybe encryption keys?
In a storm, a gathering storm not unlike the news today possibly.
And that kite was struck by lightning, electricity, natural electricity.
I think you solved it, that sounds like American Electronic Warfare.
I started pulling on that thread a little bit and found AEW wrestling, a competitor to WWE.
I think this has to do with the U.S. not wanting China to start a competing Professional Wrestling circuit.
It's all so clear now.
Good work comrade friend.
The plot thickens... turkey, the bird, but maybe Türkiye, the country.
But wait it was the Ottoman Empire in Ben Franklin's day.
Ottoman like the modern furniture for resting your legs.
And what do you put over your legs when you're relaxing and chilly, thats right an Afghan as in the blanket, but also the peoples.
And the finest most expensive (follow the money) afghans are made of cashmere, which etymologically comes from?
You guessed it Kashmir.
Where china has skirmished in recent history.
It’s probably also a tactic to keep from escalating things with china.
They don’t wanna keep saying they’re shooting down Chinese spy balloons after all the idiots freaked out about the last one wanting to get super trigger happy.
If they’re avoiding calling it a “balloon” it’s probably because they don’t want it to sound quite as silly when they say they sent in a hundred million dollar ultra sophisticated killing machine to shoot it down.
My money is on it being a CCP balloon that they’ll conveniently shoot down to demonstrate they’re both justified in their espionage and demonstrate their anti air capabilities.
