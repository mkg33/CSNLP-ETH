I mean, if they actually were in possession of clear evidence of a crime, announced that they possessed such evidence, and then withheld it, that would be, ya know, also criminal....
I kind of feel like if there was evidence of a clear crime that could be prosecuted, any of these knuckleheads like Giuliani or Tucker would have been shouting specifics at the top of their lungs.
You could tell that rattled him, so he then told me he watched them in a location that was not his home or tied to him in any way, on devices that were not his, and none of it could not be traced back to him.
At some point in time I came across a guy on here who claimed to have seen the child porn videos from Hunters laptop.
So I asked If he just admitted to watching child pornography and where did you watch these child pornography videos?
I then asked him if he or the person in possession of these videos reported it to the police, because child pornography is illegal to possess or distribute, and if Hunter really was involved with it the police should be notified.
