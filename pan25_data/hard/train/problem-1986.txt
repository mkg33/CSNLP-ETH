They are okay giving men guns knowing some will do bad things and kill women and children with those guns, but they draw the line at giving women essential medical care, because you know - and not that I care nor it’s my business - some women use abortion like birth control.
I think there were a whole lot of "I don't like wanton at-will abortions, but abortions under some circumstances are ok," people who very quickly flipped what side of the fence they were sitting on.
Coming from someone who thinks a person's rights don't matter if there are people who think abortion is murder and who blithely says a constitutional argument in favor of abortion rights does not, in fact, argue in favor of abortion rights...you'll have to forgive if I'm skeptical of your claims.
The person I responded to said there needs to be an explicit amendment in the Constitution saying that people have a right to abortion, but that isn't how individual rights are discussed in the Constitution.
The Constitution limits what the government can do with respect to people's rights, not defines what is or isn't acceptable for individuals.
Again, consider the 10th Amendment: if it doesn't say "unless there's a law saying otherwise, it's legal," what gives you the right to be posting inane comments on Reddit?
If the equal protection of law clause of the 14th Amendment doesn't mean laws can't be written that affect only some citizens, explain what you think it means.
If the rights and immunities clause of Article IV doesn't mean a citizen's rights extend beyond the borders of her state, explain what you think it means.
Add to that the universality of law clause from Article IV, and the nondiscriminiation clause of the 14th Amendment, and you get a clear case for why you can’t write laws that affect some citizens and not others.
