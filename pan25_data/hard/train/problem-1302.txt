Realize that the vote for speaker is the whole House, not just the individual party.
Meaning if the split is 218 - 217, every single Republican has to vote for their candidate else the Democrats can win control.
Because most definitely there will be 217 Democrats sitting in that chamber ready to pounce.
If Republicans have a majority, is not going to be a Democrat.
There are no independents in the House.
Pick a moderate moderate Republican, offer to have all Democrats vote for him, heâ€™ll definitely vote for himself.
You just maybe need one or two more Republican votes.
In a perfectly divided House, you only need the one Republican to vote for himself.
House is supposed to be the least partisan arm of congress as they are your direct representative.
Their party should be irrelevant if they represent you properly.
Anyone can be speaker.
Even if they are not in Congress.
The House is not the Senate.
You have to run every 2 years and need your party's support.
The only people that might flip are those that barely won and their district is going more blue.
More than likely not though.
