And every day that bill doesn't get put up for a vote, is another day that reinforces that Republican leadership does not see it as worth their time.
I eagerly await the bill from Republican Leader McCarthy that is surely being drafted, to find a way to move forward to resolve the issue that led to this catastrophe.
Gotcha, are you suggesting that President Biden draft a bill or regulations to prevent this from happening again?
That the regulations that were already inadequate that republicans thought was too much, should have gone further?
He won’t of course because the democrats are quite the sociopaths that republicans seem to aspire to be.
Yes, if Biden played it like republicans with migration chaos he would say “yeah that whole area is contaminated and I wouldn’t go there, they voted for this lack of regulations, you wanted deregulation, you got it, enjoy”.
Republicans were against even easier regulations but you are faulting the democrats for somehow not enforcing even stricter rules?
