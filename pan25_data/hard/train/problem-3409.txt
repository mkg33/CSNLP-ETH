Not trying to small talk the other armed forces, but only very few of them got a large armed force with combat experience.
And Turkey, besides having the second largest armed force in NATO, also is one of the few with a significant combat proven force.
Calls from opposition politicians and pacifists, leftists and whatnot cannot make up for the loss not only of a strategic country and a large army, but an army with combat experience and a defense industry to back it up.
I mean no one is actually doubting Turkeys role in NATO.
At least no one who actually matters.
Calls to kick Turkey out of NATO always come from the media and sometimes oppositional groups, but never from core government officials in the UK and US.
Hell there are almost no such calls from government officials in Germany, France and Italy either.
And that is what NATO is.
i would not trust turkey to do anything with NATO especially with intel.
Erdo isnt on anyones side but his, but his friendship with poopybutt and luka are concerning.
