Taiwanese still feel massive resentment for being beaten back onto an island by a militia force.
They are embarrassed by it.
The cultural revolution really hurt Taiwanese as well, they felt sentimentally to their history and culture whereas the CCP wiped much of it off the map.
Excluding plate tectonics, I don't think that Taiwan could drift any further away from mainland China.
Not to throw shade on Taiwan, but may I ask, where else have you been in Asia if you consider Taiwan to be the best?
that's not a solution for Taiwan.
that's a solution for maintaining western chip manufacturing.
china wants Taiwan bc Pooh thinks all of Asia is china.
China does this all the time so it may as well be.
They should instead just do what Denmark and Canada did till this year with their Whiskey War.
This would of course have to be at least a fifty-year plan and Xi is the kind of asshole who may want to rumble before he dies though.
If China could manage to incentivize Taiwan economically further (combined with Hong Kong, they receive \40% of Taiwan's exports currently which is about the same as UK's exports to EU) slowly vassalizing it without using military force could be a peaceful end goal that doesn't involve risking China's stability and global economy.
Of course Taiwanese citizens aren't that easy, thankfully.
