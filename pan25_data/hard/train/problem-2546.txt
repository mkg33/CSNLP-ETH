Edit: that's not even counting the injured or taking into account that he will probably be freed in half the time .
Incredible .
If you think a few years in prison will rehabilitate a member if the Islamic state then you don't have a grip on reality .
We are talking about mass murder here , not stealing smartphones and to compare the two shows absolutely no understanding of the gravity of this horrific incident.
Its also bizarre how you mention that life imprisonment is an especially cruel death sentence considering the incredibly cruel death sentence handed out to 86 innocent victims .
Fucked up are nonsensical calculations that equate prison time to acts committed, and lead to ridiculous prison sentences of hundreds of years in the US, which are essentially just especially cruel death sentences.
It would be the same if one, or if 3000 people got killed.
And nothing about this is fucked up.
This is about the perpetrator, not the victims, and how long they should be imprisoned both as punishment as well as the time needed to have them "better themselves".
And that's largely unrelated to how many you killed, how many smartphones you stole, or how many taxes you dodged.
