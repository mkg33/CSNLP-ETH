If Hungary would prevent passage of Nato troops throughout its land, that would be proof that they are working with Russia and we might just as well declare war on them while we're at it.
Orban is a piece of shit but his opinion on this doesn't really matter.
There are reason Nato needs to keep Turkey happy, but nobody would really bat an eye if Hungary left or got kicked out.
As long as Turkey is withholding its approval, Hungary can do whatever it wants.
The day that Turkey approves, we can put significant pressure on to Hungary and they have little choice but to approve.
With regards to Hungary, there are mechanisms in the EU to at least make it unpleasant for Hungary.
But unfortunately Poland has been protecting Hungary.
Which is quite interesting, how that Hungary more or less supports Putin, while Poland is super anti Putin and supporting Ukraine.
Yeah sure, Orb√°n would give Hungary to Putin in an instant and you would have Russian military bases in central Europe.
Hungary, the NATO country working for Russia.
If NATO needs fast access to help Ukraine, Hungary will be stalling them and putting up resistance, basically helping Russia.
Kick putin!
