You fill out a form and pay a fee, in my state it's $5k for the house.
From there you collect signatures of registered voters in your district; when you have 120% of the amount you need or when the deadline comes and you have at least 100% of what you need you turn them in.
From there, the secretary of state validates the signatures you turned in.
Assuming you submitted enough valid signatures, what happens next depends on what you wrote on the form: independents get placed on the election ballot.
Party-affiliated candidates get placed on the primary election ballot; each voter will only participate in one of the primary elections.
From there it's only about getting enough votes.
I don't know that there's any validation that takes place.
Some states don't require you to live in your district, and others don't require you to live in the state in which you are seeking office.
IIRC you need your name and address, the office you are running for, the filing fee, and you declare a party affiliation.
From there it's up to voters whether you win or lose, or even make the ballot in the first place.
The oversight is supposed to be the voting public.
That's what it means to live in a democracy, you can't keep passing the buck forever, and since we have no king the final responsibility ends up with the voters.
The problem is that a near-majority of the people doing oversight think that George Santos is perfectly fine.
