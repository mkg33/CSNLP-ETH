Put a microphone in John Robert’s face and ask _him_ this question.
Lead it with, “you say that you are concerned about the perceived legitimacy of the a Supreme Court, yet a justice, whose spouse has alleged involvement in some cases, is ruling on those same cases….”.
And that’s the question: “Chief Justice, do you believe the court has a responsibility to recuse others of cases if they do not recuse themselves or do you believe justices should be granted the ability to judge their own behavior?”.
The next line of questioning should be if a Justice unable to recuse themselves and legislation that attempts to force them to step down is passed, what’s to stop the justices from overruling that themselves?
The line of thinking shows that we are in a constitutional crisis and really there’s nothing that if Ginni was say arrested right now that would stop Clarence from voting for her to be freed and this topic might mean that if there’s a constitutional crisis, the judges are above the law.
My answer would be to simply push onto Roberts a compromise where the crisis is averted because the alternative is to just go and arrest the entire SCOTUS seeing that there aren’t legal consequences and looking at it as an act of war against the government cause really…it is.
