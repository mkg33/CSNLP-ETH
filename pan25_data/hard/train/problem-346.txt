Exactly.
This is likely a ploy to keep trans people "out of sight" and to create a legal pretext for police to arrest trans people in the state whenever they wish.
It is very similar to the Russian Gay Propaganda Law in that respect.
I'd say likely the transgender person - as the cynical purpose of this bill is likely to suppress transgender activities.
However, in certain cases (like schools) I would not be surprised if teachers get arrested for exposing children to trans people or to material about trans people.
I take it most of the commenters did not read the article it talks about exposing minors to explicit content not just for exposing someone to trans people.
That is to say, the bill specifically defines "transgender exposure [...] to a minor" as inherently indecent and sexually explicit.
So yes, it does make exposing someone to trans people illegal.
What an incredibly round about way to make Trans people illegal.
I guess because they couldnâ€™t do it directly they must think this angle is pretty clever.
Gonna be a whole bunch of back slapping and atta-boys at the country club circle jerk tonight.
