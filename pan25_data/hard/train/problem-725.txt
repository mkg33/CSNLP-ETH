Honestly should consider lowering in certain circumstances imo.
If a 16 year old is working and paying into Social security, Medicare, etc.
that 16yo should get to vote.
Feel like no taxation w/o representation is a core American value.
Also a same-party decline is to be expected for a sitting presidents first midterm.
When such a large percentage of youth voters are democrats, thatâ€™s going to influence turnout heavily.
Young voters turned out at a rate of 12% but they leaned far more democratic than any previous cohort.
Edit: turns out this number is for turnout as a percentage of the electorate, not as a percentage of their demographic.
Young voters do deserve credit for an ongoing trend of higher turnout overall, which started (albeit a bit higher) in 2018 and seems to be holding roughly steady.
Young voters didn't make up a substantially larger chunk of the electorate than they did in 2010 and 2014, people are basically just praising youth turnout for the youth meeting the absolute bare minimum of raising their turnout roughly as much as the general electorate did.
But young folks still vote way less than older folks.
This is why they will keep being minimized in policy considerations.
Also presumably the Democrats would be less likely to make moves like student loan forgiveness in the future - since it didn't seem to make any difference politically.
