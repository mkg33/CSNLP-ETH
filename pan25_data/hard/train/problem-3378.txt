I mean no offense with this potentially offensive statement, but the United States really shouldn’t be comparing itself to any of those countries and should be taking responsibility for the administration of our territories.
We’re supposed to be operating in a different geopolitical league, we shouldn’t pride ourselves on just barely beating out this list.
Sure, we're economically different than those examples, but there are very strong cultural associations with each in many parts of the US.
Why shouldn't the US be compared with countries that are our geographic neighbors and who immigrate a significant amount of people into the country?
Also, for a country with an insanely high population of over 300,000,000, the US is abnormally well developed compared to the other near-peer nations of similar size.
It's not until you get to Japan at a population around 1/3rd of the US in size where you get a similar HDI.
It's... well yeah it's one of the most dysfunctional in the developed world.
I will say, cautiously reevaluate Canada on the matter as they are starting to stink things up for themselves by now brazenly offering suicide as an option for all sorts of medical conditions.
Part of the problem is that the US artificially inflates the prices of medical care through administrative costs that don't need to be there, but remain because nobody wants to do anything about a bloated bureaucracy.
The problem is when dumb fuck redditors who never been to third world countries loudly proclaim that America is a "third world country with a gucci belt" and then insist that despite its HDI and GDP per capita, it needs to be compared with other developed countries that they insist it is not similar to.
