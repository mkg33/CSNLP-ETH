They didn't just try.
For most Americans, they succeeded.
The vote held regarding an insulin price cap failed, 57-43, not meeting the 60 vote requirement.
It would have capped the cost for everyone.
Instead, all they could manage was a rule surrounding how government spending was managed, because that's what the overall bill (which passed 51-50 as one of the extremely few un-filibusterable votes of the year) could do.
Government spending only.
And Medicare counts.
First, you reference total government spending on healthcare.
So let's be clear about this.
The CBO lists government spending on healthcare in 2019 at $1.2T.
$100B would not be .4 percent.
And it isn't a rounding error either.
This is an important step in the right direction.
It is not the entire solution.
Nothing is these days, not with this GOP.
But over 20 states now have some form of price control implemented, others are considering it, and Medicare is now on-board and with the ability to negotiate in 4 years time.
It won't be perfect.
But that's not an excuse to do nothing like you would end up doing.
For various reasons (corruption), Medicare was prevented from negotiating drug prices, and subsequently Americans paid some of the highest prices in the world.
But starting in 2026, Medicare can once again negotiate drug prices, and you can bet that insulin will be one of the first things on the table.
This legislation does not affect the price of insulin.
It only regulates out-of-pocket costs.
The cost of insulin will be shifted to our monthly premiums.
This legislation does nothing to address the factors that have led to higher insulin prices, and it will do nothing to reduce costs.
Even if the cost does not increase significantly, this legislation does nothing to make insulin cheaper.
It's just covered by an increase in monthly premiums..
