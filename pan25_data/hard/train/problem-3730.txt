perception of providing "boots on the ground" by providing squadrons of NATO pilots and airplanes, I don't see a premise of a quick victory.
The training cycle for a pilot is long and Russia still posesses a lot of air power and SAM defense.
F-16 would be nice but you cant really fly planes over Ukraine, at least not in a conventional way.
Both sides have really strong antiair defenses and the only things that fly are either extremely close to the ground or russian jets shooting beyond visual range missiles(at slow moving, close to the ground ukranian planes/helicopters).
Training Ukrainian pilots and mechanics on planes like the F-16 now means that 2 or 3 years from now Ukraine will be able to scramble and intercept Russian cruise missiles anywhere in the country.
I also expect that we've had Ukrainians training on Western air platforms for at least a good part of the conflict, post-invasion.
To not have done so would have been really fucking stupid.
Especially considering that neighboring Poland has fantastic f16 pilots that are more than qualified to teach Ukrainian pilots.
I think giving Ukraine fighter jets is a great idea, and when we start replacing the F16 in earnest, Ukraine should get as many of them as they are capable of operating.
I just personally worry about rushing planes that pilots are not familiar with onto the battlefield.
The issue, is that even with the best possible implementation there's still a fairly high chance that you'll lose pilots and aircraft in SEAD/DEAD operations or the missiles will just be stopped.
Especially if you're not used to working with all of the necessary components to make a functional AA suppression mission or you just don't have all of those components available.
Both of which are true in the case of Ukraine.
