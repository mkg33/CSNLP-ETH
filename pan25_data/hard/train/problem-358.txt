The way these people see it, they are giving away free money that could be theirs if they donâ€™t claim unemployment.
Although it all sounds crazy, they do have a right to unemployment if they lose their job, since their previous employer would have been paying into unemployment benefits for them while they were employed.
Why are you allowed to collect unemployment if you're making over a million dollars but most people working part time can't collect any assistance to help them get by when struggling to survive on minimum wage?
Did you not read the part where I said that I'm not saying unemployment should only be for the poor?
I'm pointing out the absurdity of ultra wealthy people having golden parachutes when they're not even remotely struggling but then people who aren't even making enough to get by can't get any assistance at all.
Meanwhile the ultra wealthy use their fortunes to lobby for tax cuts which republicans are more than happy to pass while cutting any and all welfare programs that help the poor to find those tax cuts for the wealthy.
Reagan/Republicans basically destroyed welfare and SNAP over the whole "Dat rich might benefit from it".
Food Stamps get put on the target ALL THE FUCKEN time because Republicans can convince people that "Dat rich/lazy abuse it".
Remember that is how Reagan fucked with welfare by saying "Rich welfare queen" are collecting checks while driving cardiac, or how corrupt individuals abuse food stamps.
You are effectively parroting republican talking point now.
