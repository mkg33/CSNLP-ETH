Restore power can be done.
However Russia will just attack again.
Still worth doing, but it is a long slog of repair.
Many of the things being hit are things we don't make a lot of, and so the supply chain cannot keep up.
Protect infrastructure.
This is doable, but it takes time.
You can build a reinforced concrete bunker around equipment, but if it is attacked while the concrete is curing you have to tear it down and start over.
(consult a real civil engine for details - I'm wrong, but close enough for discussion).
Also while building thank bunker the workers as vulnerable to further attacks.
Attacks on Russia just makes Russians mad, it would actually increase Russian troop moral and make them more effective at fighting.
It might make people feel better, but in reality it makes things worse.
(Ukraine is not able to win that war against Russia).
Tit for tat is the only real option, let Ukraine strike into Russia.
Make it very deliberate and proportional and state that it will only hit infrastructure when Ukraines is hit.
