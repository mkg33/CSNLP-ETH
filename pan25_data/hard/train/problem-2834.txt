It does benefit the billionaires who have bought themselves half of our government by convincing half the country that democrats are evil and taxes are theft.
The US will pump every dollar it can from high sales taxes into military contractors and other stupid bullshit only the rich will ever benefit from.
The only people who fully support this idea are the brainwashed Republicans who think this will mean they will get to have more money because their initial paychecks will be bigger.
They think all the stupid libs are poor because they buy iPhones every week or some bullshit, but they will be smart investors and somehow not be bothered when a pack of toilet paper at Sam's Club costs $55.
I think a 30% sales tax -- which would effectively be 40-45% after state and local taxes -- could actually tip the scales and lead to true riots.
We are in a position where about 20% of Americans physically can't handle 30% sales tax (effectively 40+% when you add in state and local taxes too).
They can't pay what they don't have, but they still need essentials.
