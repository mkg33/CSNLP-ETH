Sadly, this type of acting without thinking was the primary cause of death prior to the advent of modern medicine as we know it today.
Now, someone does something dumb and gets a metal rod impaled through them?
Incredible medical techniques exist to save that person.
We are very lucky in that regard.
People used to just die from stupid mistakes.
It seems this was the same thing, except it had the unfortunate side effect of wiping out his gene pool.
Absolutely heartbreaking.
This is so tragic.
It’s one thing to be stupid and have your act of stupidity kill you, but it’s another thing to let your stupidity kill your children.
These kids never had a chance.
They wouldn’t even have the cognitive faculties to know what a radioactive substance is.
Some of the worst contamination events were caused by people that just didn't know they were dealing with radioactive materials.
The biggest example I can think of is the Goiania Incident.
Yeah a ton of clocks are like that.
Also glow-in-the-dark materials on watches and such are often radioactive.
Some countertop materials are radioactive, and smoke detectors use radioactive materials to detect smoke.
Ionization smoke detectors still use radioactive materials, and detect the ionized gases emitted from fires/hot objects.
Ionization smoke-detectors and photoelectric (not "infrared") smoke-detectors each work better with different types of smoke.
Ionization ones are better at detecting really hot fires quickly, while light based smoke detectors are better at detecting smoldering fires that produce a lot of smoke.
