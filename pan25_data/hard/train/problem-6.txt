Radical religious-right activist Mat Staver, who gained national prominence in 2015 when he represented county clerk Kim Davis in her fight to deny same-sex couples marriage licenses in Kentucky, says classmates exposed to the children of same-sex parents may gain positive “personal experience” from the interactions, weakening their commitment to “biblical doctrine.”.
Homophobes love to act like they're terrified of queer people hurting children, but it's clear that they're FAR more afraid of queer people being wonderful friends, neighbors, and teachers to children.
They are afraid of placing kids next to LGBTQIA+ kids because they are afraid their Christian kids will become friends with us "heathens".
Exactly.
They think it's some bizarre contagion.
I can't imagine how backwards their thinking is, and what they tell their kids daily.
So, Christian nationalists are really looking to turn every school into a Christofascist center, and then they are going to ban every non-heteronormative kid from attending that school, as well as any kid who has parents who are non-heteronormative.
Who could have possibly predicted a time when Christian nationalists would want to ban kids with same-sex parents from Christian schools?
Er...wait.
Isn't that like their mission statement?
