Instead of backchecking their stories (I think the press can do that), I'd rather see certain actions to run or hold office such as a certain amount of community service hours, town hall appearances, hours campaigning with other candidates, time living in certain areas within the district and maybe joining the reserve branch of the military once in office.
I'd also love some term limits and perhaps a max age.
It would also be great if they had continuing education requirements since after watching some hearings I'm convinced that some members don't even have a basic grasp on some of what they legislate.
Frankly the most troubling thing is why people who run for office feel the need to lie and some of the stuff they lie about.
I’m finding it hard to live in a society where verifiable liars and cons get elected and no one seems to care.
Hearing that a GOP member lied (among other things) is becoming so commonplace it’s nauseating.
These garbage people need to be held accountable for their actions.
