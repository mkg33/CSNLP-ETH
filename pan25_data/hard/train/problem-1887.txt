I think you have less democracy in the US confused with the world.
The world has progressed forward rather well, while the US is starting to walk backward.
That said, there is an increase in democracies from the 20th to the 21st century.
With over 1/3 of all countries at the start of the 21st century having a democracy.
Most of these formed during the latter half of the 20th century.
However, the number of independent countries has also risen, more than doubling.
So it's arguable if the ratio has changed at all.
Regardless, at the end of the day, more people have access to a democracy than they ever have.
There’s less democracy now than in the 20th century.
Bribery is legal in the US, corporations write the laws, media is in the hands of a very few, and that is being used to impoverish the world.
This inequity doesn’t create strong democracies to resist anything.
Look at how many times the US has sold out the Kurds.
I wouldn’t pin my hopes on the US.
Ukraine is fortunate because the US just ended it’s occupation of Afghanistan and needed to write off all their old gear, so they can continue running their military-industrial complex.
Plus, they were curious to see how their Cold War doctrine fared against the Soviet’s.
(It rocks.
).
I know, right?
But HIMARs isn’t even US doctrine.
It was just gathering dust.
Just expense it to Ukraine’s billion dollar aid package and even order some more.
US arms manufacturers upgrade NATO allies’ armies and they in turn hand their older equipment to Ukraine.
Everyone makes money and no American has to come home with prosthetic limbs.
Except that the media monopolies extend worldwide.
Why do Brazil, Australia and Canada have the same far right talking points?
Why did anti-vax hysteria blowback to Russia?
Why do Americans care about an Australian’s grudge with a Greek?
Transnational oligarchy seeks to weaken all democracies.
