A wide and complicated range of different aspects of society.
The sort of thing that is complicated to deal with, and thus nobody wants to consider, since it's so much easier and more ideologically gratifying to instead go with a simple populist rhetoric of "big tech bad".
But that all sounds like a matter of free speech.
Just because the app algorithm makes you feel bad doesn't mean we scapegoat the app makers as opposed to the folks who are actually saying bad shit online.
Free speech is a thing and I'm confident the SCOTUS will smack down on any populist attempts to regulate big tech.
Uh ok, well as we all know, free speech has limits and every industry has been regulated.
You cant threaten or harass people for example.
Libel laws specifically police speech as another.
It’ll be up to the people to vote whether or not we feel like large corporations are free to target specifically underaged girls to push them to depression and suicide for profit.
Most people will be against it.
No, it’s to not deliberately write algorithms that are designed to make people angry and scared and insecure, and to not specifically target insecurity in underaged women.
