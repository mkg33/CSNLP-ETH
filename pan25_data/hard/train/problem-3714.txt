It's enforced by giving the people and families incentives to report couples having sex or living with one another outside of marriage.
It's gonna turn people and family members against each other.
All it takes is someone to report and enemies will be made.
Instant betrayal by neighbours or family members.
Reporting on your neighbour is how this law will be enforced.
And to top it off they added that you are not allowed to insult the president or vice president.
People in Indonesia may not insult them but the rest of the world will.
It bans cohabitation before marriage.
All someone has to do is report the unmarried couple staying in the same place together.
It could even be in a hotel room.
They don't necessarily have to be having sex.
What I mean, you can't actually know if someone is having sex unless you are sitting there.
Will it just blank assume if they live together they are having sex?
How does roomates work?
Even if you forbid same sex co-habitation, who is it to say that someone isn't having same gender sex?
But saying they will "ban sex outside marriage" is not very accurate.
I'm more concerned about laws regarding criticism of Pancasila.
Because that would apply more to people outside of conservative Muslim areas.
If you are angry at this awful law, wait until you see all the similar laws all over the Muslim world.
But everyone knows that this is just Muslim rules that are only applied in Muslim communities like Aceh.
Just like a load of other Muslim countries.
