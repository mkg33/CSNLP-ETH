And while we’re on the subject of slippery slopes, your argument that they’re acceptable for the left because of how the right acts seems to imply two wrongs make a right.
All the bill says is “if employers cover the costs of transitions, they also have to cover the costs of de-transitions if applicable”.
My daughter got a bill for a doctor and the insurance she was under back then isn’t the same as the insurance she has today.

Since when does the left care about employers’ rights?
If a procedure needs to be reversed (e.g.

Yes, your old insurance has to cover a procedure that was performed while you were covered.
That's just a billing thing.
It does not have to pay for a subsequent procedure performed after you were no longer covered, which is what this bill is about.
Come on, you know that.
