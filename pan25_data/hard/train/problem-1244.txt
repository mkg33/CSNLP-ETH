So they switched from clear cutting to very carefully regulating when and where lumber in Canada is being cut down.
Typically to prevent huge multimillion dollar forest fires.
When trees arenâ€™t managed carefully we end up with huge uncontrollable wildfires spitting co2 and smoke into the atmosphere.
By cutting down trees and then replanting them responsibly we are able to have a renewable resource.
By all means, log and regrow the new stuff all you want, but those old-growth forests won't grow back in the next 300 years if ever if you destroy enough of the ecosystem they are a part of.
Yes Canada has plenty of trees, but old-growth forests are a whole other matter and deserve preserving, and there is very little left of them.
Do you really believe Canada's forests have been logged responsibly even before Canada was a country?
Most of the logging that is being complained about is about the very few old-growth primal forests left in Canada...
If you had a clue, you would know that there's a reason why Canada's logging industry has been in decline since the mid 2000s.
Canada's forest industry is not in decline because the world needs fewer newspapers.
Shame on you for even suggesting it.
