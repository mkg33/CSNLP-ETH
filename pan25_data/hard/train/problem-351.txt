The title uses the word "concerned" where 90% of new articles use things like "blasted," "slammed," "unprecedented," etc.
The fact that it doesn't contain those buzzwords is kinda worrying.
The AP and Reuters probably aren't on the list of "fear mongering".
People are reading these news articles with emotion attached, go into it neutral and you'll find the info is also neutral.
I think we are seeing the result of an age where people didn't grow up learning how news is supposed to function.
For me, I see articles like this and just see how events are slowly playing out.
No imminent threats or anything alarming, just observations on the evolution of the US China relationship which is extremely complex.
It pains me to see people call stuff like this "clickbait" because it just feels like no one knows what the news is supposed to be anymore.
The article is clickbait.
I mean, where are the similar alarmist articles whenever the US holds military drills with South Korea, or Australia, or other NATO nations.
They're the same thing carried out for the same reasons.
