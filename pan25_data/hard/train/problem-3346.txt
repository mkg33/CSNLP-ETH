It was never meant to be justice.
She is a Federalist society bot - their judges and supporting judges are put in place to support the conservative federalist cause i.e.
electing Republicans and policies.
This was a way to NOT demoralize Republican voters directly before the election and/or to prevent more motivation to Democratic voters.
We will never be able to accurately quantify but it may have helped them in some close elections.
She is just one of the terrible people we will have to deal with because of Trump.
She should be impeached.
The House impeached Trump twice but what did it even accomplish?
If the goal of impeachment is removal of a corrupt politician, which Trump 100% was, then it failed because 1) the system makes it incredibly hard to do (though for good reason) and 2) our tribal party system, particularly the GOP, means most votes to impeach and/or remove are strictly about what party you belong to and not whether said person is guilty.
Wouldn’t matter anyway, you still need the Senate to vote to remove and you’re never going to get enough votes in either direction.
Honestly idk why impeachment is even a thing anymore, it’s never going to happen again unless one party has a total stranglehold on the country.
Sadly the bar is so high to impeach a judge it is not likely to happen, especially with a congress that contains so many republican members that are utterly lacking in ethics.
Rather than impeach her for explicit crimes, it might be faster and better to impeach her for incompetence.
