It could be General Dynamics were asked to expand their production capacity.
They did recently win a big contract related to the Abrams to be completed by November next year.
The three months delivery schedule also makes me think that's the case as they should be able to convert 31 tanks by then while still keeping production going for other export contracts.
Or maybe the US just renegotiated with the countries expecting those tanks to delay receiving a part of their tanks.
Like I said, I hope Politico is wrong about the U.S. buying new tanks instead of sending existing stock, taking potentially years; I hope Ukraine gets the tanks sooner but if Politico are right, mere months is grossly underestimating how long it might take.
For Ukraine who knows where the war will be in a years time, they need the tanks now not in 1, 2 or 3+ years.
If they can actually train Ukrainian crews up to snuff, this should be very interesting indeed to see Western tanks in action there.
So much this, before it was pretty much the same tanks against each other where skilled Ukrainian crews hardened in ATO and ZSO took advantage of unskilled russian crews.
Add this to newer hardware, optics and arguably better ammunition to the mix and russians will have little chance.
