In the lawsuit itself, he likely sought well over $3M.
The reason why people ask for a huge amount is that some states will cap how much you can recover at what you ask for, so if he asked for $3M and a jury wanted to award $3.5M he would only get the $3M.
These decisions would also be made almost entirely by the attorney with little to no actual input from the client.
A client can technically tell an attorney they don’t want to do something, but 99.9% of the time, an attorney suggests a plan and the client says “ok if you think that’s best”.
I’m not defending the man, but bringing suit is typically how you get real insurance pay outs.
An insurance company won’t pay $3M until an attorney gets involved.
Additionally, he probably didn’t sue for more after he received the payout because a $3M payout is likely contingent on him waiving any claims against parties covered by the insurance (it’s a settlement).
That dispute is complicated: Records show the insurance company paid Cawthorn $3 million, per the insurance policy; then he unsuccessfully sued them for $30 million, claiming bad faith after a negotiation with Ledford.
A court ruled against Cawthorn and then his appeal was rejected in 2019.
But the Post reports he is continuing to seek money.
Edit: Realized he got $3M from insurance over getting paralyzed (and he sued for more on top).
Given he’s being sued by his Jan 6 legal team for $200k, the Florida move might be to protect his assets from judgements.
Hey now, he got one semester of college under his belt.
Between that, his part time work for a year in Mark Meadows office as an assistant, his zero revenue real estate company, and two years of Rep salary, and zero current income he’s just $800-900k shy of affording such a home.
