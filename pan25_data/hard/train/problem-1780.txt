Trump takes a $20 million loan from North Korea, has a meal with a dude who praised Hitler along with a white supremacist AND wants axe the constitution.
(Everything else aside, I’m going by news cycle).
But all Republicans are concerned about is Hunter Biden’s dick pics.
Does some of the data make Hunter Biden look bad?
Well yea, but that's not even remotely news.
Anyone that follows politics knows Hunter Biden has had substance abuse issues, we know Hunter Biden had sex with his dead brothers wife.
We know Hunter Biden had some nude pics, we know we have pictures of Hunter Biden doing drugs, etc.
None of that is disputed.
Also as someone that is interested in IT/Cybersecurity/Forensic Analysis of data I've read some credible reports on Hunter Bidens laptop and a few questions have to be answered.
There's a lot of forensic analysis that can be done to help determine if thats the case, and that analysis has been done.
Well much of the data on the laptop is absolutely legitimate, a lot of it appears altered in the anaylsis of the data.
Also there is very clear evidence not all the data on the laptop orginated from that laptop and it appear some of it was very much planted.
Also there's reason to suspect some of the data had been altered to make this seem like a better deal.
