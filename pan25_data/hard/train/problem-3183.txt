It's been weapons and supplies the whole time and mind you the equipment is mostly from pre 2000's Era.
All of this equipment would have otherwise rotted in our reserves.
The EU is handling Ukraines financials and the US is handing physical equipment.
There's a good thread below that gives quite a good breakdown of western aid to Ukraine.
Which, again, has nothing to do with aid due Ukraine.
You want to rant about the disfunctionalities in US procurement regulations, spending transparency and resources allocation, you have a whole branch of government dedicated to doing that.
It's Congress and the people you keep voting in there are obstructionst opportunists that make the whole system dysfunctional just so they can sell you the idea that government doesn't work and they're the only ones that protect you from it.
Taking stuff out of a warehouse, billing it for its as new price and sending it to a friendly nation is robbing you blind how exactly?
What economic benedit did you get from Javelins or 155mm shells sitting in a warehouse waiting to be decommissioned?
That's on your poorly regulated financial market, not on aid sent to Ukraine.
The newer equipment would have been made and bought anyway regardless if the old stuff was donated, sold, decommissioned or left to rot in a warehouse.
