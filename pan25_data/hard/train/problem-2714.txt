They are small, great for cleaning thing with there tiny hands.
They are disposable, easily make more of them since it takes far less time to grow.
The ones one that die or get hurt were probably liberals anyway who believed in ridiculous things like workers rights, or not letting mega corporations exploit children to increase the wealth of the shareholders and their ability to buy bigger yachts.
I am not saying boomers are the only ones susceptible to this, I am saying that throughout their lives the elected officials they elected enacted overwhelmingly pro business policies that hurt workers.
It's not opinion its just what happened.
My first thought was this.
If they think undocumented people working for under-the-table pay drive down wages, why don't they make the connection to easy-to-bully / domineer literal children?
I'm not defending child labor, but this idea that anything other than raising wages is an evil attempt to undermine the American worker is so played out at this point.
The place I really hate this argument is the immigration debate.
We need to increase legal immigration into this country dramatically and immediately.
But that's just "importing cheap labor instead of raising wages!"
Enough of this.
There aren't hordes of working age adults who have been out of the labor force for 2 years and are just waiting for a $20/hr minimum wage to get back in.
Sure, increasing wages would have some impact, but it's not a magic bullet and it's time that we quit pretending that it is.
It's 2023 and I'm tired of the "There wouldn't be a labor shortage if companies would pay more" argument.
Millions of people dropped out of the labor market during the pandemic.
A lot of those people fucking died.
An even larger number is Boomers who retired.
They aren't coming out of retirement to wait tables because the pay went up $5/hour.
