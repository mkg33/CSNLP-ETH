Every two years the House dissolves and reforms as a new body (the Senate works differently).
Part of the organization process in the House is the swearing in of all 435 members and the election of a new Speaker.
Speaker candidates are selected by the political parties and the entire House votes, with the candidate obtaining a majority of those present and voting (usually 218) becoming Speaker.
If no one gets a majority, multiple rounds of voting continue until someone obtains a majority.
There was one Speaker elected by a multi-party coalition as Speaker in the mid 1800s, but that was after a 100+ vote deadlock and something had to be done.
Each member votes as an individual, so there is nothing to prevent another coalition of Ds and Rs from forming and voting for whomever they want.
I think so.
The winner has to get 218+, but it doesn't have to be the R party's candidate of choice if the votes are there for a coalition.
Any R who voted with the Ds on a compromise candidate would probably be expelled from the R caucus as a traitor, so there is that cost.
Hmm.. it sounds like if the R vote is split in any appreciable way the democrats could have their choice of which one they want to win by voting as a block for them.
Or just letting it be chaos.
