We need to expand the judiciary 3 fold across the board.
The SCOTUS should have 28 justices, yes twenty eight.
There should be 4 courts of 7 and the makeup of each court should be randomly selected from the pool of 28 at the start of each annual term.
This will help prevent gaming the court because you never know who will be in which court or which of the four courts your case will end up in.
Adding some additional rules like a 75 vote confirmation requirement and rules like "the Garland rule" which is a time limit on the Senate for voting on a nominee.
If the nominee isn't voted on by the full senate within 3 months of being nominated he is automatically approved.
Another necessary rule is the 2 strikes rule.
If two nominees get shot down by the senate, then a randomly selected judge from the next lower court in the same party as the president is automatically promoted.
Edit: But I see the hole here.
Yes, it should be amended to not allowing an automatic approval if the governing party of the Senate is the same as the president.
The only remedy is Impeachment/Removal, which is a political process, and only has a chance of happening if there is strong public support for it.
In todays hyper-politicized world, you need public support to push 67% of Senators to have a chance at Removal following Impeachment.
Im sure a depressing number of House Republicans will get onboard, but I think it's unlikely that enough of them do to actually pass articles of impeachment.
I'm sure Margey Infidelity will clamor for impeachment proceedings but I highly doubt any Republicans will climb on board with her after the Red Sprinkle proved how unpopular they already are.
