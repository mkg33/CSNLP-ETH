I worked for the Department of Corrections (sort of, I worked for a contractor under them).
One day the Community Corrections Supervisor (not technically my boss, but sort of in charge of the place) comes in from one of her many vacations, this time to New Orleans, practically salivating that down there you can pay people only 7.25$ an hour.
I just kind of looked at her with a face and said, yeah and that's terrible, right?
Even though I get paid a bit more than minimum wage (I call it just enough to be able to say we don't pay you minimum wage) that was one of those moments I was glad to be in a state with a somewhat sensible approach to adjusting our minimum wage.
The minimum wage increase this year actually would have increased my pay like 20-30 cents I believe if the place had been able to stay open due to no-one wanting the jobs there.
Most places started having minimum wage at 14-15 bucks an hour in my area, prices then started jumping up to compensate so we get the same amount of stuff (or less) for a higher price to compare to the wages.
On a macro level either businesses will increase their wage, the minimum wage will eventually increase, or people who don't mind living at a deficit will take those jobs.
Thatâ€™s one interesting thing about a reasonably high Federal Min Wage - it might, just maybe, convince people to move to cheaper areas of the country.
When you can make $20/hr working some neat job in small town middle America, and the local housing market averages $150k, it might not feel terrible.
Until everyone else finds out about it and housing prices jump.
I just think we need to tax excess profits.
Companies should be dumping money into wages, not into shareholders pocketed.
