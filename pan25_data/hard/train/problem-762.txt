Hey That's what I say whenever someone over the age of 13 who doesn't have a developmental handicap says they still genuinely believe in fairy tales aka religion.
Are you telling me I can't mock a flat earther's beliefs if they are charitable and volunteer at a homeless shelter?
Those beliefs are ridiculous whether you're a demon or an angel.
Ridiculous beliefs should be ridiculed often and loudly.
Religion is a poison on humanity.
It exalts belief in fantastical, magical shit without evidence, sometimes counter to evidence.
In every other context of life we call that what it is, stupidity.
You call it religion and then we just say it's "faith."
We should have the same respect and deference to religion that we do for flat earth bullshit.
Yeah fine we can't make a law that says you can't believe in flat earth, but we should be mocking you mercilessly for such a stupid fucking belief.
How the fuck can you argue with someone who will take a fact, a verifiable, undeniable FACT, and just say "eh.
I don't believe it."
It's like trying to argue with someone that the sky is blue.
