It's a little off tbh.
Kh-555 can be build from the Kh-55 kit, however no Kh-555 was observed in some time now.
ALCMs that were used in the attacks in the last few weeks are mostly Kh-101s with some old Kh-55s as decoys.
AFO Saturn is working 24/7 now trying to meet demands.
Optimistic values are up to 50 Kh-101s per month, 30 Kalibrs.
So roughly a single barrage per month.
However their efficiency is atrocious.
Even with the escort of anti-radar planes only 9% (UA sources) to 13% (RU sources) of launched missiles are reaching their targets.
Last big air assault was in the last week of November, and all the numbers showed back then pointed towards another 500 and change missiles available.
Enough for 5 x 100 strong attacks.
In the first two months of the war they were firing 100 missiles per week, mostly Onyx, Kalibr and Iskander.
Now they're firing one attack of less than 100 missiles every two weeks, including many 1960s dual use anti ship missiles, training missiles as decoys and even empty missiles from the strategic deterrent stockpile.
If they're all the same to you then we found where the problem is.
They did another attack in the second week of December with over 70 because Ukraine hit their Tu-160 and Tu-95 bases, grounding some of the launch airplanes.
The missiles fired at Ukraine in the last few months were primarily shot by plane, ship (not any more) and s400 (kinda mobile).
So no real launch sites in most cases.
Atleast that's what I've read somewhere, don't take anything I say at face value.
But Munition depots, airfields and any other type of infrastructure would be good targets for longer range himars missiles.
They will likely be attaching them to long range bombers that will carry them to just inside their effective range, lock to targets, launch and leave.
