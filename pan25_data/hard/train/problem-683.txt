Everything about this is so weird.
You think any research team would know they’d be found out eventually and staying silent would just cause them bigger problems.
And it seems like the super-obvious choice is for the US to bring down the balloon and investigate its payload, and I’d be really surprised if we didn’t have this capability.
It does seem a little sketchy but again I don’t think it is anything nefarious and it should be resolved politely and without damage to their balloon (because potential science!
).
Yup.
Now you are getting to the meat and potatoes.
The balloon is not the problem.
China not communicating is the problem.
Keep in mind though it’s kinda stupid easy for anyone to just launch a big ass balloon without proper officials being notified.
Also keep it mind it's a fucking weather balloon that most mentally mature people fully grasp the not-possibility of a balloon starting WW3.
I mean if the USA needed to find out which people launched a weather balloon in the past month would they also be in a similar situation trying to find out who's it is?
I would assume a person would have to file a flight plan.
