The Budapest Memorandum pisses me off.
It isn't explicit but if 'the west' expects countries to disarm nukes based on protection deals then any and all agression should trigger significant aid.
What nuclear weapons have shown to accomplish is that they act as a deterrence to war in general.
Countries which possess nuclear weapons tend not to be attacked in part out of the fear that those nuclear weapons will be used.
That has even been a reason for the measured response from NATO about sending aid to Ukraine.
So the only way to protect Ukraine would have been to literally fight the war for them with boots on the ground, US soldiers killing Russian soldiers.
No one in Europe would have supported us and it would instantly begin WW3.
Ukraine didn't have an army prior to 2014 and even after the "Civil War" the large majority of fighting was done by ultra-nationalist Ukrainians who basically funded themselves, which is where you got all these stories of Ukraine being a "Hot-bed for nazis" because the people most likely to be willing to fight are going to be, militaristic right-wing ultra-nationalist.
It sounds nice in theory, but you have to understand, there was no way to defend Ukraine's territory.
To maintain the support of the Russian people, they had to claim this as a defensive war.
Because of that, all of their declarations have to have the voice of a defensive nation, leading to their statements sounding like theyâ€™re coming from an out of order notecard stack.
