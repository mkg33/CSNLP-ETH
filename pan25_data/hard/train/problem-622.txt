I say this all the time.
Democrats aren't amazing, but Republicans are fucking horrible monsters -- not evil, but they could not care less who gets hurt by their policies to help the rich.
What a surprise, the GOP protecting the capital interests instead of the average people… I hate them.
Is there a pro-forgiveness movement?
I’ve noticed the current administration nor the media is being vocal about the need for the forgiveness, maybe they want to use the block as political leverage?
The smart ones likely understand just how popular this forgiveness is with most of America and don't want to risk alienating any constituents that might be for this.
Sort of a choosing your battles.
The difference I bet is the the House of Representatives term lenh is 2 years.
They essentially have to run for re-election every other year.
On the flip side Senate term is 6 years so many of the Senate Republicans are insulated from the immediate impact of rejecting this.
I could also just keep extending the moratorium on student loan payments.
If no-one is required to make payments it isn't far off from forgiveness.
Again campaign could run on if GOP wins then they are going to force repayment and that would be a largely motivating factor for voters 35 and under.
