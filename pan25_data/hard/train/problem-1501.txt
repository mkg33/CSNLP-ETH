Not really what they were saying.
It was more like, "Here's the reasons most voters preferred us over the Republicans bent on digging past rock-bottom".
"Did people vote for us because we are awesome or because Republicans are bent on enlarging the basement they have dug beneath the hole they've scraped in the bottom of the barrel?
Likely the former.
".
Yeah.
Gee.
Who was a part of the Obama administration who we know contributed to bag fumbling?
Oh yeah!
Joe Biden, who once stopped Democrats from strong arming Republicans because of one phone call from Moscow Mitch.
I'm not satisfied with decent, especially when he sold himself on bigger things.
Things he had originally mocked before adopting as his own policies.
I don't just dismiss what the people I vote for promise once they're in office.
That's how we get Sinemas.
Politicians should held accountable for their words and actions.
Our current circumstances have been entirely expected for atleast four years if not more.
The idea that Republicans obstructing rn and the policies they're obstructing are unexpected is absurd.
And thatâ€™s with having the slimmest majority in the Senate possible during a time where Republicans want to block most legislation.
Definitely credit is due to Biden.
