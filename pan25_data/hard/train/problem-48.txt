Never fall for the vulgar trap of believing conservative talking heads/politicians/functionaries desire free speech in any useful sense of the phrase.
They desire the power that free speech traditionally granted - that is, the ability for truth to win when "grappling with falsehood," to invoke John Milton's Areopagitica.
And for good measure, the would-be standard setters in the conservative blowhard-sphere are like the "oligarchy of twenty ingrossers," bringing a "famine upon our minds again, when we shall know nothing but what is measure'd to us by their bushel.
".
Right.
the President of the United States has every right to retweet every unverified article about unmarked vans dropping off ballots in swing states he sees, from websites that didn't exist the day before, without hesitation or a critical thought.
Nothing bad can come of that.
Because all you really need to counter bad faith actors on a gish-gallop of lies is a little bit of healthy dialogue.
It's not like the people who thought pizzagate was a thing can't be f-ing reasoned with at all.
If the left wants to have a reasoned debate, instead of shouting "misinformation!"
and silencing him like communists, they could simply reply to every one of Trump's hundreds of retweets of fake news each day with an attempt to prove a negative.
Is that so hard?
And trust me, the people who need to see it will see it.
