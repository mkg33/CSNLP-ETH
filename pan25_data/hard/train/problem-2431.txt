If not for companies like TikTok or Facebook you probably wouldn't even have any idea just how much of your data is being sold - actually, you probably still don't!
Blatant problems like this are much better when they're in the open because they can fester where people can see them, which has the potential to lead to much greater change than when they're left to fester in the background.
When we take non-measures like this politicians can later point to them and say "look we did something", and the average person who doesn't have the willpower or energy to actually research a complicated topic like this in any detail will sit back comfortably thinking the problem was resolved.
Here's the thing...
Unless you stop them from using their phones entirely, you're not really doing much.
You're leaking so much data all over the place that China hardly needs TikTok to spy on you.
Who are you that you think China cares about your data for anything other than selling you bullshit?
Like what nefarious things do you think they're actually going to do with your data?
