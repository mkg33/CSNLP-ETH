Pentagon was totally wrong on what was needed in Ukraine and land war in Europe and has run out of the weapons needed while we have spent trillions on floating cruise ships.
Not by any real numbers starting with US with 18 aircraft carriers vs. 4 for Russian and China combined, an offensive weapon at that.
And $5B dollar bombers and $10B aircraft carriers are not doing but $200k anti tank missiles and $500k drones are.
By my count the US has less than 150 major overseas bases capable of real offensive operations, and while that's still too many, it's not 500.
Just like World War One when the major militaries were trying to use planes to spot troop buildups and material before major offensives.
Everyone knows there isn’t a clear advantage in a war of attrition, it doesn’t matter how good your technology is in modern warfare, the German’s learned the hard way going into Russia that technological advantages don’t make up for the willingness to fight and die, as the US learned in Afghanistan and Vietnam.
We never won those wars because the people weren’t ever going to support us.
We far outpaced them in technology and material, but not people.
