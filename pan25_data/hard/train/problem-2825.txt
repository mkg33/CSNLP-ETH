More like a parent leaving a baby in a room of pit bulls and then when people want to say the parent shouldn't have done that they go "Uh, are you forgetting who actually ate the baby?
".
This is not true.
Most people want the economy to be unaffected, to have their companies get their inventories and have jobs as well and their stuff on the shelves for Christmas.
Like it or not the republicans could have been Santa's elves this year, but instead the chose to play Scrooge (as usual).
The narrative would be Biden did nothing to help and if he does something republicans do everything they can to screw it up so they can still blame Biden.
However, it is both okay and necessary to blame Biden and the democrats for doing bad things when they choose to use their control of the government to do bad things.
The fact that republicans joined them in doing the bad thing doesn't somehow absolve them.
Forcing a strike to end against the wishes of the workers and to accept a contract they find unacceptable is an unjustifiable abuse of state power and a betrayal of democrat's supposed values.
Either way the government stepping in to force a striking union to work is not great, but to do it in a way that so clearly and easily favors the business side is really disheartening from the party we have no choice but to put our faith in.
It's a demonstration that there is no substantial pro labor party in the government and highlights how much more we need to do if we want our rights to be taken as seriously as Capitals.
