Republicans are still supporting him, Trump’s backed candidates still won the Republican primaries in the midterms, they just lost in the general elections.
Point being he still has immense support in his party.
Most Republicans don’t care about January 6th.
My point is that if Democrats don’t turn out to vote, then Trump will likely be re-elected.
People are acting very prematurely if they think Trump is anywhere close to being out.
Maybe, I’ve seen a massive narrative on how Trump has lot control of the party.
I also think you overestimate peoples willingness to turn out for Biden, but I hope you’re right.
I think people are grossly underestimating Trump’s chances of winning in 2024.
He still received 70M votes in 2020, and if he wins the nomination, his voters will turn out again.
Biden is far from a guarantee to be re-elected.
All the Republicans I know still support Trump, granted that’s anecdotal.
Once the primary starts and Trump is clearly in first place, he’ll get his media time again.
Remember an election where are the polls said Trump would lose and the Dems had lower turnout than expected and Trump won?
Maybe we shouldn’t assume people will come out to vote and treat the election as though it’s very much up for grabs.
Plus voter apathy, he was a wake up call to young voters why it matters and since he won the voter turn out has been gangbusters in the last three elections.
Dems are motivated to come out and vote against him because of what happened in 2016.
That won’t happen again.
No one is treating it like it’s a sure dem win after 2016.
It really is.
There’s a formula and every single speech and tweet follows it.
Anyone can follow the formula and you can’t tell if it’s something he actually said or not.
Everything he says sounds exactly the same.
