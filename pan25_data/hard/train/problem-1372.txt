They’ve explicitly said they’re living off their own means so the British tabloids and public don’t feel like they have paid for unfettered access.
Your uninformed contempt for two strangers could be studied by sociologists.
They’re just people.
Of course, they are just people, but what kind of people are they?
Are you denying that Harry publicly tried to shame his father, for not continuing to financially support him, even knowing he had personal millions in the bank?
They always could’ve lived financially independently, their problem is they want to live at a higher level than they did as working Royals.
Their only source of income, however, is there a former association with the Royal family.
Harry is a total hypocrite.
Here is the best example, him complaining his father is not still supporting him after quitting his job and his father knows he has $20 million in the bank and Meghan had millions in the bank too.
Harry is completely jealous of his brother, it’s pathetic.
"Harry then accused his brother of acting like an heir, unable to understand why his younger brother was not content to be a spare.
".
Oh ya.
My sister knew I would over react.
She would smack me and run to her room.
I’d sl on her door.
She would cry and I’d get whooped.
Kids are pricks lol.
