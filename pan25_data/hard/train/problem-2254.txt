Likely what will happen is a new district will replace Reedy Creek.
Disney gets its self-governing back.
The bonds go to that new district, so the state doesn't have to pay it.
Taxes will be renegotiated.
And Disney cools off their culture war against the state.
(Iger already said he is wanting to cool it a bit.
).
As for the "Don't Say Gay bill."
That's not changing.
And Disney doesn't have the financial standing right now to continue fighting the state from an activist angle.
Disney won't change their company culture of inclusion and tolerance as far as their company is concerned.
But I don't think you will see Iger continue to fight a cultural war against a governor that just won re-election by 20 points.
Disney needs Florida.
They can't pick up and move the Magic Kingdom.
Florida is not California, and looks like it never will be.
So the company will need to find a happy balance to get along with Florida politicians and keep everyone happy.
That's just the reality of the situation.
That's true.
However the law is cleverly written to include heterosexuality as well.
The law bans any talk of sexuality (gay or straight) or gender identity in grades K-3.
You can't permit straight people to talk about their families and forbid gay people.
It wont be long before this is challenged and he loses.
Just like many of his other silly ideas, like the election police.
