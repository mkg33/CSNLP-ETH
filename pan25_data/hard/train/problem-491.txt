Everywhere had superstitious and totally useless (and often actively harmful) doctors until very recently, with the advent of scientific medicine.
Traditional Chinese medicine is just as useless as the four humours or the miasma theory of disease.
That's not only true for Chinese traditional medicine - you see similar issues all around the world.
People are good to see patterns, and tend to see patterns where none exist.
Scientific standards are required to overcome that, and traditional communities did not have access to those.
I wouldn't be surprising at all if some doctors in ancient China got executed for reasons like that.
I'm not playing with semantics.
"traditional Chinese medicine" is used to refer to a certain set of approaches, and many of those are not working.
If they were working, there was no need to refer to them in a specific way as they would have been included into modern medicine.
Traditional medicine has been used and is still being used across the world in regions where modern medicine is not as accessible.
To say it’s completely quack is just discounting billions of people as fools.
What makes you think traditional medicine do not work at all?
Also they've stoked the traditional medicine fire too much to now go back and say that they actually need real medicine.
Seems like some folks are very honed in on the fact it’s called “Traditional Chinese” Medicine instead of it being simply named medicine.
Word games?
Kinda pointless to discuss about it in this case.
