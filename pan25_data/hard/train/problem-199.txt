I'm not ideologically opposed to genetic splicing.
Yet with the current implementation and legal framework, patentable GMOs are basically setting up major staple crops for a similar collapse.
Whether the patents are BS or not, the law is the law, and knowingly & massively violating seed restrictions over tens or hundreds of thousands of hectacres of farmland is going to get you in trouble.
Just like if a company reproduces a patented drug, they're going to be sued.
Farmland is a very important resource for the security of food and even a country's GDP, among other salient concerns for proper use of farmland.
I would argue these concerns aggregated can give rise to good arguments for well-regulated oligopolies that stand above concerns that oligopolies bring in general.
I would agree monopolies and oligopolies are generally a bad thing because, among other reasons, they discourage competition, which has all kinds of negative externalities.
Monopolies and Oligopolies have more chance to sweep mismanagement and negative externalies under the rug, and even to just ignore safety concerns totally in less developed countries...
