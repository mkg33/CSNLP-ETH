So while it's not a strictly population-dependent process, it's also not a process that's spelled out.
Other than that it's up to Congress.
Currently, DC has a population that has no real representation, and it is larger than Wyoming, which has 2 Senators and even a Congresscritter and is heavily weighted against... well everyone else.
A person's vote from Wyoming is worth something like 22 Californians.
And you know the saying used to be, "No taxation without Representation."
So I guess we could just exempt DC from National Income Tax.
Also the reason it's not in another state is laid out in the original reasons it was incorporated as a city without a state.

What you said doesn't make any sense given the context....like seriously what do you mean about evidence?
None of them claims here are stuff to do with evidence maybe the culture one but it's mostly just opinions that can't be proven with facts which are part of a argument......
Give me a example of a state being made a state because of the population if you can't give that why are you acting like it's a argument?
It is larger in population than 2 states, and people are the only thing that should matter when it comes to representation.
The amount of land they own is irrelevant.
