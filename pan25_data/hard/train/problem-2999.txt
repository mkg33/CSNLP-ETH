They stoke fear about exaggerated dangers, get elected, stop stoking, and the public is left with the feeling that Repubs have "done something".
I'll try to answer my own question here: the fears that the GOP stoke allows people to demonize "those people", which is somehow acceptable, especially if it's not overtly phrased as racist (and even sometime when it is).
But those that the Dems stoke require targeting of groups that we're told are off limits.
Climate change and income inequality require us to target the rich and "that's not good for the economy", while reproductive rights require targeting christofascists and that's "religious discrimination".
Now, if you just want to talk about gun crimes, then the US is definitely an outlier.
But that "one political party that wants to get tough on crime" adamantly opposes doing anything about the single thing that sets us apart from other countries: our overabundance of and easy access to guns.
America is a shithole when comparing crime rates to Nordic countries, but as soon as political party runs on a hard anti-crime campaign then they're exaggerated fears.
