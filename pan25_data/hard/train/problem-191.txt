The DR is not exactly a top-tier country themselves and has plenty of their own issues to contend with without inviting in a whole lot more by taking over Haiti.
Perhaps more importantly is that these two countries have different cultural backgrounds and do not even speak the same language.
Haitians would probably always see the DR government as foreign invaders.
Thing is, there's been constant foreign intervention in Haiti for decades.
Military police from other countries.
And the situation hasn't improved.
The activists got a point.
I know a few of the soldiers that went there and it is a very complex situation.
Not blaming it on the soldiers (for once), it's just Haiti has been the absolute worst for 15 years or so, and there doesn't seem to be a simple way forward.
Haiti has sadly seem to have gone from one bad time to another bad time throughout its entire history...
A lot of good comments here, Haiti was dealt a bad hand but they weren’t perfect and as for the Dominican Republic….
Your forget if the part Haiti invaded and occupied the country for 20-30 years with an additional 10 years of incursions.
During this time they tried to wipe out/suppress the Dominican culture including the use of Spanish language, forcibly took land, took their wealth with large taxes and allowed their troops to pillage the country side.
