Oh we are in Texas and I think the house they got was something like $400K?
But yeah I doubt they can come up with $1mil from friends and family but then I may be presuming much regarding their relatives lol.
Liability part is overstated.
It's a house.
Even if it loses some value it's not going to drop so much the owner can't sell and pay back the loans.
You are correct that they may not has much legal recourse in such a loan, hence you would never do it for a stranger, but assuming the borrower is borrowing in good faith this is a very safe investment.
In terms of what they can earn through other forms of investment, of course that is indeed what they're missing out.
But many people are perfectly content with safe investment with low rate of return.
Presumably the fact that they had that much money on hand means they don't invest all that they earn.
I do agree though that having relatives that can trust each other with money like this is really advantageous.
Those friends and family are gifting the difference in what they could be earning in other forms of investment.
