Agreed.
The Dems in Congress should sponsor a bill to allow people to chose where their tax dollars go.
The people in the blue states can then stop propping up the red states.
Not from SC but always be skeptical of "people from blue states turn states blue by moving there".
In Florida it's probably the opposite, blue state migrants turned it redder.
Even the bluest of states still have plenty of Republicans and it's not hard to imagine that a Republican New Yorker would be more likely to go to Florida or SC than a Democratic New Yorker.
It's a very mixed bag - depending on the state: some states are magnets for right wing blue staters, while other states are more of an "it's a red state, but people don't really move there for conservatism".
On top of that Blue voters are moving all over the country to find a stable life and ending up in red states further diluting Republican vote share.
Red voters moved to Texas and Florida by the millions over the last several years.
They were drawn in by Abbott and Desantis vying for Top Fascist.
It could end up that Tx and Fl stay red and middle states start going purple or even blue.
Weird times.
