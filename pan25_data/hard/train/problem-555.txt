I have two friends from El Salvador that don't know each other and both of them love this president and what he's been doing.
One of them just bought a house there and plans to spend winters there and he said he never thought it would be as good as it is.
I get the overreach and it's implications but I think the people that actually live there and have been terrorized by gangs for the better part of 30 years appreciate it more than some of us do in our cushy lives.
Some may say that a some of them were captured as children by the gangs/didn't know any better and that's probably true, sure if they have had a better life they would have chosen something different, but it is what it is.
If you were in America and joined the KKK or some organization that killed people in broad daylight, you would be guilty as well, just for participating or being a tool to them, or promoting hate.
The people that join these gangs in El Salvador know what they get themsleves into, they know that they will kill people, they aren't innocent by any means.
The fact that these very draconian measures are still very popular with Salvadorians points to what an insane crime problem they must have.
No, I have no idea about the crime situation in El Salvador.
No doubt it’s bad when draconian laws are overwhelmingly popular among voters, but Latin America also has an unfortunate history of dictatorships that abuse the power they get by cracking down on crime.
Let’s hope they have the wisdom to bring back proper due process once things calm down so they don’t turn into another Latin American dictatorship.
