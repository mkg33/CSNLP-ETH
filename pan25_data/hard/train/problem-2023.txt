Yeah, the democrats have never been great and mobilizing their voter base and the republicans are actually pretty good at it.
Meanwhile, republicans might actually cater to their voter base… a lot of the times by screwing them over, but they are good at convincing them that they want whatever they are doing.
I guess that's one way to count, but if you just look at how many votes Republican candidates got versus Democrats, The current seat count is quite proportionate to the popular vote, in fact.
While you’re at it, maybe think about actually weighting the number of seats in Congress for each state by population?
Not just have 2 Senators for both California AND Wyoming.
The amount of disproportionate power this gives to low-populous (usually RED) states is beyond ridiculous.
A Republican voter in Wyoming has like 3 or 4 times the power as one in California.
End result: Republicans hold \67% of the state's US House seats when the state constitution calls for them to hold only \54%.
Thats a swing of 4 seats right there (R loses 2, D gains 2).
All this is to say, she could have better served the Dem party into the future had she stepped aside, as many Dems called for her to do, in 2020.
Instead, she chose to serve herself.
