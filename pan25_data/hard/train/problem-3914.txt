I hope he runs as an independent and takes away 30% of the GOP vote.
The he starts his own party, captures the far right, and forces the GOP to the middle to remain relevant.
Eventually, the GOP kicks out McConnell et al, and rebrands into a different party.
They run on Fiscal conservatism combined with social equity.
They push for legalization on marijuana and flip to pro-choice.
It becomes The birth of a multi-party system in the USA, thereby eliminating the Dem /GOP oligopoly.
I think the historic repudiation of the republican party's anti-woke, culture war BS in the midterms was step number one.
The GOP will either get with the times as shown to them by the voting public in the buttkicking they just received in the midterms or they will die and a new party takes their place.
What I do not know is if current Republicans switch parties to be part of this new party, does that mean Dems take over both houses as majority?
Republicans are very good at setting aside their differences to vote no on anything Democrats want.
Democrats are very good at turning on each other if they don't get 100% of what they want.
The political reality of the country is that compromise is the only way to advance anything.
That sucks when compromise means minority groups are in a perpetual state of maybe next time.
