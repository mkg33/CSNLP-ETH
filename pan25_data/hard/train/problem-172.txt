America must be the most frusturating opponent known to man.
Fighting arsenal America is like the old video games that never ended, each level just got harder and faster, until you eventually exhaust and get wrecked.
Added bonus: entire arsenals of weapons that were designed to fight Russia were just going to be retired without being used.
This is the absolute best scenario now, for them to be used in the defense of an innocent country that wrestles the bear.
I think so but the ringleader is still free after a 1000 crimes and is running again, and still even has the moron millions' support.
It is wild how America went from the Red Scare, where you could be blacklisted for life for only listening to a communist speak, to the Red Embrace, this sick team up of those who willing to sacrifice anything to be allowed to embrace hate, rascism and dominance through violence.
It was mentioned by some legendary Redditor once: that if the US invades your country, not only will that country get flattened (military-wise), in 20 years Americans will make movies about how sad it made them feel to have to do it.
