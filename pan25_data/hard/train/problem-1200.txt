Oh gosh if only someone in pakistan had thought of this possibility before protecting the taliban and then releasing them back into afghanistan.
The ISI since 2021 supported the taliban's re-occupation of afghanistan, and stopped the GHQ's attempts at a ground invasion against the TTP.
In Nov 2021 the GHQ overthrew the ISI, and in April 2022 overthrew the isi's allies in the civilian government in a soft-coup, and now the GHQ has a free hand in doing what it wants, which is tackling the TTP in afghanistan's provinces adjacent to pakistan.
the link you quoted shows since 1960-2006 pakistan's Gross Domestic Product Per Capita was higher than India, regardless of coups, civilian governments, and dictatorships.
Every Military dictatorship in Pakistan has been extremely beneficial for its economy.
You are right that shifting to a civilian government is a problem, because civilian governments always mismanage the economy due to factionalism and sometimes nationalization in the case of Bhutto.
Only 2006+India's GDP recently started outpacing Pakistan.
2006 was the time the TTP was born, the War on Terror was in full swing.
