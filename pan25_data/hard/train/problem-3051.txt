I wish there was more of an outrage about this.
This fucker broke the law and what does the "law and order" party do?
They change the law to suit his needs.
This is banana republic level of shameless corruption.
Because it’s corruption.
Blatant corruption that’s impressively worse than anything Rick Scott pulled, and that dude tried to mandate drug testing for welfare recipients coincidentally utilizing his wife’s lab company to do said drug testing.
Dawg, these “contracts” are all being awarded without bids to his political donors.
Every Republican I know down here is quiet as fuck about the migrant shipping bullshit because of how bad it looks; ain’t no one can actually justify the fact that Ronny D paid a political contributor 20k a head to fly legal asylum seekers from Texas to Boston.
Why doesn't Ron DeSantis, Greg Abbott, Ted Cruz & other border state officials put those resources to good use to naturalized those immigrants seeking asylum, rather than pull a cheap political stunt?
We are all immigrants, unless someone is native American.
If one were to look too hard through their genealogy, they may find that some of their own ancestors may not have arrived here quite legally.
