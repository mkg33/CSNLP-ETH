The extremists ran as two parties together ( ) under one ticket in order to pass the threshold (pooling votes).
The two equivalent (. )
left-wing parties (small, further left) did not join together, and one of them did not pass the threshold so their votes basically went to waste.
However, as the parliament works on a threshold system, the seats are not divided directly by votes but rather the votes of parties that passed the threshold.
But yes, unfortunately there is a minority thatâ€™s okay with it.
10.8% is upsettingly high for the ultranationalist parties and too many people subscribe to the cult of Bibi.
(The ultra orthodox are basically living in their own bubble world and almost exclusively vote for their own parties, so the 14% was expected as it approximates their demographic (approx 13% of the population).
).
Wow.
Even Israel.
Congrats on joining the list of nations which have elected far-right populists who will dismantle democracy Keeping you company is Italy, Poland, Brazil, Hungary, and many more.
