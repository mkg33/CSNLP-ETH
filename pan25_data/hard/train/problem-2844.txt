India likely figured that they could get a very good deal on all the R&D Russia has done for this stillbirth of a tank and developed their own model much cheaper and faster than they otherwise would have been able to.
With a little luck they can even export the result to countries that would no longer want to buy Russian now.
I see no problem with Russia selling itself to India.
Let India extract the value and grow, while Russia collapses.
At this point I think Russia is kind of desperate to avoid India moving away from them.
And India knows they can get better deals now than they ever could before the war started.
Since the war kicked off, India has made a lot of noise about how they aren't going to side against Russia because Russia treats them better than the "western" world historically had.
And they need stuff like fertilizer too much to risk losing it.
Since then, the US and others have been making them many offers.
Deals on supplies, better/more military gear, etc.
Almost like they're trying to rebuild the relationship.
And in the meantime, India has cancelled deals to buy stuff from Russia, because Russia can't deliver anymore.
They're also desperate to keep India from divesting from Russian made weapons.
India has increasingly been trying to diversify its weapons procurement through domestic production and contracts with western countries.
They may figure that licensing out their designs may be the only option to keep the Indian market now.
After all, Russia's tank losses in the Russo-Ukrainian war have been so horrific that they're likely not gonna have anything to spare for export for at least a few years.
That's assuming the war ended tomorrow, which it definitely won't.
