That whole "Crimea fiasco" in 2014 is exactly why, almost right afterwards, the Ukrainians started working to build up a modern NCO corps with US help to start to model their military after the west.
Those NCOs are one of the reason why Ukraine's military has done so well, they are one of the unsung heroes behind the scenes that make a military a well oiled machine.
Now that is very true, they don’t care as it is their doctrine/military mentality they are proud that they threw men at machine guns in WW2 as it was patriotic it’s the same in Ukraine.
Forcing the enemy to spread out air defenses is def a tactic but I think this stems from the fact that they’ve made it clear that they want to exterminate the Ukrainian identity from the land if they won’t comply.
It’s terroristic and genocidal because Putin’s facade will come crashing down along with the image that he can defend Russia if they don’t take Ukraine.
I do think there’s geopolitical reason as to why you’d not want Russia completely neutered.
I’m not well versed enough on Macron to judge just how fascist he is haha.
Macron is a nationalist.
There was a story where, during a parade Macron was participating in, he snatched a minors phone and broke it because said minor wasn't respecting him.
