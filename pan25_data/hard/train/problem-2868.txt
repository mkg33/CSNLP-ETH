Thanking everyone but the medical professionals who don’t get holidays off and literally save lives and see the people other quarantine from but thanking everyone else is an interesting take.
Is what ensures Canada remains peaceful.
You think it’s Canada’s mighty military that allows them to not ever have to worry about Russia or any other country?
I think he's implying that why would Canada (or any other NATO country) even bother meeting their defense spending obligations when the U.S. would happily step in to pick up the slack.
Unless I am mistaken, Canada spends more on defence than Poland and Greece combined, but because Canada is so rich it is lower as a % of GDP.
I don't know if Canada is spending more on defence than Poland anymore.
The figures I was looking at were for 2020, which showed Poland spent about $13 billion on defence, but looking at more news they've increased that amount and said this year that they will essentially be doubling their defence budget to nearly 5% of GDP.
Canada spends about $25 billion on defence and Poland's looking to spend $30 billion moving forward.
The problem is somehow all that money doesn't go all that far for Canada.
Turkey has a massive military, and does so on a smaller budget than Canada.
Canada spends more and gets little to show for it.
Even at $25 billion a year in spending, that's still in the upper half of NATO countries (by just total $ spent) and more than what Spain spends on defence ($15B) or Greece (>$10B) and they have each much larger militaries than Canada's.
I have no idea where all that money the Feds have been spending goes, but it doesn't seem to go very far.
I don't think that's an issue with just the current government either, the previous one wasn't any better, nor were the ones before that going back to the start of post-Cold War cuts under Mulroney.
