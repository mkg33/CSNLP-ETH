That’s entirely fair, I was worried because I’m Jewish and using “they” is a dogwhistle for Jews, I’m glad you didn’t mean what I thought you meant and I’m sorry if I caused any offence by thinking you meant to be antisemitic.
I guess my antisemitism sensor got a bit too trigger-happy.
I totally understand that!
I’m practicing and visibly Jewish (large beard, yarmulke, Star of David necklace, the whole shebang) and I’ve received more than my fair share of hate even when I was an atheist.
I’m seriously considering Israel, and though I know it can be a touchy topic, it’s the only guaranteed place for our safety and that’s something I value highly.
I think the issue with Israel is that 1: you're only safe if you're conservative and Jewish, and 2: They have the same issues the US do with fledgling fascism and conservatives maintaining minority rule.
that will, inevitably, lead to worse and worse quality of life for everyone just like it has here.
I'm Jewish too!
I don't blame you for having a hair trigger I am very concerned with how anti-semitism is all the rage in this country lately, and when we have children, even though we aren't practicing or anything, I find it hard to imagine raising them in America.
Tel Aviv is a pretty nice city though!
I guess you just have to decide if those factors are worth it.
I've been eyeing Canada because it's close and easier to live there, but money is harder to make there so I'm not really sure.
