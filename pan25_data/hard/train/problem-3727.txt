this doesn't surprise me at all because the Iranian government is a vile, Evil institution and I hope the Iranian people can convince the majority of the Iranian Army to overthrow it.
What I personally am gonna do is treat everyone who supports Iran or has ideals even close to what Iran has as a piece of shit, which will hopefully disuade anyone around me from acting like that.
Then, if I can persuade everyone else to do the same thing, then hopefully the whole world will be disuaded from being that kind of asshole.
Sure, there'll be other kinds of assholes, and we'll deal with them when we get there, but for now, we start with shithead Iranian tyrants.
As a one whoâ€™s been in Iranian regime prisons, I must say they have one of the most brutal systems in the world.
Torture is very common and systematic.
The most common torture is cable.
They keep hitting your foot soles in a way that after a while it swelling and blistering.
Then they ask you to run on your bare feet so swelling would go down and they could hit you again.
After that torture you can not either walk or put your shoes on for a while.
I have seen cases that tortured person had to go through skin transplant because there was no skin left on his foot sole.
Dying under the torture is common in Iranian prisons.
They torture you to break you.
Sometimes they keep beating up the prisoner and keep torturing him/her until the prisoner is dead.
There are other tortures such as a torture they call ghapaani.
They attach your hands from front and behind with a handcuff and then they hang you from the ceiling.
