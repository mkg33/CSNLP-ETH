Let's see, Trump's Attorney General and FBI dug as hard as they could for two years, and found zero.
Just a reminder, Trump's FBI had possession of the laptop in question for at least a year before Trump left office; I am guessing if they had found anything remotely incriminating at all, Trump would have been on some Rupert Murdoch media outlet practically Pencing himself as he relayed the details.
Some large percentage of the country is somewhat displeased about the Republican overreach on abortion, and a larger percentage is concerned about issues such as inflation, jobs, and healthcare.
One party seems serious about governing, and another one seems to want to sooth Trump's narcissistic injury from having been impeached twice by impeaching Biden three times, or more.
But I'm sure that if even Republicans haven't been able to prove anything despite their willingness to bend and break reality, a congressional committee will for sure impeach Hunter!

Unlike, say, the whole Benghazi bullshit saga of investigations that was totally a political attack on Hillary Clinton, very much admitted on live TV by Kevin McCarthy?
