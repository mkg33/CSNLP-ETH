They could have but it’s easier and cheaper to deal with one plane full of angry passengers than to deal with all the problems that come from having an aircraft in the wrong place.
Granted, the airline is only liable for the price of the ticket, so disrupting a shitload of other flights doesn’t compare to the cost of just flying back and refunding people’s tickets.
Returning probably affected the airline less than diverting, but it almost certain harmed the passengers on this flight more.
(ANZ will say, probably correctly, that diverting would have forced them to cancel the return flight, harming all of the JFK-Auckland passengers.
But I'd argue that canceling a flight in advance hurts a passenger less than making them sit on a flight to nowhere for 16 hours.
).
The question is whether ANZ properly balanced the interests of downline passengers, who would have had their JFK-AKL flight canceled, and the difficulty of finding connecting flights for the diverted passengers, against the harm incurred by passengers who have to sit on a plane for 16 hours only to wind up where they started.
I think that operations folks sometimes disregard the impact on passengers of being forced to return or divert to an unnecessarily far destination that is more convenient for the carrier.
That sort of "soft" factor is harder to calculate than operational disruptions.
