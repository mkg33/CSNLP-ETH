In my opinion all that is a long way to say “fuck you I (one day will) got mine” but I do find it particularly interesting that younger generations who have access to information and socialization in a way I never dreamed of when I was a child made it to their mid 20s and are somehow still like that.
You described my small sample group pretty accurately tbh.
A dozen or so insecure young men and two hyper religious women who believe their ultimate duty is to breed.
I’m a millennial and I am blown away at how wise and empathetic the majority of gen z is turning out, so I do hope you are right.
There are people like that in every generation, and probably always will be.
But considering Gen Z is almost overwhelmingly Left-leaning, I don’t see their shitty messaging reaching too many people.
In the cold light of day, Republicans simply offer nothing that Gen Z or Millennials want or need, hence why Cons want to restrict voting so badly.
The generational fight is already lost, and it gets more apparent every election cycle.
I have trouble seeing how the GOP recovers from this at all without ditching the far right which is going take them at least two presidential cycles by which point gen z and millennials will make up the majority of the electorate.
There are plenty of 'em and it's naive to assume that the Republicans constituent base will be reduced simply due to the younger age of the electorate.
I used to think younger people wouldn't fall for the Republican platform once they got old enough to vote... until I encountered or heard of enough of them who blame LIBRULS for everything, or are brainwashed Christians and single issue (abortion!)
voters.
