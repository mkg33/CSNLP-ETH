It will be a waste of time and money, but it still pales in comparison to the money Biden has wasted on Ukraine.
Can anyone explain why we need to be involved?
This is like Vietnam all over again.
We need to take care of Americans before we meddle in foreign policy that’s isn’t our interests.
I do care about Russia and Ukraine but those here at home come first.
It’s still not worth the cost, we have people homeless and hungry here at home, yet we spend trillions on foreign hegemony, and in the case of Ukraine, on a country 99 out of 100 people can’t find on a map.
It would cost 100x more to allow Russia to do as it wishes, when they own all the oil fields in Ukraine as well as natural gas...there will be more homeless who can't pay heating bills.
Besides Russia is committing atrocious war crimes, raping and killing women children and much more.
Just for that reason alone it's worth it.
But you do not know, Americans are spoiled as shit, for us a bad day is getting a speeding ticket.
Try to imagine a bad day over there.
Open up thy mind.
I agree with you 100% we need checks and balances but I would let the next 6 years slide all Democrat, in the House, Congress and Prez, until the Republicans gain the ability to provide an adequate check and are more balanced.
At least I would know that my rights will be protected and my vote!
