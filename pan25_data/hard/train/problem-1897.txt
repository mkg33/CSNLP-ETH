TBH it is weird the cartoonists went for "terrorists".
If they'd had the Qatar team being chased by men with whips it'd be more direct and harder to criticise as simple racism.
Yeah you can criticize the fuck out of Qatar and the WC without being straight up racist.
This cartoon is literally just straight up racist, though.
Well yeah that’s racist as shit.
Shame on that French outlet for taking the absolute lowest hanging fruit possible when there’s actual human rights abuses and other violations they could’ve called Qatar out on.
The cartoon is about Qatar trying to buy a "cool kid " softpower/public image while being a theocratic dictatorship with a long list of human rights abuses and links to terrorism.
You just all applied your braindead premade "american political debate reading grid" consisting of "if it's criticising POCs, that's racism, and if you try to explain that the criticism is valid and argumentated that's also racism".
It sucks so many redditors apparently believe that it's OK to be racist if your target is a shitty person or group of people, as if being non-racist comes with prerequisites.
How about actually explain why you think this is a good, nonracist attempt at satire without flip flopping what its intended meaning is?
