I am not sure if you keep up with current events, but currently the "country" in question which is Russia is actively waging war on it's neighbour Ukraine with the full support of the Belarusian regime.
Easy answer here, all 30 countries that issued the statement now issue another one saying that we will not send athletes to the Olympics as a result of this.
IOC quotation from posted article: "But the Olympic Games can set an example for a world where everyone respects the same rules and one another.
".
Sadly, though, Russian doping scandals indicate that the country doesn't (respect the rules and Games participants).
If they didn't ban Russia post all their blatant doping and cheating, I would not expect the IOC to let something as small as starting the biggest war in Europe since WWII to stop them from competing.
Not only is Russia a belligerent country, they have a long long history of cheating and doping and almost certainly still are doping.
If they let Russians in, nobody should ever take them seriously again.
