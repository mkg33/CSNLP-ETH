Live In the Midwest too.
There’s amazing polish and German places.
Pretty good Italian places(mom and pop Italian places that make different homemade pasta noodles each morning), great Mexican food, a great Salvadoran restaurant.
There’s also really good Vietnamese and African restaurants.
Plus others in forgetting.
That’s all within a 20 minute drive.
I just learn to roll with it.
Talk to any person that’s well travelled and also loves good food and they’ll agree the US easily deserves a top 10 spot.
It’s the people that go to red lobster for a fancy Friday dinner that think US food is shit.
Not sure how to explain it other than I just didn’t have good food?
I spent about a month in each country so I had a fairly good idea of the food.
90% of my meals were at food carts or little local restaurants with those tiny plastic chairs.
So the type of restaurants I went to were all the same across Asia.
But I'm even more surprised to see Chinese at 11th, as there are Chinese restaurants everywhere.
Another surprise is Brazilian cuisine in 12th.
(Maybe because Brazilian steak / barbecue houses got popular in the US over the past decade; sadly, that's typical only of the southern tip of Brazil, and it leaves out the fantastic dishes of states more to the North like Minas Gerais and Bahia.
).
It really is.
I'm not even American and it gets on my nerves.
EVERYTHING American is the worst, all american food is the worst, all American people are the worst, all American politicians are the worst, all American foreign policy is the worst, all American laws are the worst, all American police are the worst, all American products are the worst, all American education is the worst, all American media is the worst.
And if anything else in the world is worse than anything in America it's Americas fault.
