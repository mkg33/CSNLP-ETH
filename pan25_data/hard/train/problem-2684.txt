Would it?
I mean, assuming you limited the damage to killing Putin and his staff somehow, I'd think those would be legit military targets?
Or did you mean the collateral damage (journalists that would be caught in the blast, etc.
)?
"Zelensky then stopped by the Kremlin and signed the guest book before drawing a penis on Russian President Vladimir Putin's face in permanent marker while the latter was sleeping.
".
Then again, that's just what I think.
And I also thought that Russia would never have the guts to attack Ukraine, I also thought that once they did attack, the war would be over in 1 or 2 weeks in Russia's favor.
I also thought that, even though they are holding back the Russians surprisingly well, there is no shot they are getting Crimea back through this conflict.
While the last one hasn't happened yet, I'm no longer convinced it's an impossibility.
It is definitely possible he could be amazing, but I personally don't see it.
I think history suggests that the experience of wartime leadership don't translate that well into peacetime leadership skills.
Zelensky was kinda looking like a bit of a weak/dud president before the war.
The circumstances of his election would always make him notable in Ukrainian history, but not globally.
He was elected as a protest vote but failed to make large inroads against the issues he was elected to protest against, in fact he may have taken part in some of them himself, though mostly it has been due to fighting the established system and its issues, an uphill battle.
Either way his popularity dropped quite heavily.
His strongest pre-war actions seems to have been in relation to gearing up for the possibility of war, while trying to prevent it starting a war, a hard line to follow.
