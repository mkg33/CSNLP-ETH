The bottom line for me is Biden brought one more American home.
I completely understand why the right is attacking him, but that doesn't justify it.
I fully believe and support Whelan being released but wasn't he Punitively discharged from the Marines?
I mean if we're going to throw mud on Griner, Whelan should be looked at in equal measure.
I think Whelan should be home, but if consistency is a thing I would say that he deserves exactly what the hardliners say Griner deserves.
Also, Griner never intentionally defrauded US service members while Whelan did.
He isn't a Marine.
He is a dishonorably discharged former Marine.
Well, the Marines certainly didn't think he deserved to continue serving as a Marine.
While he may technically still be considered one by many or even most Marines, he's definitely not in the same category as a serving Marine or former Marine.
I’ll be sure to tell that to an acquaintance of mine, a former Force Recon Sniper and Clinton through Obama Secret-Service retired Marine, who refers to himself as a former marine…and once took me to task early on for saying “ex marine.”.
