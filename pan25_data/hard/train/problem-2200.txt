A very quickly aging population with a upsidedown pyramid of young people due to their decades long 'one child policy'.
Their vaccine isnt as strong as a lot of the ones from the west and because they were forcing mass populations to shut down the passed three years when they spotted a single case they never had chance of gaining a herd immunity.
Basically - most other countries locked down, until vaccines became available as it was necessary to do so.
Then they slowly started to reopen, bit by bit.
This meant their populations were highly vaccinated, and herd immunity in the public was strong from infections.
What China did was lock down, but due to their closed government - refused to use any western developed vaccines which were seemingly much more effective than the indigenous Chinese vaccines.
A lot of the elderly are superstitious and believe in traditional Chinese medicine and are not vaccinated even with China's inferior SinoVac.
This should certainly help out with China's huge demographic imbalance of old people.\.
