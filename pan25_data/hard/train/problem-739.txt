How is it possible to believe that she sent those emotional, overwrought texts to Mark Meadows, but didn't discuss anything with her own husband?
It's just not plausible.
That's what would happen.
The right-wing on the SCOTUS have no interest in lessening their power and there is no mechanism that would keep Thomas off the bench.
Imagine if they tried this and it went all the way to the SCOTUS, Thomas didn't recuse himself, and successfully got the court to drop the subpoena.
In the extremely likely event C. Thomas was involved and there is clear evidence, he should be impeached and criminally tried as well.
Why do people have to listen to the Supreme Court?
It holds power through perceptions of legitimacy, being impartial and fair-minded in interpreting the law.
It is clearly a political institution and always has been.
The Court is now just a parliamentary body far more powerful than Congress.
If it functions as a parliamentary body, why regard as a judicial system; why not end the bullshit?
The current Supreme Court cannot be taken seriously.
It’s members stopped vote counting in Bush v. Gore and one member’s wife sought to play a role in denying the election results.
Thomas refused to recuse him from cases in which his own wife was involved.
His wife, Ginni, should be put on trial.
She should get a fair trial, but if the courts insist on using their position as a will to power then she should get the same shitshow kangaroo trial Ed Snowden would get if he came back.
Whereas Snowden (or Assange) would be tried in a three letter agency district in Northern Virginia with the ruling predetermined, G. Thomas should be tried in a district with little to no MAGA support, a hostile rubber stamp district with little support leading to a supermax.
