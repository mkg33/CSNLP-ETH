If you only look at the first Congo war.
If you look at the second Congo war that started near immediately after and spilled into the early 2000s, there are levels of excess death approaching the holocaust.
Yet neither this nor the Tigray war happening now get much international attention.
I understand that the Russians waging war in Europe has more far-reaching consequences for the world than what's happening in Tigray.
And even while it is making some headlines, the media aren't covering this like they should be, and our lack of general awareness about this much less our collective response is frightening and sick.
World leaders need to do more but alas their agendas are severely misplaced...
Also I'm willing to bet a humanitarian disaster like this didn't happen on its own without foreign hands having played their part at some point or currently interfering.
True.
This won't make the headlines because somehow, for some sick and twisted reasons our society thinks African lives don't matter as much as Europeans.
While I don't disagree with you, many of the problems that Africa experiences to this day are indeed because of colonial heritage.
Those straight borders you see in the map weren't drawn by africans, and they weren't made thinking on ethnicities relationships.
We westerners can't reflect on local ethnic tensions as much as we can reflect on how our nations actions in the past helped enable, or encourage them.
That's all.
Just wanted to put this comment as a disclaimer that if you happen to read a comment of mine or something like it in the future that criticizes colonialism, that's my approach to it, not to take away from these countries or these peoples agencies.
