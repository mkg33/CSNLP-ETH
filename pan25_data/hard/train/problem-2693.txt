Remember when they also had no plans to replace the Affordable Care Act with anything, even though their slogan was literally "repeal and replace"?
..Yeah...
I mean.. maybe?
Theyâ€™d be speaker at that point and could run whatever conservative agenda they want to, a very far cry from having Jefferies as speaker.
Once speaker they could deal with GOP leadership however they want, etc.
Like I said there will be a Republican speaker of the house no matter what so we should attempt to seize the possibility of helping someone we can work with.
We wouldn't be helping out the Republicans we will be helping ourselves we can't stop a republican becoming Speaker of the House eventually there will be one so we have the opportunity to make deals to get somebody more moderate that we can work with.
Like I said we wouldn't be doing something to help them out we will be helping ourselves out we can't stop a republican from becoming Speaker of the House so eventually there will be one.
We have the power right now to try to make a deal with a moderate Republican somebody that we can work with.
My thought being any kind of working with the Democrats in any way like this would be running too far afield from the GOP.
But what conservative agenda would they be able to run after they decided to collaborate with Democrats?
Maybe I'm being too pessimistic but at that point I'd expect the Republicans to just outright revolt against them until they were gone.
Whoever that republican was would be completely excommunicated from the party, and thats putting it lightly.
They'd never be able to raise a GOP dollar again.
It would be a Republican who would be willing to take such a risk, that at that point, you might as well just ask them to vote for Jefferies.
