Belarus, on the other hand, is a dictatorship imposed by Moscow against the will of the people (since Lukashenko is very unpopular in Ukraine).
This non-elected dictator imposed by Russia is choosing to bring his country into war on Russia's side.
Ukraine, obviously, has a right to defend itself, including targeting Belarusian troops and bases used to attack Ukraine; but it would not be wise nor fair to wage war against Belarus as a country, rather than the Lukashenko regime specifically.
This isn't even a new concept - when Napoleon took power in France for the second time, countries in Europe declared war on Napoleon, not on France, as a way to show that they didn't want to attack France, just remove Napoleon from power.
Not only that - the military doesn't have any special sympathy for Lukashenko.
He's a dictator installed by Russia, not by the Belarusian military.
The Belarusian military simply doesn't feel like fighting him either - but that could change really fast if Lukashenko decides to send them to die in Ukraine.
I mean the second Russia completely loses their footing in Ukraine Lukashenko is gone anyway.
The only thing keeping him in office is the presence of Russian troops.
