As far as the US is concerned this war advances US national interests, is great business for US defense firms, and time is on their side while Russia bleeds.
This narrative that the US is going to get tired of supporting Ukraine doesn't even make sense, unless the GOP gets really excited for more self-sabotage on an international stage.
Don't know about the Republicans party platform now but many right wing parties in Europe have been receiving lots of suport just for blaming about everything on the Ukraine war and its suport.
So as long as the war and the suport go on the right wingers will keep on abusing that situation to their advantage.
Looking at Europe, now that Corona is getting less relevant, blaming everything on the Ukraine war has been about the only party platform of some right wing parties.
And worst thing is, that in some cases they were quite successful with it.
So yeah, I do see the situation in Ukraine very much influencing the political scene.
Right now, “negotiation” would be “how much of Ukraine does Russia keep.” As a predetermined outcome, UKR doesn’t think much of it.
So, as you say yourself: no point negotiating.
Russia is unfazed by sanctions, and is prepared for even further economic contractions by mobilizing its workforce.
The sanctions _do_ deprive Russia of the ability to produce more weapons of war, but that effect is not yet realized, and won’t be until existing stocks are depleted.
