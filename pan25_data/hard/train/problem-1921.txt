Its a strange one where people wanted them to do more and specifically more socialist things yet will punish them by voting more right wing.
Unlike the states Ardern is PM of a single house system and has an unusual overwhelming majority.
Theres no Senate, no house of lords.
They could pass whatever legislation they wanted.
They started a massive housing program and built about 8 houses, a lot of stuff people vote labour for need policies that take a decade or more to have real impact.. sigh...
They can't buck the market and the solution to the main problem - housing - is to start a massive programme of public housing.
That costs money and incurs a lot of debt, and its front loaded like any investment.
That's my point.
Massive means several hundred thousand and that means starting capital of about NZ$10bn just for the land plus at least that again to build the units.
That's 20% of the entire NZ Government budget.
Markets dont like that and the NZ Dollar would face pressure probably beyond that which it can handle.
