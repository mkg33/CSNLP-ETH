Israel is small enough that it can't really afford to have a reputation for bluffing otherwise it would get challenged fairly regularly.
A country like Russia doesn't have this problem - it's large enough that even its reputation for constantly bullshitting doesn't stop there from being general unwillingness to risk confrontation with it.
Israel in particular faces various countries without nuclear capabilities, but they don't even affirm that their nuclear arsenal is real because they don't want an open arms race.
Israel has a serious problem , russia is supposedly giving Iran advanced intel and weapons so they can increase there firepower against Israel attacks.
Russia was the only thing that posed a threat to their air operations in Syria, Russia allowed Israel to strike Hezbollah shipments and certain SAA positions.
They're stopping weapon shipments to Hezbollah, a terrorist organization with a larger missile arsenal than every NATO country except the US, that is funded by Iran and whose leader's stated goal is to kill all Jews.
Now is the time and i cannot believe i am saying this, israel must do a few hundred precision strikes to destroy irans manufacturing and transport hub, hit every plane they could use for transport of weapons and hit every ammo dump they can find, then advise Iran if they stop sending weapons and ammunition they will stop bombing indefientely.
