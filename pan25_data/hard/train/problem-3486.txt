Maybe they do it on purpose?
Rich people can buy up crashed stocks, on otherwise strong companies, and when the economy turns around again, they are richer.
Forth, most investment done by the wealthy today has nothing to do with business investments.
People buy stock, which is bought from another person and not done to invest in a business.
Businesses are funded through loans from banks and funding from investment funds.
Gone are the days when a wealthy tycoon would open up a factory in a town to expand their business; we aren't in the 1860s anymore.
First off, employees aren't paid out from the managers pocket, they're paid by the business' revenue.
Cutting taxes for the wealthy may make them invest more, but they're not consuming the kinds of things most businesses produce so that won't go down to employees pockets.
Cuts donâ€™t just make it cheaper to take money out of the company, it makes it cheaper to hold onto income for future investments if nothing immediate is available.
It also increases foreign investment, which increases productivity.
This is a very simplistic view.
Cuts change the incentives for certain hiring credits like the WOTC, which impacts hiring decisions.
Cuts also raise the rate of return on new investments and raise the cash flow on those investments.
They can also boost long term growth through improving productive capacity.
