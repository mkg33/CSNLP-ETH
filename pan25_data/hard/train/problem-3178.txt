Suicides are not talked about near enough when the topic of gun control is brought up.
The conversation usually revolves around mass shootings or homicides.
But suicides are directly impacted by access to guns.
But handwaving a very concerning and tragic statistic such as a rise in teen suicides with some 'personal liberty' argument is a pretty bad take imo.
As we are collectively driving our young to suicide in disturbing numbers, maybe that should be a cause for reflection, maybe a sign that some things have gone fundamentally wrong and should be examined.
