A year ago, from my US view, I assumed Zelensky would run, maybe try to lead in exile, as most people would with assassins hunting them and facing down what seemed to be the leftover of a military superpower that, at its height, intimidated even the US.
Honestly, I’d have not even called him a coward for it, not in the same way as Afghanistan’s leadership fleeing with fistfuls of dollars.
There’s precedent in WW2 with the Polish government in exile, for instance.
And I was wrong about how much fight Russia had left in it, drained away by parasitic corruption over the years.
The Soviet Union was no stranger to corruption (nor was the US to be fair, though in the US it takes different forms), but the Russian Federation is akin to a deer utterly covered in ticks and dropping dead before your eyes.
If it didn’t have nukes and biological WMDs (of which we have to assume at least some still work, because if we assume they don’t and they do, it would be catastrophic), I’d even wonder if Ukraine could take the fight to Russia eventually as they bled themselves out on an unyielding defense.
However, you can deliver all the weapons you like, ultimately Ukrainians are doing the fighting and dying for both of us.
NATO is giving assistance to Ukraine, as civilized neighbors should help out in time of need, but Ukrainians are doing all the fighting.
Countries that happen to be signatory to the NATO defensive treaty are sending aid to Ukrainians - and so are countries that are not part of NATO.
