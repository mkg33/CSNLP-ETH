also, the cost of trams ends up way higher and takes longer to develop, and only goes where the tracks are.
buses are so much more versatile, can deploy faster, are scalable, and generally cheaper.
it often isnt even close.
it is the opposite in most scenarios.
the people who gs really fall into the NIMBY category poften like the idea of trams or light rails because it seems nice.
it's higher end public transit!
if you want to create a city where it doesn't exist, yeah i guess a light rail could help, but i don't see that as goal in any of the situations discussed here.
they were existing cities trying to deal with public transit with the area.
dc had (still has) its streetcar saga.
anyone paying attention knew it was going to be awful and wanted more busses instead.
the streetcar is still shit because the bougie middle and upper middle class that likes the idea of light rail still doesn't like to use it, they just don't want more buses.
Yeah that won't happen, they just got tired of trying to keep people from not paying and pissing all over the trains now that's it's free out of sight out of mind.
Unfortunate.
