I’d actually hold my horses on a statement like that.
Digging in for winter is probably not what Ukraine is doing.
The current temperatures keep the soil fluid, which is not good for any major offensive, however, with all the troops freed up from Kherson and frost coming that makes the soil firm and allows mechanized manoeuvres, I’d reckon Ukraine will want to hold the initiative and momentum they have right now to push the invaders further.
It’s entirely possible you’re correct and they’ll try to keep pushing, especially since they’re being fueled with western support but it’s also possible they won’t be able to push through Russian tank trenches and other defensive infrastructure.
Like I said, we don’t really know.
My hope is actually the Russian morale will collapse this winter and their soldiers will just decide to stop fighting, but I think that’s a little too hopeful.
He definitely knows more than I do and he MAY be right, I just don’t like openly saying things like “Ukraine will win by next year.” It gets people hopes up that the meaningless war will end and it just makes things worse when things keep going.
