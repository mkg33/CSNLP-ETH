A real answer (one of many): People in general, view the homeless with contempt.
Homeless folks are the easiest target in society, and everyone needs a place to deal with their frustrations.
Most get their vent fix by blaming the homeless for their own problems, and projecting their fears onto the homeless.
"To be fair" with the way the economy is going a lot more folks are winding up homeless through no fault of their own.
I've been homeless, so I've got biases informed by experience.
As a result I tend to recoil a bit when people are so quick to excuse away homelessness as the result of mental illness and substance abuse.
As if that makes the plight of homelessness as "justified".
The only thing i was justifying is the fear of the homeless.
Because having a homeless person scream at you while your walking home at night aint the most fun experience to have.
In most cities in the US, the homeless are bulldozed out of the way because people can't bear the signs of others struggling.
Given these circumstances it's not all that shocking that these young girls are quick to dehumanize a homeless person.
Just about the only person more vulnerable than they are.
