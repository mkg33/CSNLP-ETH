It's exactly how it works.
There are very few mines operating that are not operated by one of the major mining companies out there.
It's a rare occurrence, and extremely rare that they become successful or viable long term.
In fact, here in Ontario there isn't a single mine that hasn't been by a large mining company.
The exception on that list was Harte Gold which went bankrupt.
Canada has actually been denying and revoking permissions to sell these assets to China.
So the problem is already being dealt with, this just predates that policy.
It’s not a debate, you’ve made a factually incorrect statement and can’t provide any evidence to counteract my claims.
Nickel North is an irrelevant explorer penny stock hardly worth the paper its traded on.
Again, it's not a mine like I said in my last comment.
You're more than welcome to prove me wrong that there's a significant presence of Chinese owned mines in Canada.
That’s actually how the mining industry works, it’s sorta similar to pharmaceuticals.
Small juniors do the risky business of exploration and development of a mine and once a good deposit is discovered they get bought out by a major.
It’s actually exactly what happened at the James Bay Project.
There aren’t really many mines in Canada owned by any Chinese entities, I think the one you’re referencing might be one of the only ones.
It isn’t about having mines owned and operated by foreign companies.
If this was operated by a US or European company few would care.
China is becoming the enemy of the west.
The issue isn’t that Canada sends resources abroad.
The issue is who Canada sends them to.
If Canada was sending them to the US or Europe or Australia then no one would care.
Should Canada and western country keep doing that?
Absolutely not, and especially not in today geopolitical context, but it's not an issue unique to Canada, or lithium production.
I mean, the answer is the same as always, and not as nefarious as you imply.
It's simply cheaper to do that way.
