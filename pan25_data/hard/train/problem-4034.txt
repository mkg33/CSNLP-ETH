and IF each county shakes out how it’s currently trending, then Frisch could net another 2200 votes over Boebert which would put him up by 1800 at the end of the counting process.
Based on my math, she leads by 433 votes right now but if the remaining Pueblo county votes adhere to the 8% favor that Frisch has there so far, that’s a difference of 600 votes, which would put him ahead by 167 votes after they’re counted.
Still a couple thousand to count, but probably as many votes left in the rural counties combined (most reporting at 95%) as there are in slightly Democratic Pueblo.
Going to be razor thin.
And this district has a history of running repeat candidates.
If she wins, Dems will run Frisch again on the message "now that we know we can beat her, let's beat her" and it might just pull some more people out of the woodwork — especially in a general election where democrats could get a boost.
I'm decently confident that Frisch should win this, based off of what I'm hearing about how many mail in ballots have left to be counted and how they're most likely going to be mostly democratic.
