This isn't as much as converting people to Islam as it is an attempt to position themselves as religious and ethical leaders of the Islamic world/MENA rn.
Currently, that position is held by Saudi Arabia, aided by the fact that Saudi Arabia controls 2 of the 3 holiest sites in Islam, Medina and Mecca, and also a huge economy.
Saudi Arabia has previously picked fights with Iran over this (alongside the Sunni/Shia divide and then the pro-US/anti-US sentiments) and there's a lot of friction between the UAE and Saudi Arabia even though they are aligned technically.
Qatar and Saudi Arabia have a really bad relationship, really coming to a boil in 2017 and the Qatar Diplomatic Crisis.
This is Qatar trying to basically put on a performance for the rest of the Islamic World that they are more pious and more fit to lead the Islamic world than Saudi Arabia, which is why they don't care if they piss off westerners as long as their fellow Islamic countries look favorly upon them.
Qatar: come to Qatar There’s no smoking allowed, no drinking no sex no kosher food or praying the housing is shit and we have this guy doing Islamic conversions.
Come on it’s gunna be great.
