oh dont worry they will be quick to explain exactly how its different because they aren't entitled.
they just deserve it.
they just do.
Yes.
There's nothing particularly special about where, only the conditions set up the economies and influencing factors like legislation, resources, and built infrastructure to support commercial projects.
Supply and demand of many markets and the resources available to hire people at competitive rates.
Companies in the region are doing very well.
They need good hires to keep those results going so they have to pay competitive wages.
That raises the cost of people, the quantity of people in the region goes up, and the cost of housing & material goods goes up.
It's also partly a function of the disparity in housing costs itself.
I've had a bit of experience with this due to moving every 3 years with the military, so I've been criss-crossing the country.
Just as an example, when we sold our house in California to move to the Southeast, we pocketed enough cash to pay off the rest of a car, take a vacation, drop a big down payment on our next house...and still upgrade to a larger house, larger lot, and smaller mortgage payment.
That tracks; where I grew up everyone was poor, and while I was still living there and also poor, housing was weirdly not ever too much of a concern.
That's because you could rent half a house for $600/month, and it would be like 2000 sq ft and 4 bedrooms so you could even split it with other people if you wanted.
