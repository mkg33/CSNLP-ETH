I mean they kind of do.
Aircraft are severely limited in capability right now due to the strenh of air defenses.
A small number of aircraft are just going to be shot down.
Neither side has pilots capable of SEAD operations and no one is going to spend years training the Ukrainians how to do it.
Unfortunately the US doesn't really have any airframes that would be suitable for the rough conditions Ukraine has to operate in right now.
Ukraine needs jets that can operate on very rough ground, can be maintained without massive facilities, and are built with the expectation that they will have to operate low and relatively slow.
It's a good aircraft in those roles as far as multirole aircraft go... but there are more suitable aircraft available in greater numbers for the exact capabilities that Ukraine wants.
Bit more rugged, bit more payload, bit harder hitting as a result.
Basically - who cares if the airframes won't last into 2024 because combat related metal fatigue means they won't anyway.
If they're good enough now, then good enough is good enough.
Getting them now is more important than getting the best of the best.
