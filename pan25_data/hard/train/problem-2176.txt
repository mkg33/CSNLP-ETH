Stone is a jackass.
With that said, your “do you like beer” question could absolutely be used by the government to help in your prosecution under the right fact pattern.
Thus, the fifth could legitimately be invoked on that question.
If I were there I would have just asked, "Does the witness understand what right the Fifth Amendment provides?"
and just repeated the question over and over.
Either that or they should have just stopped the interview and held him in contempt of Congress.
He should be in jail.
The question "Would you be willing to answer a question that would have no chance of self-incrimination?"
in and of itself is in no way incriminating.
Pleading the fifth to that implies answering a question like, "Do you like beer?"
would prove you had committed a crime.
It's nonsensical and illegitimate.
The Fifth Amendment does not give you the right to refuse to answer all questions.
It gives you the right to refuse to answer a question where if a truthful answer were given it would implicate yourself to a crime.
