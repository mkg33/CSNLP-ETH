I sincerely hope that journalists keep track of what happens to these traitors- if they’re not all fired than residents of the jurisdictions in which they serve should sue for their departments for misconduct and negligence in having known criminals policing the community.
I will look and see if any were from my area.
If anyone knows that one of the treasonous “law enforcement” officers is from their area, it may also make sense to send a heads-up to your local legal aid society, public defenders’ office, and defense bar- they often keep databases of crooked cops in order to flag potential impeachment or other credibility issues for use on the stand.
As we’ve all seen, the police often can’t be trusted to police themselves, let alone anyone else.
If a cop knows about this stuff and doesn't do anything they're a bad guy and they're not on the up and up...
So really the % on the up and up is likely below 5%.
Clearly the idea we'd abolish all police is sensationalism not rooted in achievable reasonable goals and that ain't me.
Its just when people suggest we should flat out get rid of the police all together I have issues, cause whilst I don't buy into any of that thin blue line nonsense, having law enforcement is a necessary evil and I strongly believe all the alternatives to having a police force are actually worse.
Heck I'm all for even cutting back on the number of police officers in America in some places, as I feel some areas are blatantly overpoliced whilst others barely get any attention.
