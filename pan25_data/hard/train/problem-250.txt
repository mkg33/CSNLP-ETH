The problem is that the general population have not had wages keep track with inflation so the tax revenue is not there to pay trabsport/medical/fire etc.
workers in line with inflation too.
Meaning that to give them what they're asking for, the government has to cut public spending elsewhere.
Its a shit show for everyone.
I'm not suggesting that the middle and working classes should be paying more to allow the government to afford to pay public sector workers.
Im saying that the way large companies have handled woker salaries over the past few decades has left the government with less effective tax revenue year-on-year.
Which in turn makes it more difficult for the government to pay the public sector workers what they need to survive without cutting elsewhere.
Assuming no tax rates change, then if wages go up 10% accross the board and inflation is 20% over that same time frame, the governments effective budget has gone down.
Prediction: they'll wheel out the two-pronged approach where they cut taxes on the rich to stimulate the economy while slashing government spending on everything that regular people use.
This time it's bound to be a success because they've tried it so many times before they definitely know what to watch out for.
