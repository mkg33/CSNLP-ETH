If the state's explanation is correct and all they are good for is mass shootings, then why do police families get to keep them?
Moving forward, law enforcement officers will be able to purchase as many additional firearms and standard magazines as they desire, in addition to keeping an unlimited number of ARs and standard magazines in their homes for their own personal use.
But this regulation is only on assault weapons, not general firearms or (as preferred by me) high capacity magazines.
I just don't think we should be immediately banning when we can better regulate.
What they ban is assault rifles, which has been come to mean anything with a pistol grip and/or adjustable stock.
You do know that you could buy featureless AR-15 rifles during that ban, right?
You can still buy them today in Connecticut, California, New York, and every other state that has an AWB.
The receiver isn't banned, nor is the gas block or anything else other than the pistol grip, adjustable stock, and a couple other accessories.
