Bear hunting in Canada is a money maker.
Whether or not the culling is necessary, they will make excuses to do so.
They had to outlaw grizzly bear hunting because their population got to dangerously low numbers due to poor oversight.
You did see that these bears were being killed to protect the local environmental balance because of overpopulation right?
But because they don't want to have to kill a bear and waste it they harvest and use and sell as much of it as possible.
Also bears are only killed in very controlled numbers in very specific places.
So as to honor the bear and not be wasteful the fur for the hats is from these bears.
That way they know they aren't supporting a questionable activity or someone just looking for profit.
The amount they can get every year varies greatly because it isn't a factor in the full numbers at all.
If they don't get enough they just don't have it until the next year.
If I remember correctly the meat and as many parts as possible are also used and what can't be used for our purposes is used in it's own way to feed wildlife.
