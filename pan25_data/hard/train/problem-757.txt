The Russian kleptocrats probably pocketed the budget intended for additives, and someone in the army warehouses stole what additives they had and sold them on the black market.
Could be Iranian drones were just intended to operate in warmer climates (like other parts of the Middle East), and hadn't really been tested in the kind of environment the Russians are trying to use them in.
If you are Russia, you can see your running short of Missiles(of any type) so you can use drones which don’t fly well in the cold northern latitudes, so your left with your bombers which the Ukraine.
Or that Israel told Russia that if they use Iranian drones they will give the Ukraine long range missiles to hit Russia.
I suspect the real reason is Israel’s threat to supply Ukraine in response of Iran supplying Russia.
Either Russia or Iran found that too risky so the sale stopped(at least for now).
I wonder if Iran will respond?
Russia’s talking smack about their drones and I have to imagine that Iran planned for its use in the cold since they’re very mountainous.
Plus, it can also get pretty cold in Iran in general.
