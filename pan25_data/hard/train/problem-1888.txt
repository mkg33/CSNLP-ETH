Tbf I have been told that near the beginning of the vaccines in China they were causing problems but now they aren’t anymore,so that’s positive at least.
Well as far as the rest of the world goes they basically have zero immunity so it's unlikely whatever mutation comes out of china will evade western vaccines.
China's vaccination rate is way to low to achieve any kind of herd immunity and if it's a new variant, what protection they do have is pretty much limited to preventing death, not the disease.
Shit spreads fast when you drop all of the containment measures at the same time in a country that's about to start travelling for the holidays and where natural immunity from previous exposures (which is noted to be more effective than vaccines) is basically nil.
The difference is, we won't be playing coy with anyone who wants to take a look and see if we have any.
We don't need theoretical WMDs in order to sound tough to our populace and neighbours.
Kinda like Canada, except instead of a thin strip along the coast where people live and desert, we've got a thin strip next to the US and permafrost and tundra.
