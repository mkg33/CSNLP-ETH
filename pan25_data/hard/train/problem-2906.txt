Russia is already digging trenches in Crimea as if they will need to defend it.
What makes you think Russia will be able to keep Crimea if Ukraine decides to take it back?
You think if russia had the type of offensive gains ukraine has been having, that they would wanna go yo the negotiation table?
Reading further down, it doubt this deal would be accepted by either side, especially by Russia.
They wouldn't be able to sell it as a win or "save face".
I doubt it would be possible in their legal system anyway after having those 4 regions annexed and "become part of Russia".
The other things to consider would be what sanction relief for Russia and reparations & repatriation of kidnaped citizens for Ukraine.
I think these would be sticking points in a deal like this.
Good point.
I think it would spell the end of Putin if it was accepted, there's no way he could continue as leader of the country, even in the shadows.
Exactly, Russia won't give up Crimea to be a DMZ.
It's of vital importance to their navy having that port at Sebastopol.
