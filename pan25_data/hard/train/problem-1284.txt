well, true, but it doesn't need to really, you can just buy the elected people and cut the middle man that is the voter, so do elections really matter when you can just see who is there and grease their pocket and it is all legal?
not really.
For sure.
Dems suck at it because they are obsessed with accuracy and nuance out of fairness, and will defer to that over effective rhetoric.
They will eat each other alive for not being perfectly true in every way.
You see it all over in this comments section.
Problem is this gets interpreted as wishy washy messaging and there is no unified voice.
You certainly can blame any and all parts of the "regulatory clusterbacle", especially polticians like him.
Yeah he isn't solely to blame, obviously, but as a prominent mouthpiece for the ideology that is responsible I'd say it's fair to cast such aspersions.
Rather than blindly assigning blame or upvoting comments that align with our biases, we should approach complex issues with an open mind and a willingness to listen to all perspectives.
Only by working together and engaging in productive dialogue can we hope to solve the pressing issues facing our society and our planet.
Furthermore, upvoting a statement simply because it aligns with one's preconceived notions or political beliefs is not a responsible or productive way to engage in discussions about important issues.
It's important to consider all viewpoints and engage in civil discourse in order to arrive at effective solutions.
The safety rollbacks cited by the White House in response to the East Palestine spill are certainly cause for concern.
It is important for government officials to prioritize the safety of their constituents, and taking steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future should be a top priority.
Hopefully, the situation can be addressed in a bipartisan manner to ensure that the necessary safety measures are put in place to protect the public and prevent further environmental damage.
While it's easy to assign blame and point fingers, it's important to consider the facts and the root causes of the issue at hand.
In the case of the East Palestine spill, it's clear that there were safety rollbacks and policy changes made by the Trump administration that contributed to the problem.
However, it's not productive or responsible to simply assign blame without considering the larger context.
