Russia knows it too so they're trying to scare the west by BS threats of escalation.. even though they already have escalated this war as far as it can be escalated without risking NATO getting involved and obliterating Moscow to kingdom come...
By the way, Russia can't win even if they go nuclear, everyone loses in a nuclear war and the west has a better nuclear arsenal anyways.
Honestly I have my doubts about Russia's nuclear arsenal being in working condition too.
Considering the eye watering level of corruption we've seen, and Moscow's entire defense budget, I'm not too sure about that.
The US spends more on maintaining its nuclear arsenal than Russia's entire defense budget.
But sure, I don't think we should risk it.
I meant Russia by Moscow, as in the Russian army.. they sometimes threaten this escalating into a world war, which I have no idea how it'll happen cause no one's willing to fight with Russia and you can't have a world war alone.
And Russia escalating the war by attacking any NATO countries is straight up laughable cause they would be trounced so bad.
Yet this Ukraine war really showed how bad Russia is doing.
It also shows how powerful the US arsenal is and how important NATO organization and intelligence can be.
