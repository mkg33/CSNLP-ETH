Not only that, it’s a great advantage at the next US-China talks.
China is now on their back feet at the bargaining table.
Worth letting them take photos that their satellites can also take photos of.
Balloons have been used to collect more information than just close up photos like a satellite.
In the 1950s the US used high altitude balloons to collect information on sound waves from atomic bomb tests in Russia.
The Chinese or Russians have been suspected of using microwaves or other types of sound technology to make diplomats sick.
Maybe the Chinese balloon was testing how to deploy that technology over North America?
This is speculation based on publicly available information from someone who knows nothing about balloon technology or surveillance.
I imagine that if this much public information is around that there is much more that is kept secret.
Part of intelligence gathering is just collecting information and watching.
We know in the past the U.S. knows exactly who is a Russian spy but doesn’t kick them out of the US until their is a diplomatic incident.
I suspect the US wanted to see the capabilities of the balloon.
The U.S. military straight out said the balloon changed course so it was being controlled.
Maybe the US wanted to observe how the Chinese controlled the balloon in order to develop counter measures?
In fairness, three times during the Trump administration, China sent a balloon over the US, to no response.
It might seem reasonable that we've decided to ignore stuff that's inconvenient to deal with.
