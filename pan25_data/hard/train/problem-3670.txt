February 23, 2022 "Arizona House Bill 2319 says that anyone who police order to stop filming but continues to do so would face a class 3 misdemeanor and up to 30 days in jail.
".
That's my point.
I want to make sure any broken cops out there are exposed, and fingers are pointed.
Living in Phoenix, no stupid law is going to stop me from recording a cop.
I'll call it "checks and balances".
It's really hot in Phoenix.
People get lazy when hot or shutdown when overheated.
This affects education and businesses.
This affects how the cops act too.
Don't get me wrong.
I've had tickets and traffic stops and whatnot.
I'm not talking "down with the police".
But Phoenix is FULL of childish "men" (including Gov.
Douchie), and so there are some cops who take on a barbaric approach to law enforcement.
The only way the police will ever be reigned in from the wanton violence they commit every day is to show the public just how bad it really is.
That is a great way to get tased, or worse, because you are acting like you just might be a danger, and many cops have been assaulted by 'innocent bystanders' in those situations.
