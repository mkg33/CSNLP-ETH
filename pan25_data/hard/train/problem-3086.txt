This is yet another part of the story that gets me every time I hear some GQP moron regurgitate the usual line about how we just released the "super dangerous" Bout from captivity in exchange for "some basketball player".
If Bout was really still that dangerous, he would've been in a SuperMAX facility.
He wasn't.
He was in a medium-security federal prison in Marion, IL.
Shit, he probably had more amenities there than he does living in a regular apartment in Russia now.
Absolutely.
I'm not saying he has zero value to them(or else they wouldn't have wanted him back at all and wouldn't have been willing to give us even Griner back for him).
But for some folks to think that he's just going to slot right back into some position of power is just kinda silly & naive.
And, further to your point, he probably wasn't even as powerful then as some would believe, as the KGB were the ones pulling most of the strings on arms deals anyway.
The KGB controlled the arms shipments and so forth basically he was a front good chance he can still be used as a motivator, mentor, for the next generation and it is a boost like we do not leave ppl in jail we always bring them home.
