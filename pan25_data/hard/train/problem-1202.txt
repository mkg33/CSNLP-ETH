Consider the way the Russian tanks during the first weeks of the invasion were used - poorly.
Rushing into urban settings without adequate support columns, just to be destroyed.
Depends on the crews, to be honest.
If they are crewed well, that is an absolute force to be reckoned with.
They are very capable machines.
If they're operated poorly, their addition won't mean much aside from soaking up a few Russian munitions, which, still counts for something.
As Ukraine gets too notch tanks delivered to them and them preparing for that atack for a while now chances are not that bad of untaine wining out the war of nutrition.
Right now, what Ukraine needs is long range munitions, cruise missile defense (patriot) and non-arms support (generators, consumables).
I strongly believe we need to get more tanks, more ammunition, f-16s, and long-range missiles into Ukraine as soon as possible, and once Russia is out, keep up the sanctions until Putin is out of power.
The message to future Russian leaders should be: stay in your turf and we can be friends, fuck up and you're done.
