The issue with them is that either their tanks are by and large low quality.or they use them by themselves without proper infantry support.
the gap has narrowed considerably but something people forget, because they think about WW2, is in the modern day most tanks arent killed by other tanks.
The funny thing is, Russia likely doesn’t actually have many tanks left, at least not ones that can make a difference in a battle.
They’re fielding t64’s in some places and immediately pulled out their t90’s they deployed to Ukraine, the ones that didn’t get destroyed that is.
The only reason they’d be deploying tanks that old is because they’re running out of the new ones or they need something for cannon fodder (which honestly a t64 isn’t much of cannon fodder for modern western missiles or drones).
50 T90s have been strategically deployed recently to the Svatove salient, which may mean they're either getting more desperate for tanks and can no longer hold them back.
Or more likely: More confidence in being able to protect them with the increased infantry and defensive fortifications built over the last several months.
I wouldn't place any bets on Russia actually "running out of tanks" within the next year or two, even if they have to roll them out unmodernized.
