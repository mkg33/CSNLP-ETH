It's not that we have no way of knowing.
We just don't know.
But we do know that Ted Cruz weilds his power to marginalize a population his very own daughter is a part of which is pretty fucking disgusting and it wouldn't surprise me to hear that attributed to it.
Other than Ted Cruz being a vile person pushing a vile agenda, I don't feel like we should know anything about his daughter that she doesn't make public.
IMO, Ted Cruz might have been doing some shady things back stage and being completely rude and disgusting to her daughter.
But that's a theory without any facts, so take it with a grain of salt.
No conservative wants to see hate towards a little girl after she tried killing herself.
It's an awful situation.
Many conservatives think she shouldn't be making such rash desicions on her sexual identity so early in life, and instead should be focusing on other things.
But by no means do they think she deserves hate.
What I will say, however, is that many conservatives think this wasn't due to "societal norms" or simply people not wanting to support her.
