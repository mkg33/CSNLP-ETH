Then tell the Republicans to stop obstructing legislation, governance only works if both parties actually try to govern and Republicans arent interested in that right now.
We arent nation building or navigating millenias old ethnic tension/conflict, were supplying a fledging democracy with the tools it needs to fight off an imperialistic neighbor hellbent on erasing the Ukrainian culture and identity from the world, cant think of a better cause for my tax dollars to go to than that.
US budget is 6.27 trillion per year, 100 billion per year is around 1.6% of the total US federal budget, the US spent 3x-4x times per year that in the Middle East for 20 years.
The US Govt has a $6+ trillion budget.
About 20,000 for every man, woman and child in the US every year.
You need to be asking harder questions of your government where the rest of the budget is going.
And $38bn seems small fry in comparison.
38 billion is nothing in the scale of the US budget.
It’s about 1/1000 of what US healthcare would cost, and for supporting a just cause while destroying one of our most significant foes at the cost of no American lives it’s a pretty good deal.
I'm still paying ridiculous healthcare costs; might as well put our insane military budget to use for something that's morally correct.
