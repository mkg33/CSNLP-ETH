Let's hope nothing like this happens ever again.
I, for myself was planning to do an İstanbul tour once I was done with the university exam.
It's such a wonderful and refreshing city to be in.
Every street has a different story, every different location has it's own aesthetic..
I don't want to see the bloodshed of 2015-16 again.
I really hope you won't need these small rules within your trip to here, if the government decides to fix the issues at least.
Atay safe and hope you enjoy your travel to here!

You should definitely come after elections.
I don't believe that the chaos will end before them.
After elections you only have to worry about the place you're in tbh.
As long as you aren't in a problematic part of İstanbul, you're good to go c:
-you definitely should refrain from places that looks a bit too "lonely".
Which are mostly back streets (?
).
Yes.
There is a state department website where you can let them know you are traveling overseas.
They will send you alerts if things escalate where you are visiting.
It is worthwhile to stay in touch.
