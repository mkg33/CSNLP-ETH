You still haven't answered my question.
I asked you personally as to what you would call it, and you're only giving me snippets from the speech.
A few weeks before COVID struck the United States, I was, quite literally, the only person wearing an N95 at my university before COVID hit.
I had, a year prior, bought a box as a part of prepping for a general disaster along with bottled water and a small cache of non-perishables.
I looked rather nuts at the time.
I remember watching in my dorm at the University of Wyoming, seeing the mob approaching the Capitol police, then saying, "Those guys are going to get overrun.
".
But see that’s the thing.
That was literally the focus of the Jan 6 hearings: To show you it was never about that one speech.
The deniers and those just simply not paying enough attention are and always will be too focused on the speech itself, which was merely the final moments of a months long effort.
But that’s what right-wing news outlets do best: Cherry pick moments and events and show them out of context as a roundabout way of “proving” some nonexistent point so that you’re constantly distracted from the truth they can pretend they’re giving you.
Never a need to do the research they’re telling you needs to be done because you’ve seen it all….
