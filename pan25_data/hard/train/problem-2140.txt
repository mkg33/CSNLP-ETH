Blame all the redditors who keep sending Twitter news to the front page beating their dicks off to an egotistical billionaire doing egotistical billionaire things.
They are not mad about that, they are mad that twitter has fired most of its security and moderator teams, and now twitter is full of hate speech and misinformation.
Bring Trump back is just another little terd on top of the steaming pile.
Gotta choose your battles, and twitter was somewhat of a waste before.
And on an unmoderated platform, how do you even begin to "fight"?
I imagine you might make a few people waste their time in blocking you, but other than that, I'm not seeing a battleground of ideas there, and I'm glad I deleted my twitter account.
It's incredibly depressing, though, that Twitter has been lost to someone like Musk as its effectively ceding a massive portion of the internet to the Right's propaganda.
"Opting out" has never helped bring down disinformation and systems of control.
If you don't oppose fascism then it will run wild and destroy America.
There is no Twitter alternative for the reaching of millions across the globe and leaving it to the Far Right will kill more.
Twitter is nowhere near the world's biggest or most popular social media platform.
Not even close.
It just isn't.
Nope.
Guilty by associating only works if the associated party carries a lot of weight on said platform.
Reddit is just one account among millions.
Try harder next time.
This is just silly.
Agreed 100%.
It doesn't matter what side of the political spectrum you fall in, anyone on Twitter is supporting a right wing fascist propaganda network.
