Also it's the Case Fatality Rate that's around 50%.
It's entirely possible that more people have been exposed or infected, developed no or mild symptoms, and were never reported.
We know how to make avian flu vaccines.
If vaccination becomes necessary, they would have to be manufactured to the most prevalent sequence of H5N1 just like we do every year for H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B.
We do know how to make effective flu vaccines and H5N1 vaccines have been stockpiled for some time, but we can't say we know what the expected pandemic flu would look like.
So then why is the death rate of H5N1 50% if a simple flu vaccine provides protection?
That doesnâ€™t make any sense.
We would need an updated flu vaccine targeting H5N1, and that would take a year at least.
We do have vaccines for H5N1 which have been stockpiled by a fair few countries, so we should able to start out on some action in advance.
Among strains that have passed between birds and mammals, there are subtypes and these vary by location, time, etc.
We can say that our current vaccine stockpiles (and new prototypes) could be effective against a future human pandemic version, but there's no guarantee.
We could hit the jackpot and have it highly effective, we could find it mildly to reasonably effective like our yearly flu jabs, or we could find it utterly ineffective.
