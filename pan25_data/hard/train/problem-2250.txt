He won in a conservative district, he's on the blue dog coalition, and he's a veteran of several wars.
Seems like we'd be able to get five or six Republicans to go that way.

Yes, the Speaker decides the chair but the majority of seats will still be Republican.
And no the Speaker doesnâ€™t have the unilateral power to just remove Republicans off committees and force them onto one other.
Each party using their own individual House Steering and Policy Committees pick the seats on the committees in proportion to each parties seats.
Chairs would be Democratic but powerless since Dems will still be in the minority on committees.
What do you mean committee assignments?
Even if a Democrat becomes Speaker Republicans will retain majorities on committees since they still have the most seats.
Those Republicans who hypothetically flip will not be willing to flip when it comes to committees.
As many days as the Republicans can get their hands on.
All they do is disarray, either among themselves, or among everybody else.
