So the false Church of the KGB became confused with the true underground christianity of the USSR and recognised by the rest of the world as part of the legitimate Russian Church.
So a State controlled Russian Orthodox Church doesn't necessarily shock the faithfuls as it would in the West.
I know only the Church of England to be controlled by a Monarch in the West.
And it made a lot of controversy at the time Henry VIII created his Church.
Today, it is not controlled by the Parliament of England nor any administrative body of the State.
Which have nothing to say about the organisation of the Church, nor its doctrine.
It used to be and it was widely disaproved inside Great Britain which lead to civil war and, after, resistance notably from Scotland and Ireland.
But you have to keep in mind that, on the model of the late Byzantine empire where temporal and spiritual power became controlled by the Emperor.
In Tsarist russia the State (Emperor) was the head of the Church and had control of it also.
I'd argue that a state controlled church (like the original Russian Orthodox Church) is still quite different from a church that is literally an arm of the state (like the current one).
The former is still an actor, albeit not independent, the latter is just a tool.
