Not like polls matter too much for Erdogan.
In 2016, he declared a state of emergency after a "military coup failed to oust him from power," and he ran the country in that state for 2 years while he further consolidated power within the country.
The only reason NATO accepted Turkey into its ranks is because they served a strategic geographic role in being the only pro-West country (at the time) to have a geographic border with Russia.
No doubt that NATO is viewed unfavorably as Finland and Sweden have been hosting Kurdish refugees and political parties in exile, all of which Turkey designates as terrorists.
And two things Turks stand united for.
And that's against Kurds and Armenians.
Turkey's doing this for Turkey.
Or rather Erdogan is doing it for Erdogan.
Sweden has people he wants extradited and this is just about the only kind of leverage Turkey has.
Sweden applied to join NATO out of fear of being influenced by the dictator in Russia, only to subject to the dictator in Turkey.
The hipocracy is ridiculus.
I have lost all faith in the Swedish government.
Imagine if we in 5 years sell out Ukraine in favor of some agreements with Russia to maintain peace in Europe.
Don’t start with Ukraine WAR, that’s a war this is a agreement.
This is an alliance engagement.
Deals gotta be made.
Two big countries are using their cards at best.
About killing people.
First of all there is no death penalty in Turkey, second the people you talk about are recorded terrorists for Turkey and being a terrorist is a punishable act in general so of course they will not be wellcomed as important guests in prison.
Politics are bigger than people.
Erdogan might be a annoying person but this isn’t about him alone.
Personally I am happy to see two countries are in conversation about alliance rather than banning each other from everyhwhere like maniacs.
