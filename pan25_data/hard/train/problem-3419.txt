Ok that is 1 event that happened once.
Predicating all legislation on a single outlier seems like saying "Hey Paul Walker died in a Porsche crash so we should ban all Porsches just to be safe."
And even extrapolating it to "We lost James Dean, Paul Walker, Anne Hesche, Ryan Dunn and many more to crashes involving sports cars so we should definitely ban sports cars.
No that is not even close to my argument that is a convenient misinterpretation of my argument to make debating it easier for you.
You’re just arguing semantics with the ammo honestly, the average person isn’t going to know the differences, and for all intents and purposes they’re the same caliber.
This is what’s actually hurting the gun control argument because it comes across like they don’t know anything about guns.
If you're unable to comprehend any other possibilities between "I am 100% ok with people being shot" and "Ban guns because they are bad" then you have no place in this discussion.
When the issue isn't the type of gun, but the culture of hate stoked by right-wing media, access to guns in general, and our failure to actually enforce the laws on the books, fixating on one weapons manufacturer because their rifles look scary is just stupid.
