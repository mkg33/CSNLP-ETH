That's so awful.
The number of lives lost, and lives ruined.
And for what?
Some old man's obsession.
All those able-bodied young people with their whole lives ahead of them, just being slaughtered.
On both sides.
And yes, I know Russia is the aggressor but I can still feel sorrow for this absolute disregard for human life and all of the sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers being killed in pursuit of such a stupid and tragic goal.
Russia WILL lose, it's just a question of how many more innocent Ukrainians will have to be killed by Russia, before the West steps up to its moral duty to provide the weapons Ukraine needs to end this war ASAP.
Even with total war he can't win.
If he actually tried to go all out, NATO would stop him, because European place and security can't allow Russian troops marching Westwards, raping, killing, and looting.
Once Western equipment like tanks arrive for the Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Russian positions all along the front will be moving backwards a lot faster than 3km a month...!
