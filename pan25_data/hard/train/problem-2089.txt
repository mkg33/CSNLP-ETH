Extremism strives when people are marginalized and outcasted.
Sweden is currently the perfect ground for recruiters with growing anti-Muslimic sentiment.
Just being "intolerant" doesn't help the society.
Until the notion is grasped that you can't have a tolerant society without being intolerant towards intolerance this will never change.
There is no slippery slope argument and your imaginary scenario has nothing to do with the tolerance of intolerance.
In fact your example proves the point.
When you tolerate intolerance they gain power, and use that power to harm other people.
That is why their intolerance must be stopped right out of the gate.
When you are targeting other specific groups based on who they are and how they were born, that’s a pretty clear line.
The people who make this slippery slope argument are generally mad that they can’t be a bigot without being called out for it.
No one cares what is going on in your brain scan.
What matters are your actions.
If you think crazy antisemetic thoughts in your brain or have private conversations in your living room, no one cares.
If you make antisemitic comments in public, or call for harm against Jewish people that can’t be tolerated.
