Another interpretation is "I know \[the republicans\] will be there at the ground breaking to take credit for the funding you voted against.
".
Yup.
There’s already trolls and bots on Reddit saying the same thing.
For example, someone said they’re disabled and complained how Biden is neglecting them instead of thinking which party would most likely even care about the disabled.
Not sure how to put this in words exactly, but it occurs to me tonight that Republicans made a significant misstep in presenting Biden as having dementia.
We all know the gullible masses are going to swallow and repeat whatever the Bannons and Carlsons feed them.
What they should have laid out at the beginning was the evil genius dictator, dropping sweet promises and clever humor but hell bent on Deep State globalist domination.
It’s brilliant because it’s true.
And now every time it happens, the local press should do the job for him.
“Congressman, the President said he’d see you here at the groundbreaking.
And here you are.
How do feel about that?”.
Because they went with dementia, now every time Biden speaks the people with a lick of remaining sense continually get reminded that their preachers got it wrong somehow.
