Objective reality is dead and we best get used to it.
And to be honest, it never really was much of a thing to begin with, we just didn't realize how many otherwise normal seeming people believed utterly insane bullshit until facebook came along.
It felt nice thinking "if we could only get these people the facts they would surely change their minds", but logic and reason fail when you're not living in the same universe.
100% agree with your last paragraph and there is no doubt fb and ad revenue driven media has made it much worse, but the insane stuff I was thinking about is like "poor people probably deserve to be poor" or "non-white people are inherently inferior" or "my particular brand of Jesus is the only one that will keep you out of hell".
This is it exactly.
Jewish space lizards = weird, but Jesus put my cancer into remission = perfectly cool and normal.
Meanwhile in objective reality they are both 100% false.
This fact alone is idiotic.
I find it quite baffling how people reason "we just voted in a guy, so before he gets a chance to do anything let's vote for his opponents.
".
It really is.
Everytime she comes up and someone mentions she believes in Jewish space lasers and they just dig themselves that hole a little deeper.
We‚Äôre all gonna suffer in the process, but picking the dumbest possible person to lead hasn‚Äôt been working out for them anymore.
I know Nixon did 0 days jail time and never even sat in booking ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è if I commit crimes and all that happens is I have to resign from my job and keep all my benefits then I‚Äôd be stooooooked that nothing happened.
