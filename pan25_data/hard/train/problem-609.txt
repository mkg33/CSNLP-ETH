Alaska is more purple/independent/libertarian than most people realize I think.
Also national politics seem like they are really far away to many Alaskans, and most Alaskan voters are primarily concerned with fairly Alaska specific issues.
Alaska doesn’t really fit any molds that work down south.
4.)
a lot of Alaskans, including republicans, are embarrassed of the Palins and don’t trust Sarah Palin to focus on Alaskan issues.
I do wonder how many Begich voters put Peltola as their second choice though, given that Palin abandoned the last elected office she held in Alaska.
In the second tabulation round, the total republican votes were higher than 50%, but only 67% of Begich voters listed Palin as their second choice.
Yes but in a regular election it would be between her and Palin and those that listed her second would likely have just voted for her.
Ranked choice wasn’t the reason a dem won.
On the contrary it was the reason there were two viable republicans in the race.
But that’s a good thing because people on the right could choose either republican and rank the other one 2nd if they so wanted to.
Thankfully many who voted for the 2nd republican listed Peltola second instead of a Republican 1-2 vote.
11% of Begich's (R) voters decided they'd rather have Peltola (D) as their second choice rather than a Trump-backed Republican.
