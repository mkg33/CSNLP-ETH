Thomas: “remember when my foster dad wouldn’t let us wear gloves in the winter and took the heater out of the car so we wouldn’t get soft?
This one’s for you, mother fucker!”.
E: also, fuck me.
I was way too kind in my rebuttal as I thought I left out the word "significantly" in my original comment.
I did not, so therefore concede nothing.
To speak freely, dying on the inflation hill is an indicator of economic illiteracy.
In short, it seems a bit ludicrous to support the denial of this initiative under the pretense of inflation when all it takes to boost CPI almost a full percentage point is a bad meeting with Saudi Arabia.
If these rationalizations are agreed upon, then the next step is cost/benefit analysis (which the link does not participate in).
Pulling millions of Americans out of paycheck to paycheck living would be a net benefit to society.
It is reasonable to assume that consumption would increase on goods and services and that individual indifference curves would expand (alluded in article).
Thus, the opportunity cost for choosing to suppress a 27 point spike is business profits, company creation, and higher wages for labor workers.
It would harm the economy the same way that individuals seeking higher paying jobs throughout their lives harms the economy.
No, because then you would be creating/spending new money, like the stimulus checks, which would hurt the economy.
The cancelation doesn't cost the taxpayers anything.
