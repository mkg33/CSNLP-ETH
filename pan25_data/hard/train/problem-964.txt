Yesterday there was some quote from someone high up in Russia, along the lines of "Ukraine can stop the suffering if they just surrendered our territory that we occupied".
A good way for Russia to avoid having their soldiers be taken as prisoners of war is to get the fuck out of Ukraine.
Ukrainian soldiers don’t have the luxury of that choice, which is why I can’t find it within myself to feel sorry for those executed soldiers.
The thing is innocent Russian civilians are not being killed by Ukraine as opposed to innocent Ukrainian civilians are non stop being killed by Russia invaders.
Fake surrender is not pow, Russia it self has been bombing civilians targeting civilians infrastructures since day 1, can it get more ridiculous than this.
I'm pretty sure they are referring to the Russian who pretended to surrender then began shooting getting all the ones around him who surrendered killed.
Don't fake surrender is the lesson here.
Your example is very far from the scenario.
If criminals broke in and started killing all the police in the police station I'm sure the police left over trying to survive would not be trying to take prisoners and even more so here since international law can not be enforced against Russia unlike domestic criminals.
If international law could be enforced Russia would not be doing what it's doing.
"I am stating, as fact.
IF SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING THAT VIOLATES THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND IT IS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE RULES OF WAR, IT IS A WAR CRIME.
".
That's the point.
Laws of war are nowhere near as simple as do X instead of Y.
The law and even any court will take the entire scenario as a whole and judge based on the circumstances.
