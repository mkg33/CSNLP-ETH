This is why we will be honored to have Sweden and Finland as full members of the Alliance.
I know that it will be appreciated by our Turkish Allies as well (not named Erdogan).
As a Swede I have have not seen the best of Erdogan and his regime lately, and have been resentful of the Turkish diplomacy towards us.
But that does not take away my empathy and sympathy for the Turkish people and I am sure many Swedes feel the same.
I know the relations between our countries have not been the best lately, but let's put the whole NATO-thing aside for a moment.
If we can help with the rescue work and relief after these frightening earthquakes I am confident we are eager to do so.
Dear Mr. Erdogan.
If you look at the list of tv√§ttider in the washing room you can clearly see that the time was mine.
This brings me concern of your eyesight and I have therefore included this reklamblad to Synsam where you can test out glasses.
Priority one is to save lives and I hope we can make a difference.
Then I'll go back to grumbling and being annoyed at Erdogan again.
