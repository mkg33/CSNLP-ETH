No.
Zelenskyy knows that the public will never support anything Putin says.
If Putin said “return to February border lines” the public would go “no, Ukraine deserves part of Russia!”.
Obviously this is something advantageous for Ukraine to which Putin will never agree.
The issue regarding open negotiations like this between the invader and invaded would require the public discussion/admission of responsibility regarding things like troop numbers, civilian casualties, etc.
that Putin really doesn’t want to discuss.
I suppose from my perspective, the 2 things I think would be bare minimum in this case would be to hold out until: relinquishment of all historically Ukrainian territory and membership in NATO to deter invasion in the future.
Zelensky isn't taking this approach because he's a warmonger, he's doing so because it's the view of nearly every Ukrainian (according to local polling) that ceding territory to Russia (even Crimea) is unacceptable, and that continuing the fight is the preferred option between the two.
Russia has successfully turned nearly the entire population of the country against them, and they are against giving Russia any sort of 'win', especially as Ukraine is now winning on the battlefield.
Negotiations based on Ukraine's battlefield successes means admitting Ukrainians have held off the best Russian troops.
And that Russia is not the super power that USSR was.
Showing Russian troops committing genocide, torture, rape, and the deliberate destruction of electric, water, heat shows Russian policy of brutal subjugation war.
Not a special operation to welcome Ukrainian brothers.
