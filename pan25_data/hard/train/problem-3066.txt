One of the cases was when they started this whole "we want reparations from Germany!"
around 2022.10\.
There was this whole campaign going, large sums thrown around.
But when they send a diplomatic note it never mentioned it.
And they tried to force opposing politics to sign NDA so that this wouldn't leak.
Politics.
Current Polish government loves to blame everything on Germany.
Their main way of doing that is to say they did something, then wait a bit and say that bad Germans didn't agree/refuse, while in reality they never did it formally.
It's not the first time they are doing it, and sadly it won't be the last.
Generally, they are very corrupt, anti-EU/Germany, and I hope that they will be gone soon.
Disclaimer: I'm from Poland.
Meanwhile Poland has never even ASKED for approval.
Germany has stated multiple times that no requests were made and that if they asked, they would approve it.
Now yesterday Germany has explicitely said it again.
The way the squabbles have been going between Poland and Germany about the Leo2 is a fucking media circus and the entirity of reddit so far has taken the bait.
