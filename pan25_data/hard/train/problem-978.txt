It's not going to saturate the local environment to the point where it will be easier to detect.
As it decays it might ionize some surrounding atoms making them slightly radioactive, but this won't increase the overall radioactivity of the area.
Radiation is a very braod term that includes things like heat, radio waves, visible light, all the up to ionizing radiation (x-rays and gamma).
The problem is "radiation" is a blanket term, and such reactions tend not to happen all that frequently and most of the time when we think radiation we think gamma rays (aka x rays).
But hang out to something that's giving you 10 x rays an hour for a few weeks and you're going to have some problems.
Which is the same as saying, this is like getting 10 X-rays done in an hour.
Which is a very simple way of conveying useful information in a relatable way to the public.
Most people have had x-rays done multiple times, and everybody knows it's not dangerous, but that you don't want excess exposure if you can avoid it.
