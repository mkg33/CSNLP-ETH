That a few bad judges in crazy republican states can block a drug distribution to all 50 states is insane.
Let Texas judges prevent the sale in Texas and not Massachusetts.
Of course, this shouldn’t be allowed at all just because a bunch of tight assed religious zealots don’t like a thing.
“Not all christians” is another that will always help the fanatics in their goal.
Instead of properly considering the criticisms of the things religious people believe and do, they plug their damn ears and go “la la la la la, I was taught that that’s not okay specifically when it comes to religions, la la la la”.
Then they have the fucking audacity to go “I can’t believe anyone would ever try to do that” when what we’ve been warning about actually happens.
It’s literally the same people that put their god on the money and in the pledge of allegiance and want to mandate the pledge at all schools and punish anyone that disobeys.
The people that say “why does it matter if it’s on the money or in the pledge, you’re being a silly atheist troll” are critical to the success of the fanatics.
The fanatics rely on these people to do the trivializing of each of their steps towards a theocracy.
