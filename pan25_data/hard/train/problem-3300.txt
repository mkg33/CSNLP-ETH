The sensor on the missile itself is designed to go into bulldog mode against fast movers to turn slowly.
Laser guided missiles would’ve been the way to go with the balloon.
Talking with one of the air crews in charge of one of the balloons recent shootdowns, they're firing sidewinders that have no warhead, just the missile.
They’re for monitoring the altitudes that hypersonic missiles fly at (around 80k feet).
You don’t have to violate Chinese airspace to do that.
Currently we do that with E3s and Satellites (as the article says - it will do the same job as planes and satellites) but hypersonic missiles attempt to exploit an altitude gap between cruise missiles and ICBMs that current systems are not designed to monitor or counter well.
You don’t need to hovering over the launch site to do that.
Satellites can already watch launch sites without violating airspace.
E3s spy on both those countries without ever entering their airspace.
I was implying we could park one near a site of interest offshore permanently, where as currently we have to fly an E3 up and down the coast.
If I had to guess we would park them over the pacific near Chinese airspace above where e3s fly, the arctic and Antarctic.
