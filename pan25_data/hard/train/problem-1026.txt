Who knows, there's all sorts of games they play with money.
I got it when AOC talked about having to have a place in NYC and in DC, which is a lot for 174k.
But Marge is from Georgia, little bit different CoL.
I don't even think he fought her in the divorce much, just basically did "she cheated, kids are old enough , I'm out.
".
Yep.
She made a name for herself by harassing Parkland survivors.
Children who’d gone through a school shooting.
She has always been total scum and that’s what the GOP base wants.
She knows most of us see her as a moron.
Her antics aren't for the nation.
They're for the audience that consumes right wing media and voters in her gerrymandered district.
When she does things the media, her colleagues, and anyone with a shred of intelligence rightly mocks her for, its part of her grift.
"See the way the MSM and the libs hate and dismiss me?
That's what they think of all of you" It all plays into the us v. them, in group v. outgroup dynamic that fuels the right wing media empire.
Its not about policy for her.
Its about keeping her name constantly in the news.
