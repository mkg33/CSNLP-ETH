Enough with this kumbaya bullshit.
Enough seeking common ground with people who propagate lies and conspiracies and kill in their name.
Enough seeking common ground with people who have convinced themselves that our country would be better as a theocratic plutocracy.
Enough pretending like were just one good conversation away from reaching common ground with people that tried to install a fascist as President by force and then excused and white washed it because 5-10% BLM protests turned violent.
There comes a point where we stop pretending like this is a difference of opinion and realize these people are our enemies.
Like it's not hard to just talk to people and see what they believe and tell them what you believe without trying to win a debate or convince them their wrong or feeling any animosity.
You can't have a sit down conversation expecting brainwashed morons to act like people who are capable of critical thinking and then bridge the political divide.
And maybe just maybe their is an actual real world out there which canâ€™t be changed by rhetoric and philosophizing and a political ideology that pretends otherwise is dangerous.
Maybe the actual nature of the ideologies behind the politics can differ so much that there is no reasonable compromise.
