Reuters?
Or RT?
I'm assuming you mean RT because afaik Reuters is a western agency and supposedly pretty impartial.
Up until about 3-4 years ago I used to follow some of the RT news, at some point there was a definite noticeable shift towards showing the west as being in turmoil due to culture wars etc.
Lot's of stuff around Brexit/Trump; articles geared towards both sides, which twigged what I'd heard about Russia's tactic of broadcasting conflicting news.
Still, the main source of news for Russians who want to see something different from the usual state media bullshit has always been telegram.
There are lots of good independent telegram channels that regularly post news, including from Ukraine - often I see stuff posted in those groups before I see it here.
One of them, "Lentach" has almost half a million subscribers, to get an idea of how popular they are.
They are kinda half-meme half-news - they usually throw in a meme with every news item and take the piss out of the Kremlin quite a lot.
I mean, I glance at Russian propoganda occasionally and very sparingly just to be up to date on what nonsense they are pushing to be ready to counter it.
I know Russians that live outside Russia (in Northwestern US, for instance) who still manage to only listen to Russian propaganda with an occasional Tucker Carlson thrown in.
