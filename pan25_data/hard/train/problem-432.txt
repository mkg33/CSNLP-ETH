It does both?
It literally allows employers to put money towards your retirement while you pay down your debt.
Edit: there’s lots to criticize about our retirement system, student loans, etc.
This provision is decidedly not one of those things.
Most employers will add it, eventually, and it will help.
Which is better than nothing - I.e.
the status quo.
And Congress does not control what the Supreme Court does or does not do.
So this is still better than what we currently have.
It’s not a deduction either.
Meaning even if you didn’t pay $2,000 in taxes, you get this money when you file your taxes.
Literally the government funding the first $2,000 you save in your 401(k).
$2k in retirement match from the government for people too poor to put $2k away for retirement in the first place is near meaningless.
>Under the plan, workers who earn below a certain income threshold and contribute to a retirement plan could get a $2,000 match from the government.
The income limits are $35,500 for single filers and $71,000 for married taxpayers.
The $2000 government match sounds good, except it’s only for single filers making $35,000 or married making $71,000.
That really aught to be stepped up considerably in my opinion….
