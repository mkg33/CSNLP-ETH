The Constitution is holy to them.
Not what it actually says.
They probably haven’t read it and definitely don’t care what it says.
Just the idea of the constitution as unquestionable authority is what they like.
Conservatives speak of the Constitution like it's a holy document.
But in the past week Trump said we should just cancel the US Constitution, and this lawsuit is literally Republicans suing to make all state constitutions null and void.
There's 12 (R) House seats in California alone, and 11 in NY.
Dems could trim those down to half I bet.
But almost every red state is already gerrymandered to the max so they can't really gain many.
IDK.
New York was set to gerrymander the hell out of their districts but judges stopped it.
Dems are sick of playing fair while Republicans cheat in every single way.
But the fact is that generally Dems already play by the rules voluntarily to their detriment.
Go look up gerrymandering laws by state.
It’s not even close.
Virtually every state with a bipartisan redistricting commission is blue.
The only states that completely ignore any semblance of fairness is the south, where from Texas to Florida and everyone in between you have the most heinous redistricting in the country.
