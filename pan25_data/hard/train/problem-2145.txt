In America there are relatively low limits on campaign contributions and they are enforced.
The issue is that I can spend money on billboards expressing my own person view that a particular politician is good or bad.
That isn't a campaign contribution.
I can even form a group and accept donations from likeminded people put up more billboards.
Spending money on something that helps a politician is a lot like giving them money.
Lobbying and bribery go hand in hand.
Even when it is not directly giving money to the politicians, it's still using money to influence them in every way they think they can get away with.
Lobbying needs to go.
There's nothing wrong with lobbying itself.
People (and companies) should be able to form interest groups and present their views to the politicians.
It's pretty much only US where bribery is a legal part of that process.
In functioning democracies (like EU), there's nothing to outlaw.
Because that's not true, it's just anti-EU people who want to prove that EU is broken insist on that.
There’s a running gag that states „if the EU tried to join the EU, it would be denied due to a lack of democratic structures“.
The EU is hardly a functioning democracy.
EU member states may be, but considering Hungary is a member….
