There's also a big sampling bias.
The idea that "Police-submitted request to the ATF" is a direct corollary to the rate at which ghost guns are used in crimes is a rather large leap.
It's as much about whether police bother submitting the trace to the ATF as it is their actual use.
Home-CNC-and-3D-printing has sooooooo much potential.
Over-regulating it because of the scare of "ghost guns" is idiotic.
Making a "Ghost Gun" is not illegal.
However, the ATF requires in order for a "Ghost gun" to be passed on to another party or dealer that it be serialized.
Until recently, and we will see how this shakes out, grinding the serial number off of a gun was was in fact illegal.
Is this the same federal report that lumps guns with defaced serial numbers in with guns that were never serialized?
I have not heard the term being applied to regular guns with filed/altered serial numbers.
Ghost guns don't have a serial number, but it doesn't seem to apply to guns which had their serial number removed (that may change if we allow serial numbers to be removed).
Where are you seeing that these are included in ghost gun statistics?
Ghost guns are just guns that are personally made.
It seems very strange to try and argue that you should not be allowed to make an otherwise legal item.
