“While Sanders and King formally caucus with Democrats, Sinema declined to explicitly say that she would do the same.
She did note, however, that she expects to keep her committee assignments – a signal that she doesn’t plan to upend the Senate composition, since Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer controls committee rosters for Democrats.”.
This move lets her continue to play "President Sinema", forcing Schumer and Biden to continue to acquiesce to her demands for attention and favorable treatment (like committee chairmanships).
She already had a de facto primary opponent, an anti-Sinema PAC that raising respectable money, and the Arizona Democratic Party had passed a motion of no confidence against her.
Except due to her recent "antics" she's more popular with Republicans than Democrats (Still incredibly unpopular with both funnily enough).
As long as Democrats rally behind whoever they choose instead of her I wouldn't worry.
And that fact that she now lost the (D) next to her name on the ballot helps the Democrat candidate more than anything.
So a run as an independent wouldn't necessarily hurt Democrats and in fact could help Democrats.
Keep in mind this was also based on polling before she left the party.
I imagine her favorability among Democrats will sink even lower and rise even higher for Republicans.
By the time the 2024 election comes around she may be a bigger threat to Republicans than she is Democrats.
The largest chunk of that 37% isn't coming from Democrats though.
Her approval rating is higher with Republicans.
