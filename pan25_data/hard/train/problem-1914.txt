Lol some people have no idea.
A more legit one though back when everyone had them "no one knows how to change the clock on the VCR!
".
But we do.
We force everyone to now get up at 7 AM.
We just all agreed to pretend it was 6AM and agreed on a day to do so.
Just because we call it 6AM doesn't mean our schedules didn't change.
It's rather silly, in retrospect.
Just because it's dumb now, doesn't mean we have to keep doing it.
It might have been helpful back in the days of WWI but we're beyond that now.
Btw, I work in IT and Congress has already changed DST in recent memory which was a massive headache to implement as not all software back then utilized the OS's offset and had to be updated separately.
We're at a point where we could just break clean all together, even if that means upsetting yes, a minority.
We can help them through it.
Have we heard of actual industries or groups (outside hot button political/internet outrage groups) advocating for DST to remain?
It's actually a huge inefficient pain that I guess makes farmers happy but is rife with issues for any automated system that depends on scheduled execution.
It would be far easier at this point to standardize time and stick to it, and help the few that complain about dark mornings automate their scheduling.
Ending daylight savings time is good but the default time should be standard time and not daylight time.
Many scientists have studied the effects of offset circadian schedules and it is bad.
It increases stress, cancer, obesity, and depression by significant margins.
