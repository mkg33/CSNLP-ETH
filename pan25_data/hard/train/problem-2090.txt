It's a problem either way...
Voters are different in each state.
For example voters in SC are going to be less open to lgbt rights than say voters in NH.
Campaigning is helpful but doesn't make the electorate magically change.
My statement still stands: getting voter support in SC is only a problem for candidates who can't bring a message to those voters.
To be frank though, SC voters in particular are kind of useless to appeal to because it's an unwinnable state in the general.
NC or Georgia would have been much better picks if the goal is to see how the candidate appeals in those sorts of states.
Same with Nevada, very diverse purple state.
States actually are weighted in primaries by how blue to red they are.
Likewise, the realities of Presidential campaigning means that most states will in fact be mostly ignored in terms of visits and spending.
I could say the same.
Moving the 4 state to the 1 state does very little to enhance the fairness of the primary in terms equal representation among states.
Instead it feels like a reward to delegates who boosted the previous winner rather and will have the consequence of boosting more right-leaning dems in the future.
