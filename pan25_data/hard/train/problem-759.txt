If more people become aware of what's happening in Iran, Iran's government will be less inclined to execute protesters and commit atrocities if it all will be constantly in the international spotlight.
Awareness helps, because it keeps the regime's abuses more publicly known and available, and therefore helps keeps anger at the regime, including in Iran, at a higher level.
And, well, yes - if a regime like Iran's feels like they can get away with a quiet execution in times of strong social turmoil and it'll help them quiet things down by taking out protesters one at a time, they'll do so.
As I've said elsewhere, supporting dissent in Iran and trying to weaken the government in the hopes of positive political change doesn't have to mean a GWOT-style invasion (infeasible for many reasons) or the 1953 coup.
Peaceful revolutions don't happen in an international vacuum, much as isolationists would like to pretend they do.
The Solidarity trade union, for instance, was instrumental in ending the communist system in Poland, and guess who funded and supported it?
The US.
The US also funded Otpor!, the anti-Milošević protest group that helped bring about the Bulldozer Revolution that ousted him as leader of Yugoslavia in 2000.
Not saying the US has clean hands in geopolitics--obviously it doesn't--but not every US-affiliated regime change has been 1953 Iran or 2003 Iraq.
I'm not sure less covert or non-violent Western involvement is better for the Iranian people when either way, their government will likely get nukes.
The inevitable Saudi-Iranian arms race would be the most tense nuclear rivalry the world has seen since India and Pakistan in the 1990s, maybe since the 60s even.
