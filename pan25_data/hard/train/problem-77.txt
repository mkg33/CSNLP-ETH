But if it hasn't, organizing a proper election could be incredibly difficult.
Many Ukrainians have fled the war, some are living in occupied territory where it would be impossible to run polling stations and some have been abducted to Russia.
Particularly relevant in this case would be the Ukrainians that live in occupied parts of the country where a Russian soldier could force them at gunpoint to vote for the Kremlin-preferred candidate and there'd be no way for the outside world to tell.
I imagine that when the time comes, the government will be brainstorming solutions.
But there's no easy answer here that will please everyone.
Postponing the election might be the most pragmatic, but doesn't look great for a country trying to become more democratic.
Holding an election where large parts of the population isn't able to make it to the polls is not great either.
Perhaps there's a middle ground somewhere that involves an election for all who are able to vote, but with the added condition that whoever wins the presidency calls for a new election the moment the war has ended and a proper election can be held again.
But even if there were elections everyone here would vote for him again, and everyone most likely will when all this is over, should he go for a 2nd term.
