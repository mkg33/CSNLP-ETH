It may be a 3 way race with Sinema as an Independent, Gallegos as the Democrat , and whichever horrible election denier the Republicans nominate.
I think independents break for Republicans because there are more self-identified dems than Republicans but elections always end up way closer than that.
If she shows up, it will be a three-way race that splits the independent and moderate Dem vote, and a Republican will beat both of them.
Let's hope that doesn't happen.
You're right, it's not a surprise.
However, it's a complicated situation since if Sinema and a Democrat both run, it's very unlikely either of them wins.
If Sinema doesn't run, the Democrat has a good shot at winning the seat.
If no Democrats run, Sinema has at least a slight chance of holding the seat.
If Sinema cared at all about the Democratic party she would just announce she will not rin for the seat.
The odds of her winning are extremely low unfortunately she may get a bunch of corporate and billionaire money to stay in and fight.
