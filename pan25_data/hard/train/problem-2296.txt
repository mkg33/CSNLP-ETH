No, unfortunately not.
An invasion of NK is out of the question because it would immediately trigger war with China.
The other issue is the nukes.
I often get the impression that a lot of Redditors don't understand what nuclear war anywhere means for them.
If they're dummy missiles, it's not a nuclear exchange, it's a warning of Mutually Assured Destruction.
I.e.
"Hi, we just wanted you to know if you fire anything at us again we can hit you just as easily, and our defense systems can fire them on detection of an incoming missile.
The next ones will be armed with active nukes.
Thanks for your time and have a nice day!
.

Now nuking North Korea, that I'd have a problem with.
But warning them viscerally how much fire they're playing with?
I think that's appropriate at this point.
No he’s right.
Piss off the US or an Ally by attacking them would mean the end of North Korea.
Chinas policy on North Korea at present is only coming to defend if attacked first and will completely step away if they attack first.
They have very little nukes, they aren’t Russia or even China.
Like maybe 10 functional ones at best.
And if NK does attack first the most likely first target is Seoul.
And they would use artillery for that not nukes.
They would save those for different targets, most likely.
