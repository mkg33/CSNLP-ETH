I used to work with classified document security.
Believe it or not, breaches happen more frequently than you'd like to think.
Usually, they don't amount to anything, and initial offenders usually just get reprimanded.
Repeat offenders, or offenders that don't cooperate with security, will be charged and held accountable according to the level of classification of materials left unsecured.
This includes revocation of security clearance, heavy fines, and prison sentences.
A range of consequences from a talking to, to losing security clearance, to minor charges, to very serious charges.
I don't think people are excusing, you're making that strawman up, people are disagreeing with you suggesting anyone who thinks this isn't equally as bad as the Trump situation are morons.
If you can't see the difference there isn't much to say to convince you here (not that I think that you are here to discuss as much as ridiculise the law in favor of Trump.
).
Lmao.
Iâ€™m loving all the classified document keyboard warriors on Reddit telling me how the handling of classified documents works.
