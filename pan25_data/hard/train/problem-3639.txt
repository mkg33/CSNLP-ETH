I'm all down for closing down the IRS as long as In replacement we have everything swapped digitally so we can move forward like a civilized nation.
All of our information has the ability to be used and stored digitally.
There's no reason our taxes are this complicated and require so much effort.
I'm sure the Republicans want it gone for their own benefit instead.
Uhhh... no the article is about how Republicans want to replace income tax with a sales tax.
I'm not saying to dump income tax, I'm saying to use a sales tax to help pay our debt.
I've said it for years that we need a one cent sales tax on all sales over a dollar (before tax) that goes directly to paying off the debt.
People told me that was stupid and it wouldn't have done anything.
I told them that there's over three hundred million people living in the US and her territories, not including tourists, and it would make a huge difference.
First, again, that's the low end estimate.
It's estimated that on average there's 400 to 600 million sales in a day, I just used 300 million as an example.
