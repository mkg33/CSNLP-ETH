The Nazis killed 2 approximately 2 million non-jewish Ethnic poles.
The 2nd most killed ethnic group in Auswitz non-Jewish ethnic poles.
I don't see anyone lecturing about Jewish nazi collaborators.
Somebody had to administrate the ghettos for the nazis, it was the Jewish Elders.
Nobody talks about the Jewish Kapos actually operating the crematorium.
Nearly 20 percent of Poland's prewar population in 1939 did not live to see 1945.
So you can forgive Poland for being a little sensitive when people try to blame the holocaust of them.
Why is that Poland had the most amout of jews in whole europe if Poles prosecuted them on "in large numbers" ?
Also historians are still trying to figure out to this day if all pogroms were by Poles or Russians.
Literally no one is blaming Poland for the holocaust.
What kind of bullshit are you trying to sling?
Poland committed terrible crimes against its own citizens, willfully.
Most of those citizens being violated and murdered were Jewish citizens or Christian Polish citizens.
That wasn't just an accident and it didn't just spring up at Hitler's knock on the door.
Prejudice and hatred were still the primary motivator and Hitler didn't import that into Poland.
That was homegrown.
Other Polish people were the enforcers of this violence.
Do you understand the definition of collaboration?
Collaborators willingly worked with Nazis.
Took over the government.
All still Polish folks.
Sorry you are uncomfortable with the idea that ordinary citizens are also collaborators when they comply with morally unsound laws.
American citizens, Canadian citizens, European citizens, we are all responsible for complying with unjust laws and actions taken by our governments whether we like it or not.
The average German citizen in Nazi Germany was a willing collaborator.
