Well they didn’t have too deal with that before.
I have a friend who has lived in the UK for 20+ years and never got her citizenship until Brexit happened.
Why deal with the process as an EU citizen you didn’t need to.
But they didn't because "hey, we are in the EU, I don't need to become a citizen of this country".
Not very smart.
>Given the aim of increasing European integration, EU citizens are not required to give up their previous citizenship.
According to Section 25 para.
2 of the Nationality Act, Germans who become naturalized citizens of another EU country may retain their German citizenship.
Germany does allow dual citizenship for EU citizens.
It is relevant to a British citizen in the context of this discussion because the UK was an EU member until 3 years ago.
So a British citizen who had already lived for 10+ years in Germany in 2022/2023 had the opportunity to become a German citizen before the UK left, without giving up their British citizenship, and they simply decided not to do so.
I know it depends on the country, but we are talking about Germany, which allows dual nationality with other EU countries (and the UK was a member all those years), and the UK which allows dual nationality with any country.
Germany doesn’t allow dual citizenship (mostly - there are multiple exceptions but probably not relevant to a British citizen).
The current government plans to change that, but the legislation hasn’t passed yet.
