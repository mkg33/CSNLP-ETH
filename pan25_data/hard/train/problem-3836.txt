On the contrary, a T-72 needs to be within 1000 meters of an Abrahms to even penetrate it's armor.
Assuming somewhat similar performance for a Challenger, you can see why the 12 Challengers can be so effective.
It's definitely a huge contribution, but those 12 challenger tanks are as well.
As you noted, the difference is in the tech.
T-72s, even "modernized" ones, are still cheap tanks from the 70s.
Modern MBTs like Challengers, Leos, and Abrahms would still eat T-72s alive on the battlefield in a tank on tank fight.
The British army use the more modern Challenger attack, their own domestically made tank.
Most European countries use the German made leopard, which is a similar specification/era, but has been produced in vastly greater numbers is much more widely adopted, allong with parts and expertise.
Most countries running old Soviet era tanks donated their old stockpiles, as Ukraine already knew exactly how to use them.
Ukrainians are much more familiar with Soviet era tanks and technology.
You can give them the tanks, but then you also have to train them on using them, maintaining and repairing them, and provide them with a logistical system for replacement parts and equipment, all things they would already have for the Soviet machines.
