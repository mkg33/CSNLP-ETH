These people are like me.
I have paid, I think, about $500 for my college degree.
I got a scholarship for attending a Catholic high school from a Catholic college.
I got a dean‚Äôs scholarship for academic excellence even though my overall high school GPA was 3.00, because my high school was so prestigious.
I got into that prestigious high school because my parents paid six figures to put me through K-8 in a private catholic school.
On top of my scholarships my parents paid a big chunk of my tuition.
And then when I graduated my grandfather pitched in another 10k.
I have about $12k left to pay.
It will be easy to pay.
So if I was a malicious conservative who wanted to act like I earned all of this through nothing but hard work, I‚Äôd probably be against Biden‚Äôs student loan forgiveness.
Also I would argue that since Biden did in fact attempt to forgive student loans up to 20k and the only reason it would not go through is because Republicans suing and conservative judges overturning it that he actually played the Republicans.
He played them by forcing them to once again be the bad guys!
Fact is, if Republicans want to win elections they have to appeal to more voters by taking more popular actions.
He tried though which is more than we can say of the entire Republican party who is actively fighting this.
It's hilarious that you would say he played us when he used his power and went arguably beyond the extent of his authority to try to help us out.
If that's being played I kinda like it.
Opposed to what these Republican clowns keep doing which is generally opposed to like 70% of the population.
I imagine their banning abortion, trans rights and education is going to be super popular üòè (definitive sarcasm).
