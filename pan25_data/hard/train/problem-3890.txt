The proposed bill would ban all insurance companies that provide gender affirming care anywhere in the nation (not just in Tennessee) from contracting with TennCare (Tennessee’s Medicaid program).
The Tennessee market is small enough that the bill is unlikely to have a major impact, but if larger states followed suit the result could be a complete block on insurance coverage for gender affirming care nationwide.
The goal is to force companies to stop covering gender affirming care anywhere in the nation by cutting them out of the Medicaid market in Tennessee.
In order to comply with this law (if passed), all 3 companies would need to stop offering trans healthcare in other states.
However, these companies cannot remove trans healthcare from their services in Washinon state—that’s against the law.
EDIT: there is another possibility: those companies remove trans healthcare from states that don’t explicitly require it.
Extremely disastrous.
Getting into my own speculation, I’m betting that if this law is passed, these companies are gonna pull out of TennCare and get their money elsewhere.
I don’t foresee any of these companies ceasing operations in Washinon—there’s just too much money out here, especially near Seattle.
