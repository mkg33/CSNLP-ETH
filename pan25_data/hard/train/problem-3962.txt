This article is a bit trash.
No mention of the increased violence against health care workers.
No mention of unsafe working conditions and unsafe patient ratios.
No mention of exorbitant ceo pay.
No mention of increased litigation against nurses or anyone that makes a mistake after being worked to death and overloaded.
The system has collapsed already and the system deserves to collapse.
We saw the collapse of our healthcare system during COVID.
There is only one solution: Medicare for All.
Everyone would have quality healthcare no matter what.
It would also cost less.
What that means is they have no incentive to lower costs.
Look at the covid vaccine which is going to increase in price astronomically now that for-profit insurance is paying instead of the government.
It's basic math.
They routinely take close to 20% in admin costs the limit allowed.
If all of a sudden the government said hey, everyone has to charge Medicare rates and Canada drug prices, insurance companies would see their 20% cut go down significantly.
You can argue their "profit" levels are different but keep in mind admin costs include everything from CEO bonuses to advertising to building new offices.
They don't want their 20% cut to go down.
And yes if the government started setting prices like most every other country does, their 20% take would absolutely go down.
Conversely if the government started setting prices and costs fell to what other countries are spending their 20% cut would go down.
