After all the bad news for Republicans on Election Day, the GOP is just barely on track to meet its baseline goal of the midterms: recapturing control of the House of Representatives.
The exact composition of a GOP majority could take weeks to determine, but it’s clear that whatever margin Republicans have, it won’t be a comfortable one.
If house margins get razor thin (<10 is likely at this point), then bickering within the GOP house members can actually be worse for them than losing the house.
“Let’s just say that the margin is 10,” one source involved in leadership race strategy for House conservatives said Wednesday.
“If McCarthy is stumbling in negotiations with the Freedom Caucus to give them all the stuff they want, the outer core of HFC probably starts to go to him and says, ‘Hey, it’s time to step aside.’ McCarthy probably starts getting that message from all corners and stands down before the vote.”.
Even if Republicans secure and pad their majority in the coming days, McCarthy will face a problem that has bedeviled a generation of House GOP leaders: the House Freedom Caucus.
So any GOP house leader will have an extremely difficult job in controlling the MAGA side from constantly proposing unpopular bills, and not spooking GOP reps from moderate areas.
