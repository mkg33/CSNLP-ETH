That person is going to have a hard time going forward.
More people are choosing less traditional names for their kids nowadays, and many of them will sound "black or foreign" because they likely are.
So, as a teacher, would you say the students are aware of this culture war stuff going on, and if so, how would you say the students at your school actually feel about it?
I feel for the teachers, and hate what's happening, but the above question is something that I feel has been left out of the whole conversation.
What’s so frustrating about this is that it’s school principals being quoted.
Teacher here, our lives are FAR worse than that of a principal.
Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a cake walk to be a principal either.
But they make our lives hell.
Not only are we so often the first people to get screamed at, we also have to deal with bull shit bureaucracy from principals.
It’s fucking awful enough to be a teacher and now I have to do additional lesson plans, curriculum maps, oh, and I have to handle discipline myself because admin won’t do shit.
That’s a great question.
Yes and no to are they aware or not.
Many of them are being taught to dislike teachers and public education.
But they don’t fully comprehend why.
It’s not uncommon to hear from a student “my dad said teachers are ruining America”, or some such thing.
One thing I hear (second-hand) is that when parents go nuts on a teacher that the administration does not back the teacher up.
In any healthy work environment, an employee should expect that their higher-ups will back them up when things get hot, and it sounds like that doesn't happen a lot of the time in public education.
