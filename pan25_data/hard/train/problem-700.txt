Right wingers act like conservatives are persecuted and censored.
In reality, social media companies ENCOURAGE conservative speech since the extreme nature of much of it leads to higher user engagement, whether it be for or the cries against it.
That's a big reason why right wing social media doesn't end up working.
Things like Parler had their issues with child pornography and such with lack of moderation, but many conservatives simply found it less fun when they were spewing shit segregated from the rest of the internet.
No one is saying conservatives can't use social media, but social media companies aren't censoring you for being a conservative.
They're banning people who yell slurs and incite violence because it's bad for business and they're not obligated to provide a service for them.
But also don't be surprised that one side is increasingly under a bit more scrutiny.
Social media companies are more than fine with stoking the flames.
It's just when one of the right's beloved figureheads crosses the line into a direct call for violence or uses a slur, the movement wants to cry foul that they're being censored for being conservative.
Guess it just seems to me like the right gets labeled extremists too often and in a dismissive manner, when “the left” has just as many offended.
I was being a little too reactive.
