I have a feeling this is along the same lines of the non-existent “red wave” being predicted for months prior to the midterms.
For the last week, we’ve been hearing how massive early voting turnout has been and how much it favored Warnock, but now we start hearing about how he only holds a “narrow edge.”.
Meanwhile, Warnock, who got more votes in the midterm, has done zero to lose voters since and Walker has only continued to prove himself as an incoherent, lying idiot who the GOP themselves don’t even trust and therefore have had Graham and/or Cruz “Weekend at Bernie’s-ing” him to the finish line for the last month.
What scares me is that, as over-the-top flawed Walker is as a candidate, he might actually not be the absolute worst that the MAGA GOP could put up for election and actually end up winning.
I've always tended to associate that back-woodsy area of northern Georgia with the film 'Deliverance'.
I have this vision of driving across the border that delineates Greene's congressional district and immediately hearing those famous opening chords from the film's theme 'Dueling Banjos.
'.
Same.
1 1/2 hrs for me to vote early.
I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes at my polling location before.
I'm hopeful that's a good sign for Warnock.
Can someone tell me what's wrong with Warnock?
Is it simply the letter (D) next to his name?
I'm completely baffled how this race is anywhere near close.
