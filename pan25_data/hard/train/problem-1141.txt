I hope we are really listening now.
Providing weapons, money, and logistical support is all well and good, but when I hear people telling Ukraine they must consider concessions, it worries me that we’re quickly backsliding to the old thinking where we want to believe we can trust Russia.
We cannot.
Give them what they want, and they’ll be back for more later (see: Crimea, 2014).
Eastern Europe has been telling us—the West—“I told you so” for decades.
They know what Russia is, and we have consistently failed to listen.
Russia has repeatedly shown it can do as it pleases and while the world will bluster they won't intervene.
It's all a game of chess - the media, the fighting, the politics, all of it.
Except we're not playing, we're the pieces on the board.
But every time someone says it, they fail to realize that every major thing that happens, there is no contingency.
not gonna happen any time in the foreseeable future.
So they've switched to disassembling important infrastructure and the power grid in a war of attrition.
