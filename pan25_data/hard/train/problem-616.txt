This fucker proposed that peace talks between Ukraine & Russia begin with Ukraine accepting that the territories Russia has annexed (but not conquered) belong to Russia and that they negotiate over the rest.
Any talk of Russia re-entering the international community can only take place after Ukraine is at peace, reparations have been (or are being) paid, and the war criminals prosecuted â€” all of them.
I dont think it is wrong to say that Russia should eventually rejoin the international community, but only after Ukraine's sovereignty is restored, war criminals are prosecuted, and reparations are made.
Without a near-total devastation of Russia to kind of wipe things clean (similar to Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan) I am not optimistic about any kind of real change coming from Russia even post-Putin.
I am pinning my hopes more on more parts of the country breaking away and demographic decline leaving Russia weaker and weaker, so that eventually they are more of a middling global power more akin to single larger European nations like France or the UK.
Even if several of the people and families stayed in positions of power, the nation was transformed.
