Love how the truth about Dems always gets downvoted on this sub.
They're about to elect yet another neoliberal "leader" who will inspire no one.
Americans are progressive when you ask them policy questions in a non-political way, but that doesn't work for the establishment Dems.
You gotta define “progressive” first because 90% of the democrats in congress who refers to themselves as “progressive” aren’t actually progressive.
Hakeem Jeffries is in the congressional progressive congress, but he is the biggest corporate democrat in the house by far.
Next, a lot of “progressives” simply say they don’t take corporate pac money.
While this may be true, there’s hundreds of other ways for corporations to donate large sums to politicians without using a corporate pac and those politicians take advantage of those loophole.
Mostly true.
While 90% of democrats (in addition to 99.99% of republicans) also take money from wallstreet, big pharma, defense contractors, aipac, the saudis, Russians, etc, there’s a few progressives like Bernie and the squad that source their funds a bit differently.
Now to give credit where it’s due.
Like him or hate him, Matt Gaetz is one of the few members of congress that takes no money from corporations or special interest groups period.
Is views on most issues are genuinely terrible and are not bought off.
