I mean, I don't see the Palestinians protesting against their government like the Iranians.
In fact, they'd rather blow up Jewish children instead.
They're such nice people!
/s.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
I'm sure China and Russia have their whole state censorship mastered and yet we hear about their protests all the time.
If your government start locking up jews, stoning lgbtq, and oppressing women then I'm sure people would start protesting.
It's funny how most Palestinians don't seem to care that and only believe jew=bad...
“So does Reddit side with Palestine or Israel” you know people are individuals right?
Humans are not sheep.
Some people will support Israel, some will support Palestine.
They don’t want to be Israel most Palestinians hate Jews and by extension Israeli citizens.
Jordan did occupy the territory at one point and that would’ve worked out if the other nearby Arab nations didn’t get all pissy about it.
Why did they get pissy you ask?
Because they like the current situation it allows them to get rid of undesirables and allows terrorist organizations that are funded by these nations to attack Israel without them having to actually go to war.
On the matter of war every single country that borders Israel would attack them the second they think they could win and they have launched coordinated unprompted wars on Israel in the past.
Yeah ultimately the people living Palestine get fucked but there isn’t really anything Israeli realistically could do to help stop that.
It's problematic: there are genuinely great people who live in Palestine - but at the same time, they are plagued by horrible, extremist leadership that perpetuate the conflict and fill their coffers at the expense of their populace.
Edit: I should clarify, Palestine should absolutely be free of oppression from their kleptocratic dictators that grow fat off the suffering of the citizens in the WB and Gaza.
