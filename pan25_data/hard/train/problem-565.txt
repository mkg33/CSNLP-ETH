Party of Xi basically.
The idea isn't wrong.
China was authoritarian, maybe even totalitarian, but it wasn't helmed by essentially one supreme leader.
The "president" (i gather there's a couple of head offices that Xi has lately consolidated to himself) was transient and the party went through several changes in leadership, most as far as I can tell, relatively peaceably at the top.
CCP China was always authoritarian but perhaps what they mean by heading towards dictatorship is that under Xi power has been consolidated more so under one person rather than several people under different factions of the CCP.
From a domestic perspective, Xi has worn down some of the checks and balances for power and consolidated a lot of power into himself as an individual rather than the party as a collective, and he's made some pretty bad calls in regards to the macro management of the economy (i.e.
the zero-covid lockdowns).
And we're also seeing some of the drawbacks of that macro-managed economy in terms of the real estate market.
But the seeds for these things were all planted well before Xi.
From an international perspective obviously the main concern is their rapid militarisation and aggressive claims in the South China Sea.
I don't know about that.
China's economy since 1958 deviated from the Soviet "centralised economy" to a "de-centralised but still totalitarian" economy and there was no intention to ever give up on that totalitarian aspect of managing the economy on a macro level.
