San Fransisco has around a dozen enormous high density mixed used housing projects ever year...Its not a lack of housing thats the problem, its the cost of living.
Your average blue collar worker cant afford to live there, you work for the city...You cant afford to live there either.
It has nothing to do with supply of housing, when they are constantly building large housing projects.
There are multiple issues.
Corporations and Banks buying up property and holding units and homes empty to manipulate the housing market.
Or Cities and Corporate interests colluding together to drive up property values to increase taxes and profits.
Banks and Corporations intentionally overbidding on property to drive up prices.
If developers can only profit off of making high end custom homes and luxury apartments, a large percentage of the public is not going to be able to afford to live in new housing.
New construction drives up the cost of existing housing...Because there is absolutely no way to outbuild demand.
New housing does not increase cost as the other guy already explained.
I can start throwing studies at you on this if you want.
