She's been utterly disappointing as vp.
I was really hoping that she'd do something great as the first female vp, but she's just a political equivalent of a cold dead fish.
Nobody's even running yet, how can you say we only have two choices?
Give it six too nine months and we'll have a much better idea of what our options will be.
Biden, bless his soul, is a good guy, but he's old, and in my opinion, a weak president.
He's got heart, but he needs to do something great between now and election time if he expects to win again, because I have no doubt that the GOP will put up a younger, charismatic candidate to run against him.
We don't know that.
Anything can happen between now and then, and you seem to be discounting the huge number of swing voters (like me) who only voted for Biden because we couldn't stomach four more years of Trump.
I certainly didn't want Trump but I always liked Biden as a candidate and president anyway.
Like I feel like "at least it's not Trump" is disregarding him.
Sure.
I would have voted anyone over Trump.
But Biden was one I didn't mind to do so.
Biden is fine.
A lot of Democrats may not like him, but it’s soft disapproval.
He doesn’t inspire hatred against him like Trump or Obama.
Most people think he’s just ok outside of partisans.
If the economy stays ok next year then he’ll win.
Barring a massive scandal, a major economic implosion, or actual dementia he’ll win.
