Devils advocate, it’s also frustrating for people to see billions of dollars going to a foreign country over and over while we’re getting skullfucked every time we go to the grocery store at home.
I am all for supporting Ukraine here just saying there’s more to it than “people want Russia to win”.
I see a lot of people saying Russia needs to let Ukraine join NATO.
What exactly can Russia do to stop it?
Are NATO holding back from allowing Ukraine to join while this war (you can shove the special operation bullshit up your ass, putin) is going on?
I mean I'm sure they're open to negotiate Russias full withdrawal from all Ukraine, along with a peace deal that see's Russia pay for the damage it's caused to their nation.
It's easier for everyone to back Ukraine if Ukraine says "yes we are always willing to negotiate seriously" instead of "we won't negotiate until Putin is dead".
The article says they aren't telling Ukraine to negotiate, just to keep the appearance of being open to negotiate, for appearances sake.
