Considering Reagan and more currently, Rep Massie of Ky have tried to shut down the Department of Education, you’re not far wrong (assuming ‘defund’ of course .
).
Yah.
Like what country in the world actually has free healthcare?
Or free university?
Where can anyone live that an injury won’t mean bankruptcy?
How can the flood of corporate money into politics ever be controlled?
What’s especially frustrating to me is just how many of these issues would be solved by simply taking corporate money out of politics.
There would still be plenty of problems to be sure, but it would be a huge blow against all the corruption and fuckery.
That's why they spend all their time and energy bribing the politicians and convincing the public not to vote, or vote for corrupt fucking hacks.
The people in Ohio voted for all of the people that tore apart the safety measures for a multi-billion dollar railroad company that just drove many metric tons of poisonous chemicals into their back yards and killed an entire county.
They're not complex.
It's money in politics, corrupt politicians, and a lack of accountability for corporations.
