Well those companies don't need to rise wages so those jobs still remain low paying and those immigrants while probably better off then in the original country are sill poor, meaning it increases the amount of poverty, while also allowing companies to keep wages the same.
Those jobs aren't getting people because of low wages, both child and immigrants were don't care about that since well kids don't realize the value of the dollar and those immigrants a lot of them are earning more then from their home countries.
There are 2 million fewer people than jobs currently and the people pushing child labor are anti-immigration, so...
