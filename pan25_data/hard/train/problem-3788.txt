This is for the United States.. Nobody gives a shit about the US when this is about Germany.
And in Germany, IG Metall - the largest Metal working Union in Europe - hammered out Salaries for all major car manufacturers in Germany apart from Tesla.
And Tesla pays 20% less.
I mean duh, if you pay 20% less than other car companies, in one of the most competitive fields in Germany - car making - whilst Germany is experiencing a worker shortage & record low unemployment, i can't see a reason to work at Tesla.
Who would have thought that Tesla, a company notorious for its anti-union practices, would flounder in Germany, a country known for its strong unions and strong labour laws.

I don't give a shit about their US rates, the article is talking, again, about Germany, where Tesla has to compete against German employers.
Tesla is an American Company that isn't used to German standards.
And if you underpay your staff & behave as they do right now, Tesla Germany will be another Walmart Germany - which spectacularly failed in Germany.
We had people at my old company, that commuted every day from Berlin to Hamburg.
With the ICE highspeed train, that's a 1h 50m ride.
When i use public transport from outside of Hamburg to Hamburg - a measly 40km - i need an hour.
