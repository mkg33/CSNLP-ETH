The US has a mental health issue, not a gun one.
Most gun deaths are due to suicide, people don't need a gun to commit suicide.
US does not have that much more violence compared to most countries.
That does not mean I don't believe in reasonable gun control measures like storage requirements, expanded background checks, all transfers through checks, waiting periods with longer waiting periods for those who don't take yearly classes, etc...
I mean it's important to me in that this country has been taking away gun rights for years.
I would like the federal government to step in to help in the state of Washinon, where they are considering a horrendously unconstitutional AWB.
Many countries suppressors are not regulated.
The US needs to loosen gun laws as we have seen recent major shootings in some of the strictest states like California.
In case you're being serious, you should know that states with the loosest gun laws have the most shootings & murders per capita.
Guns make us less safe.
Full stop.
Voters have been brainwashed by years of NRA, Republican, & gun manufacturer propaganda & desensitized by the many mass shootings we've had... we're fucked.
Why tf does it matter how or why the shootings occurred?!
Just so gun fetishists can feel better about their deadly hobby.. ðŸ¤” If more than 3 people were shot in an incident, it's a mass shooting... not too difficult.
The amount of mass shootings has increased... a lot.
Their fear is justified.
