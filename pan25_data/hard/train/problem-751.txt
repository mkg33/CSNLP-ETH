No.
There are only additional safeguards in a form that two key decisions happen at the top of prosecution pyramid.
Specifically, two key points: start of an investigation and indictment (we are years after both of them).
Beyond those two points everything is as for any other citizen.

While the accused have to right to be present, for such cases it is very rarely that one wants and even rarer that he must.
E.g.
in a couple of years of the trial, Netanyahu was required to be present for something like a few hours.
In addition to that, Netanyahu was present for another 5 or so days, because he wanted (or probably because his lawyers wanted).
But what is way more important, is that majority of Israelis knowing very well what he is on trial for, decided that this is a not a reason to ignore presumption of innocence.
This is called democracy.
The funny thing is, this is exactly democracy.
While the majority in cities such as Tel Aviv voted against, you had many that voted for.
Israel has a voting system where multiple parties compete and the one with the most votes wins.
What this leads to is the socially liberal vote getting split between competing similar candidates and Bibi getting elected with a minority of the vote, and implementing minority (Conservative) rule.
Basically, Bibi is trying to replicate the situation in the US, where the SC is clearly divided into right wing and left wing judges, is highly political and vote according to whatever president nominated them.
So in a way, Trump already had (and heavily exploited) the system that Bibi is trying to create.
