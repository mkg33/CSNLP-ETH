Seems like someone is abusing their government power by instructing their staff to find evidence against a political opponent they do not like...if only the GOP and their supporters understood simple concepts like irony.
To the bold: This is another standard GOP talking point about "abuse of power", they'll argue everything has to go through Congress no matter how small.
This ignores the fact that entities like the FCC, FTC, IRS were created by Congress to manage specific forms of governing (Communications, Trade, Taxes) so Congress isn't bogged down with every little detail.
They act as extensions of Congress and the Executive branches.
Additionally because of how the House and Senate are currently split right now, any potential new legislation on a bill to get rid of Non-competes which benefits Republicans and big business because the rules will remain the same.
We need an FTC with teeth to protect us from monopolies and more importantly Mega-Corporations from forming and getting larger.
If the GOP is all about the free market then they should be happy with getting rid of the non-compete because it means more start ups can take on the big guys in established markets.
They'd want to break up Hollywood so there's more studios, etc.
But Miss Wilson here doesn't agree with this direction apparently.
I don't understand how this is a conflict of interest that requires recusal.
Khan was appointed to the commission in June 2021, the Meta purchase and FTC blocking was announced last summer.
Now if this merger was announced, and Khan made her statements and was then assigned to the head of the FTC and they announced the blocking, that could be a conflict of interest.
