That's quite tragic from a European perspective.
Here probably the most stereotypically observant Christian country in Western Europe is Malta ("more Catholic than the Pope"), and in the Maltese language God is literally called Alla.
And yes, the Bible begins in Malta with "Fil-bidu Alla ħalaq is-sema u l-art: u kienet l-art taħwid u baħħ; u d-dlam kien fuq wiċċ l-abbissi u fuq wiċċ l-ibħra kien jittajjar l-ispirtu ta’ Alla.
".
Huh.
Never heard of this organization, Faithful America, but they sound like… actual Christians.
Their About Us page says they got tired of sitting by and watching Christian Nationalists and White Supremacists hijack Christ’s message and turn it into a hateful political agenda, which sounds about right.
Their motto is “Love Thy Neighbor: No Exceptions.”.
Because of the people they’re fighting against, it’s been a very long time since I’ve identified with Christianity in the US.
Whether or not you believe that Jesus is the son of god, whether or not you believe there is a god… I think most good people can agree that his message is a good one.
This group is not only taking the fight to individual politicians like trump and MTG, but they’ve got petitions to Congress to pass the Respect For Marriage Act and to end the Federal Death Penalty.
They claim to have had “success” with other petitions, so I figured “why not?” and signed the one disavowing trump’s candidacy.
For now.
I’ll probably go back, because they focus on social justice issues that the other “Christians” are trying to stomp into the ground.
