It is very easy right now to denounce Russia.
Even those who are sympathetic to the oligarchs and their wealth hoarding.
Russian refugees into neighbouring baltic countries is clearly a national security issue (because Putin can and will use it as an excuse to Tey and annex territory from bordering countries).
So yeah, Russians have an incredibly strong presence/influence in Estonia and efforts to integrate them (as opposed to them just carving out their own Russian community inside Estonia) are dog whistled as Russophobia and mistreatment which is bullshit.
As usual though, there are plenty of Russians that come/came to Estonia that have happily integrated and became Russian-Estonians/Estonian-Russians but they tend to send their kids to Estonian schools, learn the language, don't vote for the Russian party (Centre party), and don't fucking support the invasion.
As said elsewhere here; Many were forced to relocate against their will and then, a bit ironically, found themselves in another, not overly friendly country, but still choosing to stay and considering themselves as being Russians, but not willing to move back because their country is still worse than being a part of an unpopular minority in Estonia.
It is also worth considering that a sizeable chunk of Russian speakers did not voluntarily immigrate during soviet occupation, but were voluntold or shipped here in an effort by the regime to saturate and phase out local culture and language.
Large Russian speaking population yes, however most consider themselves Estonian with Russian cultural heritage, which is vastly different than considering themselves ex-patriated Russians.
