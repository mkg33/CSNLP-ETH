>The Grand Jury heard extensive testimony on the subject of alleged election fraud from poll workers, investigators, technical experts, and State of Georgia employees and officials, as well as from persons still claiming that such fraud took place.
We find by a unanimous vote that no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election.
This report is from a grand jury on a massive racketeering investigation into Trump and crew for their attempts to influence/overturn the election in Georgia.
It includes the "find me 11,780 votes" phone call, other similar phone calls, false statements made to the Georgia legislature, intimidation of election workers, and the fake elector scheme.
Even more than perjury, Iâ€™m thinking recorded conversations amongst officials and the fake electors and stuff, especially if they cut a deal with any of the fake electors to flip.
See: all the new trump cookie cutter women now using fake news, witch hunt, stolen election, liar, as their whole entire fucking persona to get the repard vote.
And if they did read it right, it would be "fake news owned by libs" and "witch hunt after our greatest prez ever" and "libs trying to destroy America by criminalizing the act of being republican" or whatever dumb bullshit they can come up with.
