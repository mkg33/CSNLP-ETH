Well we just came off 8 years of Doug Ducey diverting every dollar he could away from public schools.
But the GOP mostly send their kids to private schools so only Dems care about that.
Well in this case if Trump’s picks for Governor and Secretary of State had won, Arizona would have no longer been a democracy.
We would have had to change our name to Trumpazona.
Yes but they take money away from public schools and they can reject students like special needs leaving those programs underfunded in public schools that have to accept everyone.
I have been surprised at the number of young MAGA voters.
More than age it seems to be a function of educational attainment or urban vs rural.
Look at Prescott….75% voter turnout and that’s not retirees.
They will, as the elderly white voters die demographics will move AZ deeper blue.
The GOP know this so they do everything possible to hold that off.
Close polling places in areas that vote democratic, try to limit early voting that helps working people and students but not retirees, send cosplay army men to drop boxes.
Still the tide washes in and won’t be stopped.
Kelly, Hobbs, Fontes, likely Mayes.
