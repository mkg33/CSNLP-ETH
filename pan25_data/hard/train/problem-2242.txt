The difference here is, the documents in Biden's possession appear to have been left at these locations inadvertently, and the moment they were found, they self-reported and sought to return them to the National Archives.
They found about a dozen documents with Biden that were located in an office and a garage with nothing to indicate the information was used maliciously, plus Biden’s team immediately returned the docs and are aiding the investigation and special counsel.
I believe this should be investigated if for no other reason than clearing up any national security concerns, but let’s not act like Biden’s and Trump’s cases are even close to the same thing.
I think so- they're going to a full transparent investigation and assessment of the danger and culpability, and Biden will probably come out of it just fine.
To boot, Biden and his administration are letting the investigation proceed as it should, and Democratic lawmakers are saying an investigation is warranted.
Meanwhile, Trump is attacking the Special Counsel looking into his theft of classified documents, constantly attaching the FBI and DOJ, while claiming it's all a with hunt.
