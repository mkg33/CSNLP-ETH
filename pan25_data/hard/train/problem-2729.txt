You are very incorrect in your assessment.
The only opinion I am tryin to voice - is that you should read news posted on a news subreddit.
In regards to sway public opinion - this was a comment in regards why someone would dub their adversaries nuclear missile Satan.
Man, it'd be wild if Christian prophecy was referencing a nuclear missle named Satan instead of you know Biblical Satan...
John chuckled to himself, thinking about how ridiculous it would be if Christian prophecy was actually referencing a weapon of mass destruction instead of the Biblical Satan.
"I'd much rather this be a comic than real life," he thought to himself.
Finally, after months of tireless investigation, John stumbled upon a tantalizing piece of information.
It was a cryptic message, posted on a forum by a user who claimed to have inside knowledge of the Satan missile.
Tracking down the user who had posted the cryptic message about the Satan missile proved to be a difficult task, but John was nothing if not determined.
He spent countless hours following leads and gathering information, determined to find the person who held the key to unlocking the mystery.
Finally, after months of tireless investigation, John was able to trace the message back to its source.
It led him to a small, nondescript office building on the outskirts of town, where he found himself standing in front of a plain metal door with a handwritten sign that read "John Smith.
".
True.
Last year I took two long(ish) breaks but had trouble waiting in between.
So, this year I decided to just take as many Fridays off as I could.
Got a bunch of three day weekends out of it but I think the burnout is even worse.
IDK.
