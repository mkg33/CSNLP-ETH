I read speculation that Putin has finally realized that his campaign of terror involving missiles and drones is A: not having the desired effect and B: depleting their reserves to an unacceptable degree against an increasingly reliable air defense.
So with any luck they'll give up on that tactic entirely.
Seems optimistic to me.
Russia is surely crumbling but it's going to be a long, drawn out process that won't kick into high gear until after military defeat begins to loom on the horizon.
If instead Russia suffers a decisive military defeat in the next 12 months, ousts Putin and makes nice with the West, they'll probably be able to coast along having lost "only" 20 years of progress.
While we must not underestimate any gains from Russia either, as they would have to be retaken sooner or later, it is worth noting that after the liberation of Kherson Russian control over Ukraine has fallen to 18.00%.
The quesiton is - do these operations tie up so much of Ukraine's own manpower and weaponry that IT also cant make up ground (the answer so far is yes - Ukraine might actually have lost ground on net since Russia left Kherson.
).
Yes - strategically its more or less meaningless.
It makes it easier to encircle Bakhmut.
But Bahkmut itself isnt that meaningful.
It doesnt cut off any Ukranian supply lines or anything.
Its just a good place for Ukraine to set up a defensive front, and if it goes, they will move to the netx one back.
