I hate this dude.
I have covid and it fucking sucks right now.
I have at the vaccine and 2 boosters.
I could not imagine taking this shit on without these vaccines.
I got all my vaccines as a kid (and have been through all the covid shots as well, and get my flu shot every year.
I'm even in a clinical trial for a lyme vaccine currently).
I like to ask antivax folks if they think my dad loved me so little that he would put these allegedly harmful things in my body to support a conspiracy that was only making us upper middle class rather than fabulously wealthy when he was smart and educated enough to make 2-3x as much if he stopped being a professor.
Do they really think the members of this conspiracy are risking their own health and the health of their families to maintain an income that allows them to by used domestic cars and 3 bedroom houses?
The first question for every member of the science community brought to the grand jury should be "Are you and your children vaccinated against covid" If yes, they clearly believe it's effective, or at a minimum not dangerous.
You really don't need anything more than that to tear down the entire premise of this attack, but that won't matter because of the idiocy that has invaded our political system and the politicisation of our judicial system.
My dad was a medical researcher.
He didn't work on vaccines, but he was precisely the kind of person who must have been part of all the conspiracies the antivax (and other medical conspiracies) crowd has to believe in to justify their views.
