Granted it's only the word of one politic analyst, but the mere fact this can be said out loud in Russia is deeply unsettling imo, nuclear weapon or not.
I said months ago, that the propability, that a substantial amount of nuclear weapons in Russias control are duds is higher than the propability that a lot of putins complexes stem from the fact that he is a absolute manlet.
Until last year the US inspected their warheads as did russia inspect ours it was a treaty, they absolutely have working nukes, this joke that russias nukes dont work needs to die,do the have the 5,000 nukes they proclaim, most likely not but they have enough to still ensure mutual destruction.
New nuclear warhead designs are simulated by supercomputers these days as even (especially really) Russia abides by the comprehensive test ban treaty.
Don’t let Russia’s scaremongering get to you, your fear is their real prize.
Nuclear weapons (ICBMs, cruise missiles, torpedoes) are never tested with a live warhead on board.
Even just losing a dud at the bottom of the ocean is more risk than it’s worth.
