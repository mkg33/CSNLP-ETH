I think we should, but not for McCarthy.
Make them give us chairpersons on every committee and the most liberal Republican in the House will get tepid Dem support for Speaker.
Only thing I see working is a mod-repub / Democrat deal where a moderate republican is speaker and democrats get some committee positions.
Why don't the democrats offer seats on the rules committee to 6 moderate republicans for their vote?
The rules committee has 13 members.
I'd thing there would be 6 moderate republicans out there that would be for this deal.
There are 4 more republicans than democrats in the house.
20-ish republicans are voting against McCarthy.
All of the democrats are voting for their guy but a majority is required.
So nobody wins, the House has no leader and another vote must be held.
The election was decided in November so youâ€™d think the republicans would have met at least once in the last few months to decide who they were gonna vote for.
Generally this is all decided on the first vote for that reason.
