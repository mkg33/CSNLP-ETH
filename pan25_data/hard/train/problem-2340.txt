If it was as simple as "stupid people gonna stoop", that would be much easier to digest.
But it's actually a very nuanced and complex social interaction that ensnares people looking for identity and a sense of community.
I take umbridge with this statement - we know from psychology research that intelligence is not enough to prevent someone from falling for cult tactics / outlandish conspiracy theories.
So I would amend your statement to say, instead: "They're using the same strategy; exploiting the emotionally vulnerable.

Because it's not presented as such.
You don't go to your first OT class and read a story about space aliens.
Their whole concept is about cleansing yourself from negative energy, thereby allowing to do anything you put your mind to.
When you put it that way, doesn't it sound a LOT like 99% of self-help stuff?
That kind of description even overlaps with things like meditation and the likes.
In reality, Scientology will slowly brainwash its adherents - and here's the scary part - then teach them to do it to themselves.
It's scary shit.
It's done so very slowly while giving the member a HUGE sense of belonging which is hard to push away when you're vulnerable.

But saying Mexico makes it sound like he bombed the mainland or something populated.
At least that's how it comes across to me.
I'd rather specify that it was an island.
Gotta be careful with assuming cult members are all morons.
It's a lot of emotional manipulation when it comes to cults.
We're all potentially susceptible unless you're told about the warning signs.
Not to say there aren't stupid people in there too, but you can be a genius and still fall into a cult.
