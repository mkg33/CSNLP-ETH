It would be an attack on another country.
Giving them an excuse to enter the war.
Even if Ukraine already considers them a participant in the war.
The important part is the fact, that Belarus thinks it is not.
Wanting to stay neutral-isch.
So Ukraine will be careful in attacking them \[or anything on their territory\] in order for them not to shift this sentiment, which would be opening a two-front war again.
It really does seem like Russia is going to try another offensive to take Kyiv in the coming months.
The absolute fucking fools.
All that this will accomplish is a bloodbath as every Russian troop is cut down and killed as soon as they step foot over the border from Belarus into Ukraine.
The area south of the Belarus border in Ukraine is very well fortified, and the troops in Belarus are pretty much infantry.
If the tried to go into Ukraine, it would be a mind-bogglingly brutal slaughter of Russian infantry.
They’d be fodder in the truest sense of the term.
Either Russian intends to formally annex Belarus, or they are going to intentionally sacrifice the majority of their forces there, perhaps as a stunt to justify other escalations to the Russian people.
If another couple hundred thousand Russians learn that their brothers and fathers died in Ukraine and TV’s got you convinced they’re the aggressors, suddenly everyone will be keen on fighting indefinitely with the most expensive resources and destroying the economy to do it.
