We will happily help them secure their freedom, but let's not make light of what this war costs for the People of Ukraine.
I can see a future with a Europe that is whole and able to defend herself alone, standing shoulder to shoulder with America as equals sharing the load as we perpetuate not American or European, but Western Hegemony over Planet Earth.
For all the bickering and arguing, we Americans see Europeans as Brothers and helping them stand strong benefits everyone.
Tbh Americans and Europeans arguing has always been more like two brothers arguing who’s the better one, we don’t hate each other and are willing to help each other but neither will ever admit that their measurement system is worse than the other lmao.
We will get there eventually don’t worry we are currently busy fucking over mega corporations before they take over the world, dealing with global warming on our end, helping Ukraine as much as we can both military and legally as much as we can and trying to eliminate any dumb conservative leaders left so our countries can get along better, it’s a long process because there are a LOT of countries but we will get there.
