1) Germany is the second biggest supporter of Ukraine, so Germany is a very dangerous player for Russia.
So you have a smear campaign from Russian bots against Germany.
3) German diplomacy is "speak softly and carry a big stick".
It doesn't really make good headlines as German politicians rather DO than just BRAG about it, like for example Poland.
These are all reasons why you might see a lot of negative news about Germany and why you seem to have a wrong perception of the situation.
Yes, Germany didn't always make everything right but I think the amount of criticism (especially the amount of misplaced criticism and just fake news) is undeserved and quite frankly annoying.
That being said, I can't help but think that comments that, from anywhere else, would be rightly dismissed as "well, there's some idiots everywhere" are being seen by some as an indictment for all of Germany recently for some reason.
It's like people remember any critical comment by the most irrelevant politicians sons friends cat, but have amnesia regarding Germanys contributions.
