THAT is how bad it was and continues to be, it's no wonder the Russians are losing the way they are, it's unsustainable.
Now that it's likely going to end in a failure, that could mean the end of Russia forever.
Some new country is going to emerge out of this catastrophe, probably sometime in the 2030s.
The theory goes that Russia is going to lose significant portions of its male populace by the end of the 2020s and therefore, they needed to invade by the early to mid-2020s so that they can acquire land, people, and resources.
Both sides wil have enormous losses, the demographics curve is kaputt for decades for all involved, russias was already (almost) beyond fixable before the war started.
Is it me or is the Ukrainian military only becoming more and more effective at annihilating Russians as this war goes on while the Russians are becoming worse at it?
Must be the chained elephant syndrome.
You keep a baby elephant tied to a stake from birth, soon enough it’ll never even occur to it to escape or be free.
Russians rolling in crap tanks and armored personnel carriers with rusting AK47, little ammo, no food, no body armor, no cold weather clothing, no medical support or even medikits.
Yeah I’d be feeling like my country expects me dead in a Ukrainian field within a week.
Not exactly a good place to be mood wise.
You can still root for Ukraine and not be all into dead poor Russians.
I mean the Russians have a better shot at toppling their own government than taking on the biggest deployment of modern American and European weapons systems operated by a highly motivated Ukrainian Military.
