Could work, I honestly thought he retired and didn't run in 2022 though, so I was thinking Chris Smith.
Fred Upton would be fine though.
I mean we are not getting a democrat, wishing aside, and a semi-sane Republican who doesn't want to burn the country down would be a welcome improvement on what I assumed we were getting.
We don’t need them to back a democrat, we need them to be petty and decide they’ll take their ball and go home and/or get back at their enemy by voting present.
Obviously, the times have been a changin', but the point stands, a non-elected citizen running the House is wild idea, especially to the the 430 some odd people who are elected to the House.
I don't see this garnering enough support from either side of the aisle, much less both.
For all the talk of how nothing states the Speaker of the House must be a sitting member, for the entire history of the United States, that has been the case.
Hard to imagine that breaking now, even with all of this craziness.
Yeah after the last decade, making a bunch of back-room deals for speaker votes and then backing down on every last one of them is what I'd expect, even if he's "one of the better ones".
Meh, in like 1855 they had 133 failed votes for Speaker, keeping the House unsat for like, two months.
