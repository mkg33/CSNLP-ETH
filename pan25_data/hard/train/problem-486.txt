This is more common than people think.
When I got in trouble I agreed to go to “rehab” but nobody told me that the director of said rehab enjoys leaving people in jail till she feels like dealing with it.
Some people sat in there 3-6 months past their release date then had to go do the 6 months of a scam rehab then their 6 months “outpatient” care.
It was all a scam for money.
The only reason I got out on my release date is my family and having a lawyer call asking why they had 6 months to plan to pick me up and couldn’t handle that.
If they didn’t pick me up I would have been removed from work pod and went into felony holding with people not even charged or not trust worthy enough for work pod.
That’s sketchy because fresh inmates will try and get a short timer in some shit.
This system is fucked.
Incredibly fucked up.
If you're interested in learning more there's a really good documentary called 13th.
It was on Netflix but I dont know if it still is.
Its obviously sad but I'd highly recommend it.
If you mean how do they force them if they refuse, they'll punish them in a variety of ways including loss of privileges, solitary confinement, and parole denial.
Yeah.
Its perfectly legal to force prisoners to work in most states (and in 5 states they do this and pay them nothing).
13th amendment has a part that says something along the line of slavery is illegal except as punishment for a crime.
Slavery is legal in America as long as there is due process, according to the 14th amendment.
That's why the 13th and 14th were put in at the same time.
The 13th abolished chattel slavery and the 14th provided a mechanism to put black people back into bondage, just with more steps.
