That's less independent and more ignorant.
There's nothing really new about what's going on than there was 20+ years ago.
It's just gotten to the point they couldn't ignore it.
Still kudos to them though for finally voting for something other than the worst option.
It's sad that that's something we need to acknowledge and praise.
But that's where we are.
Yep.
They're also pushing the idea that Biden (either now or as VP) was using his power to help his children make money overseas and maybe pocket some himselves.
I suppose the argument is that they received foreign funds, and are thus are risk of threats from foreign entities which could conflict with President Biden's responsibilities?
Why ask me?
Are you suggesting I find the behavior justified?
It's very clearly hypocritical if that's the argument, when it was actively ignored under previous circumstances.
Yeah.
Obviously the attention is hypocritical.
Was just making sure I understood the concerns a reasonable person would have if they expressed their concern reasonably across the political spectrum.
