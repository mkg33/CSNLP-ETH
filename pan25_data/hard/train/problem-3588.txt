These countries are using Russian weapons largely because of their history with the US.
The US has already given what few operational Russian weapon systems it had to Ukraine.
Why is the US doing this trade?
Because Ukraine predominately uses Russian weapons and it makes sense from a training and logistics stand point to continue to supply them when able.
1) Because Russian made weapons are easier for Ukraine to operate and maintain since these are the same weapons they use, are trained on and have the supply and logistics capability already in place for.
Profits are certainly part of the goal....the MIC is booming right now and this is the time for those industries to target their growth and achieve their business goals...it's a shame, but that's how a capitalist society works.
Reducing global reliance on Russia is a net win for everyone right now though.
