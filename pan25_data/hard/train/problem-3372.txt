"Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War have found no evidence that russian forces have regained sufficient combat power to defeat Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine and capture more than 11,300 square kilometers of unoccupied Donetsk region by March, as putin allegedly ordered," -the report said.
I recall thinking Russia would invade and control most of Ukraine in weeks but then would lose to a western backed insurgency.
Have to love Putin crying about 'fAciNg gErMNAn tAnKs agAiN' when they're literally only being used by Ukrainians, to repel an invasion of Ukraine he ordered.
Ah yes, surely the ukrainians did something and… gasp… defied the country that messed with their internal affairs, took over a part of the country, supported criminal warlords, sent undercover soldiers and equipment to fight against the ukrainian state.
Surely the ukrainians are to blame for the destruction, after all they shelled their russian speakibg civilians and killed 14000, there is a UN report about it (which states the 14000 is made up of more that 10000 combatants).
They even killed 20 (!)
people the last few years, what an outrage, using mostly land mines.
