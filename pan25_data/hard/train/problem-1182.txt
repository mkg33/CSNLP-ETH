US DOD announced months ago in a press conference that they consider military targets in Russia and Belarus (as well as territiry claimed by Russia) from which attacks on Ukraine originate to be acceptable targets.
Which is why UA should be allowed to attack those launch sites so Russia can't as easily bomb Ukraine's civilization infrastructure in petty retaliatory strikes.
How fucking stupid is it that Ukraine isn't allowed to hit military targets in Russia while Russia hits nearly exclusively civilian infrastructure in Ukraine?
The idea that Russia will dare attack a NATO country because Ukraine uses NATO supplied weapons is simply laughable chicken little shit.
They might be spouting a lot of bullshit propaganda, but they know NATO can curb stomp their military in a matter of days.
There is no way in hell that Russia dares target any NATO target absent direct NATO involvement in Ukraine.
And even if that happened it would still be doubtful that they would dare hit targets inside actual NATO territory.
Putin _might_ be able to sell a withdrawal from Ukraine.
He would not survive setting Russia on a suicidal course.
