PS.
Maybe we should change the name of hıyars because calling some Istanbulites that name is actually an insult to the vegetable.
Your arguments about the bird are baseless.
Erdoğan did this to score political points at home and it's not even working - except for a few people like you, nobody cares or even knows about the change.
That change is for official matters at the UN btw.
Erdoğan can send as many people as he wants in prison, it's not going to change the English language.
Oh I see you're "Türkiyeish" and proud of agreeing with Erdogan BUT JUST THIS ONCE, right ?
wink wink .
As a conclusion, I demand that from now on you change the Turkish language and call Fransa Frrrr[an]ce, Almanya Deutschland, İspanya España and Çin 中国.
No ?
That's what I thought.
I hope you have a nice day in Turkey despite what's going on and I'm not just talking about the earthquake.
My heart goes out to the poor people of Turkey 🙏 I can only imagine the terror of 2 separate large quakes!
Hopefully we can get help there soon.
