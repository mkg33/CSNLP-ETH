Jesus, this headline is stupid.
The Postal Service is not a private company, it is part of the Government.
It's like saying Homeland Security operates at a loss, or the IRS, the TSA, National Park System or the Armed Forces.
They all operate at a loss, even the IRS captures only a small portion of what they could be getting back for the government, but they still operate at a loss.
Consider the source and why they would mislead people by declaring that a service industry paid for by taxpayers “operates at a loss”.
However true that may be... its a ridiculous headline and an implied expectation that a government service should be profitable.
The DOD operates at a $780B loss year over year.
Police and Fire Departments, DOT, DHS, FBI... they all operate at a loss.
Is the police and fire department also operating at a loss or so they provide profit?
What about the military?
These are all public goods.
Their loss is due to them accounting for pensions/retirement plans up front versus when they actually happen like with every other business.
Heck, who still offers pension plans?
