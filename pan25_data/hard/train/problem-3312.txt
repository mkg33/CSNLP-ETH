There are plenty of unauthorized construction done all the time.
But usually the IDF comes tearing it down or disperses people before they can really make progress on anything.
So now that we clarified that public opinion shapes Israeli policy on settlements, we can get straight to the point - After over a hundred years of conflict, and after many peace deals with Arab states, the only ones who refuse to make peace with Israel are the Palestinians.
And with no prospects of peace, how exactly do you convince the Israeli people that these territories, full of economical opportunity, should remain untapped?
You could also say that Israel does nothing on their side to indicate they really want to build their own country peacefully alongside Palestine.
This is why they still have no real state today, and there is very little chance they ever will have a real state.
The best outcome for them is to be absorbed by the US.
Itâ€™s time to turn the page and move on.
Palestine is not going away and the Israelis need to accept it.
Even they've accepted it, nothing is stopping Israel from stealing more, oppress them.
Fuck the state of Apartheid Israel and all the Israeli thieves.
I don't blame the Palestinians fighting back in anyway they can against those thieves.
