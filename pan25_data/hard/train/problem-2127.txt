The US can do what they want.
And the EU can also do what they want.
In this case the EU tells the US that they would respond with also protecting their own economy against American products.
However maybe the US reconsiders if they make an exception for the EU in return for the EU also not sanctioning American products.
Would be beneficial for both sides.
There are surprisingly few real democracies in the world.
Maybe they should stick together.
Otherwise the winner would be the dictatorships of the world.
It simply is a warning.
The US can do what they want.
Germany is simply warning the US that the EU will implement counter measures against the US.
It is entirely up to the US if they want to do it anyway.
That's just one part of what the US gets out of it.
What does the US military industrial complex get out of this arrangement?
Every base outside the US requires staffing above and beyond what would be needed for a solely home defense force.
So we have a much larger military than we would need minus our world wide reach.
And every one of them needs soldiers who must be equipped, it needs weapons and vehicles, none of which are cheap, and, as Russia has so aptly demonstrated, you need to churn your older, unused equipment lest it rot away, or even become just less combat effective.
So, you must replace all of the above from time to time.
A lucrative venture that results in defense industry kick backs to politicians to keep the good times rolling.
