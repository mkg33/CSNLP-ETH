Oh god, conserve lions so wealthy Americans and Euro's can kill them.
Just continue with traditions, those lions are going to be killed anyway by the richest Donors.
Why are people ok with this, killing lions should be fine, as it is their territory.
Maybe if foreigners didn't come and hunt on this tribes turf then they could keep their way of life.
So done man.
I believe that natives should be allowed to hunt and that there's a wider issue, and history, of Asians and Europeans poaching animals in Africa that is not being addressed in the comments.
It's silly to pretend that these kind of issues are clearly only the result of colonialism and that the noble local population would have never been a threat to the lion population.
As everywhere else during industrialization/modernization, the population of Africa has boomed, more people = less space = local fauna getting pushed out.
What I disagree with is that the modern medicine population boom (that every society experience at some point) should be "blamed" on colonialism.
Modern medicine is a good thing, and society adopts it voluntarily once theey're able to access it.
Africa was always going to have a population boom eventually.
And that comes with new challenges (such as no longer having enough lions for every youth to hunt one).
It's also less dangerous to take part in a sporting event instead of trying to hunt a lion.
Modern warfare is never going to involve fighting a lion with traditional weapons so it doesn't really make sense as a right of passage anymore anyway.
