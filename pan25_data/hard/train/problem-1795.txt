SAME!
I thought maybe by “shanty” towns they meant some tents like you see on streets in some Canadian and American cities or run down communist-era apartment blocks like you see in Eastern Europe or the beat up Banlieues of France — but nope, that’s a legit shanty town like you’d see in a contemporary Third World hellhole or a Great Depression-era Western country, and a massive-looking one at that.

No, there is absolutely no comparison between a small homeless encampment under a highway consisting of tents and piles of trash which is periodically cleared by police raids and may only last a couple years before moving elsewhere, with what is essentially an ad-hoc neighborhood with large brick buildings and apartments containing thousands of residents, small businesses, churches, schools, etc that by now are 50 to 70 years old or older.
Me neither — I thought maybe by “shanty” towns they meant some tents like you see on streets in some Canadian and American cities or run down communist-era apartment blocks like you see in Eastern Europe or the beat up Banlieues of France — but nope, that’s a legit shanty town like you’d see in a contemporary Third World hellhole or a Great Depression-era Western country, and a massive-looking one at that.
What makes this even more remarkable is that South Korea doesn’t exactly have a bunch of asylum seekers or immigrants down on their luck like places in North America or Europe, so the vast majority of these people are probably their own citizens.
In addition, drug use and availability in South Korea is also a fraction of what it is in the West, so it’s not like these are methed-out crazies or needle-poking zombies like you might see in Vancouver, Berlin or Los Angeles — these are probably mostly just normal people facing hard times.
It’s crazy and sad, but South Korea was poorer than colonial Congo within living memory as late as the 60s so I guess it makes sense a part of it is still a festering shithole.
I guess when you look closer their economy is pretty much just Samsung, K-Pop, and cheap cars that knockoff Western and Japanese models.
