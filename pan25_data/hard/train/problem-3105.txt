I'm not OP so I'm not going to make value judgments of what he thinks or why.
I disagree with him.
I was only pointing out that the part of the post being quoted by maximum_effort was about Hillary claiming reports about Bill were a right wing conspiracy and their response was about benghazi.
They aren't going to look at PPP fraud.
They literally made the law and deliberately stripped out the oversight so they could get away with the fraud.
What they will investigate is why so many loans that haven't been forgiven or have been deemed fraudulent are Republicans, and claim it's a political hit job.
I don't know how much more vast or right-wing you can get than the Republican Speaker of the House abusing his power to invent phony, two faced investigations into Hillary Clinton for the purpose of destroying her political career.
It would be far weirder if the party in power of congress opposite to the presidents party didn’t conduct any investigations.
As I already said before, I don’t think congress should really be investigating crimes.
They’re n out law enforcement.
That should just reside with the DOJ and FBI.
