The games were along the lines of getting the children to walk next to the military locations and pin them.
Kinda like Pokemon Go, except using children to identify and reliably mark the location.
I believe some of the games even had them take pictures.
This is just another charge of the same operation/behavior from earlier in the war.
There are complete write-ups if you look back on it.
They basically had the kids playing Pokemon Go with military equipment.
If you can find "XXX" vehicle and get a picture you get points or even real money.
Kids ate that stuff up and started walking all over areas looking for matches to the requests.
Tankies say it's brilliant, except this type of activity is extremely illegal and in total, I believe this is the sixth time a russian backed game aimed at children has been placed on markets in Ukraine.
How is playing call of duty, or any other FPS, comparable to actively getting Ukrainian children to spy for the Russians?
Here, Ukrainian children are being tricked to spy for the Russians, while the information provided is likely to be used for artillery, sabotage, or assault planning.
Come on.
“🇷🇺 tried to use 🇺🇦 children to unknowingly provide information about the location of strategically important objects through a mobile game.
This is not just a dirty trick, it’s a war crime.”.
Your other comment in here says “Literally the first thing any mobilized soldier says is "it's nothing like shooting games".
“… so I’m pretty sure we agree.
Yup.
My goal was to put two Scorpion tanks in the cave, angle them correctly on that center rock, and they'd wiggle and never respawn.
From there, I'd throw some Ghosts on top, the Banshees on top, and the Warthogs underneath the tanks.
Throw in a few grenades for good measure, and they're never re-spawning .
