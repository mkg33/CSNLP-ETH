As a Nevada resident, I actually like that we have to vote on measures twice.
It prevents a minority party from introducing a ballot measure during a relatively low turnout midterm and then pointing to that as they use it to make unpopular (but difficult to reverse) changes.
This won't really benefit either party, not really, but it WILL benefit the American people because it will moderate everyone, it will no longer be a binary choice between crazy/unacceptable people and we will get the consensus candidates, who will be someone we are all sort of ok with.
It allows the final result to more accurately represent the will of the people, you can safely vote for an independent if you want, and then your vote will go to who you would prefer from the major parties instead of being wasted.
RCV is better than FPTP, that's undeniable because it lets people cast a vote for a third party with he assurance it won't be thrown away by a meme/spoiler candidate.
Tennessee and Florida have actually already banned it, because they know!
