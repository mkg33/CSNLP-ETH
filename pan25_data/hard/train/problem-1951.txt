The US should be outfitting Poland with everything we can since they're probably going to be Russia's next target if Ukraine falls.
Hopefully Ukraine will be given plenty of werstern tanks for their next major offensives to blast ruzzian fascists with.
So what, they're also facing British, American, and Soviet tanks.
And this time the German tanks are being used to defend Ukraine, whereas last time they were used to invade it.
Also I hear Ukrainians say they're facing Russian tanks again, only the first time didn't happen 80 years ago, more like 8.
They didn't even switch sides cause they realized the Nazis were about to lose, they switched sides because they had no other choice after Hitler stabbed them in the back and literally invaded them out of the blue.
Russia would also be in deep trouble in a protracted war.
Their bid to starve Europe of energy into submission is failing and even backfiring, and they're losing troops and gear at an unprecedented rate, and now they seem unsure if they'll even make it a war of attrition since they're amassing troops and saying they're preparing for another offensive.
