This is a case that I often remember when dealing with genetically modified products The issue is not whether or not they are better crops, the issue is the intellectual property that these large companies hold.
Monsanto suing a small farmer for using genetically modified canola crops, went through the years and years of litigation before landing in the Canadian Supreme Court.
Although Schmeizer was eventually found guilty of using the Monsanto crops by 5 to 4 margin, any monetary damage by Monsanto was nullified.
Schmeiser maintained the whole time that he never used, purchased, or bought genetically modified seeds from Monsanto, and that the crops obtained the genetic traits strictly due to pollen from adjacent fields of other farmers.
Monsanto sued farmers who intentionally collected seed and used it, in most cases in fields previously planted with GM corn when they no longer wanted to pay for it.
Yeah and Monsanto/whatever they are called these days have lost a lot of those cases on the basis that they can never prove the farmers bought Monsanto corn, and farmers can't control hybridization.
But did you actually read the article?
this isn't just seeds they are banning, it is all GM corn, primarily human consumption.
That is a wee bit different.
It is NOT like anything else.
It is a living thing that reproduces and can invade your own crops whether you want it or not.
The company that owns the patent will sue you even if you didn't want their product.
This contributes to economic wars and concentration of wealth on big companies vs. small family owned farms.
