Hodgson, for example, lost because cities turned out against him, but he previously had strong suburban support.
You need either the Fall River or New Bedford vote to carry Bristol county, tho, and both went strongly against him.
Suburbs don't appear to have showed up well at all, tho, and Hodgson's hometown is a college town (Dartmouth) where youth vote was high and swung against him.
MA is more centrist than left, tbh, but far right does not survive.
Republicans have also been demonizing MA, even with a Republican governor, so I think they have completely demoralized the Republicans that are in MA, as well, potentially affecting turnout.
Republicans haven't had a majority in the Massachusetts state legislature since the 19 fucking 20s, so they figured (don't ask me how) that what Massachusetts voters really, truly, want, deep down in their restless souls, is to be more like Okie Homer.
MA is a blue state and although Charlie Baker was a pretty reasonable centrist Republican as governor (as was Mitt Romney, in his time) Massachusetts voters generally speaking don't put up with Republican bullshit.
The crazier the Republican party gets the less chance they have in a state that has, like, colleges and literacy and stuff.
