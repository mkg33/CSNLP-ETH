Let's remember that it's selfish billionaires threatening economic disaster because they're too ghoulish to share a tiny fraction of their dragon hoard with the people whose labor makes them that money in the first place.
But they can't do that The wealthy elite need all the money they can get, because they use it to make jobs for us commoners But, of course, if they actually make the jobs, then they have less money to make jobs with because they're stuck paying more workers.
So they can't actually make more jobs, because if they did they couldn't make more jobs.
Duh.
Yes.

You’re just interpreting what I’m saying incorrectly.

Whatever you want to say about it.
And maybe I did interpret your first argument incorrectly.
I can own that if that’s been the case.
Yes they do.
Everyone does.
I don't think Biden's choice was easy or heartless but a possible strike could have sent the economy on a nose dive which would have hurt most Americans.
That happening right before Xmas would have been harsh for us all.
All of these would be mute if congress would have put through legislation to see everyone has this but one party just won't budge.
