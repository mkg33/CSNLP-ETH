"I never understood wind.
You know, I know windmills very much.
I've studied better than anybody, you know it's very expensive.
They’re made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here almost none, but they’re manufactured tremendous if you’re into this, tremendous fumes.
Gases are spewing into the atmosphere.
You know we have a world, right?
So the world is tiny compared to the universe.
So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything.
And you see these magnificent fields and they're ruined, and you know what they don't tell you about windmills?
After ten years they look like hell.
You know they start to get tired and old, you gotta replace em a lotta times people don't replace em.
They need massive subsidy from the government in order to make it.
No we're doing it right, we're doing it right.
And you know our numbers, enviromentally, right now are better than they ever been before, just so you know.

"That's right.
I lead those brave men and women who know truth and justice.

It was as if I was there with them.
Wonderful.
All of us, wonderful.

Yeah.
He legit tried.
He praised and kissed the feet of damn near every dictator in the world and boasted about how jealous he was.
Don’t get me wrong, the man was still incompetent but he actually tried to steal power and made vague threats and installed yes men in as many political seats as he could.
He tried to have Pence removed from the capitol because he wouldn’t play ball and didn’t want him to certify the election.
