Sounds awfully similar to we have investigated ourselves and determined we did nothing wrong… can’t say the Supreme Court is corrupt when we legalize corruption!
Or maybe some laws, particularly those pertaining to bribery and corruption should be broadly written and liberally applied because it helps curb corruption.
This precedent has affected future and past corruption prosecutions.
The way to address this is simply by rewriting the federal bribery statutes to be clearer and more narrow and specific.
That's on Congress.
Yes exactly.
All of the issues you're describing are issues with sentencing and broad laws, where making the laws broader and more flexible to allow prosecutors to charge more people would make things much, much worse.
Broadly written three strikes laws that treat all convictions the same.
Broad laws that give unethical judges broad authority for sentencing.
And for example, the current state of this case.
Exactly.
The law should be objective, not subjective.
It should be applied strictly, not liberally.
You can't have everyone viewed equally under the law when the law is flexible.
Yes, the law is inflexible.
That's the idea.
It's objective.
An action has to fit the crime.
The crime doesn't get molded to fit an action.
That is how we ensure everyone is equal under the law.
If you can't prove that an action fits the law without making the law "flexible", then you specifically make that action illegal too.
