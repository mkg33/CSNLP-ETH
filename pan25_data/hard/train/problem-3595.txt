That's pretty much exactly what happened too.
Walker had a strong following among conservatives, but he came in with wrecking ball policies on day one which were incredibly divisive across the isle.
I don't believe Walker ever won a gubernatorial election by more than 5%, I'm pretty sure closer to about 10,000-40,000 votes (seems to be the amount of swing voters in Wisconsin).
Walker probably did a few good things in WI, raised the interstate speed limit to 70 (where appropriate) and restructured Government agencies to reduce redundancy (cutting costs).
Had he sat back and just did this, I might have supported him.
Scott Walker wasn't immensely popular (in Wisconsin).
I remember my dad saying to me, "He's legislating like he won this huge margin (and mandate), in truth it's a couple of percentage points.
Wisconsin is a purple State, if he doesn't moderate his tone, he's probably going to be gone in a few election cycles.
".
Yep.
McCain is well liked here even after his passing.
If McCain was still alive I bet his endorsement would be better than Trumps for local Republicans.
i feel like calling them "mccain republicans" is not quite right.
mccain would talk sense and say he was going to vote blue, and then vote red anyway.
these people actually followed through, unlike mccain.
