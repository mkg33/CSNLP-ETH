I don't recall that clusterfuck we'll, but I believe they didn't directly observe anything.
They interviewed a group of reporters or something, and everyone in the room disagreed with Amnesty's assessment, and mind you these people had just been on the front lines, but Amnesty ignored everything they said and ran with some bullshit that was largely fabricated, about Ukraine using human shields.
Also, do you think denouncing Russian war crimes makes this ridiculous, out of touch misinformation okay, when it represents the opposite of the realities on the ground per the information Amnesty received?
anybody who seriously thought that amnesty was somehow pro-russia has brain damage - they do 1 report on conventional military strategy employed by ukraine putting civilians in harms way and then everybody ignores the over 400 reports denouncing russia and claim amnesty is pro-russia.
Reddit hates Amnesty International now because they had the audacity to -- in between pointing out dozens of Russian war crimes -- also pointing out that some Ukrainian tactics endangered civilians.
If we're just talking about effects, they severely diluted their message by focusing on Ukraine's actions while defending against an invasian while Russia was engaging in the worst of war crimes.
They should've been more aware of weighing their criticisms fairly during a critical time.
Timing matters, and there wasn't really a good reason to criticize a country on the brink of annexation for their self-preservation efforts when you could spend that time critizing the actual annexation attempt.
