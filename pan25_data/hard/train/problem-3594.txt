I wonder how many Republicans are approaching committee members, behind closed doors, and offering to help as long as it stays quiet -- and totally and completely out of a 'respect for rule of law,' and nothing to do with self-interest.
Totally.
Exactly.
So many people keep bringing up that, if it were any ol US citizen, justice would have been served.
And yes, totally true, but TFG isn’t just any ol citizen.
He’s a former president and the right steps must be taken if the DoJ wants to really nail him.
Today is just one of those steps.
Edit: wanted to add that there’s no way this council is “meaningless”.
They’re bringing in a special prosecutor who is seemingly unbiased and highly qualified.
They’re doing this so the “politically driven” defense is not as effective in court.
If they brought in one of their own people, TFG can cry political party foul all day.
I understand the frustration, but I have a feeling this case(s) is far more complex than we know.
We’re talking about a former President here and it could be the most complex, sensitive case the DoJ has handled before.
So when looking at it in that context (not to mention we still have a global pandemic raging), 2 years is really not a long time.
If you don’t get the feeling or see that these steps are necessary and are building towards something, I’m not sure there’s anything I can say that’ll help with the frustration.
At the end of the day, it’s one hell of a complex case to unravel and it doesn’t help that TFG has been playing the system for half a century - it’s going to take time.
