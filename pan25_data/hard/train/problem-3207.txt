Intelligence agencies aren't spying about pandemics folks.
The world has many interacting medical based organizations that monitor pandemics all the time.
Looking to the DoD or CIA or any other intelligence org to be the source of pandemic intelligence other than from a defense angle is a not their primary role.
Again, by rule, the NCMI is the lead agency on pandemic intelligence for the United States.
It's not an exception.
Additionally, the NCMI doesn't solely view medical intelligence from the lens of a "defense angle" as you believe.
But regardless, my comment originally rebutted your comment "Intelligence agencies aren't spying about pandemics folks."
Yes it does.
It's called the NCMI.
a.
There will be a unified Defense community for medical intelligence activities; thoseactivities will be executed in a coordinated and coherent manner to effectively respond to U.S. intelligence priorities in support of national security objectives, and in accordance with all applicable laws, Presidential directives, DoD issuances, and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) guidelines.
From multiple angles; not solely based on a defense posture.
Where's your DOD policy citation that it's solely for defense posture?
