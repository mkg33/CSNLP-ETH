“Proper” is honestly dubious.
If you google it, you’ll find that as of June the Fujian has barely left port for sea trials, despite being completed.
That doesn’t spell confidence or capacity on whatever the weak link is.
Their new super carrier has big plans, but it’s likely they’ll set it back on some important features.
For example…diesel engine instead of a nuclear reactor.
Nuclear vs diesel is a pretty big difference.
Nuclear powered relates to its ability to project force across the ocean.
China does not have that ability which is a key part of operating an aircraft carrier.
As it stands China's use of their carrier fleet is a mess (operationally speaking).
They cannot use them on the open ocean so they are not nearly as useful as a modern nuclear-powered carrier, they might as well just use a land airbase, they are not gaining any benefit of having a carrier.
The fact that France has fielded a nuclear powered catapult aircraft carrier for 20 years while China still does not have one operational means France is further ahead in aircraft capabilities vs China.
Also, France has built 10 aircraft carriers in their history, they have one operating now but there is a difference there and lots is learned in the building process (something China has very little experience with).
