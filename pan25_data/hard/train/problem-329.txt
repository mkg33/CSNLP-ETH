Yes.
After the Ottoman Empire broke up, the UK took over and had a mandate from the League of Nations to establish a there.
But they didn’t and just kept control of it.
Then, after WWII, the UK threw their hands up and said “UN, you decide what to do.” The UN General Assembly voted to divide it into two states—an Arab one and a Jewish one.
The Jews said “OK” and the Arabs said “no,” and a civil war started.
The UK left, Israel declared independence, and the surrounding countries intervened in favor of the Palestinians.
But they lost so Israel became a country.
I think you have your history wrong.
A large number of Jews moved from Europe to the Mandate of Palestine between WWI and WWII.
There were not large numbers that did so after WWII, on account of most of them being dead.
Then, after Israel was created, many more Jews moved to Israel from Middle Eastern and North African countries.
There were also a ton of jews who were forced from their homes in the countries surrounding israel as well as many jews who were just already living there.
Additionally, the British any Jews to immigrate during WWII and after it, even turning back ships full of people fleeing the holocaust, only for them to get wiped out.
This is due to the Arab rebellion starting in the 20s, where many Palestinians murdered both Brits and Jews in mandatory Palestine.
This resulted in the formation of Jewish retaliatory terrorism cells, such as the Irgun and Lehi.
