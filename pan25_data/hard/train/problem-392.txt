Russian and Iranian State Media is already Claiming that the Drone Attacks on Military Facilities inside of Iran tonight are suspected to be from a NATO or NATO-Linked Country.
Wargonzo is (of course) reporting that the explosions in Isfahan was carried out by a drone from Azerbaijan.
The only confirmed facts we have as of this comment is there was a drone attack against a military facility in Isfahan.
Flagging the reason I'm not adding the Iranian military facility drone attack to the Live Thread is:
Edit: An Iran reporter is now reporting this is Iran protestors doing this with drones.
This might not have anything to do with Ukraine.
Remember back before September of 2022 how the war was fought?
Russia would take small gains along the front line and keep pushing Ukraine back.
Until eventually Russian numbers was so weak that Ukraine was able to rush through and take large chunks of land?
Russia did a mobilization so it refilled a lot of Russian ranks so Ukraine just went back to what they was doing before.
This will continue until Ukraine feels as though Russia is weak enough for them to go on the offensive.
Any failure to annihilate Ukraine would be seen as Putin being a weak coward, a traitor to Russia and in league with Nazis.
That's dangerous as it could damage his phony image and put his life in jeopardy.
