Whatâ€™s the escape mechanism if the schools in your area are terrible?
You are forced to continue to send your kids to them and send tax dollars their way?
Send your kid anywhere you want, so long as you're paying the full tax and keeping public schools viable.
If the charter schools are accepting money from the state, I think that it's fairly reasonable to expect the schools to disclose how that money is spent.
It is the responsibility of the community to make sure their school system is well funded and adequate.
If the school is under performing then the city/county/state/fed are responsible for making the school and surrounding community's educational infrastructure better.
That's not the trap.
You just accused me of keeping people in a system that doesn't work.
You are hoping that there's some sort of magical fix to it in a private school.
That's the bullshit of all this.
There is no magic fix or escape.
Local communities need to say that there's a problem.
And then neighbors need to recognize that that's a problem.
It's not the government, the government is all of us, the people.
The trap is people thinking that it's not their problem to fix it.
That it's not their children that need help.
