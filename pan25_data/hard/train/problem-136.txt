Narita: There are too many who do nothing or past their usefulness in positions of power, and this is accepted as being normal.
The fact that we accept this is a danger, we should create more opportunities to be able to tell those who should “disappear” to go away without the repercussions.
Narita: I have a single solution in mind, it’s very clear to me, and that is group “decision” for elderly.
At the same time he was clear in stating “group decision for the elderly” 高齢者の集団自決 which could very well meant a suicide pact, and after being chided by the host he said “not only talking about physically performing seppuku” 別に物理的な切腹だけでなくても良くて, so if he actually did not mean the elderly should off themselves he made no effort to stress or clarify that point on the show.
Narita: No I’m being serious, I think it’s important that people should be able to determine when they’ve done/finished.
Not necessary talking only about physical seppuku, but it can be social seppuku.
There’s too many of whom used their past status (in life or career) to stay in power far longer than they should have.
There are too many layers, this is clearly an issue in Japan.
I mean, I know that like every country Japan has some real issues.
But for the most part I thought that on many things the current generation was getting better on some of these things than their predecessors.
But this is genuinely frightening to read about.
This statement is not as scary as the title.
I'm actually in favor of such things, old people shouldn't decide how younger generations will live, though they can still be advisors.
Majority of younger people will have more energy to run government.
