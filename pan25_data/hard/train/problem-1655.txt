What ultimately makes this a political stunt is that there is zero need to intentionally focus on EV sales.
Wyoming as a state simply lacks the population to have much sway.
If you factor in the total size, minus the people who would even get one, is just a tiny number.
Short term wins over "woke" or "the libs" or whatever.
Look at Wyoming announcing they are going to entirely phase out EVs.
You'd think a state whose only redeemable quality is its environment would care more about it.
But nope.
Not really.
Your talking labor cost, but you also reduce operational cost.
It cost more to ship from China than it does from coast to coast.
And labor is not the entire cost of most products, in fact, it's a small percentage on most products.
Increasing labor cost by 2x isn't going to increase prices 2x.
All our efforts in tech are to reduce labor cost already.
It's why people don't import cars, because the increased labor in the US is offset by the increased shipping cost from overseas.
If you want a Honda, you buy one made in Ohio, not SE Asia.
