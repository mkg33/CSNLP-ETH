What you are hearing about is done by every president in order to obtain documents for their presidential libraries.
These "classified documents" have mostly been proven to be call logs, transcripts of conversations with heads of state, etc.
The rumors of nuclear secrets have been proven to be false..notice you dont hear about the contents anymore?
All you hear is the fact that trump had "classified documents"..... after the FBI came and took them, it ended up being what the liberals call "a nothing burger".
If he had done something illegal, every news media would be on about it 24/7..and you know that is true.
The reason is that the president can declassify documents at any time, and there is no formal process involved..
A lot of the argument in favor of Trump with this stuff is that the President can declassify stuff.
But even ignoring how much of an oversimplification that is, these are not his and he does not own them.
This stuff is just sitting around mixed into his crap and he doesn’t want to give any of it back.
Even that basic fact is being ignored, it’s pathetic.
