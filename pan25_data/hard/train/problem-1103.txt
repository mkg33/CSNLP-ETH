ARE there still undecided voters anymore?
Before the political polarization of the last few decades, when you could have liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, undecided voting made sense, but in this day and age, you’re either picking up what the GOP is putting down, you’ll vote Dem or not vote at all.
Prediction: Joe (who already knows his age and therefore will and capability to confidently do the job are waning, and his bucket list presidential slot has been checked off) ...will endorse someone squeaky clean (far easier to do in the Dem party), younger and vibrant who aligns with him - things the Dems have been thirsting for - and the GOP's heads will explode when, a) he won't be running anyway after their 2-year smear campaign on his private-citizen son doesn't work, and, b) he does something else the people actually want after a long term of doing just that while the GOP opposed it all... while they're standing there, holding their dicks trying to pick a fight and making themselves, once again, look incredibly stupid just for the sake of power.
They crazies of the GOP will do a bunch of stupid political investigations, they'll threaten to default on the debt, they'll impeach Biden for something silly, and by the time 2024 rolls around, people will be ready to throw out the GOP again thus helping Biden if he runs in 2024.
Republicans don't seem to get that they don't actually have anything actionable against Hunter Biden or anyone else they want to target, while Democrats have piles of evidence against many Republicans.
They are not in the stronger position by any stretch of the imagination.
That being said, Democrats do not have the spine to take the gloves off against Republicans that tried to overthrow the government, and plan to do it again.
Then the Senate needs to do the same thing to Republicans.
A Few Criminal referrals for Seditious Conspiracy against half a dozen sitting House members should be a good start.
