My guess on this case is that Taylor likely met people at a music festival in Poland and decided to go with them to Kaliningrad, even though he did not have a Russian visa and he was arrested for it.
Clearly they judged it to be an honest mistake, as they released him without fanfare in under a year - even though he's a US Navy vet whom they could likely justify was some kind of spy, etc.
He crossed the Polish-Russian border, so the border police being involved is quite normal in this case.
To explain a bit; there is no physical border between Poland and Kaliningrad - as in, you do not have to stop at a checkpoint and get searched like other international borders, but there are still rules that apply to who can cross into Russia and who cannot.
"detained by Russian border patrol police in April 2022 after crossing from Poland into Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave which is territory governed by Moscow".
I am really curious to know why he was arrested by Russian border police after just going from Poland to Kaliningrad on a vacation and then held for the majority of a year there.
What was his crime?
