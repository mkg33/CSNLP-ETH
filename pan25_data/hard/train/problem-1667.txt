⚡️ There are heavy battles near Kremennaya.
There the Russian troops moved several battalions of paratroopers and heavy equipment.
Russians are slowly “sagging” there, says the head of the Regional Military Administration, Serhii Haidai.
Journalists visited the place in Kramatorsk where Russians claimed to have hit 600 Ukrainian soldiers, but aside from 2 holes in the ground in front of an empty building (yes, they even missed that) nothing is there.

I predict that Russian propagandists will claim the pics from Makiivka are in fact from Kramatorsk and that the 600 KIAs were in fact Ukrainians.
Also I believe those figures are based on reported active service tanks by the Russians.
I can almost guarantee a significant number of those active service tanks don't exist and some commander make some rubles off the ghost tanks.
