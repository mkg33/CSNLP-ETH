Coin flip?
No way it won't happen.
He's shooting these missles as a way of saying dont get any bright ideas like regime change US and south korea.
He's worried about the closer US south korea ties.
He will get off the ramp because he can't win.
A nuclear bomb equals certain death for him when all he really wants is to stay in power.
Nuclear escalation must be thought of as a road.
The starting point is peace and end point nuclear armageddon.
As we get closer to our destination we avoid it by taking off ramps.
This is how we have avoided nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis and fall of USSR.
Eventually the DPRK will ramp up by possibly bombing the demilitarised zone.
Then the US and SK retaliates etc.. till we at a nuclear strike.
Let's take this from the top.
Not in terms of the Kim Regime or Kim Jong-um the man.
But of the North Korean system itself.
I remember back in 2017 that North Korea got a bit missile happy... China actually had to step in.
I vaguely remember reading their statement which sounded like.. we have a defense pact with north korea which only applies if the west attacks first..
