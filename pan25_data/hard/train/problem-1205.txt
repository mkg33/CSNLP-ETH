Israel is probably one of those countries.
Recently, an Israeli spy firm was caught trying to intercept Western journalists and have them write tabloids to besmirch other countries.
Foreign agents have attempted to recruit senior Australian journalists and potentially members of the judiciary, the nation's top spy boss has warned.
Mr Burgess also detailed one foiled plot, in which a foreign intelligence service attempted to use an Australian-born "lackey" to approach "senior journalists" with the offer of a fully-paid study tour overseas.
Had the plan gone ahead, the "lackey" would have introduced the journalists to apparent local officials, who were actually disguised spies enjoying a "home-field advantage", Mr Burgess said.
And Mr Burgess warned ASIO was aware of multiple spies from multiple countries, who were seeking to leverage relationships with government and non-government figures to obtain the personal details of critics of overseas regimes.
Mr Burgess warned the countries engaging in espionage in Australia were varied, including authoritarian regimes but also nations "considered friends" of Canberra.
In two plots uncovered and prevented by the agency, separate foreign intelligence services planned to physically harm targets living in Australia, each considered a dissident.
ASIO director-general Mike Burgess has also revealed the agency foiled two plots by foreign governments to harm perceived dissidents living in Australia, including a plan to lure a human rights activist overseas where they could be "disposed of".
