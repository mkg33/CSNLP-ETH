I want a much more progressive leaning dem like Bernie or AOC in the White House.
That said, I’d vote for a dead cat over any republican.
So it looks like biden it is!
I'm not voting for Biden.
I don't give a fuck who our president is because either way we'll be at war and either way our courts are going to rule against me and other trans people.
I'll vote for a blue Congress in the hopes of gridlocking DeSantis should he win from passing legislature, too.
But I'm not voting for Biden.
Is Biden a sure bet?
No, I wouldn’t say that.
But does he have a proven track record of accomplishing things with difficult odds against him (like a razor thin margin in the Senate)?
Yes, he does.
But we’ve made progress.
Domestic electronics (CHIPS Act) are happening.
Billions of Dollars are up for Green Energy.
Gay Marriage is technically enshrined.
Mail-out Abortion Pills are happening.
The job market is pretty strong.
We got a new Supreme Justice and have been putting out new Judges.
There is still progress to be made.
Student Loans need to be locked down.
Cannabis needs to be rescheduled.
Trans-Rights need to be enshrined.
Abortion needs to be brought back.
A Carbon Tax needs to happen.
