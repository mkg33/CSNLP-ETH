If you want to dominate the world and believe everybody not under your heel is a threat to your country you aren't acting in self defense and we shouldn't muddy that by going with the russian narrative.
You realize the US has been trying to create an anti missile shield around Russia trying to prevent mutual assured destruction?
In early March last year, Bennett met with Putin and asked if he was going to kill Zelensky, who at the time was hiding in a secret bunker.
The former prime minister of Israel spoke about this in an interview with Channel 12.
Based on absolutely nothing but propaganda...
Remember the last time a civilian building was struck when Ukraine intercepted a Russian missile and how much coverage it received?
You think this would get so much coverage if a thousand times that many already died?
Putin also said NATO expansion of Ukraine is a red line, sth the VAST majority of Russians agree with.
That's why he attacked and that's why he has so much support.
Zelensky refused to give up the NATO integration (instead he added it to the Ukranian constitution) and this is the result of that.
Don't make a mistake.
Zelensky is not going to make it out alive of this, but he won't get killed by Russians.
