Don’t forget the western-backed coup against Mosaddegh and the US-financed invasion by Iraq.
Frankly if there is one country in the world that I fully understand why they want Nukes it’s Iran and it has been for a long time.
Iran has had the ability to make a nuclear bomb for years now.
There's no technical difference between enriching to 84% and enriching to 90%.
The only reason they don't do it is because they don't need to.
This isn't true.
You make it sound like scientist that gets killed has some kind of special knowledge that no other scientist has.
Iran doesn't need to learn how to build a nuclear bomb.
They know.
Iran's facilities are not less advanced than the United States in 1945.
Ever since the nuclear deal ended Iran has been slowly increasing the percentage they're enriching at as a way of trying to push Western powers back into the deal.
The media and politicians portray this as some kind of slow motion race to the bomb, as if this whole thing is a video game and Iran just needs to fill up the gauge to somehow get to 90.
