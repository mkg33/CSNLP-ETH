Most of the native language programs Iâ€™m aware of operate in schools on or near reservations with lots of native students.
I also remember hearing language teachers talk about how once you learn a second language our brains know how to learn new languages and it becomes easier.
So, the students are more connected to their culture and have a leg up if they want to learn a third language.
To me, the cool part of learning a language is being able to talk to native speakers in their country.
I'd love to learn Dutch and then go to Amsterdam and use it.
But if I learn Navajo, whom am I going to talk with?
The Navajo people all speak English and prefer English, and the younger ones may not speak much Navajo at all.
So at least for me, that makes it less appealing.
That would be great, but I think it's a bit optimistic.
A language can only truly survive if it has enough native speakers.
It's almost impossible to get comfortable enough to code switch interchangeably through classes, especially if there is little opportunity to practice with people who are fluent.
How did they represent the Cherokee?
Were they selected by the Cherokee, or appointed by some recognized Cherokee body?
Those few represented the Cherokee.
And as a treaty its is US law.
So that argument is bullshit.
Also the argument that its unfair to other Native American tribes is also bullshit, as if the treaty were were enforced it would open the door other tribes to get fair representation.
