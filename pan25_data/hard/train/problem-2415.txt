every new system is done slowly and in small increments so ruzzian media can cope.
we have crossed more red lines with ruzzia than i can remember, the first were completely idiotic and a massive bluff noone cared about.
the current ones are dealt with by making every small extra bit of aid too small in and of itself to warrent stupidity from russia... lets face it, they have one last big button, and its a suicide switch with less than optimal outcomes for the rest of the world.. but there is no way everyone in the chain involved, drunk off the 500 abrams already destroyed propagande thatl go along with a seemingly insane escalation to a minor bump from the west.
When Ukraine is liberated in full, itl take a decade or more to rebuild with massive western aid.
if its anything like Germany post ww2, the population will have no more appetite for war.
hell, the Ukrainians didnt even before this war.
If there is a country that understands the need for territorial integrity and how the powerful players around the world react to its violation, itl be Ukraine.
where is Ukraine going to expand to?
Nuclear NATO it wants to join, or Nuclear Russia that cannot use nukes in Ukraine cause of geopolitics or Russia on its internationally recognized soil should its survival be threatened by a Ukrainian counter invasion?
Option 1: Use tactical nuclear weapon against the Ukrainian military, a country that has no tactical, let alone strategic nuclear weapons of their own, a country that is not part of any collective defense agreement.
