Yet these lawmakers don’t raise as much as an eyebrow for dance team or cheerleading uniforms, when children are actually wearing revealing clothes themselves.
This is purely about men in dresses and makeup, not protecting children (who will find much more inappropriate things on the iPads they give their kids to entertain themselves while mommy has another glass of wine and daddy taps his toe in a bathroom stall).
These people only want to control other people.
What did the parents who actually took their kids to that event think, because that’s all that really matters.
I think religious schools groom children into being small minded bigots and expose them to harmful ideas that corrupt their ability to think critically and contribute positively to society.
Where’s the bill to ban those?
It’s not up to others to decide what is appropriate for their children.
Aside from the tipping (which isn’t itself explicit), nothing in that video was anything you don’t see at a junior high dance team performance.
Except it’s multiple teenage girls dancing, wearing less clothing.
But that’s okay….
That's my point though.
It starts with banning drag shows and next thing you know someone down the line decides that includes a pg-13 sex scene or a movie that happens to have a shot of a topless woman.
What someone else considers inappropriate for their kids may not line up with what I consider inappropriate and it's not the governments job to do that work for me.
The Satanic Panic should be enough evidence that these people would go so much further than just drag shows.
I guarantee this would lead to libraries having to remove books because they have "explicite material".
