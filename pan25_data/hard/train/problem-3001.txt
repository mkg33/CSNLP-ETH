Listen, mate, idk if you’re familiar or not but Germany in WW1 wasn’t too great either.
And the treaty of Versailles directly lead to the rise of hitler and WW2 and I’m telling you, such policies will lead to a rise in Russian nationalism.
Also, what you’re saying will require the utter defeat of Russia and basically the capture of Moscow, which is not very likely to happen in todays world given the fact Russia has nuclear weapons.
No one will agree to invade Russia knowing they have the bomb.
I also wouldn’t accuse “Russians” as in the people of Russia of being terrorists.
That title I feel should be placed on Putin and the oligarchs for starting this war and many others.
Edit: to be clear I’m not defending the Russian government in any capacity.
I support Ukraine and hope that Germany can hold out this winter without Russian gas as I think they got a third of their energy from Russia.
Wouldn’t breaking up Russia would throw it back into chaos like how it was with the solviet era with constant power shifts and war?
I could be painfully ignorant so correct me if I’m wrong.
