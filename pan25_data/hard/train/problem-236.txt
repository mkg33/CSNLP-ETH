I expect all museum workers to diligently poke around in the rafters and nooks of their workplaces from now on.
Never know where a long lost last specimen might turn up.
Or maybe just a bunch of artifacts pillaged from vulnerable cultures but still...
Fun fact: A lot of this stuff was stolen from other countries and cultures.
The big museums talk big talk about how they're the only ones who can properly preserve and share history with the world, but the truth is that most of it is closed up in a box in a fancy warehouse somewhere.
a good reminder so much of history is literally stored away in some dark storage room of a museum somewhere.
As for storage, a lot of older museums literally have rows of hundreds of cabinets in the warehouse/storage floors for specimens, so that’s not too odd.
Northern White rhino is actually happening There’s a surrogacy project with black rhinos at San Diego zoo It’s still very early but it’s a thing that’s actively being pursued.
It’s not just finding it, it’s finding it and knowing what it is if it wasn’t properly catalogued (since it was lost it’s a safe bet it wasn’t).
