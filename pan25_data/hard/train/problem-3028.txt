It basically would require another $150 billion/year in new taxes, which roughly works out to an additional $3,750 in taxes for every single Californian.
I would too, but there's no way our state would vote to approve it.
California as a state is pretty center-left because it's mostly made up of center-left people.
They'll never vote for a conservative Republican (in the near future at least), but they also tend to vote against real liberal ideas.
However, he does represent the party and voters generally.
Most Dems and voters generally are moderate and not progressive, even in California.
It might be a blue state, but it has heavy conservative and moderate leanings too.
He still seems to be effective at tackling climate change and keeping the economy churning at least.
I would definitely classify him as neoliberal based on the description in this article but he's effective and represents his state's general leanings.
And anyway, this strategy of "compromising" with Republicans is basically the centerpiece of neo-liberal ideology, so that's probably also a big reason why people say that about him that he's neoliberal.
How about instead of not raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for welfare and charging stations, we do do that, but not to 99%?
(as a compromise, since you seem to think that's my starting point).
I never said "any compromise is a good compromise", and I don't think many would agree with that statement.
I get it, some people that see it as a moral issue and there can be no compromise.
There are issues I feel the same on.
There are others I have to simply realize are going to take years or decades to move American culture so my best hands is slowly moving the culture in that direction.
For example there should be no compromise for getting days off in the recent railroad workers deal, for taxing the wealthy I'm going to have to compromise what I want them to pay vs how many will leave.
