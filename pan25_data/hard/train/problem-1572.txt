Yeah, well my point was, the trend that this idiotic segment of society is apparently so large now that they can form significan democratic majorities.
There will always be crazy people and morons around.
But when it's almost half the country, that becomes an issue for democracy.
I'm torn between wanting it to be absolutely equal and feeling like there ought to be some minimum intelligence requirements.
It's fundamentally against my beliefs to exclude people from influence on their own governance.
But so many people just have no clue what's best for themselves and have no idea how society works and sustains itself.
Yeah these recent developments with obvious crazy people and/or morons getting elected or losing only narrowly has made me question my beliefs about democracy.
Focus on putting measures in place to safeguard future elections from the kind of high level tampering that actually took place with false delegates and remove from office the congresspeople who were actively involved in the sedition.
Trump is no longer wildly popular as demonstrated by his loss to Biden, and heâ€™s even less popular than in 2020.
Honestly let him run, it will guarantee a Biden victory when he splits the republican vote in half.
Right I was thinking surely with Trump splitting the vote 60 in the Senate was easy for the Democrats - but no it would be uphill even then by the looks of things.
