ITT: People across the world woefully unaware of the Dutch nitrogen crisis, it's relation to the Dutch housing crisis, the relative amount of nitrogen emitted by farms, and the percentage of food that we're not even producing for ourselves.
You're all kidding yourselves if you think the solution to the world's hunger crises will be found in one of Europe's smallest countries.
Spread food production around a bit for crying out loud, everyone asking for the Netherlands to carry this burden is insanely out of touch.
That's right, you also need an environment that can sustain the nitrogen emissions that farms like that bring, without the nitrogen emissions being a danger to nature and jeopardizing housing developments (which also emit nitrogen).
“Excess nitrogen in the atmosphere can produce pollutants such as ammonia and ozone, which can impair our ability to breathe, limit visibility and alter plant growth.
When excess nitrogen comes back to earth from the atmosphere, it can harm the health of forests, soils and waterways.” Aug 11, 2022.
