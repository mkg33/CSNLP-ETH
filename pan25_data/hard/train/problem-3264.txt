The invasion force hasn't really been reduced.
They replace losses.
But the effectiveness has been greatly reduced because they are replacing better soldiers with trash untrained unwilling conscripts and prisoners.
Not if you include wounded.
Combat troop number is around 200k by some estimates.
With constant rotation and replenishment.
So 10% kia and 30% wounded.
That's only 20k dead Russian soldiers and 60k injured.
US estimates are about 100k total casualties combined killed and wounded.
But the Russian troop numbers aren't greatly reduced just combat power greatly reduced by replacing better soldiers with unwilling and untrained conscripts.
Here we had a well-trained, well-geared, modern battalion that for all intents and purposes no longer exists because Russia failed to rotate them out.
A group of Russian soldiers that take 10% casualties is going need time to recover and integrate replacements, but will return to fighting form.
A group of Russian soldiers that has 40% dead and who knows how many more casualties is going to be nothing left but broken, bitter individuals, some of whom likely now pose a greater danger to their home country than they ever did to the enemy.
There are so many mistakes that can be the end of an otherwise good battalion.
A bad commander.
Failure to properly equip.
Failure to properly train.
Failure to properly supply.
Failure to properly rotate.
Any \one\ of these things can easily spell disaster, as failure to rotate did here, and Russia is making mistakes in every single area, and sometimes all of them at once.
It's not enough to fix one of these things, or two, or all of them but only in some areas.
Until Russia fixes all of these things at least in most places most of the time, they'll continue to underperform.
This is a prime example of how Russia's inefficiencies are destroying its army and a salient lesson in just how unlikely it is that Russia fundamentally changes things any time soon.
