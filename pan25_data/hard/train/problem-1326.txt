Russia thinks it can outproduce military industrial complex of an alliance of 1 billion people.
The find out phase will get so fucking sobering for those shits.
And that wasn't even close to how badly Russia is outclassed now, in technology, production, economy and motivation and bravery of the Ukrainian people.
Even if Russia achieved it's goals and took over a substantial amount of Ukraine, it would only be as much of a "victory" as the USA's miserable times with Iraq, Vietnam, Afghanistan etc, except times x1000 because the bitter Guerilla Insurgency would be supplied and supported by the full brunt of the west.
It's not that Russia is afraid of Nato, it actually just hates that it can't annex and conquer any of the countries inside of Nato.
That's literally it.
Ukraine's chances of joining NATO were basically non-existent after Crimea was annexed because an applicant can't have contested borders and corruption/democracy that is trending down, nor would germany, turkey, etc allow it due to so much of their industry being reliant on Russian gas; they did not want to anger russia.
Every country inside of NATO needs to agree for a country to join NATO.
Every country which joined NATO did so by choice because they feared Russian aggression and oppression.
Those that haven't joined yet are requesting to join for the same reason.
