Be careful what you wish for.
I did read it, and the opening line of the case you asked me to read says:
In the words of Justice Kennedy himself, Citizens United was about corporate and union expenditures on campaigns and tied the concept of money to free speech in their 5-4 decision to allow corporations and unions to spend money on politics.
We're not talking about murals on the side of your house, or documentaries about Hillary Clinton.
There's really no point in this conversation if you're going to pretend that corporations aren't donating to political campaigns.
What corporations can do is spend money to speak on political issues and name politicians in said speech.
If the ACLU wants to put out a press release saying that Senator Bob's proposed "Lock Up Teh Gayz" bill is an affront to civil liberties, they can.
If the Sierra Club wants to air a radio ad in Wyoming urging listeners to contact Senator Alice to support the "Yellowstone Park Protection Act", they can.
If Ben & Jerry's wants to tweet a video of a named politician eating their ice cream, they can.
