If the islands are contested then let the involved parties come to an agreement.
The US can not enforce its allies legitimacy via force thousands of miles from home just on political grounds.
China shouldn't have built the base without the consent of other nations in the area.
Vietnam may be willing to come to an understanding but Taiwan.....
Vietnam's claim is that China defeated the South Vietnamese government, which the North defeated.
Then they inherited their legacy so China illegally took them from the current Vietnamese government.
The answer is obvious, it's a cluster fuck.
But once again the issue isn't ownership of the Islands its military expansion in the region.
However the issue isn't about the Islands, its about US and Chinese military expansion in the region.
Of course it isn't, the US doesn't violate China's airspace, but they were within 30 miles of a Chinese military base - neither the US nor China did anything wrong or out of the ordinary in the slightest.
This really isn't news and happens literally every day.
