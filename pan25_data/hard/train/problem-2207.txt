It's possible that it is at it's worst in 2028 or later, and Republicans are in power.
Nobody knows for sure when it will happen, and what effects it will have, but we know it will be bad.
And that's what makes it so scary.
Think about this: there IS a coming economic disaster in the U.S. right now, and nobody knows how bad it will be, but with the unprecedented economic policies that have been employed, some estimate it could be as bad as The Great Depression.
This is one path I see for this country to become full on Fascist.
Nazi's gained power during a very turbulent time in Germany -- when people have no food, or lose their houses, that's when extremism thrives.
It's a game of hot-potato between Democrats and Republicans with the economy.
Whoever is holding power when it all goes to shit, will be decimated in elections for a very long time afterwards.
As bad as the current GOP are, we did deliver a crippling blow to MAGA by showing up to vote this year.

For better or for worse, America will have a real reckoning with its identity soon.
2018, 2020, and 2022 are showing that as bad as the GOP are, we can still push them back.
It really is crazy that after the way the GOP has fared so badly at the polls in three straight elections they don't seem to want to change things up.
My guess is it's because they don't think they have anything else to offer.
It's bigotry and intolerance or nothing I guess.
That's why Mitch McConnell preferred that the GOP's message was quite literally nothing as opposed to what they ran on this year.
I can see them saying behind closed doors "if we're not trying to strip away rights and freedoms from marginalized communities, then who the hell even are we?
