Historically Pence's political positions haven't been anywhere near moderate, and we have no idea what his 2024 platform would look like, but he does do a good job of moderating his tone, and for many people that matters.
"Hillary is shrill," "I just couldn't see myself grabbing a beer with Gore," "President Obama talks down to me," personality and perception matter, he could pick up a few moderate and swing voters just because he's nothing like Trump.
That could also be a win with Republican voters, maybe, who knows, John Kasich used to have a shot in hell.
There's also something to be said for the fact that he has national name recognition; DeSantis may achieve similar notoriety between now and 2024, but as of right now Pence is probably still in the lead.
If you're old enough to remember Kasich, that's what I imagine Pence is going to aim for, his tone will be more moderate and less contentious compared to Trump, lulling the moderates, and his platform will be all regressive Republican red meat, appealing to the Republicans.
Pence trying to play both sides make him look like a Trump apologist; and when cornered with irrefutable information (regarding Jan 6th) he plays the religion card and tries painting a sympathetic portrait of Trump.
What an insufferable man.
