Maybe you meant Germany by they, which would have made sense if Germany actually did ally with the USSR, which they did not.
You may be mistaking it with the fascists half-arsed attempt to get the USSR into the Tripartite pact as a means to distract them from their European claims.
The Rhineland was German territory - it was just demilitarised as per the Versailles treaty.
Funnily enough the German high command and Hitler were shitting themselves during this and admitted that had France decided to react militarily as they could have due to the treaty stipulations, they'd be forced to withdraw their contingent and that it'd effectively be the end of their regime.
I agree it was a stupid decision that led to a much more costly and painful war - a combined UK and French offensive would have walked over the German frontier defenses while the cream of the German Army was hung up in the Sudetenland fortified zones.
Absolutely true.
Even people like Hitler were perfectly happy to get what they wanted without the cost of actual combat.
That got him the Rhineland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia.
No war over those lands because they got what they wanted.
