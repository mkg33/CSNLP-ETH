I wouldn't vote for this guy if I lived in the Netherlands (I'd be to his left), but credit where credit is due.
He's been doing a good job keeping the far right out of power while it has been on the rise throughout the rest of the developed world.
I hope Biden takes the opportunity to pick his brain.
If anything, I hope Rutte gets to pick Biden's brain.
Our health care costs are inflating due to privatization, our country's a tax haven for big multinationals, our climate change policy is secondary to whatever makes us money.
Not that Biden is a whole lot better at any of this but I do feel like he has a better understanding of the urgency of our time than Rutte does.
As a Dutch guy, I don't dislike Rutte inherently.
But I think he's a bit late to the show.
I actually think in many ways Biden is ahead of him in terms of political philosophy and I don't see Biden as being particularly far, if at all, to Rutte's left.
We don't have the latter one.
We have a semi-privatised healthcare system that was put in place after the abolition of single-payer.
Basically we thought "let's do what America does" as though that would work out better for us than it has for you.
