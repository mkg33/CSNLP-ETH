Pick an oligarch.
Any oligarch.
They would all love to see him gone so one of them can take his place.
It's just that Putin very effectively uses his military and his security apparatus to prevent that outcome.
The oligarchs know it so none of them are dumb enough to pose a threat to him, much less challenge his authority.
They know what happens to anyone that crosses Putin.
Putin didn't get where he is by playing fair or being Mr. Nice Guy; he did it by killing or co-opting his rivals.
Historically it has been frankly normal for a terrible Russian leader to be succeeded by another terrible Russian leader.
Mildly less terrible perhaps but still terrible and just as likely to be more terrible than less terrible.
Things are worse, 100%, but to suggest they’re as bad as you’re implying is naive, because that’s simply not the case.
People are still going on with their lives, some are still buying new Apple products, others aren’t.
On the other hand, China has really good products these days, so I’m not sure it’s worth paying a brand premium + the import markup for the experience of having an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy.
Huawei makes nice quality phones, I had one in the US (honor 5X) a couple years ago and it was a great deal for what it offered, honestly better than comparable low end LGs I’ve used.
Their flagship offerings are slightly cheaper than the western/Korean competition at the expense of mostly camera quality, from what I’ve seen.
