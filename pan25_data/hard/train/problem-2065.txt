By destroying Russia’s military in Ukraine, the US could drop its defense budget to 400 billion a year and still maintain enough of a presence after asking allies around the world to step up monitoring the flow of goods.
Also, we're defanging a major geopolitical rival with no troops on the ground for a fraction of what a full blown US/Russian war would cost (even if you somehow kept the nukes shelved).
We're gathering intelligence on every action Russia takes as well as what weapons of ours are most effective against them.
Even before the lend-lease kicks in and Ukraine starts paying us back, I'd say that it's money well spent.
So, say what you will about the price point of Ukraine.
Yes, catch fraud and wasteful spending… but get the job done and worry about the price tag later.
The underlying reason people give for our exorbitant military spending is that you don’t want the job don’t efficiently, you want it done completely.
This is why market solutions don’t work in all cases: Markets prioritize cost against accomplishment.
A government is the reverse.
A government should and does prioritize the accomplishment over the cost.
It’s why Government administered healthcare is better than a free market solution.
