It is irrational.
You might as well invest in giant expensive umbrellas in case a meteor hits your country.
Sure, the umbrella will not actually protect you, but hey at least you did SOMETHING and it cost a lot of money, right?
And also: nukes.
If you are in an alliance that has nukes, chances are pretty good that nobody will fuck with you and then nobody gives a crap about how many tanks you have.
Heck America could become fully fascist one day.
Everybody on earth needs a bigger army than USA too!
But wait, then other countries need to have an even bigger army to deter Japan And so on and so forth.
If Japan is in no alliance and nukes are ignored, then they can spend their entire GDP on defense and still could not defend themselves from China or USA or whoever else is the current boogey man the defense lobby uses.
How would Japan abandoning it's pacifist position and develop missiles that can hit China make things more stable?
That way when china or anyone, like russia whos getting into border disputes with japan for 100 years, doesnt attack they will definitely not have to worry about responding themselves.
