Illinois (and other states) has passed significant legislation to restrict 2nd Amendment rights in the wake of the Heller and now the Bruen decisions.
What steps need to be taken to promote an explicit Constitutional right in your state?
The Bill of Rights are not rights granted; they are inherent to all the people of the country.
They are limitations on the power of the government.
This is US History 101.
Nothing in the Bill of Rights gives the government the power to do anything.
What do you have to say about the state violating what are supposed to be Constitutionally protected rights of U.S. citizens?
There has been a Supreme Court decision in very recent times that also forbids the banning of guns that are in common use.
Semi-automatic (NOT machine guns) firearms have been in common use for over 100 years.
What you described is repeating firearms, which can "shoot bullets REALLY fast" with practice and also encompass just about all firearms made after the start of the 20th century.
an assault weapon (pistol, long gun, etc) is ANY gun that can shoot A LOT of bullets REALLY fast so as to kill as many people as quickly as possible.
used by militaries, terrorists, gangs and the like due to their efficiency.
