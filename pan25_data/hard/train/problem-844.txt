It's not reasonable to expect every single article about Trump mention this when that's not the point of the piece.
Everyone knows it already anyway.
The fact is, and this is a sad truth, almost no one beyond social media cares about 1/6.
It doesn't hurt Trump's support at all.
No one should underestimate Trump since he did win once before.
He doesn't need to win the popular vote after all.
The fact is he's still as popular as ever, not having lost any support at all, whereas Biden doesn't have the same cult following and the economy is still not up to par for most people.
Biden has been decent but Americans generally don't like him for one reason or another, usually because of age or inflation, or they just don't care for him.
Likely the biggest risk is Dems just not turning out to vote in 2024.
But I do agree about this...Democratic turnout is is the key.
Which in a very sick way makes Trump the ideal canidate.
The man has done more for Democratic fundraising and turnout than any candidate in history.
I feel like your upset prediction is more plausible if a guy like Desantis is the nominee.
And its not the same as 2016 because Trump literally did lose the popular vote in that.
He won the Electoral college by 70,000.
I know what you mean.
I just think your scenario is actually more likely if another Republican is nominated.
Democrats don't take Trump lightly...they hate his guts.
The scenario you describe is imho more likely if another Republican gets nominated.
It's probably more of a stretch that a Republican would win the popular vote than it is that a Republican would be the next president.
Popular vote doesn't matter at all.
Trump lost in 2020 by 43,000 votes.
That's what matters.
Yeah I guess it isn't as cringe as when Trump would talk about his margin in the electoral college like he won in a blowout instead of by 100,000 votes.
But it still bothers me.
