As someone who lives in Iowa, hates political junk calls/texts and thinks caucases are joke, I wouldn't say enjoyed is really the right word.
I have been one of those people and for the record caucuses are obnoxious and take so long that most people either skip them or leave part way through.
It can be an hours long affair.
This can take a long time to do.
Often, people give up and leave because they've got something else to do than just stand around and be counted all evening.
Because you know how long lines suck and we want to make voting as quick and simple as possible?
Well, a caucus is exactly the opposite of that.
They get together and say everybody for candidate a stand over here.
Candidate b, over there.
Candidate c, there.
D, there.
E, over there.
Yes, there is.
South Carolina is not a huge state- it has 3 medium-sized at best cities (Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville/Anderson/Spartanburg- the 85 corridor).
Aside from a handful of counties in Charlotte's, it is not inside any major, expensive media market.
It is completely viable for a small candidate to compete there with a motivated ground game- it just hasn't been done in the past because Iowa and New Hampshire traditionally draw all the attention before their primaries and South Carolina happened pretty quickly afterward.
