60 years) (...).
This means that only 42% of human CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere.
Land and ocean CO2 sinks have continued to increase proportionally with the increasing emissions (...)" - their data shows that this 42% of AF seems to be "constant" over the period 1960â€“2016.
according to the scientific data and mesaurements - the overall CO2 lvl in Earth's atmosphere in 2020 was at 149% of a lvl from 1750 (set as 100% - pre industrial era).
Mankind (in general) is responsible for CO2 that amount to circa about 0,000925% of Earth's atmosphere.
But hey "80% MORE" sounds scarier than "only 42% of human CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere in 1960 - 2016", right?
The rest is being absorbed by natural sinks and there seems to be no radical (none at all...) increase in the AF remaining in the atmosphere so ... no longer so scary.

Look up the Aral Sea.
It was the 4th largest lake in the world, the Soviets diverted the river for cotton fields and now it's now pathetically small and very, very dry.
The Soviets used the area as a biological weapons testing site which is now exposed to the elements and killing the local people and environment.
How does Anthrax floating around in a dust bowl sound?
