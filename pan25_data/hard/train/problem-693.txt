"Look, more sleeping people It must be nap time But that's silly, nap time comes BEFORE pants time, not AFTER.
I think these people are just making up times.

Heh.
My grandfather lived through that.
One of the things he did to keep his siblings and himself alive (they were still kids when my great grandfather died - they didn't have anything and we're too young to work the farm) was to mentally map the floor plan of the store.
Then, that night, he returned with his sister.
Iirc, some models of hybrid American pickup trucks work that way - they're designed to operate as a worksite generator and, if equipped, sometimes feature a 240v, 30amp connection.
... Heck, one guy I know has a regular has powered pickup and he has that ability.
They would return when they were desperate, over the winter, and use that hole to keep from starving.
They didn't use it regularly because it was important and he didn't want it to be discovered or the theft to be noticed.
A plug-in hybrid like that would likely have a 16 to 20kWh battery - I say 'likely' because I haven't done any reading on that since just before covid hit.
Are there any models of hybrid cars where the gas engine can be used to directly charge the batteries, without actually driving the car?
( Idling at home, say.
).
Yeah.
I think being a "competent" tsar of Russia meant you had to be able to ruthlessly put down reformers (of which they were many).
You also had to have some good policy ideas, but it doesn't matter too much if you can't even stop a peasant rebellion.
I just saw some footage of a drone bombing Russian soldiers that seemed barely responsive... the speculation was that they were sluggish from moderate hypothermia.
I think we're getting to the point where Russia's going to have to scrounge up proper cold weather gear, or their conscripts are going to just freeze to death overnight.
