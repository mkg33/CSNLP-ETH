"We're reloading over here... nobody shoot.
Hold on.
We're putting the bullets in our gun now.
You'll be sorry soon.
Just give us a minute and we'll be right back to murdering women and children.
Just as soon as we get this gun loaded again.
NO ONE shoot.
Timesies.
".
Good point.
It makes sense that he’d rally his domestic and foreign supporters, though to my mind the value of creating fissures in the West is the more important factor.
Frankly it’s tough to tell what motivates the man.
But now I think this is really about the broader narrative of the war.
Putin is telling the West, “Look, if you think giving more weapons and training to Ukraine will help end this war, you’re wrong.” He wants to fray the alliance of Ukraine-supporting nations by making them think the war will never end, no matter what they do, in hopes that the alliance will pull apart.
I used to wonder why Putin would continue making these kinds of claims, given that if you’re actually ramping up military capability, telling your adversary about it eliminates your ability to achieve strategic surprise.
The Soviets didn’t tell the Germans during, WWII “Hey, we’re working on this tank called the T-34, you’d better look out It’s coming”.
