Russia has a abundance of natural resources which makes Russia self sufficient and also helps Russia to sustain the 2nd Most Powerful military, so if India and China who get Military Equipment from Russia at cheap price.
a) Russia's selling oil on the cheap, so for a fuel-hungry nation with an extremely price-sensitive population due to low standard of living, it's a godsend.
b) India-Russia have historically had good relations, and India's foreign policy is "Non-Aligned" which means it will trade and deal with any party, unless the specific good is globally sanctioned (e.g.
NK or recently Iran).
But until Iranian oil was sanctioned they traded with Iran while also simultaneously trading with Israel, or they trade with both Azerbaijan and Armenia, etc.
Russian oil is not globally sanctioned, so they have no issues buying it while also trading with the USA/EU.
India has been propping up Russian war efforts by buying Russian oil.
This canâ€™t possibly be related.
That was sarcasm, you morons.
I hope you learn to understand reality and that a statement can be sarcastic.
