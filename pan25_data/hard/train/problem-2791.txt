Oh yeah UFO’s and UAP’s are extremely common, they’re reported by pilots more often than news articles can even write about.
People are simply more interested now due to the Chinese spy balloon incident.
my guess is that many countries are going to see all of this stuff and just start sending spy balloons over people they dont like and then try to blame in on the Chinese or on "hysteria".
My instructor reported a UFO and filed paper work and he later found out that the UFO were a bunch of balloons that had little baggies of human ashes in them.
I guess some farmer died and they spread half of his ashes in his field and attached some to balloons and let them go.
I took an aviation class in High School and what people dont know is basically a UFO in the aviation world is when a pilot sees something in the sky and cant accurately ID.
Whenever there's attention in the media about UFO's, people will report seeing them all over the place.
Because they're thinking about it, and actually looking.
But most likely these types of things are happening all the time we just aren't looking for them (and are most likely not extraterrestrial in nature but... who knows?
).
Also, Romania and Moldova are both bordering Ukraine, where there's an active war going on, so there's going to be plenty of extra things in the sky.
Well you do realize Russia shot a missile into Ukraine last week over Moldova and Romania.
They must have done so from a boat.
I'd imagine the people there care a lot more about what Russia is doing rather than some balloon a world away.
