They don’t need the west though they just need Turkey.
With Russias military already wrapped up, that’s all they really need, Russia really can’t afford to to fight Turkey.
If anything were to happen, the west would let it go until Russia were beaten and then send a peace keeping force to occupy Armenia to make sure Turkey and Azerbaijan don’t mess it up anymore than it would already be.
Thus giving Armenia a sense of security, and also in the end the Nagorno-Karabakh area probably gets given to Azerbaijan in exchange for more security guarantees.
geopolitically speaking Azerbaijan has for the past 2 years closed all land borders for its citizens except for trade and such, and all Military personnel and weaponry from Turkey pass from Georgia and Georgia only.
Since neither Iran or Armenia allow it.
And main transit routes are from plane fields and non-mountainous regions.
So Russia might simply use the sea roads to advance forward, like how Azerbaijan did against Armenia (using Irans border to advance) and unlike what Russia is doing now (pushing into direct Ukrainian territory).
For Russia to win they would need to either fight their way through Georgia to get to Armenia, convoy them through the Black Sea avoiding Ukrainian drones and using up their limited naval infrastructures, or would have to attack and fight their way through the mountainous terrain of Azerbaijan itself, with their supply lines going through their own internal caucus region which is full of hotspots.
Quite a good analysis except you forgot Russia borders Azerbaijan itself so could just attack them directly, and also already has military bases in Armenia and a way to bring in soldiers through air.
Their biggest problem wouldn’t be those aspects, it would be Turkey intervening because it has a military alliance with Azerbaijan.
And because Turkey and Azerbaijan share a genocidal hate for Armenians.
