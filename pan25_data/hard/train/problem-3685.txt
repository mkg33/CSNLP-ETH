However, given what anyone considering Georgia elections should have known about the Georgia electorate, it was probable if not BLOODY OBVIOUS that Democrats could win only with narrow margins.
I keep hearing people say this due to Walker’s obvious mental issues, but hyper partisanship is still a thing, and while getting more competitive, it’s still a Republican leaning state, and GOP state office holders from Kemp on down won reelection rather easily.
If they had nominated a less insane and less obviously flawed candidate, Warnock probably would have lost by several points.
Sure, Walker was a terrible candidate and in a normal world, he should've lost by more.
But nothing has been normal recently, so why do we continue to act surprised?
Honestly, what have we seen in the past four elections that would dictate a RUNOFF senate election in GEORGIA wouldn't be close?
And honestly, a 3% win for a Dem in GA in a landslide.
It's a big win for the Dems.
Celebrate and build off of it instead of being upset by the margin of victory.
