Edit: it was pointed out to me that intent is nebulous, well, here's what NOT NEBULOUS.
Trump's camp knew he had these documents and stalled on returning them.
That stall is willful retention.
You know you have the documents, are asked they be returned, and don't.
The don't part, THAT'S the crime.
Biden found the documents and returned them immediately, no willful retention, no crime.
Excuse me.
I misspoke, I'll edit my original comment.
See my other comments about willful retention.
Trump was informed he had the documents and delayed to the point a search warrant was executed.
Biden returned the documents as soon as discovered.
Biden returning the documents when they were discovered and didn't need a search warrant to get them back to NARA, is the crucial difference between these two cases.
Right before the midterms Biden himself forgot about some incriminating documents and left them for randos to find.
Ultimately Biden messed up here, though not anywhere near to the degree of Trump's document handling.
It looks like a mistake at this point but goes to show the need for a better system of document retention.
I also wish there was better tracking on these documents.
They should know when lots of documents are missing.
If libraries can keep track of books certainly the government can track classified documents.
