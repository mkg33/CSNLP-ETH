There was an MP who was an open critic of legalising and decriminalising cannabis, whose husband owned is the managing director of one of the largest producers of medicinal cannabis in the country.
Fellow Canadian, blows my mind that cannabis is still illegal in the UK (penalty up to 5 years in prison for possession), while we can just walk into any of the dozens of legal stores in our cities and buy it.
Are there seriously still people in the UK who are arguing things like "legalizing this addictive substance will result in mass unemployment and utter apocalypse on our roads because everyone will be stoned like they were in the scientifically accurate film, Reefer Madness?
".
Yep.
A dude who worked at my English company years ago got arrested, served like 6 months and was deported because he was drunk and the cops made him drug test, he failed and that is considered possession to them.
All that and he didn’t even physically have weed on him at the time.
I was put in a cell with two other dudes and at this time I barely spoke any Japanese.
The other dudes were in for a fight and for robbing houses, we kinda communicated by drawing on the carpet and broken English/Japanese.
They put you in like a small carpeted cell and you’re not allowed to lay down or talk in your full voice or do anything really.
They came around and gave me a book but the guard laughed at me and said “no English.” Other inmates and shit were all curious and looking at me like a zoo animal lol.
They had me sit in there for like 2 days and then they brought me to the prosecutor and you get a chance to plead your case.
(On the first day I got to speak to a lawyer and he said he would go ask the bar owner if I could pay him to drop the charges).
