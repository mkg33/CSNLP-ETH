Which kinda happened behind the scenes to help Pelosi secure the leadership previously when there were enough Progressive votes to block her.
This is what AOC meant when talking about how in other countries she wouldn't be in the 'same party' as many other Democrats.
They'd have their smaller 'progressive party' and then they'd form a coalition with the "Moderate/Center Dem Party' and that would be a power structure.
Except in a coalition government, the bigger party tends to have give real concessions to create that coalition.
Where there is really only one party, the part leadership end up dictating the terms because of the whole "who else are you going to vote for?"
issue.
Like in the UK, their parties get proportional representation, so the smaller parties will get SOME members that may be needed for teh coalition.
Edit: to add context, I wanted to show the number of parties in some countries that don't do first past the post (for 10 or more seats, I'm only counting House of Commons/Representatives equivalent):
While the money is a big part of it, the two party system is caused by our electoral system.
"First past the post" style voting (like the US has, where you win 50.1% of the vote you win everything) discourages the creation of smaller, niche parties in favor of having just two opposing parties (think about it, if you have a party that is supported by 20% of all voters you will likely never be able win by yourself, but join forces with another party that has 30% support and you kinda agree on things and boom, you've got a chance).
