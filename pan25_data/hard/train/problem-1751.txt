Hundreds of stray dogs are being brutally killed in Tangier in order to impress FIFA officials who are coming to assess Moroccoâ€™s World Cup bid this week, animal rights activists have told The Daily Beast.
Campaigners say the animals have been shot or poisoned on the streets of the coastal city found at the juncture of Africa and Europe.
Many of the slaughtered dogs were tagged with yellow earmarks to show they have already been neutered and rabies-vaccinated.
They are not pets, as you describe them; they carry rabies, a British tourist died as a result of it recently.
They also do not travel alone, but rather in groups of 15 to 30 and attack children/people.
I had to be extremely cautious where I used to study because there is no cure for rabies and it's the closest thing to a zombie virus, one scratch without a vaccine and you're dead (NSFW Alert, ).
It can be done in a more humane manner, sure, but come on people... Morocco lacks the resources of Western countries, so please feel free to adopt dogs from North Africa; it will certainly help us (Sara Morocco is a starter).
I think I am done with Reddit when the human life is being described as not a big of a problem LOL.
It is a problem and if you live in Morocco you would know that stray dogs have been an issue for years now taking 50 lives yearly.
