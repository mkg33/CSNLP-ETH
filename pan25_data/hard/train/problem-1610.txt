Which doesnâ€™t matter in any event.
If one side is still fighting there was never a ceasefire, if the Russians wanted one, and Ukraine said no it would be silly to expect any side to honor it.
Ukraine never agreed to, and is under no obligation to honor a ceasefire in a war which they're defending themselves against an aggressor.
Russia is desperate for a breather, Ukraine is under no obligation to give them one, And Ukraine is within their rights to never have diplomatic relations or deals with Russia ever again.
Every promise, treaty and agreement made by Russia has been broken, Russia invaded them.
Russia never had any intention of honoring a ceasefire.
It's all talk.
Russia acheived the monumental task of making even the Americans and Chinese look more credible with the amount of bold faced lies they spout.
All this talk of Offering ceasefire is just more propaganda from a Genocidal terrorist regime that's trying to play itself off as the reasonable party.
Right after they got done washing their hands from raping babies and castrating POWs.
