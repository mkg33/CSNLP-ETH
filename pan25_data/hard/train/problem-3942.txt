Russia's blustering has reached the point of absurdity.
If I were advising strategy for the U.S. & Europe, I would contend that they are indeed a paper tiger, and to call their bluff.
For every announcement that Russia makes threatening vague, but grave consequences for the support of a NATO country, (like releasing video of an icbm missle with multiple warheads being loaded into a silo), I would counter with a brief and consistment statement which states NATO will continue to provide any support they deem fit to assist Ukraine to regain their illegally annexed land.
Period.
Further China has made it perfectly clear to Russia that if they launch a nuke, China is no longer on board.
Despite Russia's claims of their "enduring partnership" with China, it's just more posturing.
I know that Russia continually reminds us that their country has the ability to precipitate world destruction.
And we would risk nuclear war with such a provocative statement.
But I am convinced that the explanation for the continuous and innumerable threats are evidence of their impotence.
And I do not believe the Russian military would follow orders to launch a preemptive nuclear attack.
If Russia was to use nukes sure nato should respond, but it must be incremental pressure based on the provocation.
If Russia is warning about something, it is a sure indication that it should continue.
When Russia applauds something, it's best to double check if it's the right thing to do - more than likely, it isn't.
This blows my mind that we have as much pro- Russian sentiment in this country as we do now.
