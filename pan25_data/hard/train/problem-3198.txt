They have established a fairly advanced set of air bases and air defenses on their artificial island chain in the South China Sea, the biggest threat to their dominance of that region would immediately be US submarines that could launch missiles to destroy those defenses and sink their ships.
I don't think we will go to war anytime soon, their air force isn't quiet capable enough yet, but they are definitely getting prepared for a war.
Their stealth technology is much like Russia's stealth, mostly a paper tiger.
The US F-22 is DECADES old and they have not even came close to that level of technology and stealth yet.
The F-35 is not as stealthy, it's more a mass produced plan to be all around capable but will still smash anything they have.
I truly believe what we know about as the public is a far cry as to our actual capabilities in the US.
The US has been decades ahead of everyone for a long time and I think we have things that would blow most people's minds by this point, I'd say we have some extremely advanced aircraft that not many people know about.
In a war with China air power is what it's going to come down to and they just aren't there yet.
I think they are still 5-10 years from even duplicating a plane like the F-22 and it will be well over 30 years old by then.
This is the Chinese testing satellites that can detect submarines.
Google "lasers detect submarines" and a number of articles pop up about their research going years back and some about their satellite with this capability.
I think they are less concerned with aircraft carriers due to anti ship cruise missiles/ballistic missiles potentially being able to overwhelm their air defenses and sink them.
Gotta be testing our air defense systems seeing if we'll reveal something crazy they didnt know we had or testing response times and detection capabilities.
