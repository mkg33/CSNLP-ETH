Desantis and Abbott are definitely more fascist than Trump.
He did some scapegoating of immigrants and Chinese, but you could tell his heart was never really in it.
He mostly just did it for attention.
Desantis is way more blatant about creating scapegoats.
All this “groomer” rhetoric happened after Trump was out of office and he was never smart enough to come up with it.
Trump enacted the plan to separate families at the border, but he didn’t come up with it and never talked about it publicly.
Desantis and Abbott conspired to send asylum seekers to vacation islands in the north with no services, and even to Nancy Pelosi’s house.
As a cruel stunt.
He pushed the “groomer” rhetoric.
He scapegoats people who are the least visible in society because they have no power to fight back and because it’s safe for his supporters to hate them.
The new Right have the potential to be the most evil force we’ve seen in the country since race riots and Jim Crow.
I fear a Desantis regime a lot more than another Trump presidency, but of course that’s like saying I’d rather step in cow shit than eat dog shit.
I have the same dread about DeSantis now as I had about Trump when he won in November 2016.
A lot of shit went sideways during Trump's presidency but it wasn't as catastrophic as I was expecting, and we have his incompetence and planet-sized ego to thank.
I was of the opinion that the damage Trump would cause would be genuinely insurmountable but thanks to the Republican party being full of fucking mindless dipshits it wasn't as bad as it could've possibly been.
It was still terrible but you could've imagined how much more fucked it could've been.
