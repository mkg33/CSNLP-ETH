The article does a good job of Sweden acquiescing to Turkey's demands, including handing over a 'terrorist' and dropping its arms export ban to Turkey, even as Turkey continues to make humiliating demands: firing a minister who attended a PKK rally ten years ago; demanding the names of rally attendees who criticized Erdogan; demanding the extradition of people who were granted asylum decades ago.
No other country has made demands of Sweden.
I think there's a number of demands Erdogan could have made where we could write it off as realpolitik (e.g.
such as lifting the arms ban to Turkey, or providing for trade concessions), but these are demands that go against core values of Sweden.
>In September Sweden lifted the arms export ban to Turkey, and in August it agreed to hand over a man whose name featured on Turkey’s “terrorist” list.
The Swedish government insisted, however, that the handover was in line with regular legal proceedings, and that the decision to extradite the man had not been influenced by Sweden’s aspirations to join NATO.
To be fair, from a practical perspective, Sweden and Finland are already EU members and basically for anything that Sweden and Finland would get from a defense perspective as a formal member of NATO, they are already defacto getting.
Nato is an extremely powerful military alliance; there's very little benefit to turkey of bringing sweden/finland in, only a risk of increase in tensions with their neighbour.
It shouldn't be assumed it's always the right thing to do to expand your alliance.
