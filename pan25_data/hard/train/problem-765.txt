Some think Putin wants a no man’s zone separating Russia from Eastern Europe.
Basically a place that’s so fucked it makes it harder for nato to invade.
Plus Putin wants some of the land.
Maybe he wants the natural resources or he wants slaves to work for mother Russia same as the old Satellite states.
Why would Russia try and capture Ukraine as intact as possible if not to take its resources?
Why would Russia, famously lacking in shipbuilding capacity, go to great lenhs to capture the home of shipbuilding in the USSR?
Why would one of the first actions of 2022 be to secure water supply for Crimea.
Getting control of Crimea, and it's water supply was critical to continue using Crimea as a naval base.
Getting a hold of its natural gas reserves and rare earth minerals would secure Russian income for decades yet.
Taking the farmland would give Russia a real shot at dominating the food supply to large swathes of Africa and Europe, given that Russia and Ukraine is the breadbasket of Europe.
Yeah yeah, Russia is inept and corrupt, but Ukraine would have been a real goldmine for Russias economy, short and long term.
That would have been incredibly counterproductive, at least in the beginning phases of the invasion.
Russia was struggling economically before the invasion and Ukraine sits on a lot of natural resources.
Completely destroying all it's infrastructure would make Ukraine more expensive than useful for Russia.
The initial plan failed horribly, so now Russia is "forced" to destroy that opportunity for Ukraine.
Of course, these days it's a campaign of terror, because Russia has no chance at winning in any other scenario.
The public is against them and they are outmatched militarily.
For Russia to win, they must outlast Ukraine and Western military aid.
For Russia to hold any ground in Ukraine, they must be so terrible to dissenters that the entire population is effectively silenced or utterly destroyed.
