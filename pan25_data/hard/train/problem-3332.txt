Trump tore stuff up and shredded stuff, but destroying presidential documents is literally a crime so the White house Historian spent a lot of time taping the torn up and shredded papers back together again.
Trump had a habit of tearing up government documents that by law should have been preserved for the national archive before putting them into burn bags.
The staff, in turn got in the habit of going through those bags and reassembling these documents jigsaw-style.
Someone getting angry or frustrated and tossing a document into a fireplace is understandable…doing it on average of twice a week for weeks on end is an indication Meadows didn’t even want White House staff to know the contents, probably because if the staff did see the contents they would feel obliged to report it.
Sure they get incinerated.
The White House staff has access to burn bags which are exactly what they sound like.
That’s an entirely different animal and while the documents might be gone, if Hutchinson’s testimony can be corroborated that’s reason enough for a court ordered subpoena….one of those jobbies that gets you locked up for contempt if you decide not to show up….I still don’t understand why a congressional subpoena somehow doesn’t….
