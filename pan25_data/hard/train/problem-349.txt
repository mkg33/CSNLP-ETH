When I was 16 and the '90s I had to answer a bunch of psychological questions to work at my local big grocery in St. Louis.
And with that license you should have to see a psychologist a couple times a year to make sure a person is mentally stable to own a firearm like a 2-hour test or just a 2-hour talk.
And also mandatory firearm safety class before you own one, and also proper maintenance because a broken or not properly maintained firearm is a dangerous firearm too.
I am guessing this law will get stuck down since it basically says ANY semiautomatic rifle is banned from being sold and all existing ones have to be registered since there is the part about "a shroud attached to the barrel or that partially or completely encircles the barrel, allowing the bearer to hold the firearm with the non-trigger hand without being burned, but excluding a slide that encloses the barrel".
That language basically says forend...like the kind found on basically ANY rifle.
As for selling a gun, we would have to open NICS for that AND have a system which gives a record for the sale without directly recording WHAT has been sold (to prevent a registry).
Guns that are sold in the private market are not, nor is there a requirement in most states to do background checks or transfer records of firearms purchases like there is with dealers.
Limiting a gun to 10 rounds and the like accomplishes a lot less than actually adding more hoops to jump through and actually enforcing background checks on all types of sales.
