Letting a 7 year old explore the internet without guidance and oversight is like letting your child run loose to wherever they want in the outside world.
I would say limited internet access for anyone under 16, maybe even 17, I don't think it should be law but I wish more parents were more proactive with their kids.
Also ITT: Parents who don't want to interact with or parent their kids, and distract them with phones to avoid parenting their children.
Kids shouldn’t have messaging apps at all up to a certain age.
After that, you either let them have their own device or not.
Helicopter parenting is a terrible way to raise a future adult.
The issue is having all of humanity having direct access to children.
It was always bad to let TV raise your kid, and there’s a litany of issues it leads to if left unchecked, but smartphones are a million times worse with unrestricted access and unrestricted content plus billions of dollars to be made off exploiting these poor kids.
Same with the terrible parents that let tv raise their kids, there will be lots of adults soon who are poorly adapted to normal life.
It won’t be the whole generation, but it’s definitely going to result in a lot of poorly functioning adults.
