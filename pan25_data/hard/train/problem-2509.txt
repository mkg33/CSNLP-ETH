The other wants to tear gas mexican children in diapers and kill raped 10 year olds who want to get a abortion.
Even if forcing it to term kills both child and "mother" for the 'pro life' party that shouts death to the 10 yr olds or 'rape is always THE girl's fault!
She must have worn something revealing!"
Like damn it's a child and they're trying to victim blame a raped 10 yr old.
WTF??
?.
Can't you see both sides are the same?
Why should someone who wants to give people access to a better education, worked their way up on the american dream, highly educated, cares about the poor and needy get a vote over the person who wanted to commit tax fraud and leave his own voters dead, dying in the cold and infected with the plague, and watching his own voters die.
It's sad.
The adage of "A ignorant vote is worth as much as much as a educated vote" is very real.
People really unironically think tan suits and mustard on a democrat is equivalent or more severe than murder encouraged by a republican when they shout out "BOTH SIDES are the SAME!
".

Your PTSD is warranted - but not even his family or favorite government toadies will stand with him now.
He is damaged beyond repair, and will never hold a position of authority again.
