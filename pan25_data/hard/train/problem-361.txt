lol no.
Their first priority will always remain winning the elections.
The ones who are complaining about bad quality candidates are the ones who simply want to fault Trump for the loss since he backed many of these candidates.
What \will\ teach them that gerrymandering is bad is if Democrats get into a position to redistrict to favor them instead, and that's completely fair game at this point as far as I'm concerned.
And then after they elect that speaker, a few GOP members change their mind about the speaker for not getting assigned to their promised committees and then vote to replace them, along with the Democrats.
Get rid of the gerrymandering that turned some potentially competitive seats into protected Republican seats and we'd already be saying "Speaker Jeffries".
I mean, this is a group that believes compromise, at least with the Democrats is a bad thing, and proves you aren't a true Republican.
I wouldn't be surprised if they are now using that purity test within the party itself.
