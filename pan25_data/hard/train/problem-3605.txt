His family is disfunctional as hell.
Wife left him, one daughter hates him (and gave signals she supports Navalny), his other kids try to not show any connection to him.
Nah, people from reddit definitely knows everything about Russia and Ukraine.
They predicted default in Russia with 100% accuracy!
It would happen any day now (it's still spring, right?
).
this is very true.
honestly, if he isn't assassinated by the Wagner group, or a guard of his that decides to be a martyr, this is most likely how it's all gonna end.
we do have missile defense systems that could do it, but they'd have to deploy the most advanced missile defense systems we have to every town and bigger in the US to have reliable coverage, and even then we'd only end up detonating the nukes higher above the cities than they were intended, still causing an obscene amount of deaths.
while it is possible we do have defense systems capable of taking out nuclear warheads before they come in range of causing serious harm, we would hear about it by now either by them alluding to it or by outright stating they do, as the US loves boasting their tech, especially Russia.
Risking a direct nuclear attack due to invading a breakaway Russian state versus attempting to stabilize the situation via diplomacy is a no-brainer.
And again, a second Russian civil war where nobody knows who controls the nuclear arsenal would be a threat to the safety of human civilization and the entire world.
Not a scenario we want to end up in.
