No, it's not unconstitutional.
In fact, many states have required gun permits for many decades.
Gun control has been ruled Constitutional time & again.
Considering for almost a century, most courts agreed that this was legal... then suddenly, a bunch of right-wing ideologues that were forced onto the Supreme Court through nefarious circumstances decide otherwise... yes, I'd say they're illegitimate hacks.
Yes, because the thing they voted for is unconstitutional, like when some states have overruled abortion bans because the state constitution held it as a right even though the Supreme Court managed to twist logic into a pretzel to claim it wasn't a right at the federal level.
114 is unconstitutional, and despite actually ruling properly in Bruen, this supreme court is most certainly not legitimate, Biden on the other hand, as shitty of a present as he is, is still entirely legitimate.
May issue permits have been in existence for many, many years & have never been ruled unconstitutional... until the current ultra-partisan, bought-and-paid-for, Christofascist, illegitimate Supreme kangaroo court ruled that way.
They're a disgusting abomination who've made a mockery of our judiciary.
Their rulings are purely ideological and far from based on the Constitution.
