I think the reason for this specifically is that by rejecting all federal funding, they have more freedom to teach what they want, and do not have to comply with federal regulations that go with getting federal money.
Two things that republican politicians oppose, in spite of their constituents relying on it: federal funding and public education.
They represent states that can't pull their own weight but want to make government less effective for the people they represent so that they can run on a platform of zero deliverables, oops only social grievances.
Public education is basically the only thread still holding pur society together and that's your biggest target if you object to living in a society.
But they would never raise taxes to make government programs work, they'd rather cut taxes in preparation for the federal funding to end so they can ridicule public schools for failing and usher in an era where they get to Fox-news the kids from kindergarten onward thru their parents via homeschooling.
