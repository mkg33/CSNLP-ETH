I hope we all don't sanction each other because everyone basically agreed with them regarding it not being the proper forum.
Have you looked at the joint statement issued when the G20 conference ended?
It states that the parties agree that it's not the right place to resolve security issues.
Because it's not the right forum to do so, as has been agreed upon by all attendees.
The conference ended on February 25 with a joint statement condemning the war which all participants other than China and Russia signed onto.
The part most relevant to sanctions:
Get a grip over yourself.
This article is 3 days old.
Except for China and Russia, all G20 members including India released a joint statement today condemning the war.
> Recognizing that the G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, we acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy.
India aint wrong here G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, India want to discuss russia and ukraine war but not about sanction , we want to discuss how war is affecting some poor countries and India is also urging other nation to give them some concession on debt.
People also forget that India and Russia have a pretty close relationship and just because there's some friction between India and China, it doesn't mean that India is suddenly a western lapdog who will do everything the west says esp if its against Indian interests.
Can we really blame India for looking after their own interests first??
We are talking about more than a billion people here and Russia is providing cheap oil right now, so unless the west somehow manages to supply India with millions of barrel of even cheaper oil than what Russia is providing, I don't think India is to be blamed..
