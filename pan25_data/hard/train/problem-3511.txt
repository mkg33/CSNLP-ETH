It just blows my mind that we're still talking about arresting people for marijuana.
Not only that, but just how starkly different the laws are state-by-state.
I drive by a number of dispensaries everyday here in Michigan, and it's people going about their business buying it with no cops in sight because it's fully legal.
The only debate here is whether cities and towns want to allow dispensaries in their communities.
Yep, I'm aware that Texas doesn't allow them which is why they remain in this conundrum.
I mentioned them because a vast majority of states that have legalized it have done it through ballot initiatives and victories like that have led the GOP to try and neuter people's ability to put these kind of things on the ballot.
Without it, in states dominated by the GOP, there's no hope of getting popular reforms like medical/legalized marijuana passed.
I'm all for legalizing recreational marijuana and it's legal in my state but I imagine having city laws that run in direct opposition to state law could create some major challenges.
Texas will unfortunately be one of the last states to legalize or make any meaningful progress on cannabis due to their part time legislature, recently enacted voter restriction laws that are clearly targeted at populations that tend to vote democrat, and their lack of a state-wide voter initiative/referendum process.
The latter point is really the key to meaningful progress on this issue in majority Republican states.
