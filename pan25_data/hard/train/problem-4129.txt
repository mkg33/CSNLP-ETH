The justice system moves at lightning speed when powerless people are involved.
When it's powerful people, then and only then do things slow down.
Why didn't they form a grand jury for Reality Winner?
Why didn't they subpoena people she talked to 2 years later?
How were they able to arrest Reality Winner within 4 days of finding out she leaked a single document?
Where was the long running criminal investigation?

Nope, just speaking to the reality of basically every federal criminal investigation ever.
Most take a painfully long amount of time, and much of it is because grand juries can only work so fast and can't schedule infinite depositions and proceedings.

Go figure, you’ve no idea what you’re talking about so you’ve fallen back on predictable teenage-esque smugness.
Yawn.
