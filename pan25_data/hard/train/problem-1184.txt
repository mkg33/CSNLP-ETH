The GOP won't do it because they'd lose Florida, with all of its anti-Castro Cubans.
The Dems won't do it because they'd be accused of being communist, which would sway centrists they rely on to win still.
It's that they extremely dislike socialism of any kind, due to their poor experiences in Cuba.
The feeling I get is that even the perception of socialism is enough to put them against something.
So, they vote very heavily for the GOP, and the party is afraid that if they lifted the embargo, that Florida would become a swing state again.
If the anti-Castro Cubans hate equal opportunity, they can still vote for the GOP and also favor lifting the embargo.
Their continued support for the embargo, which hurts their Cuban families back home, is a mystery to me.
The embargo is stupid, but Cuba would still have an awful government and economy without it.
The embargo is not what holds Cuba back, not by a long shot.
Even Cuba is becoming more capitalist these days.
I don't think real communism has ever existed, but every iteration that exists now is far from being the best attempt at it.
I don't think real communism has ever existed on a national level, no.
But it does exist on a business level.
There are true co-op businesses that exist, even in America.
Those are an example of workers owning the means of production and sharing in the profits of that production, which is ultimately what communism (as far as economic theory goes) is about.
