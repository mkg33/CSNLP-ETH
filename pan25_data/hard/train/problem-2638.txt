The Democrat is still behind by about 800 votes right now, but yesterday she was behind by 9,000 votes.
Experts are expecting that trend to continue as the last votes are counted based on where in the state most of the uncounted votes are from.
It's pretty likely that the Democrat will overtake the Republican in the next day or so and ultimately win, but it's too early to know for sure.
The chances of the democrats taking the house are improving but they’re still not the favored party to win.
Whoever takes the house will have an incredibly slim majority.
Like 1-3 seats at most.
Republicans are pretty much guaranteed to lose the Senate and the democrats chances of winning the House are improving.
This is an absolutely historic midterm for democrats which came after another history election in 2020 and another historic midterm in 2018.
The trend is showing that Republicans are in a lot of trouble going forward as their gerrymandering and voter suppression is working at its full potential and it still wasn’t enough to artificially create a red wave.
