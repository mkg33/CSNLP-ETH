But the bot was programmed the way it is based on the idea that tweets will be believed, so it's the same thing.
"Twitter claims that tweets from verified accounts are, in fact, verified accounts, which can therefore be believed to be legitimate sources, etc".
Indeed it's possible that a lawyer could argue that Twitter has a reputation and the verification check is used to say that this account is the actual account from the company or other entity.
By removing the verification process and not having proper means to protect the authentic account from malicious impersonation you could say that Twitter had gross negligence that led to material damage.
Literally the reason Twitter introduced authentication in the first place is because they got sued by corporations over impersonation that had resulted in damage to their corporate brand.
If this happens to more companies, class action lawsuit against Twitter for allowing users to officially impersonate others and do tangible damage to their bottom line sounds possible.
