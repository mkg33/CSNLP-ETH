Actually using Warnocks position as a Pastor against him (his church pays his bills, he makes a living just talking, "who would elect a man who never ran a business and does nothing but lie to people every Sunday").
Every single Christian I know (bar none) is harping on every rumored mistake Warnock has ever made in his life (rumored as in 75% of their claims are of course bullshit or exaggerated) while dismissing every Herschel Walker claim as "in his past" and "he's a man of God now".
I don't care that Warnocks a pastor as long as he doesn't try to force me to join his religion and the more Christians that reject their own people to elect people closer to Satan than Jesus doesn't seem sustainable.
Warnock winning doesn't hurt Christianity in and of itself but if Christians reject him, they are rejecting their own religious tenets, so not instant destruction but destruction none the less.
I think you missed my point that Warnock being elected and representing his faith and the attitudes of a true Christian is the only way to save Christianity in politics.
You are seeing the end of Christianity while I am seeing its protection and redemption.
