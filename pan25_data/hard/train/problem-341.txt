In the case of Ukraine, that second point isn't even relevant because the production that keeps Ukraine in this war isn't happening in Ukraine.
It's also much easier for NATO governments to justify providing more assistance to Ukraine if Russia indiscriminately murders civilians, making this whole thing an even worse idea than it normally is.
Strategic bombing famously if the goal is to demoralize the population into surrender, and only works if the bombing is sustained and constant if the goal is to damage war production capacity.
Attacking civilian populations is a war crime for good reason: it's effective and is a cheap/obvious strategy for anyone who does not care if the enemy population lives or dies.
It's for truly evil people.
This is pure terrorism, which benefits Russia in many ways.
Strategically, it diverts a lot of Ukrainian resources towards protecting and evacuating civilians from areas where they should be pretty safe, away from the front lines.
Russia wants to disrupt Ukraine's advantages on the battlefield (better training, better equipment, higher morale, stronger will to fight) by keeping them spread thinly and reacting to civilian catastrophes.
