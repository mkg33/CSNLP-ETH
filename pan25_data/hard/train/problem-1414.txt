The only similarity here is that documents are involved.
The amount of documents, cooperation with DOJ & Archive, and return of the documents is all different.
10 documents Biden's lawyers notified DOJ and the National Archive of and handed over.
Verses 325 documents DOJ and the National Archive had to notify Trump's lawyers of and then Trump refused to return.
Trump was contacted multiple times by the National Archives and the DOJ and refused to return them or cooperate.
That Trump repeatedly refused official document requests and lied to the government about what he had doesn't seem to phase them.
Trump's refusal to return the Documents and lying about not having them is in itself a crime.
It wouldn't matter whether the documents were Secret or Top Secret.
If Trump had the documents, kept them safe, and gave them back when asked, I personally wouldn't care.
Having documents isn't the crime Trump is accused of.
Refusing to return documents and obstructing efforts to retrieve documents is the crime Trump is accused of.
