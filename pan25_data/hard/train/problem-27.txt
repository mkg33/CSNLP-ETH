Never understood the hate for calculus, math in general, physics or chemistry.
Somehow I always understood that.
Languages on the other hand.. shudders.
Nah, the pope said the laws where unjust, but like with all popeganda, they want to make this superstitious bigot sound not as sociopathic as all the previous bigots.
Nah, The Council of Trent taught that "those who commit infidelity,...fornicators, adulterers, effeminate, liers with mankind, thieves, covetous, drunkards, railers, extortioners, and all others who commit deadly sins" lose sanctifying grace.
The council also taught that hell is eternal punishment.
He still believes homosexuals deserve to burn in hell for eternity, and you say that's the best he can do.
So basically the Pope said that gay people will definitely burn in pain in the afterlife for eternity, but will not be criminally charged for it while they are alive?
But it is a sin for christianity, so he's ok with it not being a crime but it's ok for them to go to hell forever in the afterlife?
That's...confusing, or god sent an email asking to update sins to 2023 vibes?
