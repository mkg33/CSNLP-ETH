It's the same reason Iran is killing celebs/athletes.
Those with followings have a much larger audience than the average citizen, so it sends a bigger message.
Allowing them to speak out or flee the country is a huge hit.
I mean, this is the country that uses wave fighting, and although I'd expect their Special Forces to have a better command structure .. it's not a gimme.
True, it could also be that Russia decided airstriking their own men was worth it or unintentional and this is just their cover up story.
Considering both the personal and professional conduct we've seen out of the Russian military this year, I'm almost certain the above is pure fantasy and what actually happened was the Russian air force botched an airstrike and they had to come up with a way to cover that up.
As for the conscripts, they have many off ramps before killing and raping men, women, and children.
They do not deserve sympathy.
You're assuming any of it ever actually happened, which is rather a lot considering the propensity of the Russian government to never tell the truth under any circumstances.
