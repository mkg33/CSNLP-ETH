I wouldn't put it past Trump's cult to have at least one follow who's crazy enough to try and assassinate DeSantis or anyone else who looks like they might beat Trump in the primary.
Man... can you imagine if DeSantis creamed Trump in the primary and in a fit of rage, Trump ran a third party spoiler campaign?
You know that would be just like him.
It would be such a beautiful trainwreck.
I think that a 2024 campaign would be a sad desaturated echo of his 2016 showing, but I can almost guarantee he's going to try even if just to try to fend off being charged for everything that's currently brewing.
Right now he no longer has the power of the executive branch to shield himself, and until now he's been able to count on the Republican establishment to a degree, but it seems that's going away.
His options are narrowing and the only way they widen again is to revive his political career and get some power back.
There's always going to be some (like my boomer Mom, I'm sad to say) that will still donate whenever he asks.
That plus the media's tendency to give him free air time would probably be enough to cause plenty of trouble.
