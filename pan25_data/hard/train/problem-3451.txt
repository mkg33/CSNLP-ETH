The growing list of people that have testified in Fulton have made this one of the highest profile state criminal investigations in American history.
It includes:
The DA is supposedly weighing election fraud, conspiracy, oath of office violations, racketeering and other offenses, and indicated a decision on charges could come as early as the end of the year.
Sort of.
The fifth can still be invoked to protect you from incrimination in a grand jury, but it's not a "get out of testimony card" that many believe it is.
Depending on the case being civil or criminal, pleading the fifth can be seen/viewed as abject inference and an implication of guilt which is up to the jury.
Adverse inference on pleading the 5th is a thing for civil trials, but I don't think it works at all for criminal proceedings, kind of goes against the concept.
In a trial the jury is instructed to draw no conclusions from someone pleading the fifth, it canâ€™t be used as a reason to convict someone.
In a grand jury they are told that if someone pleading the fifth creates a greater probability a crime was committed they can indict based on that fact.
