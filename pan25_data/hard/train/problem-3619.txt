Where you start having issues is when people begin to suspect that you might actually have a plan that you intend to enact.
The government is especially sensitive to threats against public officials but if everyone who merely said, "let's shoot Biden" were instantly guilty of a crime... well let's say that the ethnographic composition of America's prison population would change real fast.
If the US Secret Service believes you are actually organizing a specific plan to shoot Biden, you may very well get a visit from them.
"Death to Biden" is not an illegal statement to make, although it is controversial and could very well get you an FBI or SS visit.
Even saying that you wish Trump was executed by a red-hot sword being shoved up his ass is not an illegal statement to make.
Explicit threats, or the explicit encouragement of violence, is generally illegal.
Wanting someone dead or expressing that view is not by itself illegal.
Saying “death to” should never be protected speech IMO.
People need a better way to express political beliefs.
The problem is that if a group of people start chanting “death to X”, then there will be some nutjob out there who didn’t get the memo that they were just speaking figuratively.
