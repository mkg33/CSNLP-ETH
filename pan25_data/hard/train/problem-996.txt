Exactly, they’ve never stop being bigots, they simply rebranded their bigotry.
Just as they did during and after the civil rights movement.
I tell people all the time, don’t forget the bigots hitting and spitting on black people trying to sit at white lunch counters are still here and their ideology hasn’t changed.
Attacking people for quoting Biden's multiple well-documented racist statements from his decades in public life doesn't make them go away.
It amounts to reality denial.
When people do that about bigotry it has bad results and very specific political valence.
Thanks very much for proving my point.
The willingness to defend Biden's bigoted statements is deeply corrosive to any kind of politics that tries to advance racial justice.
It's also important to remember that Joe Biden in contrast to Trump's views has even said in an attempt to gain black voters.
“I’ve had a great relationship.
In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India.
You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.
I’m not joking.”.
However I will humor you and sit this one out.
You've already decided to do my thinking and talking for me anyway.
