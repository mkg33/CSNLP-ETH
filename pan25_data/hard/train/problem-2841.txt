I find it more ridiculous that there is no mandatory ethics training and attestation that they will abide, no ethics codes or laws that apply to them.
I’m all for having no requirements to be an elected official.
Who knows more about the needs of the working class than someone from the working class?
I’d just want that person to be held to reasonable levels of standards of behavior and ethics - whether that’s homicide as in your example, or insider trading and benefiting from conflicts of interest like mine.
The difference is homicide is already illegal, but the other isn’t, not for Congresspeople.
It would be the easiest thing in the world to just categorize congresspeople as federal employees, under a special pay band of the GS scale or something, and copy-paste the rules that apply to over 100k other feds.
But they get to vote against their own regulation.
It’s bullshit.
It's not bullshit.
It is, perhaps unfortunately, the Constitution of the United States, which seems to have been written with the idea that the will of the voters and the very basic qualifications listed override all other concerns.
Technically there's nothing stopping a psychopathic convicted mass murderer from getting elected if there are enough people willing to work to get them on ballots and then vote for them in the election.
