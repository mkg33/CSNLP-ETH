some speculate that is the real prize here.
Russia's population has been tanking for a while, and that paints a pretty bleak picture for the future of the empire; taking Ukraine would do a lot to reverse this.
Actually, it might be surprising to hear but one of the biggest reasons Russia invaded Ukraine might be to increase its population, due to demographic collapse.
I know Ukraine isn't much better and has been worse than Russia, but I think from what I've read the plan is the usual - relocate Russians, then encourage them to have kids and take over the local area etc.
All that rape during the raw probably doesn't hurt either.
It's probably not significant enough to make a dent in the huge demo collapse but multiple tactics add up in the end.
Especially if they're prisoners or other "undesirables" you'd be happy to lose in society anyway, and I'm sure in a twisted way, Putin manages to make some loyalists out of this process, even if they were super anti establishment, they've been given a get out of jail free card and the opportunity to be as sadistic as they like in another country.
Honestly, the use of prisoners and ethnic minorities from eastern regions feels like a state sponsored form of ‘suicide by cop,’ whereby the Russian government is using the Ukrainian war as a way to eliminate undesirable populations without doing it themselves.
Don’t need to pay to keep a prison open in Siberia if the prisoners are all dead!
