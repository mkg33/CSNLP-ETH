Rabbis are not priests.
Judaism hasn't had priests for nearly 2000 years.
Rabbi means teacher and they are advisors to observant Jews on how to follow the Law of Moses.
So, a rabbi advising the Jews in his community that "doing this thing that is normally forbidden on Shabbos is both allowed and a Good Thing" is his job, even if it would be obvious to observant Jews.
Edit: I want to add that my initial comment was to say that I don’t believe any sane Jew would refrain some saving lives in a disaster scenario because of Saturday and that this Rabbi is simply posing.
The argument that Jews are in fact allowed to help the victims of the earthquake and that’s a good thing is like praising someone for not being a total asshole, where I would argue that it’s the absolute minimal requirement to not be a terrible human being.
More to the point, if religious Jews are still helping sift through the rubble two months after the earthquake, there would be no expectation that doing so would save lives (even if it's still important work).
The helpers would at that point be expected to refrain from their work on Shabbat.
I think you may be letting your biases color your view.
The issue is similar to the difference in common law between shooting someone because they’re about to set off a bomb and shooting someone because they gave you a bad haircut.
We have a rule that you’re generally not allowed to shoot someone but we make narrow exceptions for exigent circumstances.
