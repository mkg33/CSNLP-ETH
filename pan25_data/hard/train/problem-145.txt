Yes.
Even just Polish Soil would be enough for them to invoke Article 5, however on a practical level they may be unlikely to do so over soil.
Dead people on the other hand… that’s a much bigger deal and much more likely to consider it an attack.
Which mean they would have a right to invoke article 5.
Welp… seems to me like this could qualify for invoking A5 if true.
So up to the Polish government if that’s how they want to treat this.
I mean even so, this may still be A5’d.
Less likely to be sure, but NATO already made it clear any fallout reaching NATO soil is a red line.
And a stray missile is more direct than fallout….
If their missiles are so untrustworthy that there is a risk to neighbouring countries then they shouldnt ben using them period.
If i'm aiming rubber bands at my little brothers head and accidentally hit the sleeping pitbulls nutsack next to my little brother then i may have had nothing to gain and yes, it might have been and accident, but i shouldnt be surprised if there are consequences.
Accountability is a thing you know, who aims unreliable missiles next to a NATO country.
What a nutty thing to do.
