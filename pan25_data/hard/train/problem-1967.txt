And a lot of times they’re just conservatives who want to be quirky.
Ben Shapiro I think considers himself a libertarian, even though he’s pretty vocally against a lot of civil liberties, weed, etc.
Can confirm; I am a libertarian and also a moron (although I do support industry regulation; don’t care about corporate liberties, only personal liberties.
Still a moron though).
I think maybe because right wing libertarians dominate the media around libertarians people forget that left wing libertarians are a thing too.
I’m a left wing libertarian; I don’t care much about private ownership, happy to pay taxes and industry regulation is good.
I do care about my personal liberties and those of citizens in general.
I think maybe left wing libertarians tend to care about personal liberties whereas right wing libertarians extend that to corporations.
Taxes are great because they are a method of redistributing wealth to level the playing field as it were for those who don’t have means from those who have more than enough.
I don’t want to preserve unjust hierarchies, actually the opposite!
