Or, to put it another way, how exactly could we get politicians to create and enforce that law without first reducing corruption by voting out the ones who are corrupt and voting in new ones who aren’t?
The problem is that we don’t have an active, educated electorate and politicians who are blatantly corrupt will get re-elected.
If we actually ousted corrupt politicians, the corporate sector jobs for them (and their aides) would dry up.
Corrupt people will always find another method to be corrupt, rather than try to legislate against a method, we need to elect people who aren’t corrupt.
It’s not that politicians moving into private sector is bad, it’s the corruption that comes from politicians listening more to the private sector future jobs than their current elected/appointed one.
The solution is far simpler (if not easy), it involves an active, educated electorate that votes out politicians who seem more in bed with corporate interests than their constituents.
Neither of these existing options are actually problems in and of themselves.
They both open the window for different types of fucked up corruption, but they aren’t corrupt in and of themselves.
The good old boy connection and corruption isn’t quite the positive flex they are trying to paint it as.
These people are all crooks.
Doesn’t matter what party they claim to be.
