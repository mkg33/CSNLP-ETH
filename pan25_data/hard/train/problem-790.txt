The jet is a reconnaissance plane, painted white.
It does not spy, spying means the jet is flying over sovereign territory without permission.
The two definitions are very important, especially when China wants the phrase used to remove credibility from the RC-135's actions, which are actually surveillance.
If you go back through historical flights (Rivet Joint), you will see that this jet flies very predictable and deliberate routes.
It does not fly directly at borders, never turns toward an adversarial nation, flies constant air speeds, and doesn't even change altitudes very often.
Look at the color of a U2, the jet originally flew above SAM coverage OVER sovereign territory without permission.
The same of the SR71, both of which were once dubbed spy planes.
For political purposes the definitions are very important, as a crew forced to land in an adversarial nation from a reconnaissance aircraft vs a spy plane would require dramatically different lines of effort to retrieve.
One crew would be potentially charged with spying, the other would have the innocent circumstance of being forced (by nature, mechanical or hostile means) to land there (meaning no violation of international law has occurred).
Either crew in your scenario could be charged with spying if the violated nation wished to.
Nothing protects them other than the ill will of their nation.
