Well, they put in all that effort of destroying cities and lives.... they've EARNED land that isn't theirs... /s.
I hope the countries supporting Ukraine begin to realize that rationing weapons and supplies is NOT helpful.
Give them everything they need now and get started on NATO membership for Ukraine.
There's no way Ukraine gives up the opportunity to join NATO.
That's pretty important to national security at this point, since future NATO membership would be the only thing stopping Russia from trying again in a decade or so.
I addressed that in another reply, but suffice it to say, I doubt NATO promises would withstand Russia shutting off Europe's gas tap and/or Putin threatening to lob a few hundred warheads in their direction.
Once they've thrown Russia out of the borders, besides nuclear threats, what can Russia plausibly do to have any grounds on which to negotiate?
A broken army, increasing drone attacks into Russian territory, increasingly effective air defense over Ukraine, increasingly powerful Ukranian military... what are they going to do?
I'd jokingly say "bleed on them?"
but they've already gone past that in droves!
Cry perhaps?
After all those unnegotiable preconditions are met, talks can begin about a gradual reduction in sanctions and an end to Ukranian drone strikes against Russian military infrastructure.
