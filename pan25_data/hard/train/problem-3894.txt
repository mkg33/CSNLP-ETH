My favorite is that these are just regular weather balloons being released by grad students at like the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the Air Force is shooting them down because they're on edge and trigger happy.
I think you are right, except for the first part, they're probably just balloons launched by university aero clubs, not prototype defense vehicles.
Also, the other reason they don't wanna talk about it besides having realized they shot down pointless stuff is they don't want to admit NORAD has been filtering out balloons and the like on their radars for years because they assumed spy vehicles would come in the form of planes.
I believe some of them are launched with payloads like cameras, or instruments, that may be able to detach themselves and fall to the ground under a parachute for recovery, because as you say, you can't control an ordinary balloon or make it come down when and where you want.
Larry: Ah, the difficulty is, ah, this was an unauthorized balloon launch, and, uh, I know I'm in a federal airspace, and, uh, I'm sure my ground crew has alerted the proper authority.
But, uh, just call them and tell them I'm okay.
Also iirc, he launched prematurely.
Intending to give himself time to contact authorities he cut the first of his two tethers.
However after rising rapidly the second tether broke.
Pretty sure the first few things he tells his wife is to contact the authorities.
REACT: What information do you wish me to tell [the airport] at this time as to your location and your difficulty?
Well i don't know the details but I know in the full video he's insisting the ground "team" contact the "proper authorities".
