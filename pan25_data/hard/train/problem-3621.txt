That's not a projection.
That's a historical precedent.
Not a certain one by any means either.
Both chambers didn't flip to the opposition in 2018.
Or 2010.
538 predicted that the House would be pretty safely controlled by Republicans and the Senate would essentially be a coin flip that came down to a few races.
Which is exactly what happened.
What?
It's not semantics, you're just wrong.
I'm sorry you're upset about it.
Historical precedent is not a prediction and it's not consistent at all besides.
No they aren't.
The outcomes of the last few elections have been well within 538's predictions which use these polls.
On the flip side, Biden has more weaknesses than he did in 2020.
He's older, the economy is in rough shape (this might change by 2024 but who knows) and he has many other policy decisions to defend now.
Not to mention the chaos of the Ukraine war could go either way when it comes to American sentiment.
There were a few upsets in the House for races they thought were safe like Washinon's 3rd but that's hardly enough to say "polls are meaningless.
".
This is it.
Trump being on the ticket is going to do more for Biden than anything else.
And I'm here for it.
Could even help democrats retain the Senate.
