I really doubt DeSantis has a chance in a general.
His policies are very unpopular in most of America.
He's also not as slick as some make him out to be.
He's really easy to get angry for example.
He may be the best the GOP has to offer, but these days that doesn't mean much.
The only way he gets into office is if the GOP goes full populist.
They would have to finally read the room and realize that they have deeply unpopular policies, and that's the ones that aren't just genocidal at this particular moment.
The GOP just waltzed into a mine field by destroying women's reproductive rights.
Now COVID is taking more and more of a toll on the deciples of the Trump cult.
It definitely cost them this last election just from fatalities alone.
If it keeps going and they don't mask or vaccinate it will be even worse for them.
Knowing where things are likely to be at that point I don't even know if the GOP will exist.
If DeSantis runs people are going to see through him so much faster because of the very real pain Trump has inflicted on the nation.
He is under investigation for human trafficking.
I'm not sure if he's actually going to be free in a few months.
It seems like the DOJ is starting to get serious.
So what happens if both Trump and DeSantis are out of the mix?
DeSantis is just Trump 2.0 except he’s not a moron and could trick independents into thinking he’s not a fascist.
Nah this isn’t good news because any democrat should be rooting for Trump over DeSantis because Trump is so much more incompetent and would be much easier to beat.
Ehhh, I mean he's probably going to be a much better candidate than Trump and Trump barely lost in 2020 despite him mishandling... just about everything?
