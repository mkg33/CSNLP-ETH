I'll shout this for the cheap seats again... CONGRESS PASSED THE LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDED PPP LOANS That is why they happened.
That is why they are legal.
That is why they aren't being/can't be challenged in a court of law.
The legality and procedure behind the PPP program and that behind the student loan forgiveness plan is entirely different and done by two different branches of the federal government and why the student loan plan is challenged and will fail.
Congress has the power to allocate/spend money; the executive branch has no such power.
And if you want to tie that to the PPP loans being unfair/failing then you need to point your little finger of blame at congress.
I don’t have a a student loan,, but this will help a lot of Americans,,, if it doesn’t get passed then all the PPP loans should be paid back in full as of December 1st.
I mean I don't have kids, I don't qualify for the child tax credit so no one should get it, or I don't own a house so I don't qualify for house credit so no one should get it.
I don't own a business so I don't qualify for tax credits given to businesses, so no one should get it.
They don't but I think they will back Biden on this.
The plaintiffs are saying since they don't qualify for it no one should get it.
This would open a huge can of worms for the courts.
