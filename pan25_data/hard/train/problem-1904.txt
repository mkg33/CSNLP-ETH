I’ve only done one cruise as an adult, but it wasn’t so bad for my introverted self to relax.
Find a deck chair in a nice place, read a good book, and have the staff bring you fruity drinks.
Not a bad way to spend a day.
Its a good time actually.
Depends on the ship.
The oasis class feels kinda crowded but the Quantum class ships dont.
Its really not as bad as people like the moan about.
Obviously if youre taking a mid tier carnival ship compared to a royal carribean Quantum class your results may differ.
As a pure vacation it has a bad rap.
I would understand disliking it for enviromental reasons tho.
I wouldnt take every vacation on a cruise but people moan about it too much.
You get to be a fat ass and relax.
Eating and drinking all day.
Watching caberets and shows that normally i wouldnt go to.
Soaking, gambling.
Get a night where you dress up and pretend ur one if the rich guys on the titanic.
Its just like any resort really.
As far as a resort goes… the boat itself is the resort.
It’s crazy the stuff they have on these boats now.
I loved the few cruises I went on as a kid.
I don’t think I could do it now as an adult, but that’s not necessarily because of COVID.
