They buckled because they were in fear of losing their jobs and their power.
They lack integrity, morals, and any real authority and most importantly any ounce of patriotism.
So, what you're saying is, they lack integrity, morals, and any real authority and most importantly any ounce of patriotism?
Edit: You know who is genuinely and legitimately worried that Trump supporters would murder them and their families if they turned on Trump?
Nancy Pelosi.
And yet, somehow, she's found the courage not to support him.
I guess she has more of those things than the majority of the Republican party.
Politically, the GOP had no choice.
They would’ve had to tell their voters, “no, y’all are fucking idiots.” It would never happen.
No political party would do that, period.
I frankly don’t think the dems would do it were the roles reverse.
Pragmatically, they didn’t really have much of a choice if they didn’t want to blow up their own party.
Edit: the point I’m getting at here is that the GOP didn’t fall behind in for power and money.
They fell behind him because it was the only option other than blowing up their own party.
I’m not saying they literally had no other choice.
I said they did have a choice—self sabotage or make the best of it—just not a good one.
And while self sabotage was certainly the “right” thing to do, it’s not realistic.
