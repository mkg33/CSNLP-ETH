Yeah, and the fact that the countries around turkey are assimilated, colonized by them and also that every country around turkey is speaking only Turkish clarifies how a giant piece of shit Turkey is.
Well, Turkey has historically been a giant piece of shit to countries around it for hundreds of years before collapsing into multiple states, Turkey included.
Iâ€™m guessing it was due to generational hatred toward Turkey by past abused culture that motivated the arsonist.
Evils and intergenerational traumas and hatred is the visceral way in which we as a whole sort everything else.
All the things that every human has ever done regardless of morality is the natural state of humanity.
None of that is an endorsement or celebration of terrible things and acts.
I can't wait for the era of Star Trek kinda humanity where curiosity and empathy are the foundational points of the average person.
The speed of change is just a matter of perspective.
In 100 years the social consciousness and behavior of humans has changes dramatically in many ways.
