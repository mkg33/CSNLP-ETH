Similar national broadcasters are common in Europe.
For instance, Eurovision is organized by European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
Members of EBU are public broadcasters such as BBC.
BBC isn't a regular multinational corporation.
It's national broadcaster of UK and it's funded by UK government.
The BBC is owned by the UK government and does not make a profit or have shareholders.
It is incorporated in many countries as a private company for work it does there but they are all wholly owned by the parent in the UK which is owned by the state.
Given this status it's very unlikely it would deliberately engage in tax avoidance/evasion as (a) there is no motive for a public company to do so and (b) it would be an extremely bad look for the UK government as a whole.
BBC Worldwide's charter is to report the news and current events and make content about important current and historical topics.
They're not going to risk their journos losing access to a whole country over something as stupid as tax evasion.
