I’ve seen way too many cocky quotes on this subreddit talking about how DeSantis doesn’t stand a chance that I’m now convinced that he is going to be the next president.
Conventional wisdom is that DeSantis is the likely winner of the republican primary but I really don't think he's got the same sort of following as Trump.
Trumps people think he was robbed of his rightful second term and a ton of Republicans like DeSantis but don't think it's his time yet.
I wish.
Did he really lose that many voters over Jan 6th?
I highly doubt there are that many Republicans who wouldn't vote for him in the general in 2024 because of Jan 6th.
The Democrats are unlikely to show up in as high numbers as 2020 for Biden or anyone else the Dems attempt to throw out there.
I'm not getting cocky until Biden (or whomever the Democratic nominee is) gets sworn in on January 20 2025.
Bad news: As it looks today, Trump is the only Republican that can secure the nomination, and Biden is the only Democrat that could beat Trump.
