(I saw one documentary where a prisoner showed how women were raped with a "strap on" made from a belt and some markers or other object attached to the belt).
The first post says that there should not be an opportunity for a person who identifies as a woman but has a punishment to rape a woman in prison.
You responded, saying that rape is bad.
I respond that it's not any worse if their trans and their genitals should be where they go.
You threw a fit and accused me of argument fallacies while you constantly commit them.
Yeah, full swing hypocrite.
I hope you have a nice life bud, you'll need all the help you can get, my homie.
Okay?
There is no gaslighting.
My argument is that they should go to where their genitals are.
If you read to comprehend instead of argue you'd know that.
Putting someone who identifies as a woman but has male genitalia in a male prison is the same.
It's worse to pit one with a male genitalia in a woman's prison.
Or do you think that they're saints and would never sin because they're trans?
Why do you say that like it's any worse to get raped if you're trans vs. not?
They are not special enough to be exempt.
Complain about the prison system all you want, he'll I'm there with you.
But being trans doesn't make your experience with the subject any more important than everyone else.
