Yeah, it was a toss up between which link to post, either original source or secondary source that denies B the clicks.
But thanks for the info on the comments (and for braving the comment section!

"A few weeks ago, Breitbart News — the right-wing, hyperpartisan news site formerly run by Steve Bannon — published a truly galaxy brain column.
Editor-at-large John Nolte argued that Democrats have been promoting the COVID-19 vaccine not to save lives but instead to trick Republican voters into not getting the jab.
Nolte’s theory concluded that this, in turn, would lead to unvaccinated Republicans getting sick and dying from COVID-19, ultimately helping Democrats electorally.

Fascism never starts out as Fascism.
It starts as anger, often over inequality (real or imagined), then some hypnotic leader picks up the flag.
From that point, it is a steady and predictable path toward totalitarianism.
