Warographics on YouTube recently put out a good video about what this war means for the future of not only Russia, but the entire eastern european region itself.
The region is already a tinderbox waiting to blow, and one of the few things holding that together was a fear of Russia.
Now that Russia has been revealed to be much more vulnerable than previously assumed, and not willing to uphold their end of article 4 of CSTO (their version of NATO), it's started a bit of a chain reaction among Russia's neighbors , and we've seen some spark ups with previously cold conflicts.
When did Russia, currently our main geopolitical adversary, find representation among the top brass of the US Army?
There is no question that the support for this Russian aggression is much more coordinated and plentiful than the support for the previous Russian aggression.
Kind of makes you a question their commitment to treaties and peace doesn't it?
But all that being said does the general in the story really feel like he is honoring the meaning and letter of the agreement!
It's easier to tell other people to negotiate when you don't even fulfill your own obligations.
