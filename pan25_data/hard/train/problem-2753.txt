Why would I send a C17 full of HIMARS rockets to someone who is questioning whether Ukraine is worth fighting for?
I'd rather just send the rockets straight to Ukraine.

A.
The Kherson offensive took a LOT of troops.
They need recuperation of course, but sooner or later they'll be free again.
And with all the bridges across the Dnipro destroyed, a lot of them will be free to be deployed elsewhere.
D. So that would be a classical Ukrainian move."
OK guys, we've cut off all your supplies and we're bombing the shit out of you.
What are you going to do now?
".
Yes.
That’s why Ukraine wants Kreminna and Svatove.
A bunch of Russia’s supply lines go through there.
Liberate them, and it doesn’t matter as much what Russia does in Bakhmut as they will have trouble getting supplies to maintain that campaign.
It's really hard to defend Zhaporizhia Oblast due to the terrain.
If Ukraine can get past Russia's erected lines, it's trouble for what's left of the land corridor to Crimea.
Losing Kherson frees up 20000-25000 Russian troops but frees up 60000 Ukrainian troops.
Some will stay in Kherson to target Crimean supply lines but the rest can be spread out to the other fronts.
Ukraine could blitz from Melitopol to Berdyansk and cut off all the supply routes to the Russian military.
