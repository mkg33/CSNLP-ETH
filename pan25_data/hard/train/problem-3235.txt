The crazy thing is, I thought everyone knew who this guy was before he got into politics.
He's a con man and always has been.
He's literally a joke in business circles.
This is known.
This is not information that should have been discovered by anyone during his candidacy.
This is who he is.
This is who he always has been.
His bullshit has been in full, public view for decades.
But I can see how his reputation for endless shenanigans never really traveled too far outside of New York.
New Yorkers are more familiar with his bullshit than most.
And that stupid TV show really did wonders to spit-shine his image for gullible audiences.
Cohn was a fucking ghoul.
He taught Trump to weaponize the tort system to weasel out of debts and obligations.
He showed Trump how to run cons, and how to evade accountability when they implode.
When biden found documents he turned them over immediatly, trump lied for months about having them, then returned a few, and lied again about how many he had.
Remember when Biden and Pence's names kept coming up again every time a new tranche of documents was found in their possession after lying to try to keep them secret?
Me neither.
