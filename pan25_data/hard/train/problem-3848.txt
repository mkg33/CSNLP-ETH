So, eg.

A licensed professional providing a letter stating a procedure is medically necessary should be sufficient.
Sadly, I doubt there is.
Short of providing a full coverage, state funded, healthcare system we're stuck wiht insurance who's primary motive is always "how can we deny coverage"/.
It really is disturbing how much control "insurance providers" have over the medical care we can receive.
Tell me why that's not a damming indictment of insurance as a healthcare system?
"We have to let people suffer because otherwise insurance companies might not make as much money" is not the hot take you think it is.
This is the real comment, insurance companies are total trash and work to make money, not to improve lives, which should be their goal.
They are an intermediary to care that seems to know better than your physician despite no medical training.
