"The democratic president hasn't managed to deal with the massive deficit he inherited from us fast enough!
So now elect us again, so we can blow it up so large, that the next democratic president will fail to fix it entirely as well.
".
Yep.
Right wingers in Poland keep complaining that these deals were influenced by the USSR, and that they didn't get enough money out of it.
It's also seems worth noting that this was brokered by the USSR, which saw both Poland and East German as Soviet vassal states at the time.
But the frontier line was definitely made permanent by resettlement patterns and the breakup of the USSR...
It seems worth noting that, after the war, Poland received significant German territories, well over and above that taken by Germany in 1939.
The value of the territories ceded by Germany dwarfs the size of the reparations Poland demands now.
Which is, of course, precisely why the Polish government already agreed, shortly after the second world war, to waive any claims of reparations in exchange for these territories.
But, if you really wanted to return to the 1939 status quo ante, the territories would go back to Germany, and Poland would receive the monetary indemnity and whatever other forms of reparations are appropriate.
