People complaining about Cheney's ideology don't understand what a coalition speaker would mean in practical terms.
If you're concerned about Cheney's ideology, you don't understand what the speaker does generally or what she'd need to do in this coalition situation.
The only thing she'd be needed for is settling rules disputes, which I'm not worried about and you shouldn't be either.
Still better odds of moving their bills than they would have under actual GOP control.
And the actual mechanics of the legislative process would be a subject of negotiation.
They might choose to put a lot of that in the hands of committee co-chairs and devolve power from the speaker's office (more like old days legislating where committee chairs ruled their fiefdoms).
Every time the majority changes, you can get the fun of another messy leadership election, followed by all new committee chairs and new committee staff.
Its chaos.
(EDIT: Forgot office assignments!
).
Yeah.
Basically democratic bills wouldn't go forward, but neither would there be endless investigations into Hunter Biden and playing chicken with the debt ceiling.
Seems reasonable to me.
That's the first reasonable response i've seen in this thread.
Every other pro Cheney person keeps saying but "she's moderate so good" when she is the farthest thing from moderate she is a dyed in the wool ultra conservative.
Liz Cheney is as moderate as Republicans get, but she is no moderate.
She never voted with Dems on a single meaningful thing that didn't involve insurrection/treason.
