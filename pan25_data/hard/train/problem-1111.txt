Lawyers need to be sanctioned, and politicians should be liable both criminally and civilly for their actions.
Lake may have violated some Arizona election laws with some of the information she put on social media.
Show me where I said that, and you might have a point.
Trump won the electoral college and lost the popular vote in 2016.
That's not cheating.
Its just a stupid side effect of our election system.
There was lots of disinformation in social media in 2016.
Still not "cheating" because no votes were changed at the ballot and no collusion was proven.
There is virtually no voter fraud.
It's like saying the purified water you're drinking is "pure".
It's being pedantic to acknowledge <100 voter fraud cases in an election of 100+ million people.
If you choose to be dishonest and take a stance that there is no voter fraud, that is your choice.
I choose to admit there are some instances of voter fraud, just not enough to sway much more than maybe a small town city council election.
Uh huh.... and voter fraud occurs so infrequently and so insignificantly that when there is a problem it becomes national news like what some GOP operatives did in North Carolina.
What this really does, other than divide our country, is make it really hard for people with VALID claims of voter fraud to be taken seriously, because they get lumped in with these alt-right morons.
