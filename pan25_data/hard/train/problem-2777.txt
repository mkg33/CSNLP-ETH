It kinda is.
We're finding that isn't so uncommon and that's a problem.
Whether its Biden, Trump or anyone else, classified docs shouldn't just be lying around.
More to the point, it seems like Biden's own lawyers/staff are doing the searching and finding this stuff, and returning it/announcing it - as they should.
The contrast with Trump is stark.

The real crime is obstruction of justice in Trump's case: lying about having documents and refusing to return them.
The difference here is that it really seems like Trump meant to obstruct the FBI and was knowingly hording documents for his own purposes.
Given the fact that Trump has almost certainly been engaged in numerous criminal activities and being POTUS was more or less just a shield for him, and given the fact that he's beholden to all sorts of foreign entities that would want confidential info from the US, what Trump is doing seems genuinely nefarious, whereas what Biden may or may not have done seems like clerical oversight.
I'm not gonna fucking Al Franken this one so we can keep up airs against hypocrisy accusations against a group of seditionists who readily and gleefully commit hypocrisy on an almost constant basis.
