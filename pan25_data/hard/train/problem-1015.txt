DeSantis only had that margin of victory in 2022 when he ran as an incumbent and the "Democratic" candidate was Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor of Florida.
Sure, De Santis outspent Crist three to one (he spent over $100M in 2022, an unheard of amount in a gubernatorial election), and yes, there was absolutely voter suppression, but I think the reality is that Crist is an insipid, uninspiring former Republican who didn't motivate voters.
I looked at this the other day.
He won 2018 with 49% of a 63% turnout, and he won 2022 with 59% of a 54% turnout.
Those numbers mean that in 2018, 32% of voters voted for him, and in 2022...32% of voters voted for him.
Crist got 2.8M votes in 2014, Gillum got 4.0M in 2018, and Crist got 3.1M in 2022.
On the face of it that looks like a Crist problem rather than a Democrats-voting-less-over-time problem.
Something has always bugged me about the last election.
Like Tampa is a purple area in the state but it was overwhelmingly red this time and only Orlando had enough blue votes.
Without evidence though, it just feels like something is off this time.
