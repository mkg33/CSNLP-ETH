If aliens are technologically advanced enough to travel the distance, they sure aren't going to let themselves get detected let alone shot down.
Part of me wants it to be aliens though.
That'll be cool to see lol.
No it's not aliens lol.
Extra terrestrial life obviously exists considering the vastness of our universe but there's no logical way they'd have the technology to be able to travel this far and also being vulnerable enough that a human weapon can shoot them down.
People often offer theories about alien species invading to steal our resources, but an alien race capable of interstellar and intergalactic travel, probably has far more resources than we do.
If they were here to enslave or subjugate the human race, there would be little pretense for hiding it and it doesn't make a lot of sense to spend decades or centuries "secretly" enslaving humanity by making people think it's okay to be nice to each other, which is an argument the American political right would make and HAS made.
I think that it's possible that such an alien race might study humans incognito (like wildlife cameras) and would avoid making contact, especially if they saw the last State of the Union address, where a bunch of furry apes with pounds of caked on makeup screamed and flung poo at each other.
If an alien race is advanced enough to achieve interstellar and/or intergalactic travel, then they're probably logical, rational beings.
Similarly, to the fictional "prime directive" in Star Trek, in which it is considered unethical to contact primitive alien species, a scientifically advanced race of beings would also likely consider the ethical and/or moral conventions of contacting us, in the very same way that uncontacted tribes on Earth are left alone, and minimally observed, although many of those tribes are being encroached upon.
