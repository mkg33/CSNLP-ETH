Open Secret also indicates that Schiff’s biggest contributors are business, while Porter’s are ideological.
Schiff and Porter apparently both accept corporate PAC money.
However, Porter’s contributors clearly want to end/reverse Citizens United.
It’s unclear whether Schiff’s contributors do too and thus whether he will wholeheartedly support a viable attempt to end it versus weak grandstanding.
Porter’s 8 contributor per your source is literally called “End Citizens United & Let America Vote” — Not even in Schiff’s top 20.
I don’t see OP’s comment saying “any” corporate money.
They say “but if he's so against Citizen's United, then let's see if he accepts corporate PAC money in his campaign.”.
Look, it's a fine gesture and he's not the-worst-of-the-worst, but if he's so against Citizen's United, then let's see if he accepts corporate PAC money in his campaign.
haha.
Schiff will get a ton of corporate money and probably AIPAC/DMFI money because he'll uphold the status quo, which tilts the scales heavily in his favor.
Schiff will have a ton of big money backing him, but he doesn't have Porter's following and isn't likely to inspire the kind of enthusiasm she does.
