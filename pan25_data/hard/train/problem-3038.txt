In 1968, the Soviets began the invasion of Czechoslovakia by seizing the international airport in Prague and then using it to land airborne forces.
Last year, the Russians tried similar moves outside of Kyiv, and now we hear rumors that maybe they’ve got plans along the same lines for Moldova.
Look at a map of Moldova and tell me how Russia is going to get there.
How Russia would get any supplies or ammo there.
It's like Putin had this list of stuff to accomplish.
First, take Ukraine.
Then, move on Moldova, etc..
Except, action 2 depends on the success of action 1.
Without Russia taking Odessa, they're fucked in trying to get to Moldova.
I mean, they're fucking dumb, so I wouldn't be surprised if they try.
But, they can't even supply their forces in Transnistria if air space gets closed over Moldova and passenger planes are no longer allowed to come in.
They'd be fucked.
Romania would just have to send guns and ammo to Moldovan forces to hold them off long enough for Russian forces to run out of food, fuel, ammo, etc...
Meanwhile, Ukraine could safely lob some HIMARS at logistical and command centers in Transnistria to help things along.
Moldova’s in a tricky situation because they’ve got Russian troops sitting right on their border already with land access.
Those troops take control of the runway and suddenly it’s a Russian runway.
In any case... Moldova can always counter by targeting the runway, like Ukraine did at Hostomel.
You can't land planes under artillery fire.
I think Russia has learned this, but.... sappers at ready regardless.
