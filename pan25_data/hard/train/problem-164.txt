More times than not when voter turn out is high Republicans do bad.
They took care of it on state levels by gerrymandering.
That doesn't work on the federal level so they do the next best thing of preventing as many votes as possible and trying to disqualify as many of the votes that made it through.
When this fool said ‘Stop the Count’ I felt it, because everyone that is eligible to vote, will do, unless they abstain (choice) but the fact he wanted peoples votes just thrown out, fucking infuriates me.
It’s unsurprising yet still baffling that so many people in this country believe that you can just go and write down a random name, submit a ballot, and commit enough voter fraud to swing an election the other way.
Especially an election with the vote difference being 8 million ballots.
That’s without even going into the even more ridiculous tales of dead dictators using other countries’ satellites to somehow beam changes into closed circuit voting machines.
It’s all incredibly absurd, even on the surface level.
It’s ridiculously hard to get a “fake” ballot through, let alone thousands.
How would one know that the thousands of registered voters they are submitting ballots for have not already or do not plan to vote for themselves?
We’ve seen several cases of Republican voters submitting ballots for others, including dead people - and we know about it because they got caught doing it.
