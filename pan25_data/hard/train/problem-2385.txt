This is literally the guy saying "I have magic powers.
I can tell if people are lying with 100% certainty.
No, I can't explain how it works because then people would use the magic powers for evil.
No, I won't testify in court myself because I'd have to provide proof.
Instead I'll 'teach' the magic powers to 911 dispatchers and prosecutors, then they have infallible magic powers too.
".
Edit: something was nagging me about this, something familiar, then it hit me.
Body language experts.
That's what this is.
It's the same thing.
Charlatans who claim they can tell people's guilt or innocence based on whether they brush their hair back, where they look, how they position their shoulders.
Polygraphs also went through this, they were introduced and were eventually built up to be infallible indicators of guilt or innocence, it was an epidemic in the justice system, until finally enough science was done that polygraphs were barred from being entered as reliable evidence in courts.
This is the same thing.
This is not technology.
This is pure bullshit that has no basis in reality.
But hey, the cops have a long history of using faulty methods to put people in jail.
hey did you know cops actually don 't prevent crime, have no legal responsibility to protect people, and solve less than half of all murders?
>What are the police for?
Producer B.A.
Parker started wondering this back in June, as Black Lives Matter protests and calls to “defund the police” ramped up.
The question led her to a wild story of a stabbing on a New York City subway train, and the realization that, according to the law, the police don’t always have to protect us.
Producer Sarah Qari joins Parker to dig into the legal background, which takes her all the way up to the Supreme Court... and then all the way back down to on-duty officers themselves.
