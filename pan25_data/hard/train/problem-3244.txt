Also since Citizens United, the US has slid tremendously in holding corporations and their board members accountable.
Do you even know much about the laws about responsibility of board members regarding companies' actions?
And who can actually bring such cases to court?
Because I suspect that is a bit more relevant than what CNN is talking about...
That is so not how things work; do you really think judges decide on what cases to take based on what's on TV?
For cases that size?
But luckily, Reddit and Facebook are going to sway the judges?
This makes no sense.
Oh for sure.
And the Kochs have played a pivotal role in undermining public education, public transportation and environmental regulations; and unleashing the "fuck you, got mine" brand of American alt-reich conservatism.

Won't be pesky climate lawsuits if there's no functioning court system!
If there are no public schools -- only private religious ones -- no one will know enough about science to be concerned.
And so on.
