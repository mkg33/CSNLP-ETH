The humanity.
Honestly though Prior to Trump having a First Lady with porn photos - this would have been a pearl clutching moment for the republicans.
I think that I can go interview a certain porn star and get a completely accurate description of Mr Trump's penis.
Maybe even a couple of snapshots.
Even if you were coming from the right wing side, I don't see how nudes of Mr Biden's son has anything to do with the administration considering that he's nowhere near it.
Pretty sure Hunter Biden wasn't running for office in 2020, he was too busy taking nude selfies of himself, using illicit substances, and having sex with random women.
GOP folks on my FB feed are clamoring on this as being out generation's Watergate, and that's outright hilarious: Biden wasn't IN the office at the time (Trump was), nor did he direct something illegal to occur (unlike Nixon).
What's annoying more conservatives was the fact that their "October surprise" fell flat across non-conservative media, and they believe it would have been enough to change the outcome of 2020.
For the (fewer) conservatives in this sub: is the content of the laptop the problem, or the suppression of its existence?
