Usual reminder that Congress can supersede these state laws.
Want national voting rights laws?
Vote for Democrats (progressive preferably, but any is better than none).
The Constitution gives Congress the ability to do so.
SCOTUS has also upheld and acknowledged this power in saying "Thus, it is well settled that the Elections Clause grants Congress ‘the power to override state regulations’ by establishing uniform rules for federal elections, binding on the States".
So there is ample precedence, both legislative and judicial, that reinforces the idea that Congress is able to supersede state election laws.
There's also the entire National Voter Registration Act of 1993 which, among other things, requires states to use specific forms to register people for elections (which SCOTUS even upheld later that year).
And it also allows people to submit their voter registration by mail.
Florida has early voting and workers can even use mail in ballots to vote if they want.
As before, there's no right being lost.
Except the person I replied to never said said they were disabled or unable to go to there.
So their right isn't being taken away.
