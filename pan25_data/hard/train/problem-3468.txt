Strategically it would be a blunder.
Unfortunately most Americans have a poor grasp of civics, so Republicans would just scream that it's the president's fault and a lot of voters would believe them.
Very cool how every time there's a Democratic president with a Republican House we have to go this ridiculous debt ceiling debacle.
Absolutely nothing positive ever comes of this.
The Democrats keep refusing to get rid of the debt ceiling whenever they control Congress... why?
All you're doing is giving the Republicans the power to hold the country hostage.
The debt ceiling needs to be done away with ASAP.
The actual strategy is to get rid of the debt ceiling when the Democrats control Congress, but so far they've refused.
Can someone explain to me in a nutshell why Democrats couldn't have done anything about this when they had the house and senate?
Couldn't this have been fixed through budget reconciliation bill where we just let the debt ceiling grow along with the size of the economy?
Or am I missing something major here?
