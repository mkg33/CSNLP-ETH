One of the most interesting aspects of the Mad Cow Disease outbreaks of the 90's was that Cambodia asked England to ship all of their infected cows to them so that they could be used to "find" unexploded land mines dotting their countryside.
At the same time, mad cow was absolutely rampant in the Uk for a decade, when the British government was telling everyone that humans could not get mad cow, and not that many people died from it all things considered.
About 178 it seems.
Your chances of getting mad cow from infected beef are still quite slim, as long as you don't eat an infected brain.
There will be a few American deaths from mad cow since the disease left the UK but the number wonâ€™t go higher than 1 to 5.
But yeah, I know what you mean, there can be decades between the introduction of prions and the start of the disease.
Because they are caused by Prions there is no medicine or medical treatment.
Your body doesn't have a defense system.
There is no vaccine, there will never be a vaccine.
There is no medical treatment, there won't be either.
But Prions specifically are just so strange, just the idea of one of the body's building blocks just collapsing, like a rotting structural beam in a house that causes the ones next to it to rot, eventually collapsing the whole thing.
The difference is just if the first one was a random accident that then spread, or if it got introduced.
