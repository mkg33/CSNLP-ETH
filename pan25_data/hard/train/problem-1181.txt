someone replied to me that the Biden admin was under "immense pressure" to get this deal done.
i was like, what pressure?
lol.
i've been asking this all over here.
i haven't seen much support and absolutely zero support from people in real life.
when i heard the news i thought, "well i guess that's gonna be one of the right-wing talking points for the next two years, along with hunter biden's dick.
".
What you say is correct.
The part you're missing however is, just how potentially dangerous all these experts believe Bout still is, how he will be immediately utilized by Putin, what political hay Putin gained, what precedent was set for any future negotiations for Americans still held, and that this was a terrible "swap" even tho an American came home.
And in the end, Putin made it work, it is now pitting Americans against Americans, whether it's people that support the right (whom Trump released 5000 Taliban prisoners) or just people who don't see the equivalent value of said prisoners, which is a legitimate concern, to people who say it's only because she is famous and Whelan wasn't given that treatment.
If you are going to gulag the bloke for selling your weapons behind your back, you don't paint him as a hero victim of American injustice in your state-sponsored media, it's all i'm saying, it contradicts your claim that he may be prosecuted/punished in Russia.
