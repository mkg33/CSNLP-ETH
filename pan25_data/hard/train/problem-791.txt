For example, you probably know that George Washinon owned slaves but did you know that he intentionally exploited legal loopholes and even violated laws (that he himself signed into law) to keep his slaves in Philadelphia even though it was a free state?
After studying the history of slavery I can say, without any doubt, that we are absolutely not being taught properly about slavery in schools.
If slavery could be attributed to the modern democratic party, as Republicans ALWAYS imply, wouldn't they want to teach African-American studies?
Slavery is a huge complex topic and reducing it to such an asinine discussion just shows how bad our schools are at teaching about it.
Sane people: "Oh, no problem, see, we're just gonna teach people about slavery and the Civil War in school.
".
Oh yeah.
The founders were a bunch of bickering slave owning aristocrats from 200 years ago.
But they are seen as demigods from some idealized time.
It’s a huge problem in America because we can’t move past them as a result.
