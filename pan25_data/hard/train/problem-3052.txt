Same here but actually in colorado.
I voted the fuck out of yes.
(Also straight blue and for legalizing shrooms; let’s serve as an example of how to do it CO!
).
This is going on now too.
There isn’t “French fries” daily but the healthy vegetable is tater tots one day, then French fries, then baked potato wedges, then sweet potato fries.
Pizza has one serving dairy and 1/2 vegetable (plus 1 vegetable from French fries.
ALL kids are picky eaters…rich or poor.
Most poor kids take the free meals and throw away the milk and anything healthy and just eat the pizza and fries.
Rich kids do the same when meals are free.
Been this way at schools for decades.
Over half of weekend power pack meals don’t make it home either.
Kids toss in the trash before getting on the bus.
Veggies, fruit…anything healthy gets tossed but they keep dessert, snacks, and Mac n cheese cups.
What is worse is kids are forced to take the healthy parts with the junk food so most milk and fruit gets tossed in the trash can.
This is why this free food shit is both a waste of money and tremendously damaging to the health of children unless we make sure it’s only healthy food being supplied.
Give kids free lunches, theres 0 justification for forcing the peanut butter sandwich cause your parents didn't send you money or you forgot or the money got stolen or whatever.
People will use the excuse that they don't and they get a peanut butter or similar sandwich if they don't have the money.
Its a joke.
If anything we should be washing out fairly reasonably by not having multiple people taking money and giving change.
