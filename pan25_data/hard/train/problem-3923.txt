Carter's boy Volker cut inflation by a third by the end of 1979 with the most aggressive Fed policy in history.
The rest of the economy was improving, and Carter was looking better and better, until Iran seized our embassy and drove the economy out of the public's eye.
Then Reagan cut a deal with Iran to release the hostages AFTER the election.
Actually I found Reagan to be a warm, compassionate man...one on one, When he heard one of his staffers had to take his daughter out of college because killing Revenue Sharing also killed the grants that were allowing her to attend, Reagan handed him a personal check for her tuition.
Ronny's suck the rich taxscam drove inflation and unemployment back to near record highs and more than TRIPLED the National Debt (+340%).
Reagan's economic policy had four key pillars: reducing government spending, slashing taxes, reducing regulations, and tightening the monetary supply through higher interest rates, all of which shifted the burden of "fixing" the economy on to the backs of bottom 90%.
It's also worth noting that Reagan's tax cuts helped stimulate economic growth, created new job opportunities and allowed for more disposable income for consumers, all of which contributed to a more robust and healthy economy.
