But (2) is very likely.
Specifically, he has presented his financial position one way on his tax returns, and another way on loan applications and other financial disclosures.
That's very illegal.
Not a good idea.
That means that nobody who pisses off the intel community will ever hold office.
It also adds an additional requirement for office that's not in the Constitution.
And requirements for security clearances are often bullshit: not ever having smoked weed, not being queer (it's OK now, but before that, it wasn't), not having relatives or in-laws in certain countries, etc, etc.
Another question is the level of losses he's reported on tax forms, which might undermine his claims of vast wealth and infallible business acumen.
Also, there is potential embarrassment from his sheer level of tax evasion.
My guess is that looking at his tax returns alone would show little to no law breaking by themselves, but combined with other publicly available documents, they would show vast amounts of corruption.
For example: claiming a property was losing value on his taxes to get a write-off but inflating its value on a loan application to get a better rate.
Tp is no genius but he and his family have been in the real estate business for a long time and know how to manipulate the numbers to their advantage.
