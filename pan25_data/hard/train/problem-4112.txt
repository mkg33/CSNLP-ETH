We can either fix the damn roads, or we can fill pot holes.
Centrists are pot hole fillers.
Progressives want to redo the roads.
Centrists will vote republican over construction delays and show shocked Pikachu faces when their suspension goes because of unfilled pot holes.
If the goal of greenhouse emissions reductions is to lower temperatures by 1 degree C, centrists will install an air conditioner and put up a Mission Accomplished flag.
I read the article.
Your assessment is precisely the problem.
Centrist has meaning.
And framing it that way will ensure that little to no actual progress will be made.
So we agree.
Centrists are not trying to solve anything.
They just want incremental progress, so they can put up a Mission Accomplished banner.
The five points outlined in the article are progressive goals, too.
Centrist positions are the "little off the top" measures for what is called.
Framing progressive goals as centrist proposals is a very effective way to do that.
That's what I feel this article is doing.
Hell, Bernie made a whole fucking campaign based on that tactic.
But now it's a problem because the article used the word centrist.
So my issue here is that many are attacking the article for using the word "centrist" regardless of what the article actually says.
It's just reactionary.
