But this raises the question: what will the world do about it?
Just make toothless statements while Iran builds a nuke?
Iran can make a nuke.
They can do so with limited effort.
That's a fact.
There's no going back.
Iran doesn't appear to have made one and if they were to make one it would be inefficient and not capable of being placed on a missile, not immediately anyway.
They'd have to miniaturize it first (which presumably they've already at least thought about.
).
Absurd.
The CIA concluded in 2003 that Iran has the know-how to build a bomb and that they previously had a weapons program.
This is what all the inspections kerfuffle has been about.
Now all of a sudden Iran doesn't have the know how and they're trying to get Russia to help them?
Previously it was North Korea helping them.
In 2014-2015 he Germans and Brits said Iran had the capacity to make a bomb within 6-18 months if it wanted.
The US estimated Iran would have that capacity in 2010 with the biggest hurdle being enrichment (which Iran has fully mastered.
).
Again, you're presuming that the ability to learn and teach nuclear physics is absent in Iran outside of these scientists.
