Removing him from the House doesn't require him breaking a law at all.
The House can vote to expell members, for any reason.
And if his district has recall process on the books it almost certainly also does not require him having broken a law.
Nah, clearly the fascist caucus isn't crazy about him, and neither are their voters.
Calling a speaker vote would likely endear the "moderate" republican who called it to the far end of their loony voter pool.
