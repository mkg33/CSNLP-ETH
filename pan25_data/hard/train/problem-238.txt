Being an utter piece of shit committing war crimes left and right doesnt mean you know more about war.
In fact several "tactics" used by Russian army / Wagner are very arguable from a military standpoint like mass executing/raping civilians.
Maybe in their mind they're breaking the local spirit, but it could easily be argued they actually pissed off even more the Ukrainian and made dead sure everyone would fight to death.
Wagner is even more extreme than the regular Russian army.
But just because they are more violent and inhumane doesn't mean they're more competent.
The point was to undermine the idea that Prighozin is necessarily better than Putin at this and by association that rank brutality is necessarily the best way in war.
Prighozin used to be in the catering and casino business.
He just found a new lucrative business and a good way to pitch his service by appealing to the toxic appeal of abuse and strongmen figure in Russian culture.
Like "Wagner will do some shit so extreme that it would make even the Russian army recoil" .
This whole "the more cruel, the more efficient," appeal to some primitive mindset.
It's kinda like the idea that you have to be an asshole to succeed, that business is a zero sum game, etc....
There are some toxic ideas.
Bad enough this idea is very popular in Russia, I 'd rather not see it take root anywhere else.
Wagner are not better fighter, they're just more depraved.
500 wagner-syrian forces attacking by surprise VS 30 US Army Rangers and Delta Force commandos from the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).
It’s “500 Russian/Syrian soldiers with no armored vehicles or support getting targeted by combined artillery/aircraft firepower, while 30 commandos watched”.
