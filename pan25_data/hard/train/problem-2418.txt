It’s more than China can access other things in the phones, so it’s an obvious thing.
Hated trump as a guy from the U.K., but he was right when he suggested banning it.
A total ban would be unbelievably unpopular and I highly doubt it goes through.
Rubio/Gallagher's bill about the red scare won't make it either.
Just because the Chinese government has access to data doesn't mean they are going to manipulate it and spread false stories, spy, etc... the Chinese can look at my tiktok feed, they might even laugh.
Why?
What is the app doing wrong?
Again I'm not concerned with the bullshit its killing our youth argument.
None of that gen z bullshit.
It's a fucking app that plays videos.
It's not fentanyl.
This has nothing to do with still-developing brains or the youth.
It has to do with perceived Chinese spying and misinformation campaigns.
So yes, the main issue is indeed China spying.
But we should also be looking at the effects (long- and short-term) on our brains, not just from TikTok but all social media.
It connects us and can be beneficial, great, but all of them have problems with appropriately moderating potentially harmful content and those with algorithms increase the chance of seeing extremist content.
