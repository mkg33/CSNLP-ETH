Yeah.
Ye being like “I loooooooove Hitlerrrrrrr” is him just tossing out their dog whistle and shouting what they’ve been winking and nodding into a megaphone.
They’re mad at him because he’s making it harder for them to dl love Hitler.
Are you calling elon musk and trump an actual nazi?
Lol I understand Kanye at this point for the actual things he has said but the other 2 are a long shot.
I edited my comment above to be more clear about my focus but yes I was talking about Kanye.
In my Black mind Kanye and the word sin are associated since he literally has/had his own church and uses religious backing as a shield of “good faith efforts” for change.
However, and ironically, your statement here:
“But I'm thinking maybe you meant slavery doesn't mean Kanye can do no wrong, not that the Halocaust means Jews can do no wrong.”.
Just realize if that's true everyone is misunderstanding you because you only mentioned Jews, not black people/slavery or Kanye.
But I'm thinking maybe you meant slavery doesn't mean Kanye can do no wrong, not that the Halocaust means Jews can do no wrong.
I could be wrong but I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.
