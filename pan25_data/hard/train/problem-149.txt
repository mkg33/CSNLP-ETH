Valid point.
It would also make me nervous that "we need more laws to get more prisoners, because we need more organ donors" could be a legitimate political take.
We do need prison reform tho, and something like organ donations in prison would need extremely strict oversight with severe punishment if abused.
As long as the prisoner consents and they arent violent or a danger to society it's fine if they want to help another human in exchange for a shorter sentence.
I'm all for prisoners donating organs voluntarily, but when it's used as an incentive to shorten a prison sentence it's essentially holding their organs hostage.
not apples to apples, but Dr Jack Kevorkian had a revolutionary idea to allow prisoners on death row to voluntarily donate organs many decades ago, as described in his book Medicide.
He wanted allowing people who are already condemned to death a way to have something good come of that, but all the methods of death used then destroyed every organ that would have been harvestable had the prisoner agreed.
The reaction among wardens, State officials, and the medical profession back in the '60s was nearly universally negative.
It seemed that the jailers, the politicians, and others wanted the pain and suffering to happen for the person dying, and that was the main point.
Using a less destructive method of death that would allow harvesting of organs was out of the question.
Gas em, poison them, fry them was the mantra and mindset.
