LOLOL.
Yes, the U.S. is so weak at soft power.
Just look at how overpowering Chinese movies, fashion, food, music, culture, etc.
is globally compared to what comes out of America.
Could we do better?
Of course, but to say the U.S. never has been very good at wielding soft power is about as absurd a statement as one can make about foreign policy.
Sure, and I understand that point - their claim was that China is better at wielding soft power than the US, which is what I was curious about how they came to that conclusion.
Beyond that, the US never has been very good at wielding soft power as compared to the Chinese for example.
The US approach has always been a much more direct stick and carrot approach, and honestly you can't tell me that the average American has a single clue as to the cultural intricacies of pretty much any other country in the world you care to name.
US foreign policy, whether in Africa, South America or anywhere else has always been one of pressure, forced regime change and altogether what can best be described as a bull in a china shop approach and damn the consequences as long as it is/was convenient to them and their economic interests...
How exactly do you make foreign policy work if you don't have clue one as to the culture of another nation?
In the case of the US, the answer is simple, you don't care and you just brute force the whole thing with no knowledge of, or respect for the other nation...
