Is that really less plausible than the claim, without any evidence, that it's the tomb of not only a Pharaoh, but the most famous one?
Even the CTV article only says "some believe" it leads to the tomb.
It's a fascinating find regardless.
describe it as such, and compare it to a well-known similar one in Greece.
Underground aqueducts needed to be at least tall enough to work in, and since water needs to flow they would dig down to achieve the necessary grade (maybe changing over time).
The claims about "leading to" a tomb are kind of ambiguous - it could be in the city they're excavating, but the tunnel isn't literally part of it.
The tomb itself has yet to be discovered, but based on the location of the tunnel, archeologists believe they may have found the location.
Just 13 metres beneath the ground of an ancient Egyptian city is a mysterious tunnel that could lead to a tomb archeologists have spent decades searching for.
Archeologists have narrowed down their search for Cleopatraâ€™s tomb to one section of the tunnel where they have found four incredible carvings in Roman scripture.
They have docs up about this lady trying to find Cleopatra's tomb and other Archaeologists - quite good if ur into that sort of documentary.
