Democrat news is very centrically organized.
You tune into CNN you’ll hear very similar things that you’d hear/see on Huffinon Post, BBC, The New Yorker, NPR.
They’re pushing the same narratives because they’re working with the DNC to reach the same goals.
Outside of some individual programs, there is not much in the way of left-wing news that is credible and happens to have a slight liberal bias.
It’s almost all propaganda.
Just take what you said and do the reverse with the GOP and DNC thing and that’s pretty much how I feel, again.
That’s from the perspective of someone who wishes they were more organized, I’m telling you they’re too organized, even if it damns right wing bias as well.
I would say a lot of their base assumptions are inherently centrist to right wing as well when it comes to police, immigration, etc.
The assumption from CNN and other major news outlets is that the status quo is good and must be maintained, anything that threatens the status quo is considered radical, and since the status quo is in the US is conservative they often defend conservative views.
There are a couple fallacies behind your question -- that news outlets should exist to cater to a particular political mindset, and that the other news outlets you view as having leftist inclinations are as relentlessly partisan and activist in their bias as Fox News.
They aren't.
They're not even close.
MSNBC has attempted (and largely failed) to emulate the Fox News business model, but still...there is no left wing equivalent to the level of influence Fox News has on Republican politics, or the truly Orwellian you'll hear from their primetime hosts.
If everyone thinks fox news is bullshit then what other news outlets are available to the Republican mindsets.
Don't say any other news channel as from an outsider perspective, I can clearly see leftist inclination in other news channels too.
