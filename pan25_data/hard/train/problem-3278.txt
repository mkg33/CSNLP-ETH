That's what government spending does: it creates money.
Money is literally how all government debt is paid.
The only difference with the $1T coin is the president doesn't need congress to do it.
How do you think they are going to pay off the debt if they raise the debt limit other than by printing money?
So... Print money to pay off your national debt?
What a great idea, I wonder why nobody has tried that before...
You can keep adding edits, it won't make it true.
Government deficit spending creates money, not all spending.
Most spending is from the revenue pot of taxes, tariffs, fines, etc.
Basically: Congress mandates spending and sets tax rates.
They've mandated more spending than is collected in taxes.
There is also a cap on how much the US government can borrow, which Congress raises from time to time.
If they fail to raise it, the US government can't pay its bills.
This will crash the economy.
The far-right Republicans insisted on having the US government not pay its bills as part of the deal to make McCarthy Speaker, so there's a bigger chance that it will happen this time than in past years.
