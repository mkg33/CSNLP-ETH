I would have to guess it'll depend on how they organize afterwards.
A lot of the equipment will also have gone through a tough war and most is older stuff.
Probably a lot will be scrapped, some might be returned if working and still used in those countries inventories.
It'll take a long time since I'm sure they'll want to reduce equipment variety and restart their own arms industry again.
Lastly, the post war military likely won’t want 10 kinds of tanks etc.
So that may factor into things.
Very nuanced.
There might be some kind of demilitarization agreement depending on what peace looks like.
Also Ukraine does have a history of selling off surplus equipment, so destruction or giving back equipment may be part of economic grants used to help rebuild.
I believe a lot of countries are using the aid to Ukraine also as a way to offload dated or overstocked equipment.
Essentially, the donation to Ukraine is a good excuse to replace them with newer systems.
As such, I wouldn’t expect any country to ask for its donated systems back.
They will be worn out and already replaced.
Doesn’t really make sense to keep a stockpile of worn and outdated stuff.
