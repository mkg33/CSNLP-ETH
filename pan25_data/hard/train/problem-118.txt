If it was shot down it was not aliens.
Going by the tech in some of the most widely confirmed encounters such as the Berkshire County incident, do really really think something that can read minds and levitate people, allow a projectile to hit it?
Besides, my original point was only that if you believe aliens have visited us, you have to assume advanced technology, so you can't really claim such a craft would easily be shot down.
It's like saying someone shot down an F-22 with a bow and arrow.
My point is just that if anything is shot down it is probably terrestrial, and that this is a logical conclusion you have to come to if you do or don't believe aliens have visited us (unless you think they deliberately allowed a craft to be shot down).
I believe he meant that the aliens were unaware of the concept of someone shooting it down (due to not having wars and conflicts for millions of years) so it was unshielded and as such an easy target.
Maybe those aliens have evolved beyond the need of weapons and didn’t expect other species to be so primitive and violent so they didn’t bring weapons….. this time….
If it was alien craft that traveled here from millions of light years away do you people really think we humans could shoot it down with our proverbial stick and stones?
Do you really think that an alien craft that traveled here from millions of light years away could have accomplished that feat without evolving past conflict and war millions of years ago?
