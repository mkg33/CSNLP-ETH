Lol mate you should really check out what their peacekeeping forces did.
They been sent out to reelect new government, resolve security situations and "reorganize military and police" in just the last 3 decades.
All of those objectives can fit the situation in Iran.
Again, Iran government know there are precedents to UN peacekeeping interventions in similar situations, and that's the only reason protesters are still alive.
You need a clown sticker to go with that tin foil hat?
Most of the countries they got in don't even have oil deals with anyone.
UN peacekeepers aren't US military.
Unfortunately, that's too few to give justification.
The numbers need to be much higher for UN peacekeepers to be sent in against the government's will.
I'm talking genocide numbers.
Even a genocide is not enough.
Remember Rwanda?
The bulk of the UN (Belgian IIRC) peacekeepers were withdrawn when the genocide started.
Only a tiny fraction remained and was unable to stop the killing due to lack of manpower.
The poor Canadian commander gave it his best shot but they took the troops away just when he needed them.
