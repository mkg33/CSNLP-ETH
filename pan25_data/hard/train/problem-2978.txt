As others have pointed out this district was made significantly more Republican leaning in redistricting.
Also, the idea of you singling on one district that progresses lost compared to the many many that moderates lost in Florida and New York is hypocrisy of the highest order.
To further add to the ridiculousness of this, the Democratic party offered no funding to this race.
Well Andrew Gilliam only lost by about 0.5 points, whereas former Republican Charlie Chris lost by 20.
It is maddening to me that the moderate Democrats keep saying that progressives can't win when their own candidates clearly do worse.
Maybe if the Dems campaign arm did what they should instead of refusing to help a primary winner we wouldn't be having this conversation.
I can't imagine why, in a year that was expected to be really bad when Democrats were trying to defend a ton of seats, that they would decide not to fund what they saw as a risky challenger likely to lose.
The fact that McLeod-Skinner finished just a few points behind the Republican despite getting left for dead by the rest of the party pretty strongly suggests that decision was a mistake.
Obviously there's no way to no for sure what would have happened, but it seems like if she had gotten a little bit of support from Democratic campaign organizations we could have gotten another seat in the house.
