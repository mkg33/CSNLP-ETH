Russia fucks up time and again and they whine at others for not letting them win.. this is more pathetic than a school bully running to their parents in tears cause their last victim decided to fight back.
Yeah seriously!
How pathetic and stupid does someone have to be to start a war and then throw a temper tantrum and complain that their enemy is fighting back?
?
Man Lavrov is particularly pathetic, all he does is make stupid statements and whine like a bitch every time his country screws something up.
So invading a neighboring country and starting a war of aggression isn't a global catastrophe, but arming someone to help them defend themselves against said invasion is??
Gotta love Russia's stupid logic.
There are plenty of stupids that simp for Russia and cling to any argument they shell out.
That's why they continue to say this ridiculous shit.
Had someone sincerely tell me Russia is the most powerful country on the planet and Western media is lying to us about the war.
I'm not American but that fact is really terrifying and Russia knows it too.
They can flex and run their mouth all day on state run media, but the people at the top know that American military power isn't a paper tiger.
