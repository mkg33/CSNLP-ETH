Yes, because of them being in Germany they were able to be apprehended but they commited their crimes outside of Germany against non-German citizens.
It's quite unique that a perpetrator gets tried for that in a foreign country.
Normally there would be an extradition request by his country of origin if his actions even where a crime there.
Which they weren't since he was an Assad government torturer.
So in most other countries he just might have been expelled if there was any legislation for that, here in Germany even those people might get tried in court.
I think it's a good system for crimes against humanity.
No safe space for those bastards.
Well, that is debatable.
The German justice system does go after people who have commited crimes against humanity outside of Germany.
There have been some famous cases of Syrian torturers hiding here as refugees who have been tried with German law because of the gravity of their crimes.
So in a way German law DOES extent beyond Germany's borders but its power doesn't.
That does put the onus on germany to get that right, though.
Thats the issue, it lets the government decide what reality is, and make it illegal to disagree.
That is necessary sometimes, of course, but its still a bad precedent.
However, it's still not a bad idea.
Being upset about the outcome of a vote, is understandable.
Denying the reality of the vote outcome, maybe not as much.
Hey now, could be about Bolsonaro.
Sure, just don't look too hard at where he might have gotten the idea from.
