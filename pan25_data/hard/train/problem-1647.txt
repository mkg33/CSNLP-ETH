Thanks for the link with the chart that supports my point, even though it feels like you posted this as a counter.
There's clearly a lot more alternative energy production now than 20 or 30 years ago (when it was close to none).
Baseline Power: Yep, that what's happening if there is a mix of different forms of energy and no extreme high amount of renewables or nuclear, e.g.
germany right now.
There is no issue running 3 (or previously 6) nuclear power plants covering 10% when you produce something around 40% by wind and PV.
But if you extend wind and pv (which is happening) you will have more and more days reaching 100%, where you don't need any other power.
Let's assume you now make 80% with renewables in average - that probably means that probably half a year you don't need anything else, but for something like two weeks a year you need to cover 100%.
This is not something you want to do with a nuclear power plant for technical and economical reasons.
I'm pro-nuclear, it's a safe and reliable form of power.
Unfortunately I am also realistic and know that there's many people against it who will fight tooth and nail to prevent it from being built.
That combined with the safety regulations, bureaucracy, and lack of investor interest means that even 10 years would be significantly faster than most projects this century.
I'm in favour of building it, but it isn't a realistic alternative to Russian oil and gas right now.
Nuclear reactors take a decade or more to plan and build.
I really hope that this war is over a decade from now and that Putin has moved on to another plane.
