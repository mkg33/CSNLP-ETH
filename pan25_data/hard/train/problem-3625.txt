Because a dictator is overthrowing a democracy.
Americans used to be united in support of democracy, but now it seems like Republicans are thinking twice about it.
And not that many people are being killed this could just drag on indefinitely.
in part because it's to Putin's advantage to claim that Russians are being persecuted and need to unified in support him in these terrible, troubling times.
There are some Russians who are not lost to insanity who have joined Ukraine in fighting this evil, and some who may not be able to join but stand with Ukraine in the ways they can.
YOU are NOT my enemy.
The ONLY person in this equation that is liable to use nukes is Putin, and it's in everyone's best interest (very much including China) to make sure that doesn't happen because radiation shitting all over europe and asia is a problem NOBODY needs OR wants right now.
No.
The west doesn't NEED to use Nukes on Russia.
Russia might NEED to use nukes against the west, but the US and Europe have enough artillery and military capability to pretty much flatten Russia without having to use nukes.
the only contry who has used Nuclear Capable weapons has been Russia, they have fired Nuclear Capable Ordinance into Ukraine before, thankfully without the warhead.
