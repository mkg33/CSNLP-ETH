The previous referendums have shown that 53% of Puerto Rican’s want statehood out of half of registered voters.
It’s not as clear cut as many people think.
It’s not really as clear cut as people want to make it out to seem.
This bill also has to get through the Senate, which is not guaranteed.
That’s not exactly correct.
The question on the 2020 referendum was, “Should Puerto Rico be admitted immediately into the Union as a State?” Voting no does not mean keeping the status quo, it means any option other than statehood.
It could mean independence, in addition to status quo.
Now you want to lump together statehood and status quo.
My original comment was about statehood alone.
The results are not as clear cut as you’re making them out to be.
You don’t address free association either, which is one of the options here.
It’s a complicated situation and it’s not just statehood, status quo, or independence.
So not having statehood actually does have benefits, and not all the people in the territories want it.
