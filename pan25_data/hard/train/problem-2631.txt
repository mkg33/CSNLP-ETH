The article speculates that is her plan, but polls show her getting crushed in the Democratic primary and a dead heat between the likely Republican and Democratic candidates both with and without her in the race.
The current polling indicates that her running as an independent would have a negligible impact on the election.
Interesting that when she announced switching to independent she said AZ voters elected her to be an independent.
Uh, no, they thought you were a democrat!
Yup, but she would draw off enough votes that the democrat would also lose.
Which is the threat she's using to try and make sure the Dems don't run anyone.
Those who follow politics, even marginally, will know Sinema and why most don't like her.
But many/most voters don't know/care who she is and they only vote for Dems cuz their grandad voted for Truman or Kennedy.
I did door to door canvassing in my area last election, and I talked ONLY to registered democrats.
Most of what I did was explain who Mark Kelly is.
To registered Democrats in Arizona who were regular voters.
They didn't know the name "Mark Kelly".
Despite registering as Democrats, voting in almost every election...
It's the same on the GOP side.
You've got a handful of loud mouth Trump cult members, and a handful of slightly less loud Never-Trumpers.
And then an overwhelming majority of GOP voters who just know the GOP opposes abortion or their parents liked Reagan or they remember feeling pretty nice in 2006 when Bush was prez or whatever.
The average person, even a college educated person, doesn't know much about politics other than they can probably name the president and maybe their governor or senator.
But they generally don't know what these people do.
Nor do they know what the president does.
That's why a president's approval rating reacts to things like inflation or gas prices, even though a president has little influence over these things.
