It isn't, Europe immediately and then repeatedly lowered how much it was importing from Russia.
They price capped Russia recently so India more than tripled it's current Russian energy spending.
India continues to ramp up its buying of Russian energy.
They have contributed to the destruction of Ukraine FAR more than theyve helped.

Because being in this thread making excuses for countries increasing their support of Russia makes it seem like you don't.
Do you really not see a difference between the EU cutting the amount of oil it's buying from Russia and India increasing the amount?
Considering how offended people were with the earlier article despite it showing EU still buys more oil from Russia than India does my hopes are pretty low.
You do realize that the Saudis refused to sell for cheaper/increase production despite the situation correct?
Where is the outrage for them?
They are actively milking this situation for what it's worth and people are so dense they blame the buyer instead.
