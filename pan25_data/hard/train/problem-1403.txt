And with chinas help to make the afghans loyal subjects to the Chinese empire, I mean freedom loving individuals, there will be no stoping the Chinese this time!
The only thing they've got going is the Chinese investment, but it remains to be seen how that would benefit the Afghanese people and not just the Taliban regime.
My point is that there's no reason I can see that will keep many corporations from working in Afghanistan, in compliance with the Taliban, if there's money to be made.
Corporations aren't people, but they're run by people who find it as easy to work with entities like that as you do to wear clothes made in a sweatshop in Bangladesh.
I agree with this.
This World Cup proved to FiFA that they really can do whatever they like and not only will countries still participate in the event, fans will watch and attend.
It's not a good omen of the future conduct of the World Cup.
I'm talking about the World Cup.
A few thousand workers died during construction of the stadium.
Qatar is also a human rights nightmare.
And yet, all of those people attended.
All of those companies worked there.
