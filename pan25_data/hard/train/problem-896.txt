isn't this kind of bound to happen with how there are so many more people who identify as LGBTQ and there is more willingness from those people to report it (due to less fear of police persecution/publicly outing themselves).
Not that this isn't horrible, I just wonder if this wouldn't be the case now no matter what (record high numbers reported).
dunno why you got downvoted, that's a very reasonable consideration.
Certainly in the last decade what would constitute transphobic speech has expanded (and only really been properly defined as society became conscious of them more wholely).
I agree...
I guess my feigned misunderstanding was one of those nudges to other voters to allow freer discussion.
I personally don't see anything transphobic about discussing or your comment specifically (which shouldn't even need to be said).
I don’t know how I went from “broadly in favor of trans rights” to “transphobe” in ten years without ever changing a single opinion, but it’s been strange to watch it happen.
Again… it’s the small minority of trans-people who detransition.
13%.
It’s an even smaller smaller minority of those people who changed their minds because they actually don’t want to transition… 97.6% of those people only detransitioned because of people like you making it hard or impossible for them to keep going.
