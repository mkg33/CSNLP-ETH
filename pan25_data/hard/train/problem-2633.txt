They chased the Joneses and can't afford to retire, they hoarded wealth and resources, treated the planet like crap and take advantage of being corrupt whenever possible.
They sold out their own parents and their kids to stay on top instead of working to make the world an even better place for said seniors and millennials.
Millennials aren’t having kids, we’re not making money, and the internet is keeping us connected to Gen Z.
I think there are a lot of people like me in the millennial generation - I'm 34 - who aren't getting more conservative, even with wealth.
I'll probably retire before I'm 50, I have a nice house, no debt and healthy savings/investments, but I'll never vote for a Republican for as long as I'm alive.
Me too, used to be Republican when I was younger before I really paid attention (my parents still are Republicans) and I'll never vote conservative for as long as I live.
I have a pretty decent life and have a house and family and stuff, but there is NO reason why those types of things can't be had by everyone.
