Anything can be susceptible to spin and distortion to be said to have sent the wrong message.
The diplomatic deliberations have to make offers that aren't expected to be accepted, so they can say that they tried, before ruling out those unacceptable options.
Another thing that gets poorly interpreted, is how diplomacy has to deal with parties not upholding what they already agreed to - suboptimal compromises will be considered.
If Putin is banking on the initial proposals to be the final agreement, he's ignoring history at his and Russia's peril to take encouragement from that.
Yeah well it may be that but it sure risks sending the wrong message encouraging Putin that if he fights hard enough that he'll get to keep some of what he stole because he'll interpret it as allies' war fatigue.
Guaranteed that either he or his successors would then be back for more there or elsewhere in the future because they got to keep territory and Russian soldier lives being so cheap in that society made it worth it.
