I know when I first heard it I thought that doesn't make any sense.
I thought I heard it wrong.
I think I found it in an article from the LA Times first then there were 2 or 3 other articles that confirmed that was what the police that responded said happened.
I know it has been a mess of fake info but this was later in the investigation when the police started dropping some breadcrumbs.
Even after reading it I still have doubts about this and anything else I read.
They have said they knocked and somebody opened the door from inside.
That's where the 3rd person rumor started.
But it was just the 2 of them.
Pelosi going pee-pee and being in the bathroom with the phone, calling 911 then coming back out of the bathroom almost made my head explode then somebody from the inside opened the door made no sense.
Somebody had to let go of the hammer, open the door then go back and grab hold of the hammer again.
Alright, so you're a cop and you open the door and there are 2 guys holding a hammer.
Which one do you tackle/shoot?
How were they supposed to know who was the victim in this case if they are literally both holding onto the hammer?
