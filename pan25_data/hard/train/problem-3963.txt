We can easily see with USPS competing with UPS and FedEx that private companies competing with the government leads to better product/services and more consumer friendly pricings.
100% agree - I’m just pointing out that limiting competition on price shows the prospective quality improvements of single payor systems in the US.
Private companies competing for the same dollars leads to differentiation through improvements in quality of care.
Fully nationalized health care systems suffer from under funding in lots of places.
Just to be clear on the Maryland model, there’s still competition on the insurance side but the state set caps on pricing meaning there’s no cost side competition leading only to quality side differentiation which improved outcomes in the state.
A single payor system would have the same effect.
Nationalized payors lead to competition on quality without the issues of fully nationalized healthcare.
Edit - btw I’m advocating for nationalized payors (insurance) but not providers (hospitals and others who deliver care).
Youre not recognizing the difficulty in making that happen… half the country’s representatives want to get rid of social safety nets entirely and the other half is fine with the status quo but would potentially consider a single payor system.
There’s not even a conversation about nationalizing providers in the US because it would be killed before it could even reach committee.
