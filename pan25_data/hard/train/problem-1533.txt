I don’t understand like of all things, people can genetically be intersex like doesn’t matter where you stand on transgender etc stuff like you can biologically be in between two genders.
Personally, as a trans woman, my ID representing me as male causes me a certain level of anxiety when dealing with anything asking to see it.
I have to out myself anytime I want to enter a bar, apply for a job, and interact with federal services.
Those include when I'm pulled over by a cop who I would really rather not know that I'm trans at risk of harassment up to the point of being jailed in a male prison system.
Gender markers affect your lived experience in the world so I believe it's important for them to accurately reflect how their holders identify.
Look at it this way: cisgender people have the ability to have their legal gender reflect their gender identity.
Nonbinary people currently do not.
This outcome isn't the end of the world, but it does reflect disappointing yet unsurprising attitudes towards trans people.
Having a legal third gender won't erase bigotry, but an unacceptable social climate leads to leaving nonbinary people out.
NO, America is the only country that has ever had racism or sexism or homophobia.
America is the WORST.
Gay rights (a cause I've personally championed in public) saw HUGE positive strides when "gay people could be anyone you love - your uncle, your teacher, etc, we're no different, we just want to be left to do our own thing like any other person" was the message in the 90s and early 2000s.
It was amazing.
