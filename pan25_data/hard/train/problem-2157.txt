Desantis had his moment with taking the heat on being anti-lockdown, keeping kids in school , yada yada and was honestly proven to be right.
Since then it’s just been trying to pawn Trumps image and I think it’s going to bite him in the ass in a year.
I don't think this is a political winner for Desantis.
He's an 800 pound gorilla in a state with an absolutely feckless and downright embarrassment of an opposition party, so the party will do what ever he decides to pick a fight with on that day.
But he isn't going to beat Trump in a primary by being a copy cat, and it going to be a very hard sell to Pennslyvania soccer mom swing voters that we should ban their free college courses on the main stage.
I just don’t see how any of this actual helps them.
Florida is a red enough state that they’re going to blindly follow whatever this wannabe does.
But elections are still won and lost on moderate middle class voters with two kids and two dogs and they’re not going to be won over by banning their kids from getting a head start on college.
Then no college should take any Florida students - when they learn their kids can't go to college outside the state the voters will make them quit the stupid culture war drama.
People shit on New Mexico for our education, but goddamn we must be doing something right if Florida is doing this.
Free college for students is better than anything Florida is doing.
