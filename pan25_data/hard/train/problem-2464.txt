The actual report just argues that each member should consider it and that the UN could help draw up frameworks that could inform and assist them in the process.
They are suggesting that each country individually should consider implementing laws that allow for criminal charges for actions that impact climate change.
I could see establishing a system of taxes/penalties for activities that significant contribute to climate change.
That's different from going after politicians for approving the construction of a coal mine.
And small consolation but I believe the new UK coal mine will be used for making steel rather than burning for electricity.
Well steel cannot be made without at least many forms of it so it would be good to have some coal left over long term.
Same goes for oil.
If we stop burning it now we'd have plenty left over for manufacturing.
You quoted me saying many forms so I don't know why you're under the impression I said all steel needs coal.
But yes if you want to make fresh steel from iron you generally need coal.
There's also electrolysis but that's insanely energy expensive so it's mostly been theorized for extra terrestial application such as foundries on the moon, which is rich in every element except carbon, that's super rare on the moon.
