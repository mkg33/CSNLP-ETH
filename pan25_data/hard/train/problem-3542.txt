Arizona is likely to go Biden and Dem because it is full of actual conservatives who can’t stand the racist/fascist crapola coming from Florida.
Think McCain types.
In my opinion it is possible that Biden might pull off a Reagan 1984 situation in 2024, where Biden runs the map except for Florida.
Regardless.. the real question isn’t whether Biden can get the necessary 270 over DeSantis/Trump, but by how far a margin Biden wins in 2024.
As a moderate who believe foreign policy being just as important as domestic in trying times we have rn, I can't think of anyone better equipped for the job than Biden.
I think it's a terrible idea to nix filibuster.
Senate seats flip all the time and wo filibuster, gop can do so much dmg and can introduce laws that could keep them in power.
It would destroy any and all bipartisanship and destroy the democratic process.
That's why even gop didn't nix filibuster when they had majority.
You would rather want them to be able to make drastic changes w one senator majority?
You say that now, but if gop had majority and used that majority to get rid of filibuster and pass bills outlawing abortions, making it easier to suppress voters, outlaw gay marriage, take away lgbtq rights and so on, you would be singing an entirely different tune.
They can literally make extreme gerrymandering legal to stay in power.
