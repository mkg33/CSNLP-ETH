And instead of just turning them over he claimed first they were planted then they were his and he wants them back.
You are trying to have it both ways: we don't know what was in both Trumps and Bidens docs but you are going to use that to assume that Trumps aren't NS threats but Bidens could be.
In a way, I worry more about Biden intelligently exploiting precise documents than Trump picking random papers out of spite...
Waiting to hear what republicans think should happen to Biden for this remembering that Biden returned the documents that were found and Trump is STILL HIDING some of the ones that were asked for.
And they had to get a search warrant signed off on before going in and getting the ones they have so far and Trump claimed that he had declassified them with his mind!
Even if Trump had willfully taken the top secret documents, when he was caught, he should have said my bad and returned them.
He didnâ€™t.
That is why he is being investigated.
There is no indication that Biden willfully took them.
And when his staff discovered them they contacted NARA and arranged for return.
Some protocol or process certainly needs to be fixed so that these sensitive documents are properly handled and moved when one administration ends and another begins.
