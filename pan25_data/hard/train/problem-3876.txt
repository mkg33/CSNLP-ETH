Russia should be excluded from all cultural and sporting events until such time as there's amicable peace reached over their aggressive war in Ukraine.
I think at a gymnastics event just after Russia's war started there were supposedly neutral athletes but, of course, a Russian teen that doesn't know any better put a big Z on his shirt with masking tape at the medal ceremony.
Yes, on a personal level it sucks for the athletes but Russia deserves no such international platform to pretend they're still part of the rules based international order of nations.
But let’s not pretend that any of the major sporting organization including the IOC care about what’s morally right.
Could be made quite simple that Russian athletes that don't support the war could be allowed to compete under the Olympic organisations flag.
Afterall, the actions of the state does not speak for the view of everyone from that state.
This isn't going to bat for Russia, just stating an option that exists with the International Olympic Commitee which could be used for a select number of athletes if they meet criteria.
I'm not particularly interested in making it an ethnic thing, I'm more interested in the Russian state being repulsed and punished.
