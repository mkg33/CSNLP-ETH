Yes?
It's saying that Exxon's own scientists were skilled and knowledgeable and came to the same conclusions as other independent/government scientists, not that they were somehow more skilled and knowledgeable than modern scienctists.
"Exxon’s science was highly adept and the “projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models”".
they use past tense, implying that the models used to be at least as skillful as others.
had they used present tense, the implication would have been that they still are.
the study itself, which is linked in the article, specifies "the same as that of independent academic and government projections published between 1970 and 2007.
".
usually i suspect some agenda behind client denialist comments.
refreshing to see that in your case, the cause is a simple reading and comprehension disability.
do you still not see the difference between A) "the studies were as skillful as otheres" and B) "the studies are as skillful as others" ?
A implies that they no longer are as skillful, B implies they are still top notch today.
and yes, in your initial comment you referred to studies from today, not from beteen \50 to 16 years ago.
