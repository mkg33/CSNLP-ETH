I think it's unlikely that much will be released following Tuesday's hearing because there are two outcomes from the Special Grand Jury: (1) no crimes were committed or (2) they think crimes were committed.
If it's the former, there's not a whole lot to say, because nothing happened.
If it's the latter, they're not going to want to say anything.
And even if they want to, they can only say so much, because pursuing charges means that they need to assemble a grand jury for an indictment, and grand juries are secret proceedings.
That will likely be tied to a conversation about whether or not the DA plans to file charges, but because of the nature of the topic, the hearing will be behind closed doors and not open to the public or press.
All we will get at this point is what the judge wants to give us.
The hearing on Tuesday will largely be about how much (if any) of the special grand jury's report can be made public.
Some good news - there's a hearing in GA Tuesday about what from the completed Fulton County special grand jury report is made public.
One of the prominent attorney analysts seemed certain that some kind of indictment or other serious move would follow from it.
This might be a good week.
