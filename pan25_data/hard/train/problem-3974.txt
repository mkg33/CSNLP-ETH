Airlines are a bogus industry.
The government is in complete control of route assignments.
It's not like 'I'm going to start an airline and undercut every existing route price.
'.
Sure.
Now what happens in 5 or 10 or 15 years when another contract dispute comes up?
You're climbing up a rotten tree to escape a bear and hoping the wind didn't blow too hard and knock you and the tree down.
And there's a storm brewing on the horizon.
What happens the next time they have a contract dispute (and they will, because we live in a capitalist world that undervalues labor) and threaten a strike?
If the workers decide to strike anyway (even though it would effectively erase their years of working towards their pensions) and the economy suffers.
They could make nationalizing the rails a precondition of ending the strike (as well as restoring their years of service towards their pensions).
The unions need to wildcat strike but i can guarantee you if the rail lines get nationalized, theyâ€™ll crumble into dust and a decade from now will be sold back for pennies on the dollar.
Strong unions, strong regulation thats what the government needs to support.
In the US it would be a nightmare.
There will never be the political will (tax dollars) to update the infrastructure.
Look at our roads, bridges and electrical grid.
Look at our poor schools, look at rural hospitals, look at the VA. Look at Amtrak for gods sake.
Money for minimal maintenance will be all it ever receives.
