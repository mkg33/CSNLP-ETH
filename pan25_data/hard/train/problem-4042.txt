Even the current oil price cap actually helps all countries around the world, including India, as it's reselling discounted Russian oil elsewhere at higher prices.
It only really harms Russia and its producers, but then you have to remember how OPEC (especially in the past) has been doing the exact same things in reverse, only their price hikes tend to harm the world economy.
Sanctions on Russia, alongside the economic effects its invasion of Ukraine around the world, of course, also slow down the global economy.
All mostly true, but the US also has strong relations with India, accepts many of their immigrants (heck, look how many important American CEOs are Indian-American) that bring remittances and skills home, invests in the country, sells arms to them, and helps New Delhi with China.
The point isn't to say "the US is necessarily a friend to India", as everyone more or less pursues its own interests, but these things have to be taken into account.
I read your comments explaining India's position .... but I am still convinced that as a responsible country, India should stop financing Russia, which is waging an unprecedented war of aggression against it's smaller neighbor.
