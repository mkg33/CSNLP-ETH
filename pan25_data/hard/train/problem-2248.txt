Can someone summarize what is the situation in Kosovo?
The article more or less describes how the “match was lit”, but I don’t really understand how or why Serbs and Albanians hate each other.
So serbs hate albanians because they see kosovo as their land, stolen from them by albanians.
Which is 100% true too.
It's basically the same as the current Ukraine situation except serbia=ukraine and albania/america/nato=russia.
They just came and took the land, they could do it with the back up from a greater power like america.
Their excuse was that the population was divided and that there are more albanian people there than serbs, which was not true at the time but it is now.
- The reason that caused Serbs to start not liking Albanians is that when the Ottomans conquered the balkans, the Albanians switched sides and became Muslim (mostly).
The Ottomans decided to expel as many Serbs as possible from the Serbian heartland and settle the area with Albanians.
They expelled the majority of the Kosovo Serb population after the Serbian Army pulled out following the NATO air campaign.
By that point, they were no longer the smaller army.
They were unopposed.
