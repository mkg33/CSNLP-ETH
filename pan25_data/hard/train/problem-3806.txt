When I moved here to Texas I did all the research and wrote up a full pro-forma on running an in home daycare so my wife could stay home.
The math simply makes no sense without either paying slave labor wages ($12/h is average here for childcare workers) or charging ridiculous prices.
Subsidy really is the only viable answer because I won't pay people garbage to work for me so we scrapped the idea.
When Texas completely runs out of child care maybe they will change their tune.
Most businesses pay out relative to risk.
Working with people is inherently risky, you're always one hover parent and lawsuit away from bankruptcy.
Now I have a business where I teach people with disabilities job skills and get them a job then go home.
If I owned a group home or daycare I'd be worried constantly.
Don't forget the same angry hillbillies want you unable to have an abortion or birth control.
So fuck you no matter what you do, even if you are responsible and know you can't afford the outrageous childcare expenses you still can't win.
Work nonstop and die a virgin I guess?
Nah, why work for the boss when I can work for myself or not work at all?
Iâ€™d rather spange then have no dignity by the end of the day.
