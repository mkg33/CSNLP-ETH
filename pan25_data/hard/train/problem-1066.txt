I was thinking more food and other resources.
I agree that a country would be more flexible with global responses.
Maybe I'm projecting then.
I was thinking they could take a lassiez faire approach and just take it to expand their international waters.
What if the lesson is that you don't start without a few years of supplies?
Is that possible?
Could China become 100 percent self sufficient, or enough to hold out until they are done with their dirty work?
In no way can China become self sufficient.
Not without leaving a very big portion of their population to literally starve and freeze to death.
Meanwhile, after 5 years they're out of energy and food and their people start to starve to death by the millions.
The US Navy and military can box China in without much trouble.
We just put up missiles that can hit their ships on the islands that surround China and plug the gap with our massive Navy.
Their only path at that point is to attack a neighbor like India to try to gain what they need to survive.
The problem China has is that they don't have anything other than cheap labor and some rare Earth minerals to offer the rest of the world.
They can be absolutely crippled without anyone firing a bullet through sanctions.
That's the key take away that China is getting from Russia right now.
Isnt China the same as Russia?
Greed caused military contracts to be fulfilled with lies and subpar equipment.
