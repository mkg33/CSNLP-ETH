If congress were proportional to the country's cross-section of religious beliefs (or lack thereof), there would be 42 members that self-identify as atheistic/agnostic and an additional 123 who call themselves religiously unaffiliated.
(3) Regarding the Jewish members, I would venture to guess many, if not the majority of them are religiously atheist, agnostic or unaffiliated but ethnically or culturally identify as Jewish.
(1) Politicians may feel like they're under pressure to present as more religious than they are because they think there is an electoral benefit to doing so (or an electoral cost to not doing so).
There are plenty of people who engage in nominally Christian activities like celebrating Christmas and Easter and having some vague notions of an Abrahamic God existing but don't actually go to church or take any Christian doctrines all that seriously.
That sort of non-politician wouldn't go out of their way to describe themselves as Christian but perhaps politicians do.
Granted, if you call yourself an atheist, you will NEVER be elected in many parts of America.
Lots of them hate atheists even more than Muslims, I’d reckon, though I haven’t seen data saying so.
Edit: It appears Muslims and atheists are hated rather equally among older folks.
Atheists are rather liked (by comparison to other “religions”) among younger people.
