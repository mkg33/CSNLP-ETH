And....
This is why immigration is so important in the US.
Without it the population in the US would begin to fall as well.
Other nations have shown that no amount of government intervention will effectively counteract this.
The US is lucky that it is still such a huge draw for immigration.
Their economy is f'd long term from the loss of working age manpower and shrinking population.
Who will buy real estate when there will be fewer people in the future to buy it and as a result will be much more likely to fall in price than gain?
Fewer people to buy hard goods so the price of your business stock will likely fall., etc.
Does that also work the other way, with small changes in demand causing large price swings?
As renewables begin to replace oil demand, will the price crash?
I'm assuming inelastic either means that you can't quickly produce more of the commodity to compensate for the reduced supply, or that the demand itself is slow to change, meaning that a reduced supply won't mean a reduced demand since the demand for oil won't change that quickly.
That sounds about right, and yes, it can go the other way, a small dip in demand can cause a sharp price drop as inventory piles up suddenly, some commodities are more elastic than others.
