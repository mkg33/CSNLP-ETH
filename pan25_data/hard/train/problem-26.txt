Fantastic, glad we all agreed Covid is not a pandemic any more.
That it is endemic and now playing nice with us and is mild at best with no long term damages to us.
Hmmm, now that you mention it I vaguely recall a video from 2020 that showed the science of the airflow in airplanes.
Came to ask that same question.
So on an 8+ hour flight, aside from wearing a hazmat suit, what are the chances of avoiding Covid on such flights.
I had to take a number of flights over the last few years for work and avoided Covid.
I'm not discounting I could merely have been lucky, but the air gets fully cycled in planes every couple minutes and with a mask you can avoid even more.
IMHO as long as you aren't sitting next to someone sick, mask up, and wash your hands before eating, you can be reasonably assured of avoiding Covid.
If you are fully vaccinated, properly wear an N95 mask and don't take it off, and wash your hands thoroughly while avoiding any hand to face contact, your chances of getting COVID are very small.
Very few people have the discipline to do this for the entire duration of airport transit and a long flight.
