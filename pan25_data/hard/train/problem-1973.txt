The Taliban today are almost exclusively former mujahideen.
Not the fly by night pawns that flip allegiances every other week, but the competent group of commanders.
To your point, many anti-Taliban groups are also former mujahideen.
I also get what your saying, insofar that obviously Americans didn’t recruit fighters using an extreme religious angle, but the Americans knew that was happening and still maintained an “enemy of my enemy” approach.
I wouldn’t call that lack of oversight and more deliberate indifference, which kind of defined US foreign strategy in the late 80s and early 90s (Iran, Nicaragua, Iraq).
Put another way, I really don’t think the Taliban would have existed in their current form if it wasn’t for US intervention.
The CIA armed and trained the precursors to the Taliban.
Yes, ostensibly through ISI, but only with a wink and nod.
There is 80s era us army gear all over Afghanistan.
Ok, yes, not exclusively the fault of the US.
Kind of like a gun dealer selling a gun to someone that they know is going to murder someone because the dealer needs to feed their family.
More like giving weapons and money to somebody to organize the defense of a neighbourhood knowing that some of the people they're hiring and arming are probably gang members.
Uh, the Taliban are not Wahhabist, they subscribe to a completely different branch of radical Islam, although in practice it's not that different.
But now Wahhabism has taken a center stage in Islam, with different sects claiming Wahhabism and discrediting other Muslims.
The Taliban thinks they represent Wahhabism, while Saudi’s think they represent it.
Then lots of infighting between.
Is that right?
