Can't speak for all Westerners, but I for one would love to see a democratic, prosperous, Erdoğan-free Turkey in the EU.
The sooner, the better.
I recall it was mainly the UK that scuppered your chance of joing previously, right?
It was a shit thing of them to do at the time (especially since the UK then went and left).
But then again, probably just as well, in hindsight...
Seeing as Erdoğan is now blocking Sweden from joining NATO, the EU is probably very happy to not have Turkey in there risking undermining its unity in a similar fashion.
Imagine what would it be like if Erdogan decided to blackmail the west WHILE being in the EU with open borders.
No thanks.
No.
New F-16s (block 70/72) have some of the same tech as the F-35 and are far more capable than their older cousins.
They are building brand new ones in SC right now for a number of export customers.
Maybe, but probably not that they can buy.
Serious competitors are the Gripen, Typhoon, and especially the Rafale, but Turkey probably can't buy them.
They also have an existing F-16 fleet, so maintenance will be easier.
