This is the key takeaway here.
There were close races in AZ, and this county is heavily Republican.
If their votes are excluded, the Democrats could pick up another seat in the House.
If only Democrats could make hay with this.
It's a swing and a hit that they will not capitalize on.
Meanwhile the Republicans will rant for weeks about the evil Arizona Democrats even though Republicans caused this.
Sometimes I wish liberals did have their own media conglomerate like Fox News.
At least then it would be fair and balanced.
The whole "it's not fair!"
narrative is a popular one.
A lot of these people don't personally understand the full extent of oppression and discrimination, yet argue that they're now one of the most suppressed and persecuted groups in this country.
It's fucking wild, racism is ubiquitous now, but only in the form of anti-white discrimination, only if they can be the ones cowering at the sharp end of it.
I've noticed that you can boil most conservative talking points and attitudes down to what an insufferable child might typically say or do.
For instance, the obvious example here is election denying, "if I win, I won fairly, if I lost, you cheated", that's as childish as it gets.
Now we can say things like, "Democracy as we know it is no longer valid because Trump convinced half of America that if they don't win, then the other party cheated.
Thanks Trump.
