I don’t remember the “west” invading Russia, I only remember Russia invading Ukraine.
What basis does Putin have to make the claim that the “west” for a war that could’ve been avoided by Russia simply not invading a sovereign nation?
Not really, while that was a point brought up, there were also statements implying some smaller nato members were not worth defending, which obviously was worrying for those on the border with Russia.
In current scenario where there is a real threat of direct confrontation with Russia and everyone in Europe is raising their defense spending i don't think that even Trump would consider leaving NATO.
Yeah main reason for threat of leaving was A. Trump wanted other members to spend more on their defense B.
There was no REAL threat for NATO.
US leaving NATO might be the thing which breaks the camels back and pushes Putin to got to war with Europe.
Abandoning your main allies in critical moment of need causing millions to die would forever destroy EU and US relationship.
