There is going to be a lot of re-population, in between countries, immigration, whatever, you can't blame anyone looking for a better life.
In the grand scheme, although I think every nation should open its borders to people seeking a better life, that comes with complications.
Nations that are "well off" will be drowned because the vast majority of the world doesn't have western standards, and you can't simply "adopt" people as +1 citizens, they bring a lot of the cultural and societal issues with them - not just assimilation - but why their countries failed in the first place.
Secondly, it's like homelessness.
Adopting people from worse-off countries doesn't do anything in the grand scheme of things.
You need to treat the cause, not the symptom.
Europe (and the west) would do better to help grow other nations than just adopt their refugees.
Immigration is fine, but the people who migrate need to learn and adapt to the society they live in.
That means learning the language, building relationships with locals and accepting the host nations values.
The UK tried an open door policy in the 00's and it built up a lot of resentment in the native population, it didn't help people complaining were immediately labelled as racist (some/many were, but it shut down discussion on the integration issues).
As a fun example a lot of British people retired in Spain.
They never learnt the language, insulted johnny foreigner in their own country and generally transposed some of the worst aspects of British culture.
The enclave allows them to operate as they would in their home country and that makes it obvious they hold different values which annoys the locals.
