You have no idea what you would do unless you've actually been in one.
Especially if it's the first you've ever experienced.
I was close to the epicenter of the Sylmar earthquake in 1971 and I think I was just frozen in bed for the 20 seconds or so that it lasted.
I've experienced a bunch of earthquakes since then, but none nearly that size.
Now I just wait a bit and if I think it's a big one I'll run outside.
I've yet to run outside.
A really big earthquake is absolutely terrifying.
Being a Californian, small earthquakes that don't do much damage are amusing.
I always speculate on the size and distance.
The further you are from the epicenter the more rolling it is.
If you are near the epicenter and it's a big one it's a big jolt that keeps on going for a bit.
Nah, any open window in freezing temperature will release the heat in a hurry.
A closed concrete room will provide a certain amount of insulation, but once the building is collapsed, the temperature will approach ambient in a hurry.
People are going to die of hypothermia even with minor injuries if they don't get rescued soon enough.
You can bleed out, freeze to death in cold water or suffocate in just three minutes so you assess and deal with injuries first.

The reason it’s a “rule” is that most people do not think clearly in a survival situation.
So it gets drilled in your head when you are safe and warm in the hopes you will remember it when needed.
I was pointing it out so you don’t skip this crucial step.
