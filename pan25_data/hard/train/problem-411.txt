So we spoke with a higher up and he said it's totally fucked, it would cost as much to fix it as buying a brand new laptop.
It needs a new board, new ram and cpu, and a new drive.
Maybe more than that, it may need a screen replacement too.
He claimed it was water damaged, which was a lie.
But basically he's telling us we should just get a new model.
Their practice seems to be "if the tech can't fix it in the next 10 minutes try and sell them a new one.
If they insist on repairs tell them it's totally ruined and not worth the time and money to repair when you can just get a new one, lie as needed.
".
For me it is a bit more.
It is only "self driving" if I don't have to be on the driver seat and at-fault accidents are covered by manufacturers insurance.
So in a true self driving car, I would only have the optional comprehensive insurance to cover cases like theft, or someone hitting my car without any fault on my cars end.
In fact I wouldn't even need to have a driver license in such a case.
