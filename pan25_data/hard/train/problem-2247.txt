Agreed.
Whatever the rules or norms, I don't think McCarthy would willingly vacate the office, nor do I think the Architect would act on their own initiative to force him out of the office, unless and until someone else is actually elected Speaker, no matter how long it takes.
In that sense, Gaetz's letter could actually help move things along.
At least Gaetz was actually on those committees in the previous Congress.
McCarthy is not, and has never been, Speaker.
The case with the Speaker's office is totally different.
Although it may be likely, it is not guaranteed that Kevin McCarthy will (ever) become Speaker.
Before yesterday, there was a presumption that he would become Speaker due to his position as the leader of the majority party.
However, that presumption was shattered as soon as he not only failed to reach 218 votes, he didn't even win a plurality of votes.
Moreover, there is, in fact, an "alternate" Speaker-designate who, as of right now, has a better claim to the Speaker's office than the thrice-defeated McCarthy.
I speak, of course, of the person who actually got the closest to 218 in the most recent Speakership election, i.e., Rep. Hakeem Jeffries.
It seems correct that the Speaker's office ought to be vacant for now and, if not, the person with the strongest claim to it is actually Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who's come in first in all three Speakership votes so far.
They really think by blowing up the House they will be able to elect a Freedom Caucus loon as speaker instead of McCarthy, a Freedom Caucus adherent as Speaker.
He just isnâ€™t crazy enough for them.
