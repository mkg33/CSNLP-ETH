Maybe if Buttigieg could have the default position of being in support of railroad workers and airline customers he wouldn't be seen as a "blatant corporate shill".
Given that his default position is support for airline passengers and all workers, including railroad workers, calling him a "blatant corporate shill" is just stupid hate.
Helping to "convince" the airlines to hire a lot more staff and pay them better, to adapt their schedule and to guarantee better customer service.
Multiple new or strenhened regulations going through the necessary process (of which this letter is a part).
$600 millions in refunds for passengers this year, record level of fines both this year and in 2021.
How exactly is this "standing with billionaires"?
You know that airlines can sue and courts look very closely at the authority the DOT actually has and whether the fines are proportionate?
And that in the end it's the passengers who pay for those fines?
Personally I think getting the money to the customers as fast as possible is a lot more important than trying to hurt the airlines and wasting taxpayer money with lawsuits that take years.
If they can't handle the cost of refunds for people who paid and didn't get their flight because the airline sold the seat twice, they have no business operating anyway.
