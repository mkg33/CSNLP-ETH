That being said, anything other than revolvers, pump/break-action shotguns, and bolt-action rifles should be outlawed.
If you hit every shot and 1 bullet kills each person you hit.
The killing potential is significantly less than an AR-15, semi-auto shotgun, or magazine-fed semi-auto pistol.
While I'm a proponent of gun control legislation, state-by-state or city-by-city gun legislation is like a designated pee area in a pool.
Gun control is most effective when it is universal.
There are ways to achieve similar results without guns.
Like the mothers during BLM protests/rallies, where they'd come and stand a line against police or other instigators.
There things tend to ebb and flow, but I can't really recall a time in my 46 years where LGBT+ people weren't persecuted in some way.
There was a slight decline as gay rights were passed, but I feel it helped support the future rhetoric.
I do feel in the past 10 years, there has been escalating vitriol directed at the communities though, which is sad given that almost everyone I know from that community are pretty decent people overall.
