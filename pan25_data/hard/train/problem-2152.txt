Cmon man!
Lasko is one of my favorite beers in country and i really hate Heineken...
I didnt even know that Heinken owns Lasko (Slovenian beer).
Its only good beer in my local store...
Edit: i see you are from germany and you guys have one of best/quality beers i have tasted in my life and its way cheaper then our cheapest shitty beer in plastic.
As someone who drinks a lot of cheap beer and has traveled a lot all over Europe I would say no European country I have been to has had worse bad beers than the US.
Your bad beers are in a league of their own and the reputation is well deserved.
Even Malta's Cisk is better than the cheap American lagers.
Sadly, yes, and I have no clue why since there are plenty of cheaper and better plain lagers.
But Heineken also has a lot of other beers, some of them actually good.
Okay no more Heineken beer for me then.
I boycott companies I don't care for.
If everyone was like me the world would change, you should try boycotting companies that are evil as well.
I don't drink beer, as a rule, so a boycot is difficult for me, but man, do I hate companies like this....
