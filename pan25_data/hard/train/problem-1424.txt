So he was in the perfect position to kill himself.
He didn't need any help moving that along with everything that had just happened to him.
They might have killed him eventually, but why bother?
He was already going to do it.
If this is a cover up then it's the best damn cover up in history because every single piece fits with his profile and the circumstsnces he found himself in--circumstsnces in which many others have also killed themselves.
Bring forward one shred of compelling evidence.
Because there's almost no evidence to support that "fact."
He was, accordingly, never charged with that, despite multiple investigations.
Because it's impossible to believe someone who had attempted suicide a few weeks prior, and signed his will the day before, might have killed himself.
Yes, an area nobody could get to without walking past the other cameras first.
Nobody referred or left the cell block.
None of the other prisoners saw anything but heard him tearing sheets.
One of them said "Jeffrey Epstein definitely killed himself.
Any conspiracy theories to the contrary are ridiculous.

The fucking answer is yes.
Do you live in America?
Do you understand the concept of transparency?
Did you not think we had the right to know what happened behind Iran Contra?
Or, Watergate?
Or White Water?
Or January 6th?
The Constitution demands transparency for the people.
They are supposed to answer to us.
Thats the way its written.
Our leaders have been implicated in Epsteins crimes.
We absolutely have the right to know.
WTF?
Dont tell me im not answering the question when you dont even understand the basic principle of the question you're asking.
