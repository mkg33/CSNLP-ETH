If a migrant re-location program was handled in a cooperative and thoughtful manner between the states, I think it would be great to see FL send migrants to other states.
Doing so is likely in the best interests of the migrants.
There are existing groups that are willing to help migrants resettle.
If DeSantis contacted them ahead of time and said "I have X migrants that I'd like to fly to this area," then they'd get everything set up to take them in.
Then I realized my mistake.
I was trying to fit PEOPLE in there and, even though the people I was trying to fit in were imaginary, my brain was giving them basic human decency.
If, however, I tried picturing cramming that many people shaped objects in the train car, I had no trouble at all.
I saw this when I went to the Holocaust Museum in DC.
At one point, you can walk through a train car or go around it.
I went through and paused inside it.
The plaque said how many people were stuffed in there, but I couldn't picture that many people in that small of a space.
The problem for DeSantis, though, is that this is too kind and doesn't have any shock value/"own the libs" value.
He doesn't personally benefit from working politely with groups to resettle these immigrants.
However, if he drops them off in random areas unannounced, then he gets both cruelty and "I'm owning the libs" points with his base and increases his political power.
