GenX-er here, what matters most is keeping the GOP out of the White House.
I'm for Biden until someone else shows up who will get more votes.
Haven't seen that person yet, don't expect to inside a year.
I mean same.
But it is worth pointing out that Biden defeated all the younger candidates to get the primary.
I think he has a lot greater ability to win than people are giving him credit for.
Democracy is a literal popularity contest.
If you can name that Democrat right now that will get more votes than Biden, I'm for it.
Otherwise, it's Biden.
A lot of people here are wishfully thinking that replacing Biden would ‘just work’.
The fact is: nobody, and I repeat NOT ONE SINGLE name is popular enough to top Biden on the Democratic side, and Biden right now has the absolute BEST chance of winning.
Trying to replace Biden would be handing the presidency to Trump/Desantis on a silver platter.
After his second term, we can look for a strong democratic replacement, but right now we need Biden to truly drive the stake into the heart of the GOP.
I like Biden, and also he's our literal best shot at keeping the Republicans out of the White House in 2024.
The major difference about Biden's voters that I enjoy is they do not see Biden as some demigod like the GOP sees Trump as.
There is no cult of personality around Biden and honestly most of voters, including me, only voted Biden because he was not Trump.
Realistically, that is the statement you're making if you would vote for the DeSantis over Biden because she would be president if Biden died.
