As for the other guys, the 20-ish holdouts, I'm beginning to wonder if they're not really the fascists I've thought they were, but are instead anarchists.
I'm not sure if all of those holdouts really have a vision of America that they want to see executed at all costs so much as they want to just watch the whole thing burn.
I think some of them are more akin to extreme libertarians who believe the best government is essentially no government at all, and as such they're actually enjoying this chaos as opposed to being ashamed of it.
That's why I'm wondering how long this has to go on for before a group of 6 or more Republicans just approach the Dems and try to get them to back an extremely moderate Republican who promises to make all kinds of concessions to the Dems, especially that they won't hold the government or the debt ceiling hostage.
This isn’t a path for the right to reap what they sow, this is a small hyper partisan extreme voting bloc that will wield equal power in the house to the republicans and democrats by blocking every bill and threatening to shut down the government every time twenty people don’t get there way.
>Unable to corral his caucus for what is usually an easy vote, there is no chance McCarthy would be able to get them on board for hard ones, like keeping the government open or raising the debt ceiling to avoid plunging the country into default.
While I think there are Rs that don’t want McCarthy, I very much doubt given recent history that there’s going to be any appetite to “work with Dems” - it seems it’s more likely that they want someone who is willing to shit down the good government over the debt ceiling next cycle.
Seriously, the guy spent years making sure peados didn’t get charged and now all he wants is to talk about a guys Phallus.
I think he’s so deep in the closet he found Narnia.
