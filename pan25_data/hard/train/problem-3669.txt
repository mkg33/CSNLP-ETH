The UK is still the second biggest economy in Europe and with predictions showing the backlash of Brexit to be mostly over by 2024 and the UK to start growing again, we would be of value to the EU, but with the tensions finally settling it is still too soon for both the EU and the UK, but by 2025 if we elect an actual government with some brains the EU will likely be open to start putting in place better trade deals with the UK and building that relationship up again what ultimately could lead to another UK vote to join the EU sometime in the next 10 to 25 years but of course things can change.
The predictions show our economy to finally grow in 2024 but honestly I doubt out government will be much help in making this happen, they are currently trying to destroy anything EU related to try and justify their Brexit claims what everybody knows is total bullshit at this point, but they can't back down because if they did the Tories would be basically admitting that everything from 2016 they have done has been total bullshit and it would destroy the party, this is the reason they are so bent on removing all EU laws even if they are among some of the best in the world for worker rights, health and safety, regulations etc...
Basically we are in a shit position with a government what won't back down because it will destroy them, the EU stuck not wanting to deal with the Tories due to the Tories going against anything EU related and things won't change until 2025, then after that it would be a good time to look at that question and see how the EU and UK relationship is going what I think very much depends on how we vote.
Basically we're at a stale mate until the UK finally gets it's shit together and starts building the relationship with the EU so ultimately another vote to join can be taken what would be years from now and impossible to say when, if or even if they will accept us because it is a very long time away before any UK government asks that question again.
If the UK ends up rejoining the single market, it would mean the UK would be complying with all the EU regulations and freedoms that they rejected with their hard Brexit, but this time without a direct saying on the policies going forward, because they are out of the EU.
It would effectively mean that years and years, along with hundreds of billions of pounds were gone to waste to end up in a worse position than the one they started with.
