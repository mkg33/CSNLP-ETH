The only thing that has changed is that they said they will help suicide on purpose instead of as a known byproduct through a lifetime of horrific injury, disservice, ignobility, and indifference.
Because I think there are strong arguments to be made that the availability of medically assisted suicide is actually a critical human rights issue, in that it is a human right to make that choice under some circumstances.
I support euthanasia, but it's one of my fears that it'll become a standard way to get rid of people that are an inconvenience, and take advantage of those that are suffering from situational depression.
Then you have situations like in Europe, where elderly patients now feel pressured to accept euthanasia and go through with it, thinking they are wasting resources/space.
The problem with legalized euthanasia is that it starts with cases that everyone agrees should be offered MAID, but then over time it slowly expands to more and more people.
Eventually it's being regularly offered to many, in lieu of other possible services.
