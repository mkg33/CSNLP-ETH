As these black voters physically become less urban and more suburban (ie go towards becoming rural), they will automatically become more conservative.
So.
Bringing that all together, here's a list of majority black counties, with election results and population density in ppl/kmÂ² as a measure of rural-ness.
Two, rural black voters are far less likely to vote, so they make up a smaller share of the electorate than they do the population.
So just because a county is majority black doesn't mean its electorate is.
Here's an article on that subject:
Your math also doesn't jive with the population distribution of black people in the US.
40% of black people live in urban America.
Yet 90% of black people vote democratic.
Even if urban blacks were 100% Democratic voting (they aren't), that wouldn't even come close to 90% unless rural and suburban blacks also voted heavily democratic.
So, to come back to this article, according to this theory, the reason black voters are the most reliable Democratic voters is because they are the racial group most likely to live in urban areas.
