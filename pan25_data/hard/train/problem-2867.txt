That's right.
For all intents and purposes it enshrines a permanent wealth class with most of the wealth being completely shielded from taxation.

It's long and boring.

But wait, it gets worse.
There is a provision in the tax bill calling for the repeal of the 16th Amendment (authorizing Congress to collect income taxes) within 7 years.

This would leave the federal government with virtually no income and it would need to drastically slash pretty much every program there is.
That is until like you said the gov runs out of money and then gets to use the “we can’t afford it” excuse for why every currently funded program gets gutted.
Oh but they’ll love forever on patents, selling you and your info to other governments, interest in federally funded loans and all the other shit they already make money from.
