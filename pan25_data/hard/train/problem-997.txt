Not just The West®, but presumably the incoming new Ruzzian government as well.
There's going to be a shit ton of missing money that needs to be accounted for once Pootey is out of power.
One of the quickest and oldest ways to ease into a new position of power is to blame everything wrong on the guy that was deposed.
The massive scale of the corruption in the Russian government under Putin and how shockingly blatant it was, makes me think it's nearly guaranteed that whoever comes after Putin will blame EVERYTHING on him because of easy it will be to do.
Oh absolutely, the thing though is almost everything I’ve ever read/studied about Russia is that it’s not just X official or X leadership at the time is corrupt but the entire system is fundamentally corrupt, in a that’s the way of doing business thing.
My guess is Belarus, Qatar and Saudi I don’t think risk completely being alienated by the west by harboring him but definitely not out of the question either.
I don’t see China unless it’s completely in secret, China I think is friendly with Russia no doubt but as a necessity for certain things like energy.
Whoever knowingly harbors a fleeing Putin is going to get backlash from the west, especially if he is able to do some crazy shit before he flees.
Just an opinion.
