This is why Democrats need to do more to fight voter suppression besides telling people to "vote harder".
You would think after that last election debacle the Republicans would have figured out that restricting voting only hurts their base.
All that happens is Democrats become more determined to vote and make sure they do while Republicans get stoned walled with the way they are used to voting and are too lazy to do anything else so they don't vote at all.
And when it affects republicans ability to vote the GOP will easily convince their constituents itâ€™s the democrats fault.
Over and over and over again the GOP passes legislation that benefits themselves and the wealthiest Americans.
The resulting negative impacts of that legislation on the majority of Americans is framed in a way to blame the opposition.
No matter how much evidence exists to the contrary, they will always believe whatever their party tells them.
With the decline of our public education system, the ignorance in our country that allows this to happen will only increase.
