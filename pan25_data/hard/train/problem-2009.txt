Sure, those exist.
They are the good ones that - for whatever personal reason they had left Turkey - enjoy living somewhere else.
I am not talking about those.
They are usually older, smarter and liberal.
You get 2 votes to influence geopolitics and can use it for conflict.
On a national view point that all makes sense but we don't live in national bubble, we live in a global bubble and our understanding of democracy should retled that.
So, yeah...
I think people with multiple nationalities should be given the chance to choose, but they shouldn't be given extra votes.
So you're in favor that a citizen living away from the country of their citizenship shouldn't be allowed to vote in that country's national election?
If they're under a work visa for a couple of years they only should be able to vote in their home country since that's where they will be returning to, they shouldn't be able to vote in the country they work temporarily in.
We do allow dual citizenships ofc, but guest workers living here temporarily gets no rights in our elections.
If they live here 15years chances are they would be approved for Norwegian citizenship should they chose to apply.
