Agreed.
That unwavering optimism is the veil that these assholes operate in so that they DON'T have to change things.
It IS good that things are FINALLY starting to SLOWLY change, but the change needed to happen 30 years ago.
This little bit of progress is nothing to jerk ourselves off to.
It isn't a defeatist attitude, it is pissed off that these cocksuckers have done this much harm and will face little to no consequences.
I vote for the right people, but my 1 vote vs their billions of dollars is a slow crawl toward progress.
That doesn't make up for the fact that this is so far behind where we could/should be at in order to not permanently damage things, assuming we can even fix the problem (we won't).
We will probably not destroy the planet but millions of people will die so that a few oil execs could get a couple more dollars.
Billions sounds big, but the oil industry has earned literal trillions from fossil fuel extraction, and set us on a path to spend more trillions to attempt to fix the mess they created.
The extent to which powerful oil interests pour money into efforts to stop any regulation of fossil fuels and carbon pollution is mind boggling.
