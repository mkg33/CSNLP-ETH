No, Congress and the president worked together to steamroll US rail workers.
They averted a strike and showed the railroad management that they don't need to negotiate in good faith anymore because the government will simply impose a contract on the workers because they're so essential to the economy that their own demands don't matter.
Uk rail workers have been striking for the vast majority of the year and good on them i fully support them, the union leader MIck Lynch is exactly whats needed he doesn't take bull from the government and train bosses and calls out the media at every given chance.
I understand the need for strikes and i rely on the trains but what i dont like is being used as kind of a barganing chip in the process, the strikes are organised on purpose with maximum distruption to the public in mind and i just dont feel like thats the right way to do things, the assumption being cause as much trouble for the public as possible that the commutor complaints will force the hand of the pay masters.
I dont like the way this is done.
However when the weekend for the London Marathon is picked for strikes for example then it’s clear this was done with the sole purpose of hurting the commuter to force the hand of the employer which is the same for striking at Christmas, they could strike tomorrow and it would be fine however it won’t happen tomorrow it will likely be the busiest shopping day of the year they strike on and that IMO is not the right way to do things.
