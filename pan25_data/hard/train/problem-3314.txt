Genuinely hoping all the shit they’ve been shooting down and not saying what it is other than “drastically different from the Chinese balloon” is actually extra terrestrials and we’ve done pissed them off by picking off their vanguard.
Having a "spy balloon" float over the continental US wasn't a good look, so now they're posturing by shooting them down.
At least for North America, there have probably been spy balloons flying over for awhile, but two things recently happened that changed the paradigm:
I mean, from a surveillance perspective, the balloons are nothing more than a satellite would see.
Although, the lower altitude might allow for more electronic snooping than a satellite could, square cube law and all.
True but the stories saying that Trump admin didn't know says either NORAD kept national defense information from the president or didn't realize it yet.
Using the facts as they currently are, if the Chinese have one balloon, they have more.
If the US of all countries did not detect balloons for several years, its highly plausible that China has been sending balloons for a while and only after the US said, "Hey, that signal?
It's a Chinese balloon."
did all the other countries discover the overflights as well.
