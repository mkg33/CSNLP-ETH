The problem is he walked in with a film crew and used the place for his publicity stunt without asking the permission of the owner.
But they wouldn't be out of bounds to refuse service to a private citizen with a film crew who did not get permission to film on their property, would they?
Edit: I don't think it's unreasonable to say, "You are more than welcome to eat here, but you are not welcome to film and hand out political material (MAGA hats) here.
".
And?
They can’t stop paying customers from walking in and buying burgers.
I feel duty-bound to say, I don’t support Trump, but McDonalds would be wayyy out of bounds to refuse service on the basis of political ideology.
Just to clarify though, legally speaking McDonalds would be well within bounds to refuse service to anyone they want for purely political reasons.
Plenty of businesses do and this kind of autonomy is regularly championed by the right when it's something they agree with.
But socially/politically yes it would be a shitstorm if they did on the right due to their hypocrisy.
