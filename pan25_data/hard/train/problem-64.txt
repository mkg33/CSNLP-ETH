True, we hoped to produce a friendly state that acted and thought like us, but that's a rather different beast, even if it's also a bad policy to go about doing.
The big advantage of GLSDB is it's flexibility via the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (hence the SDB) which has a load of snazzy features, such as enabling a "return angle" attack.
As in, the missile can fly past a target, turn around, and hit it from behind.
The SDB also has variants to allow laser designation of targets, ability to track moving targets, etc.
The latter statement isn't true here.
The standard GMLRS warhead is 200 pounds tnt equivalent in either a unitary high explosive version or a fragmenting style.
The warhead is a little more than half the size on that of the GMLRS and surely subsonic because it needs to glide like 100km to hit the quoted range figures.
It'll destroy vehicles and most buildings it can hit but you'd have to identify, target, and hit them.
At 150km without air superiority that's not very easy.
On the upside, these are cheaper than GMLRS and more spammable assuming we're sending a lot of them.
