Yeah, we know the parliament was against him and tried unsuccessfuly to impeach him legally.
That doesn't negate nor justify the fact Castillo tried a self coup, an extremely illegal power grab, and got legitimately thrown in jail for it.
On to the argument on what is or is not a coup, our previously elected president was ousted by congress in the exact same way as Castillo was and that move has widely been regarded as a coup.
One of Castillo’s main campaign goals and the reason a lot of people voted for him was to reshuffle the corrupt congress and rewrite the constitution to remove clauses that have been damaging our country for so long, such as the Congress’ current ability to impeach presidents based on ‘moral incapacity’ at any given time, which was left vague intentionally and can mean anything at all.
This constitution was written by the previous dictator of Peru as well mind you, and has been a hindrance on our country for decades now.
I hate that this is the main narrative that is being spread in the news abroad.
Congress started their first impeachment attempt literally in the first month of his presidency and has blocked almost every single law and measure his party attempted to make, not to mention the dismissals and forced resignations from many of his cabinet picks, leading to chaos in the government and nothing getting passed.
Not sure what is happening, but it feels like Castillo was played for a fool and was used by higher powers.
The right wing of the government now has a firm grip on the politics, and the army has shown that they are backing them up.
The people are calling for early elections but the new president is trying to stay in power.
