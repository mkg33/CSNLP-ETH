They lost a nuclear core in North Carolina.
Their solution?
Buy up the field and put a do not enter sign.
Yes?
You know that just because a balloon is deflated that it doesn't just fall straight down right?
Wind is going to blow that shit off course hard.
And once it deflates and falls low enough, radar isn't going to track shit.
The jets fly too fast to really keep on a small ass target falling down.
The jet is travelling at mach speed, and the balloon is travelling at wind speed.
Any object dropped by the jet would continue travelling at mach, making this difficult to justify, but I see what you mean.
The debris could have landed anywhere, do you think a jet can track literal pieces of garbage?
Once it broke up it was not trackable with equipment and visually you'd never find it either.
Really man, what kind of equipment do you think the military uses to track bits and pieces of a blown up balloon?
There's literally nothing that will do that.
That's true.
I guess depending on the material composition is could've just... vaporized?
Honestly I think we just need more time and stuff will be found.
The longer that takes, the less trust we will have of anything reported though..
