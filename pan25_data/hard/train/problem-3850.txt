However major protests are happening in Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing right now, and all of them are protesting against a problem all 1.5 billion of Chinese citizens can deeply empathize with.
A single protest in a major city like Shanghai would be more impactful than 100 of the small protests, let alone so many happening in so many major cities simultaneously.
But once it reaches a certain scale and it reaches a high profile and god forbid, if people protests against the central government, then the line is crossed and there will be swift crackdowns.
For people who are saying "oh protests happen all the time in China so this isn't a big deal", I cannot emphasis how unprecedented the current situation is.
People also don’t realize that China is very lenient with small-scale protests against specific policies, but it’s practically unheard of for protesters to be going after Xi himself, or the CCP.
First of all, it was said for decades (since Tienanmen square) that the people would never even openly defy the government, but here we are seeing the CCP challenged so brazenly and on a national scale.
