I think the only thing he actually has to worry about is that he’s becoming an inconvenience to the GOP.
They might actually help clear the runway for an indictment if he doesn’t drop out and start paying other candidates’ bills from his PAC.
And I think we all know how likely he is to do either.
Yes, I am aware of those.
I don’t think state level cases especially the NY case have the potential to turn loyalties away from Trump and towards DeSantis.
I think the NY case worst case scenario for him is its potential to negatively impact Trump’s businesses.
I think criminal charges and a trial will result from the Georgia investigation but trumpanistas have already effectively cast that as an individual’s vendetta against Trump and his loyalists, just as they did with the members of the Jan 6 committee.
I agree.
I think this is what is going to happen.
I think the Jan 6 investigation report will help but they are really waiting for the outcome of the classified documents investigation.
Of the two investigations, Jan 6 is hopelessly politicized while theft of top secret documents is a lot harder to get partisan about.
That is the Republican end game.
Their condemnation of Trump sitting down with infamous dinner guests is testing the waters.
They are looking for real life indications that their party’s midterm election losses really do signal Trump fatigue.
So far so good.
They will keep up condemning his most egregious behaviors to normalize the criticism, then ramp it up using the results of the top secret documents investigation under some nationalistic perspective about Trump endangering security.
Simultaneously they will promote DeSantis to give trumpanistas someone else to fix their loyalties on.
