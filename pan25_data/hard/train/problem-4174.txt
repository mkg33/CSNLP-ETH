Screw this lady for thinking it's her job to tell other people who to love.
She has as much moral authority on the subject of who other people can love and marry as I have in dictating what God she is allowed to worship.
How does the legal marriage of two people stand between anyone and their ability to worship as they choose?
How does it endanger them in any way that they need protection?
This is so off the wall, there's no basis for answering her concerns.
Americans have gotten so slap happy with their choices of representatives our legislative process is crippled by the time wasted by allowing drivel like this.
This isn't presenting a defensible argument against the issue.
And that's because there is no defensible argument against same sex marriage.
I'm still looking for the connection between same sex marriage rights and a threat to religious freedom.
Marriage under the law has nothing to do with religion.
Thousands of straight and atheist couples get married in courtrooms instead of churches every single day, yet I’m sure she hasn’t cried in front of Congress about those.
She hasn’t decried Trump’s multiple failed marriages, well-publicized affairs, proven pornstar settlements, rape allegations, or his children conceived out of wedlock.
So those are all kosher because he’s straight and has only married, divorced, knocked up, raped, and paid for sex with women?
But I shouldn’t be allowed to marry my same-sex partner of 8 years inside a courtroom because that might offend your personal god you worship in a church I will never see?
In her case I think she might genuinely be afraid of the consequences of letting gay people get married.
She's lived in terror of a vengeful God all her life.
She probably things the USA will quite literally get sucked into hell if she allows gay marriage.
