Thoughtfully and strategically constructed legislation is another rung on the ladder of progress.
It may not get us to the height we aim for, but it gets us a little higher to reach the next step.
The obvious answer is that they made it easy to swallow and bulletproof.
We're not trying to end homophobia with this law, we're trying to protect LGBT and interracial marriages today so that the Supreme Court can't take the right away as they have signalled they will.
This protects every existing gay and interracial marriage in the US as well as protects every gay and interracial marriage in the future.
Yes, there is still work to be done to get those other states to allow gay and interracial marriages, but that will either require a social change to vote in better politicians, or a constitutional change to eliminate any gray area with the first amendment.
Nah, itâ€™s because it allows (if Obergefell is rolled back) states like Utah and North Carolina to openly ban gay marriage again, as long as they recognize them when their residents elope to Hawaii.
