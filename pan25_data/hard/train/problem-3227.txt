I mean, regardless of historical context, anything good Hitler would have done doesn't really matter.
But like take Volkswagen, it started under Nazi Germany, it's a fact, but it's not really relevant to anything other than maybe some Volkswagen history.
Another case of using forced labor and a dirty past.
I would say it's a case that something good came out despite its origins rather than credit to them, I guess is what I'm getting at.
But the kinds of arguments Kanye is making is trying to credit this stuff to Hitler and Nazi Germany, which distracts from the whole point in bringing up Hitler.
I don’t know where he got the idea that Hitler created the microphone, but I suppose he just got confused about the fact that Hitler used a microphone during his hate-filled rants?
Close enough, I suppose.
First, the autobahn predated Hitler’s rise to power, and even after, only a relatively small portion of the planned system was actually built by the Nazis.
Worse, much of what the Nazis did complete was built by compulsory labor, and during the war, actual slave labor.
The rest of Kanye’s rant is even crazier than what’s quoted here.
Kanye tried to credit Hitler for creating highways and the microphone as examples of the good Hitler has also done.
He was on Alex Jones' program (just to make the whole thing somehow worse) and claimed that Hitler invented the microphone and highway.
Both were invented before Hitler, but Kanye is attributing them in what's either a horrible understanding of history or a horrible justification for praising Hitler.
If Kanye seriously thinks that he "invented" antisemitism or that we invented the concept just now to criticize his statements, then he's seriously ignorant of history.
