Turkey's done so much more over the last year to increase support for Kurdish issues in Sweden than anyone else.
A lot of basic liberties have been granted or expanded for Kurdish people and Kurdish speakers during the last 20 years.
Official TV channels started broadcasting in Kurdish for example.
As context Kurdish villagers were being deported to random provinces as early as the 90s.
Kurdish terrorists have been a problem for turkey since its founding, many NATO countries backed them in Syria anyway.
Turkey's position hasn't changed on the issue but since most of NATO doesn't care about Turkey that didn't matter.
Activities of Kurdish terrorists in and around turkey directly threaten the territorial integrity of the country, which is why turkey doesn't take kindly to them no matter who is in charge.
Don't be mistaken here, Sweden's paltry support for the Syrian Kurds is not a serious security threat to Turkey.
Erdogan is just trying to milk the situation for as much political benefit as possible before elections next year.
