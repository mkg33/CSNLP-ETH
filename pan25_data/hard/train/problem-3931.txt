That being said, Trump's presidential announcement couldn't have been placed at a worse time and was met with crickets.
He didn't energize anybody and has exactly zero momentum.
I imagine he's hoping to recreate his bullying the other candidates in the primary debate stage thing.
Who knows if that works twice though.
I think we need some primary polling.
DeSantis polls well against him amongst GOP voters, but are the people that want DeSantis people that will show up to primaries?
IDK.
I feel like the red in their bones Republicans still like Trump and they're the ones that vote in the primaries.
As for why...... it because the GOP voter base really hate the 'rinos' and are 'done' with the neo-political system.
They will continue to throw Trump like a Molotov cocktail.
I wouldn't be too shocked if more state GOP's canceled their POTUS primaries should Ronna/Co make a play for anyone other than Trump.
Trump's speech was intentionally presented to address the DeSantis swayable type of voter, it wasn't designed/written to address the base.
Thus it was subdued and targeted.
