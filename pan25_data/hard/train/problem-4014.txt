Interestingly, Stonehenge has nothing to do with the original Druids.
Stonehenge predates them, by quite a bit.
Moreover, from what we know of actual ancient Druidic ceremonies, they were generally conducted in woodlands, not in stone ceremonial spaces.
The actual age of Stonehenge was only determined much later, well after the association between Druids and Stonehenge was already well established in the popular mind.
What I find fascinating about this is that there is absolutely no cultural memory left from the people who built Stonehenge.
Not a shred.
I don't know, spirituality is something that just doesn't come naturally to me, it's not how I interact with the world, but if I did, it would probably be related to the cycles of nature, the origin of the universe, and the history of our species, and Stonehenge with it's connection to the Solstice and as such an iconic remnant of our first steps into civilization does feel like it would be a good place to experience that.
I mean, they did have that luxury for thousands of years until that point.
The religion of the people living in that region was probably unrecognizable to the builders of Stonehenge by the time Romans arrived on the island, let alone Christianity.
