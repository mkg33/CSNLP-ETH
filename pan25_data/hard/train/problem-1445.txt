For those who are unable to read Finnish, Marin said that the talks about sending heavy military equipment are progressing and that the general support is increasingly shifting towards providing heavy weaponry for Ukraine.
They see it likely that we’ll be providing this aid in coming weeks, or at most month(s).
Meanwhile, Finlands’ NATO ascencion is unlikely to happen before this summers' NATO summit, after Turkey’s has held elections.
If Finland magically gets into NATO but Sweden doesn't, it effectively turns into an island surrounded by NATO.
That definitely improves their security situation but it allows them to be "freeloaders" hoping that others in their way protect them from the Russians so it's better to tie them into the joint alliance.
I do understand that, seeing the perceived vs actual capabilities of Russia does get a bit smile on most people's faces but that sort of attitude can easily lead to complacency and complacency is dangerous.
Best we all stay aware of the horrors in Ukraine and Russia's willingness to use force to pursue their geopolitical goals.
I hate to say this but…didnt the US and Russia sign an agreement to protect Ukraine if they gave up certain weapons…and then turned in to aggressor and bystander?
