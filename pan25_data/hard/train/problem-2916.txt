Europe was not on a war footing before this, if Zelensky hadn’t asked for ammo instead of a ride, we’d be facing Russian troops on the borders of Poland, Moldova, and Hungary; all NATO countries.
This is a case of non NATO country fending off Russia, if Russia invaded Poland that would be the full deployment of NATO forces.
If these pro-russia / anti-nato right-wing leaders get elected and Russia wins in Ukraine, there is a possibility of Russia attacking EU or Nato nation in the future.
The point is, that there is more than 0% chance that Russia manages to divide western countries to the point which makes alliances like NATO fall apart.
For example USA leaving NATO (which Trump said is a possibility if he was president), or France leaving NATO (LePen said she wants to leave as well).
Another example is USA, where democrats and republicans are more divided than ever, and there is more than enough proof that Russia has actively fueled the anger (especially on republican side) between the two parties.
