Definitely a bunch of negative responses from people who didn't read the article.
They are projecting that electricity production from renewables will go from 29% to 35%, and therefore surpass coal, if you combine all renewables together.
Basically it says that by 2025 we will have spooled up renewable energy enough for it to rate above non-renewable in terms of supply.
The article then makes the incorrect assumption that renewables will be the majority of all energy supply within 3 years, but that’s not what the report says!
This just means that renewable will be the dominant energy provider it doesn't mean that fossil fuel usage is necessary reducing fast enough to fully stop climate change.
To a less extreme degree that’s what’s happening here, our global adoption of renewables is only offsetting our increased consumption of global power.
It’s a great improvement as a percentage but doesn’t really decrease from our base co2 emission, it only decreases what our hypothetical current emission would be without them.
The problem is (and I’m using silly numbers because I don’t feel like calculating the ratios), if you use 100MWH, and go from 0 renewables to 50% renewables, but now use 200MWH of electricity… you’re still burning the same amount of oil.
No one here is making the argument that renewables are bad.
They’re arguing that we aren’t utilizing them fast enough to avoid the giant fucking (ironic) iceberg in front of us.
