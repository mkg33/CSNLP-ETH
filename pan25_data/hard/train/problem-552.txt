So what I’m hearing is, it should be a lot less expensive to drive an EV than a gas powered car.
Imagine if they had subsidized the renewable energy market instead.
Solar and wind options would be so affordable anybody could put them in.
Solar is not the cheapest option, not even close.
The amount of minerals needed for 1 solar panel is an order of magnitude higher than coal.
You know how many minerals you need to have power from coal?
1.
That’s it, coal is all you need.
You find a rock and you burn it.
Anyone believing that solar, which requires a massive supply chain expanding the 5 continents and and armada of shipping containers powered by diesel transporting minerals across all the oceans in the world before the work to produce a single solar cell has even begun, is cheaper than finding a rock and burning it is grossly uninformed or being paid to push a false narrative.
Solar is a third generation energy source, meaning you can’t even produce the equipment required to generate electricity from solar without coal and diesel.
Almost all solar power plants rely on a gas or a diesel backup plant to provide energy when the sun is not strong enough.
Solar and wind is dirth cheap to generate per KW/H yes, but delivering that power to you is a whole other matter.
Right now on most cases the shortfalls of wind/solar when it comes to reliability is subsidized by existing infrastructure.
When wind/solar is producing you turn down the fossil fuels/nuclear/hydro production and vice versa.
Guess what happens when you add more and more solar and wind and the legacy generation no longer is enough to compensate those shotfalls?
You start to hit treshholds where you have to start building additional infrastructure to accomodate it.
It then suddenly it goes from very cheap, to very expensive with intermittent generation.
