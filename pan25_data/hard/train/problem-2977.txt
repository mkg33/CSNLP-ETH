Also Republicans: No guns at our big events, please.
If lots of people are armed then that isn't safe.
Indeed, but they are just smart enough to also realize that the presence of "good guys with guns" has a low chance of stopping the "bad guys" until after the bad guys start shooting and probably hit someone.
Yeah we agree, but as it stands there are no consequences that are strong enough to stop them from carrying guns into the floor.
Honestly I think the moderate stance on gun control is stronger than the progressive stance at this point.
A lot of progressives have been shifting far enough left to get their guns back.
Progressives are realizing this as they wake up to the reality at hand and shift further left.
Pink Pistols, John Brown Gun Club, and SRA membership is exploding.
It's mostly the old neolib holdouts that are delusional enough to think there's any hope of reasonable middle ground compromise with the far right that are still holding on to the old Democrat gun control platform.
Tbf, a lot of Democratic lawmakers could do a lot more than they're doing to resist the GOP and just keep trying to take the easy way out by pushing dumb platitudes about bipartisanship while doing things that their donors/GOP donors (lots of the same people) like.
The way to fix that isn't by punishing the Democratic party/punishing America by allowing Republicans to get elected, though it's turning out to vote in primaries and making sure all your friends and neighbors know who the good and bad Democratic lawmakers are.
Oh, so we got the metal detectors got reinstalled?
I must have missed that story, thanks for trying to link it there but it looks like you copy and pasted the wrong link since that article doesn't have anything to do with what we've been talking about.
