I think people greatly underestimate the effort ahead.
Liberating the territory stolen since February is going to be hard.
Liberating Luhansk and Donbass are going to be brutal but likely if things continue as they are.
Not sure how they liberate Crimea, it should be extremely defensible, with only a very narrow approaches to attack... Hope they do liberate all of Ukraine, but I think it is very early to talk about counter attacking into actual Russian territory.
However it remains a possibility and unless Ukraine has the resolve and capacity to push Russian forces back from all the annexed land, or think they can somehow force Putin to conceded...they might just have to take it.
There's also a non-zero possibility that if Russia is pushed back to its borders, it'll spend however many years Putin's clique remains in power flinging missiles into Ukraine.
Also once a ceasefire happens, Ukraine is getting fast tracked into NATO, at which point Article 5 will likely mean that the Russian shelling stops (and the Russian state sponsored terrorism ramps up).
Nope, EU and US have made it clear that their ongoing support is contingent on that not happening - they won't even give Ukraine proper AA protection, because it's field of control would reach too far into Russian airspace.
