We can see a similar arc with Elon Musk.
Though he can't send people to a gulag, he can (and does!)
fire people for telling him things he doesn't want to hear.
So Putin may have been competent (though definitely evil) at one point, but over time he's created a system where it's no longer possible to be competent because he's become separated from reality.
If this were true though, it would rely on Putin forgetting that even before accounting for his horrific corruption, Trump is an absolutely useless bumblefuck who is bound to accomplish none of that.
Best he can do is yell out a few token orders to his base.
EDIT: Before the Ukraine war, I thought of Putin as a cunning despot.
But now I think he might just be an equally useless bumblefuck who was cruel and lucky enough to seize power.
That begs the question-- is it absolutely necessary to be gulag-happy with your inner circle as a tyrant?
Because you could insist that your trusted advisors always tell you the truth and shield them from punishment for bad news.
Seems like an easy way to avoid turning into a helpless psycho in the end days.
He should hope that plan moves quickly then, because apparently his health is declining.
Crazy to think he wouldn't just want to chill with his vast fortune in his final years.
