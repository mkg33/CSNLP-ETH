Yes it's a given that Israel's gov is more representative of the views of Israelis than the PA where there's no competitive elections yet this point is missed on you.
What about Palestinian Christians who are overwhelmingly anti-Israel?
Do you have some other excuse for dehumanising them since they're not Muslim?
Also do you think Arab-Muslims in Israel who make up 20% of the population should be allowed to vote?
To your last question - if they wanna be part of the Israeli society, that just want to live in peace, and not praise the killing of jews, I more than welcome them to be able to vote.
Ofc I didn't mean ALL Palestinians, and some do want democracy, but like I said, if most wanted it, they would have had it by now.
wtf, like Israel has had no role in the prevention of a Palestinian democracy?
That's literally Netanyahu (and Sharone's, and ...) life's work, preventing a functioning Palestinian state.
Am I blaming the occupying power for occupying and controlling every aspect of Palestinian existence?
Yes, the occupiers are occupying.
I will be brave enough to connect those dots.
