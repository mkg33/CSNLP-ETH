" Deli, a land of gold, a haven for the capitalist, but a land of sweat, tears, and death, a hell for the workers.
The coolies were forced to work; they were slaves.

My family suffered greatly during the El Salvadoran civil war.
If the warring parties or the US government apologized, or if they already have, I personally would not be affected in the slightest.
A fair amount of the monsters involved are still alive and won't see justice.
Yet, I really don't care and will continue to live my life just fine with or without someone taking responsibility.
So I'm on the side of "it doesn't really matter" but again, that's just me speaking for me.
