some of these arrests are relatives of the terrorist.
arresting them for intel and as a way to show the terrorists that their actions will affect their loved ones.
a person can be influenced by his surroundings, those arrests are done in order to understand how a 13 year old gets access to a weapon, if he has any connections to a terror organization or was ordered to do so by a relative.
you see?
the difference is that Israel targets militias and terrorist organizations while the palestinians target civilians leaving a praying site.
You just said Israel doesn't target civilians by explaining how Israel targets innocent civilians because they are related to someone who committed an act of terror?
Lol, you literally said that Israel targets innocent civilians who all they do is just be relatives of someone who did terrorist attacks that's the most radical thing I had ever heard.
No you mean to help terrorists organisation with attracting more people that's only show Palestinians that's Israel is shit and the hate is justified.
So then Israel treats Palestinians like shit and then justifies it, and then some Palestinians do some fucked up radical shit.
Thenâ€¦.
