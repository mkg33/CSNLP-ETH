- British Steel has said it will not use coal from the Cumbria project because its sulphur content will be too high, while Tata has said it may use some coal from the mine, but ultimately plans to shift to greener production methods over the next decade.
This coal mine is being said to use for steel in the UK but UK Steel has said no it won't be used as they are moving to green alternatives and actually 85% of the coal will be exported which is purely for money and not a requirement to stop using russian coal.
B) thereâ€™s support for a backward step to produce coal, 80% of which is expected to be exported and contribute to the carbon output of the UK, against the trend of steel production around NOT using coking coal in its process.
Cumbria's Metallurgical coal is compatible with just about all steel plants worldwide, and was used in UK plants until it became cheaper to import from Russia and America (Hell, we get 1/4 of it from Australia, do you want to guess the pollution that causes?
Equivalent to millions of cars).
The export level is due to requiring a certain level of mass production for the process to be economically viable, this production rate is in excess of the UK's current requirements.
This has popped up a few times, and folk keep missing a key point, usually to fuel /Worldnews Anglophobia.
