I know this.
However Belarus has a large border with Ukraine that isnt just near Kyiv, and its likely to be used for an attack if Russia wants to lessen the Western supply flow into Ukraine.
The conventional war for Russia was lost the moment they plundered their first attack and west realised Ukraine won't just tumble over and started arming them.
Putin didn't get his truce, which leaves Ukraine in an advantages position, but the winter is going to try Ukrainian soldiers as much as Russian.
Melitopol will be make or break and both nations know this.
Unless there is another surprise breakthrough like what happened in the north a few months back, we can expect the battle lines of spring to be fairly set until either nation runs out of money.
People remember the Winter War as an embarrassment for the USSR, but the Soviet Uniondid win in the end.
Most of the casualties for the Soviet Union were for the same reasons ee see now: under trained and under equiped boys being tossed in a meat grinder with poor leadership and logistics.
After the Winter, the Soviets rallied with actually trained and disciplined soldiers and got Stalin a victory.
War, defensive and offensive is harder than people (and evidently all of Reddit) think it is.
Russia has more fight left in it than people want to recognize, not least of all because they've already proven a willingness to cut their own arm if it means they can stay on the hill.
They absolutely can rally and send out a new frontal assault.
Denying this reality helps the Russian war effort more than the Ukrainian as it makes Ukrainian concerns seem illegitimate.
Not only this, but the comment assumes all the generals/intelligence services consulting with Ukraine don't know this too.
putin's russia is toast, it's only a matter of time now.
