The only other export Russia had many buyers for, their weapons, is also seeing significantly reduced demand because of the war.
A combination of the shitty performance against NATO weapons, sanctions making ordering parts much more difficult, and Russia using up their stockpiles in Ukraine have this part pretty much nuked as well.
Russia doesn't even have the luxury of worrying about occupation, they couldn't even complete the invasion phase.
It's ironic.. Putin wanted to be remembered as a scary ironman and the glorious hero of Russia who restored it to a superpower.. instead he'll go down history as the dummass clown who took on a nation 10X smaller and miscalculated so bad he kickstarted the collapse of his own country.
Russia has had troubles for years, but one of the reasons so much of its shit got tolerated was how Putin was seen as this iron fisted genius.
Somebody that slowly was stabilizing a country wrecked by the collapse of the old glory, when Soviet fell apart.
Somebody that, while not nice, was simply needed in a place of great corruption and hopelessness.
