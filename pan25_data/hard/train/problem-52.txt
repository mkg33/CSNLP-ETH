I'm not an "EVERY HUMAN LIFE IS PRECIOUS" guy, but there just isn't an available procedure to ensure that every single execution is justified, and that means that we shouldn't be executing people.
It also assumes that everyone put to death is guilty, which is a biiiiiiig assumption given the statistics.
190 people on death row have been proven innocent since '73 (slightly under 1500 have been executed) and those are just the ones who've successfully navigated the incredibly difficult task of having their case reinvestigated and heard again.
There's no threshold that we can reasonably set that will exclude every person that shouldn't die.
The threshold is already as stringent as it can be and we still kill innocent people, the mentally ill, etc.
The government is supposed to protect people and ave lives not end them, lethal force should only be used if there is no other way to reduce harm.
No they shouldn’t.
If they’re safe let arrested and locked up what is even the point of killing them anyway other than some barbaric revenge fantasy?
Nope, keeping him as a prisoner would be better, treated like any of us would be in prison (like shit.)
That’s far worse for Dump, and far better for society.
He would be more of a martyr dead, honestly just as dangerous if not more dangerous.
