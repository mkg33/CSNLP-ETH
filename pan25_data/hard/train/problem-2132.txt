The only way I see this going anywhere is if it can be argued that Prince Harry did not take adequate steps to either ensure his targets were legitimate, or to prevent/limit civilian casualties.
Assuming he could only have reasonably believed they were all combatants, it's s legitimate act of war.
Summary: It's okay for civilians to be collateral damage under certain circumstances aka if it helps you win the war.
Most people I meet who says civilians are war casualties say it as a way to remove responsibility from military actors.
So, should we prosecute war criminals or not?
blanket military necessity.
It states that civilians shall not be the object of attack, nor can attacks.
Part 2 Don't target non-civilians if there are a lot of civilians around UNLESS it helps you win the conflict.
Itâ€™s done to prevent combatants from thinking they can get away with it and get protection using sensitive civilian spots.
If a hundred or so guys are firing from their positions, and you are not reasonably able to avoid a civilian casualty when assaulting those positions, it's awful but lawful.
If one guy in s crowd of hundreds begins taking potshots with a handgun, setting fire selectors to automatic and lighting everybody up to get that one guy is obviously disproportionate, and comes across as a deliberate attempt to kill the non-combatants.
