Not unlike Mahsa Amini, whose death sparked the riots... Those fuckers really like bashing innocent people around, huh?
I'm not sure what fate becomes them, but I sincerely hope it'll be decided by the Iranian people fighting for their freedom right now.
I just hope the Iranian government is weak enough that it won't be able to suppress dissent much longer.
No one is going to help the Iranian people who are protesting.
The government is going to crush these protests.
The Iranian death squads are shooting the women in their body parts and I don’t mean arms and legs.
I mean these scumbags are brutally killing them.
These people need to stop the madness.
At this point Iran is bringing back the death squads they used in Syria and Iraq to unleash a blood bath on the streets of Iran.
There are millions of these men that they are mobilizing including the IRGC and Basij fighters.
They can probably bring in 500,000 Iraqi Shiite militia fighters who fought the U.S. military during the Iraq war.
The IRGC has access to Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon, the Iraqi militias that fought the U.S. and afghan militia fighters who fought the Taliban for years.
So it’s not like they don’t have access to soldiers to fight their war.
