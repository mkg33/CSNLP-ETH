“Like sorry, I missed happy hour cause your punk asses can’t get your shit together yet wanna run the country and (hiccup) that’s just like, fucking hilarious to me”.
This would LITERALLY be me in Congress.
I’d have a go to flask for Republican bullshit and be getting trashed whenever I was waiting on them to unfuck themselves 😂.
Everyone was expecting a shitshow when Republicans took over and that'll probably be true no matter who comes up on top.
It's just nice that Republicans, for once, get to experience the same grandstanding assholery that grinds government to a halt every time the Democrats were in charge for the past decade or so.
It's funny to see Republicans clutching their pearls over lack of decorum and respect for the political process, after years of them turning the system into a reality TV show and advocating for burning the system down if it won't serve them.
If she were telling the truth it makes Republicans look even worse: a drunk Democratic caucus is more functional and unified than a sober Republican conference.
