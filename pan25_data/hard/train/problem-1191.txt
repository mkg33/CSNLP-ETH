"True patriot"?
Ashli was accused of reckless endangerment, malicious destruction of property and tampering with a car.
She had three restraining orders issued against her.
Then she defied secret service Capitol Police orders to stand down and not climb through the window, forcing the officer to use deadly force to protect the representatives nearby.
> I've always held that capitol police should've shot anyone who crossed through a broken window or door into the Capitol Building while congress was in session and the VP was in the building.
The common response to this line of thought on reddit is usually something along the lines of, "the crowd would have become enraged and swarmed them" but I disagree.
Hell, we have video proof that as soon as Babbit was shot that crowd dissipated and no one else tried to climb through the window.
I absolutely believe a few dozen bodies (and I don't think it would've taken that many) would have backed that crowd off immediately.
I also believe that as soon as capitol police started firing it would've prompted faster response times from other law enforcement groups.
I didn't realize the husband has been claiming that she tried to stop the window from being broken and that proves she was peaceful.
(Per the Newsmax article you linked) He also literally says that she punched a protestor in the face and in the next paragraph claims she wasn't interested in destruction or criminality.
That's approaching the realm of Craig T Nelson's, "I've been on food stamps and welfare.
Anybody help me out?
No.
".
Yup.
They always go back to, the cops let the people in.
Like, you know there's video footage of this not happening with 99% of the cops dealing with terrorists beating the shit out of cops, being held back from getting inside.
Watch the new vice documentary on HBOMax.
It's very good, with multiple different scenes but timestamped happening at the same time.
187 Minutes, I believe it's called.
