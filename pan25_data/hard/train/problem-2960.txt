Ofc so can’t you deny their beginnings, but I wouldn’t say that SD is as radical as it once was.
But with that said so is there still some borderline neo-nazis within the party, but that’s still a minority.
I understand where you are coming from, but I would generally say that you are still stretching it a bit to call them fascists.
The party was founded by people with fascist ideals and who supported nazis.
They have roots in several political movements which fought to keep Sweden “clean”.
(NRP, BSS, framstegspartiet and the Sweden democrats) Among their founders are a selection of racists, a volunteer in the Waffen-SS etc.
in their 90s, it wasn’t unheard of to make the 88 greeting among their people.
They have history working together with violent white-power movements which they of course deny.
Their youth program was lead by a nazi who was also the editor of a nazi publication at the time (info-14), so basically they were teaching nazi ideals to Swedish youth.
The worst part is that this plays right into the Swedish right wing agenda, as the fascist party "Swedish democrats" recently finished second in the election and have a lot of influence on the newly formed center-right government.
They are well-known racists, with high-ranking members previously supporting and attending Nazi events, and they want reasons to cleanse the country.
It's even better if the pressure is coming from outside, so they can blame it on global politics.
In the 1990s, one of their goals was to deport any migrants who arrived after the 1970s.
Although their strategy has since changed, to be more subtle and less extreme, their views on the matter has not.
So while it may look like Sweden is bowing down to Turkish politics, in all honesty I think it serves the Swedish fascist parties too.
