I think that it will actually go to a floor vote on Jan 3rd, but eventually McCarthy will get the speakership.
> There are a ton of ways this saga could conclude should McCarthy come up short on the first ballot, and Biggs' announcement Tuesday makes it very likely that happens.
IMO, there's a bigger chance it happens later, if McCarthy becomes speaker but is unable to advance key legislation like a budget CR or a debt ceiling fix.
A few more moderate House Republicans start talking to the Dems about a bipartisan vote for a unity Speaker.
McCarthy and his allies let the Freedom Caucus propose their candidates for Speaker.
None of them get more than 60 votes, and the far-right candidates get less support on every ballot, until it's just the 40-odd Freedom Caucus members voting for "anybody but McCarthy.
".
True.
But the choice isn't between Hakeem Jefferies and Kevin McCarthy.
It's between Kevin McCarthy and virtually anybody else.
Seems like there should be plenty of people between those two points.
