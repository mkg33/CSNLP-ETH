Well the people scared of hazmat suits can deal with it.
Why should someone sacrifice their personal safety when it’s not causing anyone else any physical harm?
There’s a pandemic, and some people don’t want to get infected, and some people who are immune compromised can’t take that chance, so if some people have a problem with that, too bad, they can mind their business.
Totally true.
My brother is currently in China on a business trip, 10 days quarantine in a hotel with shitty food.
If he went in with Covid, it would be so much worse.
Covid is going to get a lot worse for China for many factors.
Having over 1 billion people with similar genetics (Han Chinese) is a big Achilles heel for fighting a virus.
Marek disease in factory chickens is an example of this due to narrow genetics and immune responses with 1 type of vaccine that became ineffective.
China is trying to isolate it's self from the world, this will only lead to covid cases establishing in the population with more virulence.
Ineffective vaccines, limited herd immunity, and limited immunological memory from prior covid infections.
All leads to a covid policy disaster for CCP.
