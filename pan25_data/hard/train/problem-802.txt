Yeah it really doesn’t do much.
It’s not like Russia gets royalties or anything from any production of “The Nutcracker” or the music from the show being played.
When the Oakland nutcracker show is performed by local kids, they are not promoting of Russia or thinking of it.
Russia doesn’t get a royalty or any credits.
This is silly and petty.
Next they will want to ban Tolstoy or Sergei Eisenstein.
Ukraine, you are supposed to be the good guys in this war, don’t lose it by canceling culture.
Please stop spreading this "Ukraine wants to genocide Russians" myth, it's the myth that Putin used to justify this war in the first place.
You’re forgetting that Russia has and is preforming genocide on the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian culture.
Ukrainians want a lot of there forced ties to Russia to be erased.
The big reason why there is a lot of Russian speaking Ukrainians is because speaking Ukrainian was illegal and would get you killed.
No it’s not.
Would you consider yourself intimately intertwined with your neighbour if they stole your house and threatened to murder you if you didn’t practice their culture.
