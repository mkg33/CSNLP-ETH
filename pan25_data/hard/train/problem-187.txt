Those are among the worst organized criminals you can find ever.

Only lots of heavy equipment and training will enable Ukraine to successfully attrit Wagner up to the point that they're no longer a viable fighting force.
This is a long term process.
We're in for the long run.
Russia is preparing for a protracted war, so better late than never.
As Russia steadily increases the number of its mobiks, so does Ukraine and its western allies with better equipment, training, command & control to fend off the waves and keep attrition in their favor so that they wear down Russian morale.
