The need for these employees isn't going to go away, just the employees will.
Lecce has stated that after covid and the lockdowns this isn't the time to be taking job action for better compensation at the expense of children and their learning.
I agree, but it isn't for those workers alone to shoulder the entire weight of the situation we're in either.
We're all just coming out of lockdowns, we're all dealing with inflation.
Their work benefits society as a whole and society as a whole should prop them up when they need it.
If the fruits of their labour is spread throughout society then the cost of their labour should be as well.
They're not asking for a wage that will afford them a second Ferrari.
They're asking for a wage that at the very least keeps up with inflation.
I’m also not quite sure what you believe inflation is?
Wages are not a driving force of inflation by any means.
If you dont think wage increases effect inflation, idk what to tell you.
Youre just wrong, of fucking course giving consumers more buying power increases inflation.
Its the same reason low unemployment is a factor in inflation.
Maybe thats why they wanted to cap raises, to stop some sort of cost-wage spiral.
Now correct me if you think im wrong but this is my understanding.
You could argue its not driving todays inflation (its probably not) but it is still an inflationary practice generally.
Please refer to my earlier point about how inflation outpaces wage increases, hence being moot and providing no actual benefit.
If wage increases caused inflation, why are inflation rates considerably higher than wage increases?
Also, there is literally no job on planet earth where a 1% raise a year is not a literal decrease in pay; even inflation rates that are considered economically acceptable/healthy are like 2-3%.
Doesn’t matter if you’re a CEO or a fry cook, that “raise” is a pay decrease.
