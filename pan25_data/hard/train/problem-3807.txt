I don't expect reality to change his mind, he'll be too stubborn after years of being top dog in Russia to admit he was ever wrong on something.
Double down or nothing are the only two options for him, and since neither of those will work, he's fucked.
Geopolitics is not fair, it's fundamentally hypocritical by its nature.
Unless you want some kind of global government or something.
Everyone is out for their own people's welfare though, this is just reality.
If a leader does anything except support their people's wellbeing, then they're not a very good leader.
Yeah, I've seen RealLifeLore too.
I think this fails to capture half the picture though, it doesn't take into account Russian nationalist sentiment.
Yeah I don’t get everyone’s enthusiasm about Putin being out of the picture.
He never was a real threat and was fairly predictable and level headed.
I’m more worried about who replaces Putin than I am of Putin.
What's dangerous about Putin is that he knows that his regime and reign is over if he loses in Ukraine.
Putin has already lost, his army failed against Ukraines Army.
His army is bombing unarmed civilians/targets & trying to claim a victory.
Putin has failed….. he’ll, even if he tried something even like civilians against civilians, Putin would still lose.
Ukraine people are fighting with heart & soul.
Russians are asking,why are we here & why are we doing this?
Putin is a loser.
