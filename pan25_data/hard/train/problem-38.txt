Not really.
You just described the same situation as above.
If someone is committing an armed robbery against you and while using reasonable self defense you kill another person, the person robbing you would be charged with murder.
It’s really very simple.
I’m not sure but it may depend.
In my state of texas, victims of violent crimes cannot be sued by perpetrators for injuries incurred in their own defense.
The courts have found that this extends to other victims of the same perpetrator.
Basically the person you shoot in this hypothetical situation would only be able to sue the actual offender and not you.
If somebody invades your house, you grab a gun and shoot something you see out of a window and kill an innocent bystander, you still commited a crime, even if the intruder is responsible for it you are not innocent.
At the same time, to use another example from US law, if you are in a situation where you are forced to use a firearm to defend yourself, but miss and hit a bystander you will be held accountable.
Though you'd likely be held less accountable than if there was no defensive situation.
While this is likely what would happen in terms of criminal liability, you will almost certainly be sued and situation dependent face civil consequences.
