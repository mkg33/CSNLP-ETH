Good question.
Perhaps they were being pressured by others in their party to get out of the way and this was a solution that didn’t involve voting for him.
So a few Republicans basically decided to change from voting against McCarthy to essentially not voting at all which made it easier for McCarthy to win.
So basically a new paralysis and then - presumably - after enough concessions, McCarthy or someone similar is elected again.
So while D wins a chance to show R dysfunction again, they also, at best, get a new similar speaker but with even more concessions to the extreme wing of the republicans?
I’m not sure it looks like a great tradeoff tbh.
Any D voting against would surely be seen as being for the idea of paralyzing the house?
So dems would help the MAGA faction oust McCarthy, only to give Republicans a new chance to tear themselves apart?
Honestly, I kind of hope the rest of the GOP finally just ends the MAGA element and works with Democrats again.
It can happen, they realized they played with fucking fire when Obama got elected and while it's fun watching them get burned it might be for the best it's put out and they learn a lesson.
