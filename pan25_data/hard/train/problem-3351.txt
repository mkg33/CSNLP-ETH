No, I'm saying history shows many nations have killed innocent civilians many times for various reasons, to hold Russia to this (perceived) double standard is hypocritical at best, will cause the death of tens of thousands at most.
Not sure what you are trying to ask, but NATO or not NATO member, one nation killing people of another nation unprovoked is equal in my book.
Maybe a NATO nation can threat a larger retaliation than others, but the events are "equal" NATO or not.
Goodness, even if it was russian's 1345th "miscalculation" in this war, i am in shock they had the audacity to strike a NATO member.
I didn’t think you meant genocide, but the idea that we can just go blow up Russia’s entire military without a nuclear level response is just odd to me.
Tbh, i don't know what Russia's intentions are anymore (but its turning into a "nation self destruction speedrun" due to their repeated mistakes during 10 months of war :v).
(1) Deliberate attack by Russia, (2) an accident by Russia , (3) or a false flag by Ukraine to get NATO involved?
The most likely is (2), I don't see this bringing NATO into the mix though.
