Here's what's imperial.
The radical Roberts court letting unconstitutional rulings from lower courts stand while they put off hearing the case on their docket.
Worse, what do you do if the Supreme Court itself then rules that the attempts to add those justices is illegal?
You really think a law codifying Roe will prevent the Supreme Court from throwing that law out by saying it's unconstitutional?
Congress could pass a law taking away (or wildly limiting) the supreme court's appellate jurisdiction.
That's in the constitution - "with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make".
They could make a new court that takes appeals from the circuit courts, and entirely remove the supreme court's appellate jurisdiction, leaving them with a very limited "original" jurisdiction.
Or alternatively they could add a hundred new justices and completely change the format of the court.
We could try to just add more justices to the court, but... That's not a solution.
It will be widely seen as just packing the court to win, not any kind of attempt at restoring the rule of law.
There _are_ paths...
But they involve, well, as you suggest, the states simply ignoring the courts.
Or violence.
At this point, I'm not sure if it's _possible_ for our country to survive as it now stands.
The checks and balances have been systematically eroded over decades.
