There's a difference between begrudgingly accepting an authoritarian ruler and a hostile takeover by a foreign country.
One is a shit but at least somewhat stable government, another is a complete denial of your national identity and what little autonomy you had left.
I know a few Belarusians (who still live there) and at least from their perspective, a Russian annexation would lead to complete revolution.
They've also said that if belarus enters the war in Ukraine, it'll probably also lead to a revolution.
I know everyone is thinking Russia is going to attack Kiev, but could they actually aim for Lutsk and Lviv ad those cities are were rail to the west is connected to Ukraine.
Aiming and taking those cities would greatly reduce Ukraine supplies as they get most from the West.
Even Russia doesn't take both cities Ukraine will need to prioritize the Northern Front which in turn weaken the Eastern front with Ukraine going to have to pull troops from that front to reinforce the Northern Front.
Also keep in mind the advance equipment in Ukraine has to be sent to Poland to get repairs.
Kiev is important but honestly I think Russia could do more damage aiming for these cities.
Also another point there is a Nuclear plant close to Lutsk and we know Russia has been wanting the Nuclear Plants in Ukraine.
So if NATO strikes Minsk with Putin and Luka there, would that still cause Russia to possibly launch nukes?
This is Russia's attempt to get Ukraine to fire into Belarus.
I'm doubtful that Putin is actually travelling there.
They'll send a body double and then fake a video.
