I think that burning loot was a mistake.
Loot is a distraction to Russians.
I've seen lots of IFV's crammed full of washing machines and carpets.
Stupid big things sometimes strapped to the roof obscuring vision ports and smoke dischargers.
Every washing machine displaces ammo and infantry.
It interferes with combat operations.
Every looted bottle of booze gets drunk and it deterioriates their minds and bodies.
Loot makes them think of going home with their goodies instead of focusing on their mission.
You want them cramming their mind and their vehicles with junk, displacing a sense of military objective and access to ammo.
If the loot is destroyed or taken back by the enemy that really demotivates/demoralizes them.
It’s like they irretrievably lost their paychecks.
They know they aren’t fighting nazis, nato, or defending Russia so they’re fighting because they were told to and fighting for loot.
Now half the motivation is gone.
I imagine seeing your equipment is poor, it’s cold and miserable, everything is dangerous, but thinking “At least I have my loot” would help cope.
Now there’s less coping material.
