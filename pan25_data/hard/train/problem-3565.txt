And as what constitutes as "spreading corruption in the land" is not defined, then clerics, just like Muhammad back in the day, could say what eve they wanted to "spreading corruption in the land", like apostasy for example, and kill the person accused of that.
Now, as this young man gave hugs and chocolate to people who were protesting the Islamic government of Iran, that means that according to the Quran they were fighting against Allah, by spreading corruption in the land, namely, showing support to those who do not agree with women being killed for not wearing (or incorrectly wearing) clothes women are demanded to wear by Allah in the Quran.
In Islam there is a crime "Spreading Corruption in the Land", and this crime is worthy of death penalty.
Now, I feel I must make this disclaimer, I do not believe that this is right, but this is what the Quran says and commands.
So before some mod wants to ban me for this, I do not advocate for this.
To those who want to say that I am an Islamophobic, if quoting the Quran is Islamophobic, you might what to reconsider your faith, and if you should believe in the Quran.
I’m not saying that anything is wrong or bad about Allah or Islam, I don’t want a fatwa on me.
But my goodness I don’t understand wanting to follow a god or religion that would criminalize hugs and chocolate, especially hugs or any expression of love and kindness.
