I think there's probably some of both, but for the republicans thinking it's just Trump, and not the message that goes with Trump, they may be setting themselves up for failure for the long term.
Some of the most vocal are in fairly safe districts, so they can do what they want, and likely would win with or without Trump support, and could likely even dial back on the rhetoric and still win.
But I think they actually like being like this, and don't have to worry about introspection.
People like Boebert may want to examine herself going forward, because she was really close to being voted out, and if people see how close it was and want her out, they may be more inclined to show up to vote next time.
Everything wrong with the current economy, and inflation, has a direct line back to Trump and republican control.
About the only thing that Biden and dems can be blamed for is delaying some things which would have helped recovery, but it was a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.
I feel there is some question as to whether it was Trump's support that caused these candidates to fail, or if it was the Trump rhetoric these candidates adopted that caused them to fail.
Except for Trump, who refuses to admit the obvious, I think everyone has come to the conclusion that Trump is one of the big losers of these Midterms.
20 years from now, Donald Trump is gonna be the go-to word for “sore loser”.
Like, you know how Julius Caesar, Harry Mason and John Hancock have all been immortalized as alternative terms for nouns?
It’s gonna happen to Trump.
