Every week another unsourced, unsubstantiated claim makes its way claiming he's dying or shitting his pants.
Hell a few days ago there was a claim on the front page that Putin was already dead.
The problem is you're confusing "unsubstantiated claims" with "factual reports".
Just because you see a dumb headline that says the guy has cancer doesn't mean it's true.
A year?
This has been going on for at least a decade.
The West has a weird fetish with claiming Putin has dementia/Parkinson's/Cancer, etc.
They did not claim Putin was in perfect health, every comment they made focused on claims that were speculating on severe illnesses like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's etc.
Why do I feel that Western stories about Putin's health are Russian propaganda designed to enable Putin to fake his own death and escape to Venezuela?
Personally I like the idea that Putin is secretly quite sick, and I don't think the rumors do harm because they are also harming Putin's image.
But I also don't think being annoyed by what are essentially rumors, and a long pattern of them means that someone is a Putinist.
