That is a little harsh.
MTG is a demagogue meaning that she plays on people's emotion.
Her tactic is to shamelessly and dishonestly ramp up the social temperature.
People do not think well when they are angry.
Her method is to frame everything in absurdly binary terms, dishonestly, and provide frustrated people that dont grasp nuance very well an enemy and a sense of righteous indignation.
Uh, yeah, ok.
I can see, and I know that she is a demagogue.
So thats what I wrote about.
You seem better informed in that regard, so by all means write about it.
I dont see how I excused her.
I didnt write an exhaustive ten page essay.
I wrote a couple paragraphs about a specific point.
Demagogue is not a compliment.
The word racist makes people think of lynch mobs and so on.
So almost no one is going to admit to being that kind of racist.
When a friend of mine said that being uncomfortable around black folks was racist, it blew my mind.
I sometimes felt uncomfortable around black people.
Like an interloper or some kind of jerk, just for being there.
Figuring out how we can all grow and support each other is good.
Here i mean specifically white people admitting and accepting our full spectrum of racism and getting our s---t together, not trying to make it anyone elses problem.
If the first step to fixing a problem is admitting that you have a problem having a word that lets us admit we have a problem without identifying as lynch mob types, the way the word racist clearly connotes,, would be pretty helpful.
I know not everyone is going to agree with this idea.
I fully understand where you are coming from.
I am also from the south and it is disheartening that my loved ones refuse to research their opinions.
They are spoon fed from Fox and refuse any rationale outside of the propaganda they fill themselves with.
