Every night when I go to bed, I pray a prayer that I live long enough to see the next generation start blaming your generation for everything wrong.
BTW, I’m not a boomer, I’m just tired of juvenile minds that want to pin all their problems on an entire generation rather than individuals.
But - without taking anything away from the issues younger generations face, I am honest about what the nation building discourse of the boomer gen looks like.
And the difference between it and the examples you’ve given is that those examples don’t steer nations and policy.
Boomers - through things like brexit, trump and the like, do.
The way many (not all, but many) of the boomer generation saw nation building is through an us-or-them zero sum equation.
You really need to live under a rock to not see it.
Or be yourself subscribed to the beliefs threat that generation held - say, about what nation-building means and whether people of multiple nations see their future as more or less collaborative - maybe you’re yourself in those beliefs, which they held but the generations below them hold less and less.
