Russians have amassed huge numbers in preparation for a spring offensive.
Ukrainians have spent the last 6 months training with western countries and theyâ€™ve salvaged a shit ton of Russian weaponry left behind.
This is going to be a bloodbath and will probably define the wars outcome.
A bloodbath for both sides.
And you may not have been paying close enough attention.
But the Ukrainians are very much clamoring for more ammunition, artillery and tank rounds because they are starting to run low.
And the sheer volume of soldiers rush it is sending at them is making gains and they still haven't committed the huge concentrations that they are planning to do.
The offensive has been getting going over the last 2 weeks.
People need to lose this delusion that Ukraine is somehow in control of this war and on a winning path.
Russia fully plans on taking as long as it takes.
And they're getting supplied by Iran and North Korea.
They're building out new weaponry plants.
And don't be surprised if in a year China starts supplying them.
And that will be catastrophically bad for Ukraine.
Which is why we need to give maximum support now so that the Ukrainians can smash Russia while they are still in a weak and disorganized state and force them to the negotiating table.
It would be great if Russia massed its entire force and equipment for the offensive, and then, all of NATO air power joined the war for one day to destroy everything Russian in Ukraine.
A quick, we are in, we are out.
Wow - Looking at the replies, amazing that so many people can't perceive a half-joking comment.
As they say in the movies - lighten up Francis.
