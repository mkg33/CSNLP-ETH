Stop invalidating other peoples' experiences.
You are not that poster's therapist, they did not ask you for therapy.
Work on practicing your therapist's advice to you if you find it helpful for you, not on preaching it to others.
Your "reasonable restrictions" are where this all started.
Now look where we are.
This is why although I don;t necessarily want a free for all, I'm very skeptical of any restrictions - many people predicted this is where we'd get to right from the outset of these food restrictions.
I got downvoted to hell the other day for saying it, but I still maintain that there's value in placing reasonable restrictions on the use of SNAP or other food-assistance benefits, provided those restrictions are aimed at maximizing the amount of food that assistance can buy for a family.
So taking away cheaper items and forcing people on SNAP to purchase more expensive items, under the guise of “it’s healthier” is just another way to hurt poor people unless they now plan on upping the $$ amount for recipients of SNAP, which I’m guessing they’re not.
Dictating that SNAP recipients can't purchase certain items because of a belief that it's an "unreasonable" item is not a good way to spend your limited time.
Let it go.
