lol.
i got no sympathy for this woman.
maybe she will learn her lesson.
if any other person on this planet were to take cannabis to russia the narrative would be much different, but most likely non-exsistant.
she now gets to learn that she isnt special and the same rules apply to her as everyone else on the planet.
what a dumb fucking moron to take drugs to a foreign country there is not really anything else to say about it.
She shouldn’t even have weed where she lives in America.
She just thinks the laws don’t apply to her.
Why should I care about somebody that’s thinks the rules don’t apply to them?
I don't feel for anyone who knows the rules and thinks they're well-off enough that they dont' apply.
Russia is an ass-backwards totalitarian nightmare, but she \_KNEW\_ that going there for the rubles and playing for celebrities.
Just because she had the clout at the time to flout their anti-drug laws does not mean that the laws didn't exist.
Is she a political pawn?
yes, but what do you expect if you work for an oligarch of a mafia-run petro state?
