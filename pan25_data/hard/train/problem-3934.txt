My opinion is that a strong primary challenger will only make the party stronger in the general election.
I know it is tradition that the sitting President gets to run for a second term unopposed by his own party, but Biden's age (82 by next inauguration) is really a problem for me.
I have no problem with most Democrats I know holding the Presidency, I'd just like them to be a little younger.
I'd prefer someone younger as well, but the benefit of a younger nominee is far outweighed by the detriment of giving up the incumbency advantage.
If Pete can run in 2024, there's no reason he couldn't just wait to run until 2028 instead.
That goes for any other Democrat you can name.
If we nominate someone other than Biden for 2024, we'll probably lose, and then 2028, instead of being an open race, will be an uphill battle against a Republican incumbent, which could very well mean the next opportunity to retake the presidency is in the open race in 2032.
The "waste" comes from foregoing Biden, nominating another Democrat, and then inevitably electing whoever the Republican nominee ends up being, at which point the Democratic nominee will have been "wasted," because if Pete loses to DeSantis in 2024, he won't be the nominee in 2028 to go up for a rematch.
But Pete could conceivably win in 2028, after a second Biden term.
(Feel free to substitute any other Democrat for Pete).
It wouldn't be a waste if the alternate Democratic nominee were to win, but, historically, that's highly unlikely.
The point is, changing nominees voluntarily will probably result in a Republican win, and a Democrat who loses is probably done.
Your position is Democrats should give up incumbency, waste a second nominee, and give Republicans four years to further rig the entire system in their favor?
Are you a Republican?
