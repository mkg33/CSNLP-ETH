Or, to put it another way, China did everything they possibly could to prevent transmission and they keep getting it anyways.
Having intense prevention policies, but less effective vaccines and treatment options is probably a bad trade, even if you ignore the ethical implications.
Strict policies never eradicated a virus, but vaccines have.
Also, you know that all vaccines had to go through clinical trials to determine efficacy right?
Because once you have data that a vaccine works, it's not really unproven anymore, is it?
Even if Chinese vaccines matched J&J, it still doesn't really explain why they'd refuse to approve mRNA vaccines for use in their country if they wanted to do everything they could.
Oh, that wording was a little weird.
But that's actually bull shit for, well a few reasons, but most relatively since they've (edit for clarity: China) been openly working on their own mRNA vaccine since early in the pandemic.
They opted for historically-proven vector vaccines with insane amounts of testing where we went with yet-unproven mRNA vaccines and no focus on regular testing in comparison.
I mean, this isn't exactly the formula for krabby patties, mRNA vaccines have been published and used in academia for over a decade.
Sure they'd have to fiddle with the formulation to optimize delivery and perhaps infringe a patent or two, but when has China ever cared about such things.
