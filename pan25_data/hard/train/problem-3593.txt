Japan seems to also have this dynamic that's weird to us westerners.
When you think of that "Age of Freedom", when you feel like you are no longer a kid bound by your parents rules and can do mostly whatever you want.
Easy, children don't get to consent to marriage, parents force it on them and there's nothing they can do about it until they're an adult.
Generally speaking, your parents are your parents even if they're divorced, and so they still have the attendant constitutional rights to parent their children (which are tempered against what is in the best interest of the child).
"Sole & Legal Custody" is the combination that would cut the other parent out except at the discretion of the parent with sole & legal custody.
Then comes physical custody which usually but not always includes visitation rights for the other parent.
Joint custody requires the parents agree on legal and/or custody decisions as they arise.
If they continuously bicker, it can get very expensive and highly annoy the judge when he has to break deadlocks between the parents.
