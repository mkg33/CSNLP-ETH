Biggest problem is that even if you don't buy apple, which i don't, the alternatives aren't much better, and anyone saying you don't need a smart phone in today's world are pretty disingenuous or naive.
I would gladly pay more for a phone made in the west at higher standards, but they are not really on the market or at least i have not found one.
I am not young, just always surprised by the ignorance of Americans, you seriously didn't know that iphones one of the main products of one of the largest companies in the world, are sold outside of the US?
It would be interesting to see how many people would actually pay additional $50 for an Iphone that was packaged up clearly as "Designed & Made in USA" ?
I'd imagine apple would rather cut down on product quality than raise the price of their phone as they are already ridiculous expensive.
If they switch to American production.
There is no room in global capitalism for doing the right thing here to the extent of bringing manufacturing to the US.
For it to work, and for an unethical competitor to not swoop in and steal every customer, consumers en masse would need to demand ethical conditions through local manufacturing and be willing to pay high prices for a while until a great reset happens.
Shareholders would be losing their damn minds in the meantime.
