The reality of the situation is much more boring.
As a skier following weather patterns there’s been anomalies in the jet stream over northern China and Japan, and a dissolving/splitting of the jet stream over North America.
This has caused an absolute dump of snow over Japan, but that’s neither here nor there.
If it were actually a threat it wouldn’t have been allowed to traverse the country, and the message sent is that if it were actually a perceived threat we have the capability to neutralize it, before it’s a problem.
It was shot down to quench hysteria.
Media hysteria forced a response by the White House, and it was shot down over the Atlantic as a show of force/capability.
Yeah, the US was forced into a response because it was visible to civilians, and that response couldn't be leaving it alone, because 30% of the country has had their brains eaten by conspiracy theories.
Yeah, I'm with you on all this.
There's zero strategic reason to use a balloon for anything that isn't primarily weather related, because they're impossible to control since they get blown around by... the weather...
Quite the contrary, the United States understands very well that it's intentional, and the notion that it was a weather balloon gone astray isn't even slightly credible.
The US is saying it's a spy balloon because, without 100% certainty about what it's actually doing, like all of the data is being 100% captured and interpreted by us, it's better to treat it as a threat than to not.
So, say we think it's a spy balloon and then shoot it down, but there's literally nothing it can do as a military asset that some other vehicle couldn't do better.
Imagine being this hysteric over a harmless weather balloon and spending millions to shoot down a weather balloon with a missile.
The US invades countries and kills civilians all over the world, but when another country has the audacity to accidentally let a weather balloon float over it acts utterly violated.
