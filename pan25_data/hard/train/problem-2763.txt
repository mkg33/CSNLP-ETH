there was a lot of pressure on the Dems to just punt the debt ceiling out till past '24, but they didn't make it happen so the debt is going to be in the hands of dangerous extremists who seem perfectly happy to let the country burn to push their agenda.
It will not be a serious debate.
They will rig an emergency like the debt ceiling then the GOP will tie gutting the safety net to restoring government spending.
When the Dems don't agree to gutting the safety net, the wingnuts will scream about how the Democrats are destroying the economy and their gullible base will believe them and agitate for the dems to "compromise" by only partially gutting Social Security.
Republicans constantly fear monger that Democrats are gonna take yer guns while theyâ€™re trying to figure out how to take your social security and Medicare.
If House Republicans aren't trusted enough by Senate Republicans to even negotiate the annual budget I doubt the House will be able to get Soc Sec or Medicare cuts into serious debate.
republicans every election cycle: "We would never vote to cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid It's inhumane, who would even consider that?
".
