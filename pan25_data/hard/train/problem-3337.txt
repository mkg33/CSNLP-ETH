We were pissed we were there because it was because the cops wouldn't stop escalating things by using extra judicial force against people protesting the use of extra judicial force.
During the 2020 protests the Guard was actually a deescalating force because it doesn't have the us vs them siege mentality that many policy do.
Unlikely to occur, thankfully, as the National Guard is less likely to brutalize protestors than the police these days...
Ironically, calling in the Guard probably DECREASED the risk of violence, due to how utterly borked police departments are these days, especially in Georgia..
National Guard, on the other hand?
I was in Army ROTC and trying to JOIN them (original plan was to be in the Guard after grad school and work as an ENT, to get clinical hours for Medical School applications...) so maybe I'm biased.
But would feel MUCH safer around a National Guard unit than a bunch of riot police as a protestor...
I saw national guard subtly step between protestors and cops in a few times in 2020.
And there were videos of some of them dancing and talking with protestors.
I definitely felt safer with national guard around because they seemed to keep the cops more in line.
Whatâ€™s funny is that the national guard made us feel a lot safer in some places in 2020.
Their presence made the cops way less aggressive because they knew they were being watched.
