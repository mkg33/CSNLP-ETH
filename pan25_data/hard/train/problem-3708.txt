(But you can replace "Russia" with just about any country including my own, and my previous statement is true).
Good luck.
I wish people didn't have to suffer because of the lousy leaders over them.
I hate the situation for both the Russian and the Ukrainian people.
Absolutely no hate for the regular Russian people.
You guys are dealing with an awful situation caused by an awful person.
As much as everyone wants to see Putin removed I really hope that can be done with the least impact possible on Russians.
Pretty shitty for anyone to blame this on you.
and that's pretty shitty.
I feel for the russian people who are ALSO VICTIMS of the russian government.
when people say shit like this, "THEY", they're conflating the people of russia with the conceptual entity of the state, and its leadership.
It's crazy to theorize on what Russia could be if their leadership had been reasonable and not antagonistic lol.
Real reform of gov and an abolishment of the oligarchs and a crackdown on the mafia.
They could be flourishing with great trade agreements and eventual admission into eu.
