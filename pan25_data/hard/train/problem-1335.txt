Part of me doesn’t like this bc it isnt free speech and the other part of me likes this bc journalists are getting a taste of their own medicine.
Duality of man.
I’m speaking about a particular brand of twitter journalists plus the way that old media journalists act on twitter (this is a particular phenomenon with liberal journalists, but right wing ones suffer from this also)— being snobby, elitist, promoting some sort of activism but claiming to be unbiased, calling for bans and boycotts, stealth editing articles, cry bullying, straight up lying, virtue signaling for clout, not being rigorous with their sourcing, citing “anonymous sources familiar with the situation”, and then playing the victim when called out on one or any combination of these things.
You are right, they are not the same thing, as I just said in my comment above.
They are separate processes but the results are the same (bans).
Sounds like you don’t like consequence culture either, maybe the journalists banned in this article are just facing consequences for their actions 🤷🏼‍♂️.
Journalists have been banning people from social media for having done nothing which violates the site's TOS?
