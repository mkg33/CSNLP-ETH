If he had achieved actual military successes, his political position would have likely skyrocketed.
But Wagner’s Bakhmut campaign does’t seem to be much more advanced than it was 4 months ago and losses are mounting.
I think best case scenario (for him) is that he shuts up, falls in line, Wagner becomes fully subservient to the army and he’s allowed to continue as before.
Now he’s left with massive costs, a lot of dead mercenaries, no real successes to show and he has just recently publicly criticized Russian army.
Now instead of running a shock troop of assholes he now has nothing tangible left that is of any worth to Putin, and he will likely watch Wagner get butchered as the army tries to capitalize on the failures.
Not a smart move to be all gangster and publicly bad mouth the Russian military and its entire leadership, and then spend months trying to take a strategically insignificant town, only to end up with nothing to show for it but a few hundred yards of fields and outhouses and tens of thousands of dead mercs.
He's busted.
