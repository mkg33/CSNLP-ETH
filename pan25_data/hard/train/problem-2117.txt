If Hunter crimed then he does the time, I do not care.
I do care that my tax dollars are going for a vendetta investigation bc Republicans are a bunch of crybaby assholes.
Fuck republicans - I will hate everything that will come out of these investigations and I pray that more Americans really see the evil in these investigations and send republicans packing in 2024.
They know ho to spell it become it is synonymous with Republicans being humiliated by inventing lies that go nowhere.
Even /r/conservative is angry about the Biden laptop and is asking why the fuck the first thing they're doing isn't dealing with inflation, gas, or taxes.
Unlikely.
This story isn't going anywhere because Hunter Biden is a private citizen, and they can't go after him the way they go after politicians without getting the shit sued out of them.
Look at Dominion--they're getting fucking wrecked for having crossed the line there, and Hunter will have more protections as a private person that Dominion had.
There is a reason nobody has reported on the contents of his laptop--it's illegal to publish the contents of a private person's emails without their permission.
