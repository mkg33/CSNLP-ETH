I like the inconsistencies in their arguments.
Because there are 2 main things I see when it comes to people leaving California.
Damn right we are successful in Texas!
Have you been to a hotel with included breakfast here?
TEXAS SHAPED WAFFLES.
If that alone is not proof of how good we are then I don't know what is.
I’m not doubting the veracity of any data here.
I’m saying the formula of “net new jobs for a given state” / “net new jobs of the country” is a bad and misleading way to portray this.
So I’m literally doing as you suggested, calling out bad statistics when I see them.
As aside, this statistic is meaningless and cringey from a math perspective.
Imagine California added 20k jobs but the country as whole lost 200k.
Well then California created 20/-200 = -10% of jobs?
Its also possible for many states to correctly claim "they created 20% of the new jobs" and summing those %s would give some number.
13 Consecutive months of job growth, totaling over 20% of the nation's jobs created during that time.
