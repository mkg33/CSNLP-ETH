I'm not suggesting consolidation of outlets, but I wish we could have trust in the honesty and accuracy of all of our elected officials and not just the Democrats (mostly).
It's exhausting to have to be on top of everything just so we don't let quacks and conmen take over all of our governing bodies because we weren't aware of the going on.
I hate that there are so many good journalism sources such that the few free articles many give you still makes it hard to remain informed.
I have subs to NYT, WaPo, The Atlantic, Foreign Policy, The Mercury News (local-ish paper), and I think one more that was only a few bucks per month, so that ends up costing quite a bit.
So that leaves out the LA Times (which I find I'm reading a lot), Bloomberg, The Guardian, WSJ, the New Yorker, the Economist, and so many more that I end up either trying to use my textise workaround or just skipping.
Pro tip.
Use textise.net to view most paywalled articles.
But, it depends on how the page is coded.
Don't expect WSJ or Bloomberg to work with this trick.
But for most it does.
You're right.
It's a garbage article from a garbage websight.
But there are probably hundreds of thousands of people here who hate this "socialist" entitlement.
And others who, like you, agree the problem needed fixing, but disagree this was an ideal way to do it.... ignoring the stupid argument about "socialism."
Most important, the one-time loan forgiveness probably does absolutely nothing about the continued astronomical cost of higher education.
