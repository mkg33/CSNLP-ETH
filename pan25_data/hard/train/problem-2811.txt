Han Chinese is the largest ethnic group but there are smaller ethnic groups as well.
I appreciate your attempt to continue the conversation even if you can't quite get the facts correct.
However, look how the redditor worded his response.
Instead of just saying Mitch McConnell is in an interracial marriage or saying Mitch McConnell is married to someone of Han Chinese ethnic descent, the redditor consciously chose the inflammatory "Chinese woman" trope with all the historical and contemporary baggage associated with United States and China relations -- the user even refused to type her name.
Case in point -- in 2013 the liberal super PAC Progress Kentucky released a series of tweets in a similar vein by attempting to directly connect Chao with China.
In one tweet, the organization said.
The redditor was wrong to say Chao is Chinese.
She's by country of birth from the Republic of China but ethnically Han Chinese.
I have plenty of friends who are Han Chinese but that does not make them Chinese.
They are from Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, Etcâ€¦.
