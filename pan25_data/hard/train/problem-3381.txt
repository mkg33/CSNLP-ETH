Then, after Europeans invaded and the Ottomans imploded, fundamentalist Muslim radicals began taking power in response to Westerners taking over their economies and turning it into their playground.
These fundamentalists pushed back hard on "Western debauchery.
".
Yep.
I recognize it from Iran itself too, quite recent in history.
The Shah delivering a speech in 1978 where he promised reforms and said he heard the people's revolution.
Everyone who pushed him to make that speech ended up regretting it.
Edit: As usual, there is such a gross amount of misinformation regarding the Shah in the replies of this comment.
If you want to actually learn about the Pahlavi dynasty, pick up the book "The Fall of Heaven", where actual statistical data and unbiased accounts are used to paint an accurate picture of the Shah's reign.
Don't listen to these people who are simply parrotting what they've heard without any research of their own.
Most of them are non-Iranians, who through good intentions, believe they are "helping" Iranians by setting this false narrative that one of the great nation builders of our history was evil.
The Islamic regime has dedicated the last 40 years of their existence to trashing his legacy through local and foreign avenues, much of their propaganda is being knowingly/unknowingly parrotted by Redditors.
The win here is the fact that the regime is desperate enough to do this.
I'm 99% sure they won't go through with it because they'd essentially be signing their own death warrants.
As others have stated, the compulsory hijab law is the Berlin wall of the Islamic Republic.
But the fact that they're even "reviewing" such a fundamental law of their regime was previously unthinkable.
Their weakness is showing.
Take that away and they look weak.
If they can't hang on to that, they can't be expected to hold and other line either.
