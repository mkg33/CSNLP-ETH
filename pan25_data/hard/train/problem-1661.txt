I’m from Moldova, this morning I laughed my ass of at transnistria news (but more at our people's comments on them).
Tonight russians were claiming that Ukraine started “invading “ Transnistria, because… A PROJECTOR WAS SHINING.
Then russians started the posting news about the entire town evacuating, while there were literally no cars at any of the crossings.
I believe this was a direct response to Russian propaganda claiming the Ukrainian government had fled the country.
The Russian leadership's pre-war speeches and essays stated that Ukraine is not a legitimate country and that Ukraine was unfairly carved out of Russia.
This is based on a widespread Russian belief that the Ukrainian identity was created by Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire to divide Russia.
So why do China and Trump keep demanding "peace talks"?
What exactly is there to talk about when Russia doesn't even recognize Ukraine's right to exist?
Probably means they were annoyed they haven't been in the news for a while and wanted to revive speculation that they will intervene in Ukraine.
>Great Britain wants to deliver fighter jets to Central and Eastern European countries if they in return hand over their Soviet-designed machines to Ukraine.
It's about countries that have Mig-29 or Su-24 jets, Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told Times Radio.
NATO partners had the necessary knowledge to fly NATO jets, which Ukraine does not yet have.
Ukraine demands delivery of modern fighter jets from allies.
So far, Western countries have reacted skeptically.
German news said Britain has stated it would be willing to replace any planes that NATO partners sent to Ukraine:
>China will continue to support Belarus' efforts to resist external interference in the country's internal affairs.
Russia had used Belarus as a base for its Ukraine invasion.
For months, Ukraine has expressed concern that its northern neighbor could enter the war on Russia's side.
