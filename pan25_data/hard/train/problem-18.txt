So if Ukraine gets a ready battery from the IDF, it could have anything between 60 to 160 missiles that it can deploy in any pattern it likes, including overlapping coverage.
Do humor me then.
How do other systems overcome this?
Can their one missile shoot down 20 enemy missiles?
Because as far as I can tell, you'll still need 20 missiles of whatever system you're referring to, which usually would cost at least an order of magnitude more than Iron Dome.
Iron Dome is not a good response to the threats in Ukraine - False.
Ukraine is mostly threatened with drones and cruise missiles, making Iron Dome an ideal system.
Which, considering the size of the Ukraine battlespace, would also be present and not plugged by the Iron Dome.
Keep in mind, contextually I was speaking on an iron dome system for Ukraine.
The cost, supply chain, and land mass talking points were all to say western nations need their advanced arms, canâ€™t produce them at scale for other non NATO allies, and fear them getting into enemy hands.
