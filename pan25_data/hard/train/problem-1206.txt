Look, yes, America did a lot of bad shit in South America.
Some of it probably still going on, a lot of it still needs reckoning.
No matter what they say, it’s not America’s fault that Putin is bombing Ukrainian civilians.
It’s not America’s fault that the Iranian people are angry at their daughters being murdered for improper headwear.
It’s not America’s fault that Chinese elderly are not vaccinated and rural hospitals are not prepared for COVID.
It’s not America’s fault that Venezuela has a president-for-life after the last president-for-life destroyed its economy.
Some of the bad things that autocrats and dictators do — take a deep breath — those things are actually their fault.
But this whole, “but America bad” first line of defense is getting tedious.
“Sure, Maduro gamed the system and rewrote the constitution to ensure that he will always remain in power, and sure that’s technically not that democratic, but look at what the US did in South America in the 90’s!”.
You should look into the election, it wasn't quite as "DEMOCRATIC" as you probably think it is - a whole new branch of government (which was 90% Maduro loyalists) was created to overrule the opposition in the Venezuelan legislature.
