From the evidence available, it is likely that Kim has larger warheads capable of long-range missiles, and is making rapid progress towards tactical ones, as well.
It's possible, but unlikely.
Just this Kim tested a strategic, nuclear-capable ICBM that can hit targets in mainland USA.
The current fear is that NK is already working on miniaturized warheads for tactical nukes to be placed on short-range missiles.
To my knowledge they have nukes, but not nukes small enough to fit on a warhead (no means of delivery).
Being able to manufacture warheads is what would make them a nuclear weapon state, but I could be wrong.
No one wants anyone to get nuclear weapons.
But unless you are able to threaten proliferation you can't prevent people from getting it.
I've got a couple of ideas.
Unfortunately all of them require threatening China with something that they care about because, let's face it, NK will only change course if China wants them to.
The first one is to threaten to have SK join the Quad, and for the Quad to upgrade to a defensive alliance.
