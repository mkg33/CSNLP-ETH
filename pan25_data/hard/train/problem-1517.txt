230 bills of anti trans legislation have been introduced this year alone.
That fact by itself shows that it should've been talked about for several minutes but no trans people are some political prop that don't deserve help.
Considering that attacking trans people seems to be the number one issue hands down in so many red states, that's a small amount of time no matter what the excuse is.
I think they're afraid of losing transphobic diet dems.
I want people to give a damn things are getting bad for the trans community.
So really at least some semblance that Democrats will try to do something about the enormous amount of anti trans legislation would honestly be enough.
But what we get is effectively a nothing burger.
Federal protections and prosecuting the people who are violating human rights will be the only things good enough.
Stop acting like things are fine when they clearly aren't.
Republicans want trans people dead.
Get that through your head.
Why do you think anti crossdressing laws have been cropping up?
Why do you think that DeSantis wants the penalty for being in drag in front of a minor to be death?
Open your eyes.
