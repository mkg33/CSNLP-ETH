I’m totally with you, people thinking a billionaire is currently concerned with tax breaks is BS.
Maybe his accountants are but Gates in genuinely a fucking philanthropist and has given more to the world than most other people in history.
I’m not a fanboy and primarily use Macs and have done for a couple decades, but the sheer cheek of people suggesting he’s some kind of paedo vampire looking to increase his wealth is so cringe.
It’s like philanthropy can’t exist without it being a product of guilt or as a cover for shady dealings….
So he is blatantly immoral for making the lives of everyone worse than packaging the solution to his wealth hoarding as his philanthropy.
It's because donating to your own charitable fund for tax write offs and no oversight means that a lot of that money will never see their claimed intentions.
Most of this is for publicity.
Tax on his full wealth amount is 27,160,000,000 but because I can deduct that out of my taxes I can use this number to subtract from my 97 monies and find my actual taxable income 69,840,000,000.
28% of that is 19,555,200,000.
Subtract that from what I would have paid without the deduction and I'm at 7,604,800,000.
Not only did I save that money from the government I am now .6048 monies ahead.
Oh wait there's MORE.
I donated my 7 bil monies into my own charitable fund that I control.
I can now use this money to lobby politicians by making it look like a donation from my charity.
I can also give this money to people in need, but I'll use (optimistically) 1 monies to do this.
The rest will go into the trust for my family that the charity controls.
This can be in the form of stock options as well, so my family has control of my company tax free!
I said I donated 7 monies but I didn't say what kind of monies they were.
If I have 104 billion monies and I donate 7 of my monies I lose about seven percent of my total monies.
I now have 97 monies, but because I donated seven, my tax bracket is 28%, I can deduct 28% per every hundred dollars I have instead of being taxed a full 28% on my 97 monies.
