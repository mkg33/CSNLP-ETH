Why didn't Putin just wait and pull a CIA and just install someone more friendly to his country?
Before Ukraine had a common enemy, (invading Russians), Ukraine had some corruption problems.
Fortunately with the invasion, they have been able to clean house of partisans.
No doubt a backed candidate by Russian could have had the entire government and done what needs done.
Just to be clear, I do not support or endorse the attack by Russia on Ukraine nor support the Russian regime.
Building hugely, expensive mobile warships is exactly what you want to do in the case you win the NATO conflict in the Black Sea and wish to project it further in to the Mediterranean.
Im glad we agree.
I should have commented on the other user claiming it was an arrogant move to keep these ships here.
As if there was a better place for them to be.
Yeah, no, there is literally no other place for them to be.
Turkiye would never let them leave and would never let any other ship enter during wartime.
They're trapped in the Black Sea.
