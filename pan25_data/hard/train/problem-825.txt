I mean look at what was voted down in the Build Back Better Act — paid family leave, universal pre-school, two years free community college, allows the government ability to finally negotiate prescription drug prices, ACA expansion lowering healthcare premiums for 9 million citizens and expanding access to another 4 million, massive financial investments in child care, funding for the 800,000 elderly people in desperate need of home care, dozens of clean energy investments, tax penalties if drug companies increase prices faster than inflation, lowers insulin to flat $35, caps out of pocket prescription costs at $2K / year instead of current $6K / year, the largest investment into affordable housing in US history, tripled the credit for low-income childless workers that would have saved 17 million people average of $1,100 on their tax bill, and many many more.
It doesn’t matter if it’s true, just that people are left with a sense of distrust, distaste, and dislike.
That combined with a large portion of the voting population being inherently sexist and they can control the narrative for decades.
The GOP has engaged in a 40 year hate campaign against Clinton and it’s disturbing how little attention it gets.
We had six years of Benghazi hearings alone.
It’s not a coincidence that many people “just don’t seem to like her”.
I didn't used to like her, but I did trust everything she said.
She's principled as fuck and always has been.
She’s.
So.
Obnoxious.
A total sucker for the spotlight.
Can we please find a dem that isn’t the lefts equivalent of maga world.
Progressives are a tick on the side of the Democrats.
