And you're delusional to think that fusion will play any role, as it will take many years to get a sustained reaction, and decades to develop a scaled-up production ready prototype and further time to create manufacturing plants and to set up supply chains, etc, and then it needs to manufactured and commissioned on a planetary scale.
That's a strawman.
It's not about ending fossil fuels tomorrow, it's about moving away from fossil fuels as fast as is practicable.
And the lies and obstructionism from the fossil fuel has slowed that transition.
The reality is we can’t stop using fossil fuels for a long time.
Probably until sustained fission is achieved or we see more improvements in other green tech.
There’s a reason we still use fossil fuels.
There’s a reason Germany is mining coal.
There’s a reason both democrat and republican leaders refuse to join the Paris accords.
Bitching about using fossil fuels is pretty ridiculous considering there would be about a billion people dead in a few weeks if we stopped using them tomorrow.
