Yes, if the alternative is surrendering to every nutty dictator with nukes, we'll have to risk it or assume we'll be slaves.
The other option is to be so prudent that tyrants see that nukes DO serve a purpose, then everyone races to get them and then the human race would have no future for real.
Any time some tyrant threatens nukes we'll have to threaten him with annihilation and then proceed as if there were no nukes involved.
We jokes but the few operational nukes Russia have can still starts a global nuclear war.
Putin might becomes crazy enough to use tactical nukes in Ukraine if the Ukrainians pushes far enoughâ€¦.
If Russia begins to take a lot of damage inside their own borders it just gives them a reason to point towards nuclear weapon usage.
They can drop a warhead in Ukraine and at the same time point towards the attacks inside Russia and their civilian casualties as an excuse to try to end the war quickly.
It sucks for the Ukrainians but that is how you avoid them just going nuclear.
Turn Ukraine into a never ending meat grinder.
Russia already has an aging declining population, they can't hold out for years taking casualty numbers like we are seeing.
Then the Russians send nuclear warheads at Ukraine to quickly end the war.
They know NATO won't retaliate over Ukraine.
Currently they don't have any actual excuse to fire nukes, attack deeper into their homeland and that stops being the case.
