I agree it's part of it, but Whitmer won by 10.6 points.
That signals a huge change in Michigan.
Every county in Michigan had more blue voters than in the past.
Almost every statewide office went blue.
Getting rid of gerrymandering helped local and district areas change to what they probably should have been in the past, but people voting in droves for blue statewide offices shows it's a culture shift.
It would be one thing if a few of those seats were flipped, but a majority in literally every state wide office and all three ballot proposals passing signals that this might be a culture shift.
It's not a culture shift, it's the results of not being able to choose their voters (gerrymandering).
In 2018 Michigan adopted an independent redistricting commission.
Democrats in Michigan won virtually everything.
Governor, SOS, AG, House, SCOTUS, Schoolboards... and all 3 ballot proposals passed.
Edit: Actually after reading your post again, you have a point with the state-wide elections and ballot proposals.
Seems I glossed over the main point of your post.
