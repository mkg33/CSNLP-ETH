I can't even get a post card correctly delivered to my next door neighbour if I don't put both our names and addresses on it, but somehow these gold bars are imported without the officials knowing who they are delivered to?
Unfortunately the article doesn't mention that at all (that the imports might have been Russia satisfying an order that pre-dates the sanctions).
Where do you have that information from?
In August, Switzerland, which is a major global hub for processing gold, adopted European Union sanctions prohibiting the trade of Russian gold and gold products.
So, an increase in gold imports of Russian origin are no indication that Switzerlandâ€™s trade with Russia increased, it is also no indication that sanctions were violated.
In fact Swiss sanctions on gold trade with Russia are a copy of EU sanctions and the gold trades have been confirmed to be in accordance with those sanctions.
And yet we are somehow supposed to consider that Switzerland has joined in on the sanctions against Russia, which is something.
An argument could be made that Switzerland is evading sanctions and allying with Russia.
Switzerland could then face sanctions themselves.
