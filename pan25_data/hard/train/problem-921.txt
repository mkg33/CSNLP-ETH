Kagan dissented saying that there were established tests that could be used by the courts to easily determine which maps to strike down, that gerrymandering is far more of an issue today than it was historically because of new extremely precise methods of gerrymandering, and because it was the role of the court to defend the most basic foundations of democracy in our country by striking down extreme partisan gerrymandering.
Roberts argued in his majority opinion that this was non-justiciable because of how it would require the court to determine whether or not maps were legitimate year after year.
He also said there was a history of partisan gerrymandering in the US (I think it was named after one of the founders, actually).
And he said that the states and Congress could take care of it.
Edit: according to a response this only applies to federal courts, not state ones.
In this case it was a federal court.
by federal courts.
State courts can still consider political gerrymanders based on state election laws and state constitutions.
Not agreeing with the Supreme Court, but it does mean and we have seen in some states ballot measures to make political gerrymanders illegal/unconstitutional.
