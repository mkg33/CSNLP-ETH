There would be many emigrants from Hungary, a lot of us lives only under this shitty government because we hope, one day (after Orbán) we can be an acceptable EU country again.
Blocking EU funds is breaking point for Hungary, forcing it to choose a clear path for the future: EU or not EU.
I fear it will be not EU, a lot of people brainwashed here, they can eat shit if they want, but everyone else will suffer just because Orbán is a narcissistic liar.
Oh i see so lager members been able to bully smaller is democracy and not a dictatorship how silly of me to see that the EU has the right to bully its own members.
No but at the same time larger eu members been able to bully the smaller ones to do as there told is not democratic as well i fail to see why this is so hard to understand.
What is democratic about 450 million people dictating how a smaller country of 10 million should be run oh look it works both way what a good point you made.
The anti-democratic behavior is a joke right?
using there democratic veto to stop the EU doing somthing they disagree with is undemocratic to you WTF.
Without suspending their voting rights, the EU can't really do anything to override Hungary's veto.
The decision requires unanimous consent.
As does the decision to suspend an EU member's right to vote.
A decision to sanction/exclude a country from the EU needs a unanimous vote save for the country being targeted.
Poland would veto that measure in favor of Hungary, and Hungary would likewise do the same for Poland, since Poland has also been on the receiving end of EU criticisms for anti-democratic changes to their judicial system.
Recently Austria vetoed Romania and Bulgaria ascension to Schengen, in the past a Nordic country was blocking support to South Europe, Germany took decisions by itself that affected the entire union etc.
Edit: rogue also means that someone behaves in contradiction with the majority... which Austria did...
