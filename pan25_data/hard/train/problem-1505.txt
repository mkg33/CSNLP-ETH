And?
The aircraft that Ukraine are currently using are even older than the F-16 NATO could supply and less capable than the Russian aircraft.
We can definitely train them to - switching from Soviet aircraft to F-16s would take significant adaptation but it's hardly impossible and they have a surplus of pilots.
Setting up the appropriate logistical train to keep them operational and with sufficient trained ground crew would be the bigger struggle, but even that's hardly impossible.
The real practical issue is that they would be unlikely to be ready for combat in Ukraine this year (even with an abbreviated training program Ukraine would have to have the logistics in place on the ground to support them), so the impact on the war is questionable - the effort may be better spent providing something else to Ukraine that they can put into service relatively quickly.
Honestly, I think the US could give up a few squadrons of our >1700 active-duty F-16s (especially since we have so many other fighter aircraft which can perform similar roles), but I'm sure the DoD will absolutely insist that every last aircraft is absolutely essential to US national defense (and even if they didn't, Fox News would probably tell all their viewers that it was and that Joe Biden was hurting America) so it's politically unlikely to ever happen.
There's also the practical consideration of where the F-16s come from.
There are a metric shitload of F-16s out there (over 4600 built) but most of them are either:
