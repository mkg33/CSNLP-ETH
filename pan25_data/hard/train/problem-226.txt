Ukraine should also be wise that if they do get their wish in 2 years though overly optimistic it is, they should do well to protect their agricultural industry and gas/oil from outside private investors who only want to profit, the locals be damned.
The EU would need to ‘drive the boat’ for a few years to ensure it won’t just collapse under their feet.
At best Ukraine can expect Customs Union in 2 years.
5 years-ish after that single market.
A further 3 years full EU membership and possibly Schengen.
Schengen after 10 years from now?
That's insanely optimistic.
Romania and Bulgaria not in Schengen after 15 years in the EU.
Add in some reasonable concerns, and suddenly the political vote is gonna not go in Ukraine's favour.
For one I do not believe Ukraine can win a war AND do all the changes it needs to do.
Second, I am sure EU institutions can never keep up with such a pace even if Ukraine could deliver.
I'm pretty sure the EU will do all they can helping with rebuilding the country and the needed reforms but again, that will take many years until Ukraine is ready to join.
