Frankly in a more civilized country, Cannon would be fired in disgrace for such rank abuse of her position.
Likely have charges for obstruction applied as well given how blatantly she misused her authority (even said so herself) on behalf of a defendant to obstruct an investigation.
A federal judge may only be impeached as real disciplinary action.
That process would be identical to the presidential impeachment process.
The House must impeach the official, then the “trial” is held in the Senate where a 2/3 majority is needed to convict to remove.
Sadly we only have impeachment as recourse, the definition of a toothless process when the bar is nearly impossibly high to reach conviction.
The only possible sanction would be impeachment.
I'm sure I don't need to tell you how unlikely that is.
It's possible for different judges in a panel to reach slightly different conclusions (or even opposing ones).
(A) Judge Cannon was so obviously wrong that the panel didn’t feel the need to get too formal with the typical approach for resolving meritorious appeals, and/or.
(B) Judge Cannon was so off base that this is not an important issue of jurisprudence, and therefore, the panel didn’t feel the need to go to the trouble of issuing signed opinions, and/or.
For this panel to issue an unsigned opinion in such a significant case would be an embarrassment to Judge Cannon.
So your contention that judge Cannon wanted to "devote their life to legal practice" is probably flawed.
There is a good chance she wanted to devote her life to conservative politics and just decided to do so through legal practice.
