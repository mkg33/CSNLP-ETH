I did not understand when I read _Bruen_ that no restrictions not in place in 1789 can ever be constitutional.
It conspicuously does not say that.
_Heller_ admits of restrictions in sensitive places and implies that novel weapons may be evaluated.
If you are right, the NFA and the GCA get the axe too.
I wouldn't really put anything past that court, but I doubt they are going to wipe out all the guns laws in the entirety of American history.
What if a law said you still have the First Amendment right to say silly things on Reddit, as long as you are fingerprinted, shaken down for lots of money, pass a civics test, and prove your good character to a county sheriff?
Would that be okay?
Of course not.
No it does not.
That is why the argument about novel weapons not being covered were rejected unanimously by the Supreme Court in Caetano, including by Ginsburg.
All bearable arms including ones invented in the last 40 to 50 years like tazers or stun guns are covered.
So if it is common use, not common use for self defense, but common use for lawful purposes in general it is protected under the 2nd amendment.
