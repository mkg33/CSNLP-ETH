- the exomoon would be tidally locked to the gas giant, not the star; it would get a somewhat more even distribution of sunlight (it still wouldn't be as good as a non-tidally locked planet though).
- the gravitational force from the gas giant stretching the exomoon could help fuel a geological system.
Hypothetically speaking, if you could travel at 80% the speed of light with instant acceleration and deceleration, it would take about 10 years to get there (time dilation shortens your time by 67% relative to Earth's at 80% the speed of light).
If you needed to accelerate or decelerate (deceleration is extremely difficult to do at near lightspeed), you would basically need to spend at least several months "building up" to the maximum speed, and in the last 2 or so light years you'd need to immediately decelerate (because it would require an extremely long "interstellar runway" of sorts to gradually slow down).
You need to accelerate and deaccelerate too of course, but even if you are doing 50% 1g acceleration and 50% 1g deacceleration (with the added bonus of having a sort of susbtitute for gravity on your trip), I bet you could travel there in less than 31 years.
As long as you can get sufficiently close to the speed of light for a majority of your trip of course.
This means it would take 31 years to get there if we could travel at the speed of light, to really put it into perspective.
We need around 7 months to reach Mars at our current speeds...
Only 31 light years Hot damn That’s only ….. 3,374,877 years away (Based on the fastest manned spacecraft flown.)
that’s a mere 16.87 times over the timespan that Homo Sapiens evolved till they built that fastest space ship Easy Pack your bags boys and girls, we’re going to Wolf 1069b.
