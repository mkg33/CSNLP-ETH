Yeah, I mean 2000 election was straight up theft.
Supreme Court had no fucking right to deny a recount, especially considering the governor of Florida at the time was Bush's brother.
It was absolutely worthy of being objected to.
The House actually passed the plan too, but luckily for the American people, the Senate chose not to progress the idea further.
It's even worse than this.
Before the Supreme Court settled the dispute, committees in Florida’s House of Representatives and Senate passed resolutions that would enable them to send their own group of electors to the Electoral College.
The issue was tried in courts and the Supreme Court ultimately said that Florida's Supreme Court had the final say on Florida election rules, which to be fair, is a very strict reading of the federalist constitution we have.
Edit to add: The Supreme Court didn't deny a recount, they denied their own ability to override a state Supreme Court ruling about state election rules.
Weird fixation of forcing the Pledge when forcing the Pledge has been ruled on repeatedly by the Supreme Court that is something you can’t do.
Then again, these people are the same ones who demand religion be put back in schools when it was never a part of them.
