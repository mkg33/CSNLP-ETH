I unfortunately couldn't get exactly what you meant in the last paragraph.
Some of your points are being lost in translation.
Look, I hope Russia has hope for a great future one day, but as long as you're under the thumb of men like Putin, we can't prioritize your plights over the countries Russia is terrorizing.
You’re not happy that the world has actually put its foot down on expansionist and amoral invasions by Russia?
Are you really arguing that there should be less awareness and global concern for Ukraine, because bad things are occurring elsewhere?
We’re currently in this thread discussing Russia and Ukraine, so of course people will voice their reasonable opinion that the unjustified invasion, murder, rape, kidnapping and attacking of civilian targets wholesale by Russia is evil and must be stopped.
Russian [opposition-oriented] newspaper reporting on things happening in Russia, and comments talking as if they shouldn't be allowed to, or something.
You really can't see the issue with reddit and the media only focusing on crimes being committed by Russians and ignoring those we are complicit it and never even acknowledging those that happen in the third world?
