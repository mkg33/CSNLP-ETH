This reminds me of when the Taliban pick and choose things from Islam as well.
Like forcing women to cover up but then not letting them run businesses/work, going to school, stoning people for adultery (except the burden of proof in Islam for such a crime is having 4 men seeing the act occur which is virtually impossible), and so on.
"In the Islamic Republic it is illegal to execute a young woman, regardless of her crime, if she is a virgin [â€¦]".
And just as a side note, the fact that Iran's weird religious legal system is so turbid and opaque that Wikipedia people have to do investigative work to establish a simple fact that should be easily verifiable by reading a legal act is pretty fucked up.

So all this being said, I am still cautiously skeptical of whether or not Irans lack of easily accessible is obfuscation of specific heinous acts (rather just being in league with similar countries in regard to bureaucratic IT sophistication), but given it is a heinous allegation I am just as dissatisfied in the lack of clarity as you are.
