There are a number of programs being staged up at the state and federal level to support childcare.
The biggest problem we’re having is finding trained and certified workers, so we’re also funding workforce training.
Unfortunately, until we can get childcare workers back in the game, costs will likely stay high.
We can look at similar historic situations though, going all the way back to the Black Death.
When the remaining labor is able to organize and communities take stock of things, there is a tremendous opportunity for quality of life improvements.
During the school day?
For context, this is one of the larger pieces of our workforce shortage.
We have a major childcare worker shortage, so parents are having to reduce work hours.
In America it's common for the spouse with a lower paying job to stop working during child care years.
Giving up the lower income is usually cheaper or on par with daycare.
The most needed and least available form of daycare is before and after school, since most people don’t have 6hr a day jobs.
Maybe this is commonplace, but at my elementary school there was before and after school daycare.
The teachers that worked it got bonus pay on top of their normal paychecks and the parents were assured that there were people at least somewhat competent watching the kids.
For low income parents, the fee for it was subsidized by the school district.
Could require elementary schools to do something similar.
