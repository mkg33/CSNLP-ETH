The third metric is the only one that matters, and in this case, specifically the recoverable resources in Norway's part of the Arctic.
McGlade and Ekins (2015) was unequivocal on Arctic exploitation: there is no scenario in which Arctic reserves are extracted where we stay under +2C.
It's not physically possible without an accompanying (effectively unphysical) mass removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
And if you had the energy to do that, you wouldn't need those fossil fuels.
We need to be able to generate power in a sustainable way and for this nuclear is good.
Accidents have happened, but those were older reactors.
Safety has come a long way since.
Germany is shutting down their plants, and burning more coal.
This is not a good trade and i view the Germans very negativly for their headless jump of nuclear.
Those plants are needed now.
Norway govt is against it for now, but the pro nuclear are gaining momentum so who knows what the future brings.
Nuclear is not the energy source of the future i dont think, we will move away from it when better tech comes along.
But it is one of the important energy sources right now.
Global warming is to big a deal to shut down our most effective power generation over old fears and waste managment.
