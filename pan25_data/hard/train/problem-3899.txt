The war ends in 30 minutes.
NK shoots all it's conventional weapons at Seoul, and SK responds and it's over.
The thing is, those artillery pieces are within range of Seoul, and it doesn't take artillery long to fly through the air and hit, giving citizens very little time to seek shelter.
So Seoul proper and southern Seoul metro may be a bit of a stretch yeah depending on how modern their artillery and ammunition is.
The source below says that only 1/3 of Seoul is actually in range (only the northern part), which is less dense populated than the rest.
And the farther south you go from the border, the less artillery is able to hit those long ranges.
They may have some 30-40km artillery, but those are few apart and not in relevant numbers.
One question, does NK have artillery that has a range of 30+km?
And if they have, how much of those do they have?
Even modern reports indicate that NK only has around 150 artillery pieces and 150 MLRS to hit centre and south of Seoul.
Worst case estimates are in the ballpark of 200k casualties with around 20k fatalities.
Because looking at the map, the centre of Seoul is about 35-40km away.
There are still tons of ourskirts north of it but yeah.
