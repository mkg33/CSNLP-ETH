It's because he accidentally understood the bill for a second when it was pointed out that the exact same language protects interracial marriage.
But afterwards he remembered that oppressing other people is a central tenant of his religion, so a law that says you're not allowed to do that is a violation of his "religious rights".
Does he know that there are people who claim that interracial marriage violates their religious freedom too?
What about the Unitarians who don't have any problem with gay marriage?
Are they going to declare that a gay marriage officiated by a Unitarian pastor somehow isn't a Christian sacrament?
Seriously, how is religious liberty being “assaulted” by gay people getting married?
They’re not making it mandatory that your church specifically must officiate those weddings.
Dude still gets to be a bigot.
You just can’t stop other, different churches and religions and most importantly the public court (which is a different type of entity altogether and not at all a religious institution) from doing it.
