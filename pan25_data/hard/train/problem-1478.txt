Are these the same polls which assured of a Red Wave during the midterms?
Or that Biden would lose to Trump 2020?
Call me skeptical, but I don’t think the polls are, shall we say, trustworthy these days….
I don't know why people are so vehement in writing off polls like this.
Trump eeked out a win in 2016 with narrow wins in the swing states and lost in 2020 with narrow losses in the swing states; regardless of whether you like him or not, he's gonna be competitive in a general election.
Obviously there are gonna be a lot of voters that are more enthusiastic about supporting him than just some random politicians he happens to support.
Whenever I like a politician, that doesn't mean I blindly support all their endorsements, or will be as active in supporting them.
They were still wrong, but in the sense that they expected Biden to win more comfortably than he did.
That being said, unless there are polls showing Trump ahead in PA, WI, and one of NV/AZ/GA, then Trump isn’t ahead in the polls.
National polling is pretty irrelevant.
