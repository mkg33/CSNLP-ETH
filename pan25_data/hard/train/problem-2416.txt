It was a policy memo.
This is how government agencies regulate their employees.
The memo isn't law, but Mueller could be fired for violating it.
If he decided to ignore the memo and indict anyway, he would have been fired and the case would have been withdrawn on the basis that Mueller was not acting properly on behalf of the DOJ.
Mueller was bound by the Office of Legal Counsel memo that prohibited indicting a sitting president.
With Trump out of office, there is no policy like that to prevent Smith from indicting Trump.
His consideration will be whether, based upon the admissible evidence, he believes DOJ would likely be able to obtain and sustain a conviction.
Even if I personally think he should be indicted, there's something to be said for the head of the DoJ not second-guessing their department's decisions.
Unreliable witnesses.
I agree that they should have gone for it, but the feds very rarely go for cases they're not sure they can win.
Also, from what I can recall, that was a prosecutorial recommendation from the people investigating the case; Garland, and other Biden admin.
members, wouldn't have been involved in that.
Look at the other comments.
There are a good number that claim "Well, them appointing the special counsel is just another means to run out the clock before 2024".
My problem with all these points: there is no way that the special counsel will get up and running any time soon.
It's just a difficult apparatus, and the simple sharing of knowledge and information of where each investigation -currently- is at, will take time.
Then there is the slow methodical steps they will take, and will only be slowed down with each lambasting by right-wing nuts.
