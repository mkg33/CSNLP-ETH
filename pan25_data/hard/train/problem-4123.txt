Without the US ability to decipher all Japanese communication and the Japanese being convinced they never did the outcome would be very different I guess?
(That's not to disparage any of the VERY IMPORTANT intelligence work that went into not just decoding Japanese message traffic, but properly interpreting what those messages really meant in the larger context.
).
This is correct.
From Russia's perspective it's different: in a part of Russia (called Ukraine) there's a group of separatists that want to take parts of Russia (that is Ukraine) to align with the big evil NATO.
Russia fires missiles to free some of its land (Ukraine) from terrorists.
Terrorist fire rockets from Ukraine to Russian targets because they are evil Nazis.
Of course tactical nuke would be enough to show off force, Ukraine is not suicidal to keep attacking Moscow after that.
Not to mention that attacking Moscow has no practical benefits to begin with; all it would do is escalate situation, anger population and boost support of war.
Just as "effective" as bombing Kiev is.
Actually it had very important military consequences.
Before that raid Japanese army was opposed to navy plan of taking Midway, considering it too risky and poorly planned.
But after raid army felt humiliated and agreed to follow that plan to restore its honour.
And we know how it ended.
Pissing off your enemies is still preferable alternative to real risk of dying under bombs.
Hopefully Ukraine realizes that hitting Moscow is a very bad idea unlike redditors, who make a lot of stupid suggestions.
The problem is that you cannot destroy those sites instantly, and as soon as mass missile launch is detected, all nukes will fly from their silos.
If USA could destroy nuclear arsenal of its main enemy with zero consequences, it would have done so a long time ago.
