Also, your history is wrong -- Arafat attempted assassination before Black September occurred.
Black September happened because Arafat tried to kill the king of Jordan twice, and the end result was a civil war that then led Arafat's fighters to travel across borders, eventually sparking war in Syria and in Lebanon.
A reminder that radical Palestinians tried to depose the king in the 1970s, before traveling around the middle east and starting wars elsewhere with their army of Mujahideen.
You uhhh know Israel wanted to disengage from the conflict multiple times, tried to give land back to Jordan, literally pulled out of varying areas?
When they did that the surrounding neighbors that tell idiots in the west that Israel is keeping the Palestinians down either barred Palestinian refugees or marked them as second class citizens without the privileges of certain professions and benefits.
The other nations surrounding them want it to keep going as it means a preoccupied and weaker Israel.
There’s a reason the other border states don’t want to create a porous border for the Palestinians and came up with the idea of right of return to a nation of Palestine that didn’t exist prior.
It allows them to funnel weaponry, money, and propaganda to extend the conflict without taking on responsibilities.
You think Egypt, Syria, Jordan, etc give a fuck about Palestinians?
No.
They have so much at their disposal and have had so many options to do literally any better than they did.
Instead they stole the flames and throw Palestinian youth at the meat grinder.
