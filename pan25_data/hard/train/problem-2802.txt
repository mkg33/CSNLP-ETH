All I see in the news is Russian troops claiming they don’t want to be there, why don’t they perhaps just “don’t be there” it’s not like the ordinary Russian people don’t have previous, they threw out their monarchy and hundreds of years of traditions I’m sure they could do the same to putin and his lot.
I think the Russians are right this time, I think the suffering of Russian soldiers is going to deepen even more, I mean more tanks on top of the cold, the constant artillery raining down on them, the sound of drones flying over them, no equipment, no socks, no training, no food….
Russia's go-to response to Western weapons shipments has always been reacting as if this is the first time they've heard of it, that they are starting to suspect we may be somehow involved in the war, and then explaining to us what weapons do.
Then Putin says Russian investigators are on the verge of a major breakthrough on who might be supplying the HIMARS systems, and when they find out.....boyyyyy howdy will they politely ask us to knock it off!
Then Biden holds a press conference laughing and gloating at all the Russians our HIMARS systems killed in the past 24 hours.
