I donâ€™t think any large scale media companies should ever be owned or run by one person, they should be run by a board only who abide by strict ethics designed to reduce partisanship and propaganda.
But again, he wasn't even talking about breaking up Twitter but was asked a question about it and used it as a segue to breaking up large media conglomerates.
That's factually incorrect.
Private companies, even a mom and pop bake shop, fall under antitrust laws.
This has nothing to do with existing antitrust law, anyway.
The situation being described is that Elon Musk owns a controlling share of all these corporations.
They are all separate and distinct corporate structures with no plans to merge.
The main thing that Twitter has going for it is that it is the social media platform of choice for public figures (celebrities, politicians, etc).
Once they lose that, they're basically irrelevant.
And if they fail due to financial issues before that, those public figures will find somewhere else.
Not saying it isn't \wrong\, and Bernie is calling for new laws regardless.
It's just not what existing antitrust laws were intended to deal with.
The only exception would be in purely terms of antitrust issues.
But there is no single organization that controls that much of "the media".
Edit: To be clear, twitter making rules on what can and can't be said on twitter is not related to 1A.
The government making rules about what can and can't be said on twitter or how money can be spent on speech is related to 1A.
The government can generally not restrict your ability to spend money to distribute speech.
And it sounds like, maybe, that's what Sanders wants here.
I know this is a contentious issue on reddit, but there are multiple SCOTUS decisions that support this.
