The Trump admin was telling us that the Taliban would be a counter-terrorism force working with us in Afghanistanâ€¦ not even a full year after we left they found & killed Al-Qaedaâ€™s chief in Kabul ðŸ¤”.
Pretty sure thatâ€™s where Trump negotiated with the Taliban, which led to thousands of fighters being released from prison, who inevitably broke the one condition: do not overthrow the Afghan government.
Yes, the Taliban did not attack coalition forces, but , in violation of Trump's deal; meanwhile US troop withdrawals continued.
Oh I believe it.
But itâ€™s worth reminding people that the Trump admin negotiated to make that a lot easier for the terrorists, and then Republicans blamed it all onâ€¦ Biden.
Without even putting the blame on Trump for the IS Kabul attack, there's no reasonable blame to be put on Biden.
As for the Kabul attack, that this was the responsibility of IS in Afghanistan, not the Taliban.
It can be said they are responsible due to their assault on Kabul and the chaos that ensued.
