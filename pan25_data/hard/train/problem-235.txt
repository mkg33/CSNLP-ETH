Yup.
If we didn’t have Manchin, we’d have an actual Republican in his seat.
And while manchin is a huge problem, he can and has voted with the rest of the democrats, which a republican senator would not ever likely do.
Manchin could really use the cover to vote with the Republicans without changing the outcome for these next 2 years while he's running for reelection in one of the reddest states in the country.
Manchin is very unlikely to be reelected over an actual Republican in 2024.
West Virginia is going the way of Florida.
West Virginia is probably going to have to be written off for a while.
We ALMOST replaced Manchin this month with Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin.
He only lost by 2 points after getting minimal funding from the DNC/DSCC and relatively minimal attention or assistance from the party until the last week or two of the race.
Had the Democratic Party gone as all-in on Barnes as they did Val Demmings, Barnes would have won.
Democratic leadership wasted money and time swinging for the fences in red-as-Satan's-ass Florida because said candidate is an Obama Administration alumna, while relatively ignoring a far more easily winnable race because the guy running is a Progressive Berniecrat who overturned the apple cart by beating the Moderate party favorite during the Primary.
Manchin is replaceable.
We just need to aim for other states.
West Virginia is going the way of Florida, Kansas, and Wyoming.
It's time to let them go for a while.
Manchin will be gone after 2024 and replaced by a Republican, and there seems to be nothing Democrats can do to stop it.
Whether a Conservative, Moderate, Liberal, Progressive or Leftist Democrat.
Manchin voted against the $15/hr minimum wage even though his voters very much did want that.
Manchin's votes make far more sense if you follow the money of his business investments and what business interests he's involved in.
