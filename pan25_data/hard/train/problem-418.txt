Obama ran on change, and McConnell ran on "no".
When they blocked everything Obama did, Democrats got disheartened and stayed at home.
Or actually voted for Trump.
Because they saw an outsider shaking the tree as a way to force the change that Obama couldn't do.
That's why so many Obama voters switched to Trump.
"Ok Democrats can't fix things?
Maybe this anti establishment firebrand can?
".
Right.
This whole discussion is predicated on a complete misunderstanding about how committees work and how the current 50/50 split affects those committees.
Correct.
Legislation needs to pass both houses of congress, so there would need to be compromise (lol) in order to get anything done.
They can’t really “vote anyway” because of the current filibuster rules — it takes 60 senators to agree to even have a vote on a piece of legislation at this point.
We can't add more seats to SCOTUS if Democrats don't have governing majorities in the House and Senate.
We need to stop talking about things outside the Democrats' control.
We need to vote consistently for viable Democrats.
That's what we need to do.
