Being easily ignored is a great way for people to support the thing they never hear about.
Well, I say "support," but when their support only amounts to a feeling that will immediately go away the second they're inconvenienced (or anyone else is inconvenienced) in any way, it can't actually be called support.
Protests work by getting attention and being inconvenient.
That's how they've always worked.
And they've always had people pissing and moaning about it, both from people ideologically opposed to progress and those convinced that protests are always wrong and bad and that being quiet in a corner is the way to success.
The way activism grows in society and their ways of protesting is reaching the opposite effect in society.
Protests happen because situations are often not compelling enough to have resulted in action.
Do you think every single step towards progress people have accomplished happened because everyone in society agreed it should the second someone, somewhere protested?
Or do you think people built movements and engaged in protests for extended periods of time that inconvenienced and annoyed lots of people?
I saw the same complaints about people protesting against the iraq war.In another time it was people annoyed women were protesting for equal rights.
In another time it was people protesting for an 8 hour work day was inconveniencing others.
