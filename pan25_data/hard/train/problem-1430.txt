Actually, I think it's quite rare for the plaintiff themself to be held jointly and severally liable for sanctions.
This essentially means "The court thinks you're both at fault, but doesn't really care how much blame each of you holds.
We can go after either one of you for the entire amount, and if you think that's unfair, you can sue each other to figure out the exact share of the blame."
Which is to say, if Habba ends up being the one who has to satisfy the payment, she can turn around and sue Trump for being the person who masterminded the legal abuse, and try to get that money from him.
Read the part at the end: the judge says he assumes Trump does have the money, and if Trump disputes this he has to hand over all his financial records to prove that he can't pay.
"Although obstruction of justice is typically discussed in the context of criminal contempt, the concept informs the rules of law—both substantive and procedural—that have been devised to protect the courts and litigants (and therefore the public) from abusive litigation tactics.
If use of an abusive tactic is deliberate and actually impedes the orderly litigation of the case, to-wit: obstructs justice, the perpetrator could be cited for criminal contempt.
