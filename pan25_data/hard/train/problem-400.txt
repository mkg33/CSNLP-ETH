Probably.
Recent reporting has shown that he hasn't even been in contact with his own district and people there are reaching out to other nearby Congressmen to get things done.
Dude's just collecting a paycheck as long as he can before he gets booted the fuck out.
This fucker should have never been given committee assignments in the first place.
I don't get it.
It's one thing to pretend to wait to see if he "violated the law" before booting him out of Congress, but he openly admitted that he lied about a ton of stuff and his own financial filings are covered in obvious red flags.
How hard would it have been to just not give him any committee seats, and let him try to melt into the background as an extra Republican vote in Congress?
Seems like this guy is in over his head and knows he will be exposed by his fellow congressmen as being truly unqualified if he spends any duration of time working on the committees.
Now that's convenient, he's going to stay on as a Congressman and continue to make his salary, but not serve on any committees and actually do some actual work.
Even if this guy doesn't resign, he won't win reelection, and I'm willing to bet he won't even run.
He realizes the jig is up.
He won't resign, but he's going to step down from serving on committees until these issues concerning him are resolved.
