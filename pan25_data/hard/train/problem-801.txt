And are growing in popularity.
It drives me nuts that so many positions have to be taken together to "count" as a progressive.
I'm for universal healthcare; I'm down to raise even my taxes (and it's not like I'm making six figures) to fund food, housing, and health, to say nothing of the taxes of the rich; sustainability is important enough to me that it was a focus of my undergrad engineering degree and my MBA.
But I've been pushed out of some progressive discussions for being pro-Israel (even though I consider myself pro-both as a proponent of a two-state solution).
And worse, I've been pushed out of progressive spaces, sometimes physically, for being Jewish.
And it was not questionable whether that was the reason, it 100% was.
The progressive leadership's acceptance of anti-Israel (far more than pro-palestinian) and antisemitic people makes me hesitant to throw my support behind people whose ideas and ideals I may otherwise back.
Meanwhile the Israelis are mostly secular, have huge gay pride parades, have a democratically elected government, freedom of the press etc... you would think liberals would naturally align.
As an Arab American and also an atheist and a liberal it is insane to me that in American politics the liberals support the Palestinians while the conservatives support Israel.
But the typical progressive and/or leftist viewpoint is that Israel has infinitely more power than Palestine, and therefore more ability to enact change, and therefore more responsibility to enact change.
But instead we see that time and time again their government abuses their power for selfish reasons, ensuring the cycle perpetuates.
