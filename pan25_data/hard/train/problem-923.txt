She’s so brazen.
And that’s why she got elected for a second term, courtesy of her GQP voters.
It really doesn’t matter what depraved, illegal thing she does.
She really sticks it to the libs!
Reminds them of Orange Cult Leader.
Saw a story about Sara Silverman.
Apparently she was attacked by some nasty troll on Twitter.
She asked him why he said that and he opened up eventually to her.
He went from full red MAGA to no longer a Republican.
He's a Republican.
He expects to presented with an exceptional end product that he in no way, shape, or form contributed in any manner to producing.
You know, magic.
She made a report that she had been threatened to the Capitol police after Jimmy Kimmel read one of her transphobic tweets then asked "Where's Will Smith when you need him?
".
Yup.
That falls into the "extreme" and "commercial" category.
A voting machine company lives and dies by their reputation for accuracy and reliability.
Publicly lying about that is the kind of thing a company kind of has to take to court.
You'd have to be a real idiot to lie about that.
