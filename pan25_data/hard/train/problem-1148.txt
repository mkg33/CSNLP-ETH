I saw this on a show set in the Netherlands, so maybe it's a thing there too?
So, in that show I believe they also provided the heroin.
(cuz obviously a huge issue with street heroin is what it gets cut with.
heroin is obviously never good for you.
but it can be cut with things to make it worse for you.
).
Hm.
Why not decriminalize and provide drugs for free as long as they’re taken in injection centers, plus offer voluntary rehab with free housing.
However if you commit a crime while on drugs it’s either a long time in jail or mandatory rehab.
Portugal also forces people who are convicted of a crime while doing drugs to go to jail or rehab.
Decriminalization is smart but there needs to be a mechanism for getting people who refuse treatment off the streets imo.
Homelessness is a deep-seated issue but there are ways we can prevent people dying on the streets and harassing others in the short-term while we TRY and fix the underlying issues driving general homelessness.
If someone is so mentally ill they cannot care for themselves and end up homeless, addicted or not, that is a completely separate problem our society does not seem capable to deal with.
We don't have the facilities and caregivers to involuntarily commit people who are a danger to themselves and that SHOULD be different.
