No, he would not have.
If the US had 4000 soldiers in the field we would have been able to maintain security on both airfields and the withdrawal would have gone much better.
We could have left on the original date, and the Taliban would have given Trump JUST enough time to pull out before snatching up everything.
The US forces Trump left for Biden were so weak and ineffective that they couldn't do anything, and the Taliban knew it.
Aside from one suicide bombing from Alqueda, the Taliban upheld their agreement and even went a bit further at times.
People there had 6 months to leave, and we took 100k people with us when we did.
This is what a pull out looks like.
It was never going to be storybook.
By dropping Afgan troop levels down to 2500, Trump ensured that it was going to be a cluster.
Biden couldn't move any troops back over because if he'd tried the Taliban would have interpreted that as a US surge and attacked forcing the US to stick around for a bloody civil war that the GOP would have blamed Biden for.
Getting out of Afghanistan was always going to be a shit show considering trump intentionally left it as a minefield for Biden.
trump didn't assist any Afghanis in leaving the country and the Biden admin helped evacuate over 100K people in a short period of time.
There was no way of stopping a suicide bomber in the midst of that chaos.
