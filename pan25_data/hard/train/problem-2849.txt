In handing his medal back that day in Bakhmut, the young captain wanted to extend his gratitude to the benefactor of the four HIMARS launchers he commanded: He wanted to say thank you to President Joe Biden.
So, he asked Zelenskyy to take his military cross and present it, in person, to the United States commander-in-chief.
Instead of humbly accepting the Ukrainian military's Cross of Merit, Chernyavsky handed it right back to the president.

As Trump would have just let Putin roll into Ukraine and take over, installing a puppet government as he intended to do, they really owe Biden their highest honor that Ukraine has.
It is unlikely there would have been as strong of a coalition without US leadership/military/dollars involved to support.
Biden has a lot of faults, but he did the right thing here and is instrumental in Ukraine being able to persevere over this horrible war.
that being said though, the Ukrainians have a hell of a fighting spirit, they have not let this break them and that has been imperative to their successes so far.
