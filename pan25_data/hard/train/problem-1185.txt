Those areas have had a majority of Russian speakers for decades, and the previous Prime Minister (who was ousted for leaning towards Russian trade) was part of one of the controlling families of Donetsk (yes, both regions are controlled by mafia style families).
If you read the Wikipedia article for the Donbas you can read about it, you'll find there's been claims of a history of neglect by Ukraine, and of general strikes going on there in previous decades to protest the under paying of coal miners.
Sykes picot would probably undo itself.
Who knows what that might do to the middle east.
But who knows, maybe it would all be fine.
Sometimes you have to try new things.
Hopefully they have something unique to add.
Once the invaders have left and have paid to rebuild Ukraine then we can forget about a Russia once again.
As if Ukrainian would forget which side China is actually on.
I bet there would be no peace plan, and all of this is just smoke and mirror for China lethal aid to Russia.
So, The China-Russia peace plan?
Two countries that want to invade other peaceful countries, causing wars, have a peace plan?
I think I know the answer: Stop invading peaceful countries Kick putin!
