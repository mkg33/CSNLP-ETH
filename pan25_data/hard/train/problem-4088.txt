Same thing with littering: mass ad campaigns paid for by Coca-Cola, etc., made you a "litterbug" when previously it was on the companies for stopping using recyclable bottles, etc.
Corporations tricked people into thinking its their fault for not recycling, not the corporation’s fault for producing plastic bottles and telling people it’s the healthy way to drink water.
This tactic is repeated throughout history in many areas.
Literally this!
They stole the future from our children, they owe humanity exactly that.
Their profits, their apocalypse bunkers, all assets, and the remainder of their lives work.
Like why the fuck are people obsessed with a righteously angry teenager being attractive?
What is wrong with people?
!
HA!
Right.
I don’t see her doing anything about the coal power plants in China running without scrubbers.
Why doesn’t she go there and protest the coal power plants?
Instead of protesting coal and oil, why not promote nuclear.
We cannot as a society remove coal and oil if we want to move forward.
We would have to devolve as a society and that's not going to happen.
So from my perspective, she's a well intentioned pretenscious teenager jet setting about tilting at windmills instead of building them.
As a supplement to oil and coal.
If we pull the plug on oil and coal without nuclear you may as well kiss your comforts goodbye.
Some may be willing, most not so much.
This is my perspective, maybe I am misinformed.
