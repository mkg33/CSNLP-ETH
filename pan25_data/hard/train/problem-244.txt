Well, it's not so much empathy but how its deployed in governance.
A correct phrase would be that democrats feel they know what is best for people.
Well, a fully correct phrase would be Democrats feel they know what economic policies are best for people, and are far more often proven right.
.
Literally.
The GOP default position is "I got mine, fuck everyone else"... Often even when they don't have theirs and helping others would help them too.
Also, the GOP 's voter base is for individualism unless it's from a woman who wants an abortion, a non-white person who wants equal treatment from the law, or a gay or trans person who wants other people to even know they exist...
People want to point to abortion, election denial, trans-hate, etc, as the reason the GOP lost.
And those all played roles.
Important roles.
But if I was going to point to the primary reason they lost, this is it.
I think you missed the point.
The point is, democrats politicians use time to hide behind their bullshit.
Wait long enough for people to forget/stop giving a shit, invent a new catch phrase and all the sudden you've got the moral high ground again.
