Just the way interest is calculated.
I would be done if my 5-6% was actually 5-6%.
I’ve thus far accrued 20k of interest on a 40k principal.
I’m throwing so much extra money at it each month to prevent any more accruing.
Do it for us FFEL recipients.
If we hadn’t graduated into the recession, we might have made enough for it to not have escalated so far.
And for those whose FFEL loans not held by the government, they didn’t get the payment and interest pause.
The loans would still be paid back, just delayed, so the loan companies can't complain they won't make their money back.
One thing they should simply do is increase the after graduation grace period from six months to like 5 years or so (and not charge interest during this time, of course).
A lot of students already have to apply for deferment and forbearance after the grace period ends, so extending the grace period would really just cut out a couple extra steps.
Six months is kinda just a ridiculously short amount of time for students that kinda haven't even been in the workforce for several years to get a job and gain steady enough income to cover all their expenses and then the loan repayment on top of that.
Very absurd.
