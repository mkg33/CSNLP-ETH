Lk Advani, a week after India's nuclear test in 1998 started warning Pakistan that it'll roll back Kashmir etc.
It was taken as flexing after the nuclear test in Rajasthan.
Two weeks later, Pakistan become a declared nuclear power too.
The Army and policy makers should have known that once you arm someone with no education or knowledge of the world a religious political ideology, then that person's loyalty is not with the policy makers, but the ignorant mullah who he will nod in agreement with when told that night is day and day, night.
Remember, Pakistan only conducted a nuclear test in 98 after India conducted one and its politicians starting making boastful threats to the country.
It was a BJP govt at that time.
references to Advani's threats can be found in papers from that era, I'm quoting just one (Washinon Post).
It was both, arrogance and stupidity plus the belief in a concept of "strategic depth".... the Taliban are the Pakistan army's creation, now they're dealing the rewards for such idiotic policies.
The Pakistani army and policy makers played a very stupid game with the Taliban, and they’re discovering that they’ve won a very stupid prize.
