That would be terrifying.
The stories my workers told me were about that stuff, but they had no way to get their passports back.
Working 12hr days 7 days a week living in demountables in the dessert.
They were all so lovely but so downtrodden.
It really struck me how lucky I was to be born in australia.
The funny/sad part is that I am an Australian.
I was leading the offshore survey so I was so fucking surprised when I got to port and they singled me out to go spend some time in the workers camp.
Felt like a refugee camp.
Spent an hour in a taxi and was still inside the refinery ground, it was that dystopian.
The workers camp was one of many demountable areas as far as the eye could see.
Barbed wire fences, most basic of amenities, my kettle literally caught on fire when I tried to make an instant coffee.
Meals left on door step and had to get them before the feral cats got into it.
To call it ‘food’ was a stretch.
This was during Covid too so weren’t allowed out of the demountable.
Outside was 45, inside was about 30c.
I was thrown into a Qatari gas refinery workers camp for 5 days after completing an offshore EBS.
Everyone else went back to their hotels and got their flights out next day.
No idea to this day why I was fucked over.
