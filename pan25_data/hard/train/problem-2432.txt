The way they've been going, Ukraine will be restored next year.
Then we get them in NATO as soon as fucking possible.
If turkey or Hungary pitch a fit we sign our own security alliance with them until we make those two tow the line.
Russia will think twice about starting shit again.
If we truly are people who fight for freedom, we keep supporting them until they're completely restored, or Ukraine decides they want to have peace talks.
Europe has been making efforts to get Ukraine on their side against Russia since the end of the cold war.
This ends with the restoration of Ukraine's borders and a demilitarized zone around the border for Russia.
So long as Russian military doesn't enter that zone there is no conflict.
If they enter it Ukraine would be free to use whatever means it wishes to destroy it as far as the west would be concerned.
No need to invade Russia.
Just bombard with missiles any military near the border ensuring Russia can never build up forces for another war.
Which is why I'm sure if Ukranian strikes into Russia continue, Russia will start using their civilian population as human shields.
They don't care about losses, and the optics in the West are bad for Ukraine if civilians are hit as collateral damage.
That would change if Ukraine started retaliating directly to Russian atrocities by committing war crimes of their own.
But I think Ukrainian leadership is well aware that they should avoid that sort of thing.
