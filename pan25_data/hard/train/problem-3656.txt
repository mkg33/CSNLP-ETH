Can I get some clarification on something I’ve always had trouble understanding?
Serious question not messing around, so I’m sorry if I seem like an idiot.
People say they’re “half Jewish”, so, one of your parents is Jewish and one parent is like, Catholic or something?
Or is Jewish technically an ethnicity, like saying I’m half Korean because my mom is Korean and grew up in Seoul before coming to America?
Or would it be more accurate to say half Asian?
Is Judaism a religion and an ethnicity, like are the two mutually exclusive?
What if then, one of my parents were hypothetically ethnically Jewish but for one reason or another grew up ethnically Jewish but practicing Christianity or Islam?
Would it still be technically correct to say I’m half Jewish?
Yeah, and let's be real orthodox Jewish are the "hardcore" Jewish.
Like you think catholicism is strict?
Go talk to an orthodox Jewish person and they will make you see catholicism is like kindergarten in comparison.
If you were born to someone of Jewish ancestry and they mated with someone who were Gentile (not jewish) then you would be half Jewish.
But if your mom follows the Jewish faith but has no ancestry in the Jewish ethnicity and your dad is wonder bread white Anglo Saxon then you are 0% Jewish ethnically speaking.
Unless they mixed in with someone, which then produced your mom or dad in their ancestry but my example assumes no co mingling of ethnicities in the bloodline back to its origin.
I, an American that's mostly polish but with a dash of euro mutt to round me out can be a believer and practioner of the Jewish Faith and call my self Jewish when speaking to the religion... but my ethnicity will not change.
Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and nation originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of historical Israel and Judah.
