They aren't very clear on how far this goes.
Its illegal to smoke on beaches and parks here in Canada, at least in the city where I live, Ottawa.
There is no law against smoking on the sidewalk, but you can't smoke within 9 metres of a bus stop or a bunch of other publicly owned facilities.
You can't smoke on outdoor restaurant patios.
Can't smoke in parks or beaches in Hawaii, and cops will come down on you, if you're smoking cigarettes.
They don't really care if it's reefer, think they are mostly concerned about all the cigarette butts.
I don't even smoke, have never smoke, and hopefully will never smoke, and I still think banning public smoking to be pretty silly.

Not sure about Victoria, but you can't smoke in your private car in Ontario if you have kids in there.
Which is a very welcome rule.
