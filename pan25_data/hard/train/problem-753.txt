Besides, Fox News just got publicly outed for knowing they were pushing lies... why would anyone view anything they claim with any level of credibility or journalistic integrity...?
Justin, your thoughts on Fox News hosts continuing to push election fraud claims on air when we now know that they knew it was all bullshit?
“FoxNews.com” should not be pointing out anything to do with lies.
I can already feel the ridiculous bias coming from this article without opening it.
And It does not have anything in it that is extremely biased or inaccurate.
People seem to be just taking issue with the source being 'Fox News,' and the fact that it is critical of Biden.
I can not remember the last time I read a Fox News article, but I just read it because no where in the comments does any one mention what is actually in the article.
Large unfunded spending bills makes that problem worse.
Every time the Fed increases interest rates the economy takes a hit.
Our economy is based on consumerism.
The infrastructure jobs do not replace the jobs that were lost.
Because Democrats and Biden decided to switch to public private partnerships they privatized public infrastructure.
So even the Industrial and Infrastructure jobs that were lost in the public sector are not coming back.
Instead the private sector is growing.
Which is a detriment both to workers and to the public.
The local communities that the Biden administration talks about helping out so much with its infrastructure projects absolutely fucked over with the Infrastructure act.
