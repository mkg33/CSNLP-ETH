He is a soulless empty suit, but rest easy Ohio, because there is a Choo-Choo train enthusiast from the corporate world in charge of fixing the chemical spill.
He hasn't proposed any plans to improve safety so it won't happen again, but at least he has another chance to lose a run for president.
Because he is a neoliberal, which are like libertarian democrats at best, and is a phony.
Appointing him in any regulatory position was like putting a fox in charge of guarding the hen house.
His whole defense is whatsboutisn.
Buttigieg is a neoliberal, the libertarians of the democratic party and he kept the deregulation that led to the disaster.
The problem with the party deregulation trying to attack opposition party on this stuff, is that they have supported creating the environment that made they disasters more likely.
Republican's love to rail about government, and how regulation is.
When in power they do there best strip those regulations.
So if the disaster under their watch, they shut up and go silent.
When happens during the other teams watch, they launch attacks and offer no actual solutions.
