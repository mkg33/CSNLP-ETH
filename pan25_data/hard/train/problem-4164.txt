I’m not so sure.
NPR and others have done a lot of digging in Russia and their assessment is that about 80% of the Russian public identify as very pro-Putin.
We think that he simply rigs the elections like any good dictator would.
But if he ran, even now, with Ukraine raging and thousands of sons dying, in a truly fair, observed election he’d still win by an astonishing margin.
The real question that political scientists have been asking hasn’t been “will there be upheaval or civil war under Putin.” Rather, “is there an heir apparent, a replacement to follow Putin someday, that can keep a post-Putin Russia together?” That won’t be Medvedev but there’s literally no one else that can fill the “admiration vacuum” that Putin will leave.
A lot of people believe that the real risk of revolution or civil war is about 2-3 years after Putin is gone, no matter when that is.
Not saying Putin's days are NOT numbered but don't be surprised if he stays in power another 10+ years either because russia is just that fucked up.
Secondly - IMO Russia has been rigging elections for the GOP for awhile now and this puts them at the mercy of Putin - of course they have to support him.
I think a portion of their support for Putin is simply because the current democratic president supports Ukraine.
Let’s face it, if this was Trump in office and he was going all in to stop Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Republicans would be 1000% for it.
Any enemy of the left is automatically their ally.
