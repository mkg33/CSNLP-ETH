His mission is to burn the Quran because by Danish & Swedish law it is legal.
By doing this (normally in neighbourhoods with a large representation of Muslims) he piss them off and normally a heated exchange of opinions takes place.
Thereby making his point that there are no freedom of speech in Islam.
This dude has been vocal and actively against Muslims since 2016.
He and his "Stram Kurs" folks have done this for years, have travelled around Europe doing the same crap everywhere but it somehow magically didnâ€™t happen(???)
because, according to op, the "first instance" had something to do with Sweden wanting to join NATO and and Putin not wanting that.
You're right that it's impossible for Russia to have planned this in 2016 in order to sabotage Sweden's NATOs bid in 2023, that's obviously not what OP is talking about.
They were talking about the first relevant instance of this Quran burning / Sweden NATO bid / related Turkish threats dynamic, which has been a running theme for a number of weeks.
That first instance obviously being the Quran burning in Sweden that pissed off Turkey relating to Sweden's NATO's bid, since then there's been a number of other events, such as this this article, that people are connecting with Sweden's NATO's bid and Turkey's issues.
OP was talking about the first instance of this dynamic.
If you want to install some sinks you hire a plumber.
If you want someone to conduct a state sanctioned Quran burning, you hire / empower someone that does state sanctioned Quran burnings.
You're free to burn your Qur'an but by requesting to do it outside a certain embassy shows intent that it's not burning the Qur'an that's the main goal but to stir up anger or such.
Burning a Torah is also allowed but if you want to do it outside Treblinka it shows you've got an ulterior motive that is not just burning a scroll / book.
