It’s amazing throughout time some decisions end up changing the course of history.
If Zelensky flees I’m not so sure that Ukraine morale doesn’t falter and Russia does in fact win — the US was already planning for a long Ukrainian insurgency after all.
If Zelensky was killed there is no chance Ukraine would surrender unless they were completely defeated militarily, not after seeing their leader who had a chance to get out give his life for his country.
It made Zelensky “immortal” in a sense.
With Zelensky as were seeing they are wrecking Russia.
But Zelensky refusing to flee did one really important thing, it made it so that in the tragic event Zelensky was killed, it would have made him a martyr and honestly make Ukraine harder to defeat.
All of that happened before the invasion giving Ukraine a fighting chance, otherwise zelenaky wouldn't have even had the opportunity to stay with Russia rolling straight through.
First thing Biden did after taking office was to visit NATO allies and rebuild trust in the alliance.
Second he issued military aid to Ukraine.
Next he sent our troops to Ukraine to train their officers on how to effectively train their own troops to operate like a NATO member.
Let's be fair here, NATO has been training Ukrainian forces since 2014.
All Biden has to do is keep writing cheques and handing over bits of equipment while simply ignoring the GQP people who are against it.
The rest is up to Putler and his ego.
