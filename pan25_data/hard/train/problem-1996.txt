I guess Musk has decided to take the massive social media company into a war with Truth Social for a race to the bottom.
Elon Musk's Ego is destroying twitter, berating what employees he has left, Twitter will become a hate filled cesspool.. as it crashes and burns, I hope he buys Facebook next.
Twitter is reinstating roughly 62,000 accounts that were suspended, each with more than 10,000 followers.
One of the accounts has 5 million followers.
75 have more than 1 million.
Internally, employees are calling it the Big Bang:
Elon is clearly acting irrationally here.
Twitter's board accepted his offer because it was too good to be true.
Elon overpaid for Twitter by at least $20 billion and will likely lose most of the $44 billion he invested.
These are not the actions of a good CEO.
loving this train wreck more, "Apple threatening to pull Twitter from its app store" "Billionaire owner of Twitter picks a fight with Apple" Edit, seeing this also, "The head of Apple’s App Store, Phil Schiller, deleted his Twitter account over the weekend.
Not a good sign for Musk’s business relationship with his most critical source of distribution".
