34 indictments and 9 successful prosecutions against senior Trump officials.
Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, and others were issued prison sentences.
Can we PLEASE stop pretending that nothing came out of the Mueller report?
This is Republican propaganda.
Trump abusing the presidential pardon power does not change the fact that the DOJ obtained guilty pleas/convictions and multi-year sentences for Stone/Manafort/etc.
At minimum, the Mueller report is not evidence of the DOJ's unwillingness to act (as is constantly being implied).
No, Trump himself was not indicted, but drawing conclusions about Trump's own individual conduct was also not in the direct scope/authority of Mueller's investigation.
This is very different from the current DOJ action, where we already know that Trump himself is the subject of the investigation.
"If you take the exact same conduct -- and make it not about Donald Trump and not about a former president of the United States, would the case have been indicted?
It would have been indicted in a flat second," Pomerantz said Sunday.
He called Bragg's decision not to bring the case a "grave failure of justice.
