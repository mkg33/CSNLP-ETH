Also, I’m literally a liberal coastal elite, and I don’t think I know that many people who have a secret past doing drag.
Why have so many of them done it AND also want to make these crazy laws about it?
Who ever asked anyone about their opinions about the legality of drag?
That’s not a thing (anymore).
Is that it?
You go after us because we won’t march, protest and camp outside your house & scream for a week?
You better target all offensive content - across the board - equally.
The fact that Tipper Gore went after that music over 30 years ago should give you added incentive to reignite that fight since they are your political enemies.
Is the gov afraid to approach one group/topic but not gay people?
Are we as gay people considered ‘harmless’ so let’s just pile everything on us, since we won’t fight back?
Are we the least physically intimidating?
You go after gay lives, gay culture, gay clubs, gay entertainment & call it morally offensive then BUDDY you better as shit be going after rap too.
Because you don’t get to single us out just because ‘you don’t think we’re gonna be a problem’.
Think again.
Otherwise you and any other state that continues this targeted attack on gay people will have a lawsuit filed & on your desk faster than you can say ‘please’.
