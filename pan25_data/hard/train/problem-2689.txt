I didn't say I thought it was necessarily criminal.
I was just curious--overall, there's a massive increase in value in those years.
I can perfectly well believe that most years he lost money.
That being said, I think you're significantly underrating the possibility of him lying on his taxes.
Given who he is and how he tends to operate, I would expect that it is pretty likely that he would operate criminally on his taxes--the worst case is that he has to go into litigation about it, and he thrives on that stuff.
Indeed, the entire NY suit (and the fact that the Trump Organization was convicted on all charges) suggests that most of his operations do depend on tax fraud.
Most of his taxes, therefore, are probably fraud.
Now, I don't know what that looks like, so I'm not going to say that what I'm looking at is tax fraud.
It could be perfectly legitimate--someone provided a pretty good explanation for 2018; I'm willing to accept that.
But generally speaking, I'd say that your last statement is off given what we know about how he generally operates and what got proven in court.
Big picture, most of his taxes are probably fraudulent, given his past history.
And the spin over at r/conservative is surely something about him being the bigliest of smart tax cheats and conmen.
Meanwhile a huge percentage of them are barely making ends meet, but can’t stop that poisoned logic for just a minute.
Imagine how much easier THEIR lives would be if every millionaire and billionaire actually paid their fair share and didn’t just keep robbing the general public blind?
