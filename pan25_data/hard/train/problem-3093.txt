But every time Ukraine "dares" strike back, at anything other than Belgorod \they dont seem to care about that city, poor bastards\, every time there's a prolific strike in Russia, they flip out and launch an even more savage missile tantrum, eventually they're gonna run out of things to launch and probably start using something that they shouldn't.... something that will require a kinetic response from other countries.
When You trade with an embargoed country .
You get sanctioned.
You try to brute force ships into embargoed ports.
They get fucking sunk.
Theyre basically enslaving engineers to keep building missiles.
And because Russia isn't embargoed.
India and China can just keep smuggling and selling components to Russia and laugh at the west while they make money over it.
frankly the only way the war ends is either Russia decides to pull everything out on its own accord, or Ukraine keeps fighting until the Russian Federation implodes on itself and collapses from an internal conflict.
The only thing that would prevent Russia from even daring to try again and breaking yet another agreement would be a NATO Peacekeeping Force on the ground in Ukraine after the war.
Putin is fucking terrified of NATO and he wouldnâ€™t dare launch anything that could have the potential of hitting a NATO target and dragging the alliance into a conflict against Russia.
