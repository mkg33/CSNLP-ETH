Same thing is being done in the Salton Sea in California.
Its a saline body of water inland which got polluted by farming runoff decades back so not much wildlife.
But its very rich in minerals like lithium.
Lithium is not as rare a rare earth mineral it once was.
The other thing that is constantly overlooked is that lithium ion batteries are 100% recyclable.
Canada has one of the largest recycling companies for lithium ion in the world and is working on cutting the cost of the process as it is an industry in its infancy.
Unlike plastics, these batteries have a 100 % reuse after separating the by-products.
Where in plastics a lot cost more than new to recycle and a lot there's no known way to recycle them to new.
So when there's enough lithium based batteries, they can become almost 100% self-sufficient for new ones.
Lithium is not going to wind up being hard to source, nor is it likely to remain the top battery material for all that long.
You don't need to worry much about lithium, it's both far more common than we've bothered to check and not really the ideal material anyway.
It's kind of low electron density and reactive, it's just nice for modern batteries version 1.0.
