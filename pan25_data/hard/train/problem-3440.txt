In the modern American political landscape, centrists can’t win in the republican primaries because their voters think democrats are evil, hellspawn literally controlled by demons.
They’d sooner destroy their own party than work with the democrats and they just might do that.
After 20 years of Fox News brainwashing, the nut cases run the party now.
The new policy chief for the house is Lauren “had to take the GED 3x” Boebert.
65% of the republican voters don’t even believe Biden won the election legitimately.
And you think for no reason at all, out of the blue, they’re just suddenly going to decide to be centrists because… it benefits the democrats??
I mean fucking wow man.
What kind of weed are you smoking?
I def want some of that shit.
Form a coalition with the democrats??
Hahahahahaha!
That’s the most deluded thing on I’ve read on Reddit in years.
Holy moley, you have def been tuned out of American politics for the last 25 years at least.
This is not 1994.
You don't seem to get it, the nutcases are the republican base now.
There aren't enough centrists in the republican party that agree more with the dems than the repubs to make a difference.
Also, why on gods green earth would ANY party willingly choose to become a minority party?
I mean it's great for the democratic party so I hope it happens but it's nuts to think this will ever happen.
It's better for the Democratic party to leave them trapped in the hell they made in their own party.
Also, your idea of "better" is not necessarily everyone else's.
For example, I'd argue there already are 100+ Rockefeller Republicans in the House.
They have a "D" after their name, but it's the same policies.
