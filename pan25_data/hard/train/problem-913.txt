India switches to buy Russian oil at ridiculously low prices, after western Europe moves in to outbid and poach energy supplies from the middle East, where the production has remained the same, thus making that energy unaffordable for most developing nations.
How the fuck is it irrelevant?
Most of India's population doesn't earn more than a few dollars everyday.
A spike in oil prices means the difference between starvation or survival.
How is that not a trade of equal value?
Unless you consider the lives of 1.4 billion indians to be worth less than 40 million Europeans.
No india has decided that the lives of a billion+ indians are worth more than 40 million Ukrainians, and calling that uncivilized is exactly that, racist.
And no india doesn't expect Ukraine or the west to sacrifice for India if/when the situation is reversed, because it has been that way previously and india has seen how the west acted then.
Which is precisely why India is doing what it must to survive on its own.
My entire argument is so that India does survive.
Look past the immediate problem.
Developing nations become developed by thinking ahead.
