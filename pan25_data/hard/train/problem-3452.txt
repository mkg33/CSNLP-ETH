Romney was the only Republican in the Senate who voted to convict Trump in 2020.
He definitely knew that his vote would make no difference and voted that way anyway.
He’s not supposed to vote to impeach Trump or march with BLM, but did it anyway.
I respect his few actions, because we would all be much better off if people came across the aisle when it mattered.
He’s a Republican.
He is going to do Republican things, that’s a given.
My only point here was to point out that when it comes to Trump we would have an impeachment if other Republicans followed his lead.
Romney also voted Once not to impeach him AND helped Trump steal two SCOTUS seats.
He also votes lock step with the GOP on Judges and refused to vote on anything bipartisan like infrastructure that the Dems worked out deals with the GOP for.
Romney isn’t a man of principals.
He is an opportunist.
His vote to impeach was only to set him up to survive the Grand old Purge that’s about to happen to his party when the pendulum swings back towards sanity.
At least opportunist cowards like Paul Ryan hid during Trumps reign so he could return an look like a return to sensibility.
The reality is all of the GOP enabled all of Trumpism Romney included.
Romney did not endorse Trump, did not vote for Trump, and voted twice to convict Trump.
Romney has repeatedly, consistently, and regularly criticized Trump for seeding racism, white supremacy, being a fascist demagogue, and generally being a unpresidential narcissistic blowhard.
