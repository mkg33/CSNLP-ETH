Based on rumors Musk started.
I'm 90% sure Musk is trying to generate this controversy for the express reason of convincing skittish investors to stop running towards the doors by "tricking" Apple - which had mostly been minding its own business, ad spending aside - into stating officially that it's not currently planning on deplatforming Twitter.
But the longer Apple's ominous silence goes on, the longer it seems possible they really are planning on deplatforming Twitter, so... yeah.
Good guess, i suppose, Elon.
Now that all said, Elon is doing that.
He's doing exactly what I believe he should be allowed to do.
However, I personally think he's doing the wrong thing re-platforming major sources of hate under the guise of "free speech".
I personally think his plan will fail at creating a platform welcome to all and will instead cause an exodus of the users most people would like to have and leave it with only the users most people don't want to have around.
Also causing advertisers to flee.
Thats not to say he's not allowed to do it this way, I just think he's wrong.
Free speech is one thing, no one should go to jail for saying something.
But being a welcome member of a public forum is a whole other thing.
It requires acting in good faith and politeness, following the "unwritten" rules of the Social Contract when interacting with other strangers, at least as the default state when they have not been hostile to you first.
Going out of your way to be rude and hateful to others who are just trying to go about their day, you can't be surprised at being rejected.
