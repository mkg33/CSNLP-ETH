It's fucking insane.
I've been lucky, my closest connection to a mass shooting was when a couple coworkers visited the Boulder King Sooper less than 24 hours before the shooting there, and a bunch of people texted me concerned because it's close to my office.
I was also within a couple blocks of the Planned Parenthood shooting when it happened.
Thankfully, nobody I know was hurt.
But damn, it's horrible.
While gun violence has many factors to be addressed, I think the phenomenon of mass shootings in particular has one major factor that sets it apart:
For my part, I think gun crime and gun accidents are entirely different issues with different drivers and different impact.
Another anecdote, my experience at the range has been a huge influx of new gun owners from all walks of life.
There's one pretty clear constant when it comes to gun violence in the US: an overabundance of guns.
If we want to tackle gun violence, we have to address the absolutely insane number of guns our citizens possess.
Sure but, pointing out that we had record gun sales in 2020 and that they clearly has an impact on the increase in shootings and gun violence makes you a screeching woke lib or something.
It's completely impossible to get any one to just acknowledge that more guns=more shootings as an objective fact.
