Edit: it's been pointed out to me a couple of times that the correct nomenclature is "conjoined twins," so sorry for that.
I'm leaving it as is in case any other olds run across it and realize they, too, have an unexamined racist term still in their repertoire as well.
Against their defense, they were given a 2nd chance to decide whether those racist comments or calling out the racist was the more appropriate thing.
They, twice in that case, chose to side with the open racist.
Their ban was changed from half a year to permanent for just asking if they were sure the white nationalist talking point was fine.
It was literally someone, going thread to thread, pretending that black people are genetically predisposed to do crime and vandalism, which they would then tie into lies about the BLM protests.
Seen a few friends lose accounts for calling out blatant white nationalist talking points before.
Mods decided the white nationalist comments were fine.
Calling them out though?
That's the real problem.
Here’s the problem though.
NY doesn’t appear to have any laws allowing them to recall members of their congressional delegations.
No, federal offices like the House and Senate can't be recalled even in states like California that have recall provisions, much less in states like NY that don't.
