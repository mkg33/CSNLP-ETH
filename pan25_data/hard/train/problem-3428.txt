Funny how the men there can have uncovered heads and arms without the women going mad with lust for them.
They must think that Muslim women have much more self control than Muslim men.
The thing about Islam is it's meant to control your thoughts, Like some 1984 shit.
I still catch myself judging people or I'll think something bad is happening to me because of Allah's wrath.
I've since become an agnostic though so I don't really think about God much.
It's just hard getting the propaganda out of your head and forming your own thoughts, opinions, and beliefs.
people need to stop thinking that Islam and terrorism are two different things when they are not.
Islam Promotes terrorism and tyrannical governments like the one in Iran.
Women are seen as nothing more than property in Islam, when they are born they are the property of their fathers, and if the father dies they belong to a brother or uncle when the woman gets married the husband owns her.
The thing about most Muslims is that they wouldn't give up on this dumbass religion even if they saw the decisive truth that it's bullsh\t.
The cognitive dissonance is crazy.
