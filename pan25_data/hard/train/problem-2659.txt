I believe Georgia is doing what they need to do so that they do not become a smear on the underside of Russia's boot.
Georgia cannot put up anywhere _near_ the resistance that Ukraine can, so direct or even indirect combat with the Russian military is _suicide_.
When at the beginning of the full-scale war I called on Georgia to help Ukraine, it "in the person of these same individuals kept silent," said Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council.

Gotta love people trying to insist Georgia is just some coward trying to benefit from others sacrifice because they happened to already be occupied by Russia and in no real position to lend any aid.
So the collective west "couldn't have done much" for Georgia at any point during the last 14 years, but Georgia is expected to strong arm Russia without assistance?
