I eat a mix of meat and substitutes, because some things are just easier to eat texture wise if it's a vegan alternative.
I like soy that imitates chicken but not soy that imitates pork, if they can say what it's supposed to imitate then that's good otherwise it's just not going to be helpful the other way around instead?
It should be labeled correctly obviously, but to remove what animal protein it's supposed to substitute from the packaging doesn't make sense either.
Just labeling it as "soy based beef alternative" or something is good, which most substitutes do already.
Yeah, it helps tell you what texture to expect from the meat substitute, actually, so you can plan your dish.
I think they are concerned with a future in which meat substitutes become much more common and increasingly placed nearby real meat.
Elderly, people with poor eyesite, impaired cognition could be at a disadvantage I suppose.
I'd be ok with a huge label saying "NOT MEAT".
If we’re doing this, I propose adding a “no” before the “meat” name for substitutes.
So, plant based “meats” would be NoChicken, NoBeef, NoShrimp, NoBacon etc.
