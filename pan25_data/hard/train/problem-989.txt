Yeah I was gonna say... vaccination is a part of the role to reduce risk of a sickness reducing fighting capacity at a key moment.
As an ex service member…we took all kinds of vaccines so we could do our job and be combat ready.
If you are afraid of vaccines…you’re not fit for the military.
People in the military get so many vaccines.
Way more than civilians.
If not wanting vaccines is an issue, def don't join the military lol.
They vaccinate for things you've never ever heard of.
While I am fully vaccinated, I can both still get and still infect someone.
None of the information we were told has turned out to be true.
I'm holding off on another booster.
My son was a Sargent in the Nation Guard.
There are many in his unit, including him who refused to take the vaccine.
Military's loss for sure.
I respect anyone's decision not to accept these rushed vaccines in their body...my body, my decision remember?
Have to disagree here...there is lots of video featuring Fauci that makes many claims we now know was entirely a lie.
