Of course McCarthy MUST publicly thank Trump.
As speaker McCarthy will continue to suck up to Trump.
The fact that he was voted in is disgusting and indicates exactly where Republicans are.
They did not have the courage to clean it up.
McCarthy - the traitor to democracy that he is - should not be speaker.
I watched right up and to the Jeffries speech and then turned it off before McCarthy came up to the podium.
Instead of legislating, all their time and effort will be put into BS investigations and they'll probably try to impeach Biden one or two times.
Attempts to impeach President Biden for simply being a Democratic president sitting in the White House.
Attempting to hold the US economy hostage by threatening to hold-up a vote on the "debt-ceiling", unless their demands are met.
Hopefully, the people who voted them in will soon realize that all of their pre-midterm bluster about the economy etc was just that ..bluster and bullshit.
They have no intention of working for the American people at all.
Their only plan is to disrupt, obstruct and destroy the economy so that they can blame it all on the Democrats in 2024.
Same old gameplan, just different players at the table..
Control him to what end though?
Those 12 or so hold-outs, seem to have very limited knowledge as to what exact powers that the House of Representatives is limited to: Impeachment, initiation of revenue bills, oversight and investigation, approval for seating a new Vice-President and approval for treaties with foreign nations.
