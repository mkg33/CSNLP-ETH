It was obvious that it would come to this from the get go.
Now Sweden is in a situation where it has military guarantees from all the big players but no responsibility to help NATO if any of its member states get attacked.
Well I am sure the other NATO allies want that guarantee that Sweden would defend them as well.
Join or not the other reasonable NATO allies are already doing as much as they can to protect you.
NATO is useful, no doubt, since it provides framework and structure to a multi nation defensive alliance.
That being said, it isn't the only way to have a defensive alliance with the nations in NATO.
There is the slight clause in NATO that a country can't make agreements that supersede NATO agreements.
And a country entering a war of their own accord can no longer invoke Article 5, if they get invaded in response.
The pattern is maybe worse when _every_ state has veto power, as it's easier to find a minor player willing to be the catspaw.
However, it does negate the Tyranny of the Majority, forcing the actors to actually negotiate.
I may be anthromorphising a bit too much, but politicians are people, and ganging up on an enemy without risking your own neck too much is deep in the human psyche.
