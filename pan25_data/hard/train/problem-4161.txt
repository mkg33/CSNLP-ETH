We should put pregnant women in prison.
Anything less than that is giving them time and opportunity to get an abortion.
Everybody knows all pregnant women want to do is to get an abortion and need to be physically restrained to keep from doing it.
How is it pro-life to not protect pregnant women's ability to access water, seats, etc.
during the workday?
Not having those things threatens your ability to carry a baby to term.
I'm talking about the bill that this thread is about.
I can see why someone would say "Anti choice", because voting against these protections certainly doesn't strike me as pro-life.
Dehydration can lead to early labor, UTIs, and other things that cause major complications with pregnancy.
Being unable to sit down during the workday can lead to extra swelling, premature labor, fatigue... all things that also are not good for either the mother or the baby.
To me, pro-life is a higher standard than anti-choice, and requires that the politician be concerned about policies that actually help people conceive, carry, and support children, physically and economically.
Universal pre-k, universal healthcare, paid family leave... all of these policies are pro-life, but not necessarily anti-choice.
This is just part of an example of how they are not pro life-but rather anti women, anti- personal choice The greed of these peopleâ€¦ as they take holidays, get premium healthcare not just for themselves-but their whole family.
