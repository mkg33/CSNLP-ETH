Read this extremely slowly "India is behaving much better towards Ukraine now than how Ukraine (or any of its supporting nations) behaved towards India when India was attacked".
As I have said in reply to similar comment, you can not treat a country with hostility/indifference (everyone on Ukraine side and Ukraine itself) and ask it to turn to your ally and against someone who actually had friendly relations with India.
It has everything to do Ukraine you cannot treat a country with hostility/indifference for years and expect it to act like a friend because its convenient for you in situation on a dime, you want to avoid this in future maybe start Reciprocating the same.
And while my main annoyance is about western nations haranguing us about our lack of support for Ukraine when they've done much, much worse to us, even Ukraine itself, as I said, supported Pakistan with weapons when they invaded us in 1999.
The truth of the matter is that we've been attacked plenty of times, you just don't care because to reiterate, we're brown people.
Yes, race absolutely is a part of it.
Race is also the reason why the front page of this sub is about Ukraine instead of the wars in Ethiopia or Myanmar which are both just as deadly.
