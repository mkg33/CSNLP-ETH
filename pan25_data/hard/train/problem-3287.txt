There’s likely no upside in Democrats doing anything to bail out the GOP here.
I’d probably be singing a different tune if promises were guaranteed, but they’re not.
It is likely what we're going to get either way.
Again, there is no agreement that must be honored.
It's just their word, and they can just lie.
Dems can choose to help put in a "moderate" and, assuming Republicans even accept that outcome and vote with the Dems to make it happen, once the Speaker is in charge can give Dems the finger and do whatever they want anyway.
I keep saying the Dems should try to do a deal with a moderate Republican for this very reason and everyone just downvotes.
This is politics, you gotta play the game.
Its not about getting concessions.
Its about stopping the terrorists from blackmailing their way onto important committees.
If there had actually been a red wave none of this would be happening because they would have the votes for McCarthy with or without the pro Trump terrorists.
They only have this power because of how close things are.
