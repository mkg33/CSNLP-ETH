Hence the unified application at the same time, and hand-in-hand speech.
Finland will not "betray" Sweden.
After the Second World War Sweden wantws a Nordic defence union, but then Denmark and Norway did favor the Nato solution.
So there was a discution if Sweden would follow Denmark and Norway, but that created the whole problem that Finland might be force to join Warsaw Pact.
A bit historical bacground, Finland was under enormous political pressure from USSR after WW2, and the fear was that Finland would be forced to join Warsaw Pact if Sweden did join NATO.
So Sweden did not join NATO.
Sweden joining NATO is so damn bad for Putin geopolitically lol.
Putinâ€™s such a moron for going into Ukraine.
Sweden was not joining NATO before Russia invaded.
If Russia attacked Finland now, they would face a Finnish Swedish Norwegian army supported by US and UK aircraft and Swedish and Danish navy.
The funny thing is that Sweden and Finland has been safe from russia because of their neutrality towards NATO.
They didn't even want to join NATO.
