Voter turnout for young voters has increased by a lot, but the vote share is still lower than it could be if they were voting at the same rate as older voters.
But the fact that voting rates are continuing to increase among youth is phenomenal.
Turnout for age group 18-29 has gotten really high the previous two elections, compared to the past several decades.
Gen Z and Millenials have had increasing turnouts since each generation came of voting age.
How many elections do you need this to continue before you stop crowing with the same tired nonsense?
And a lot of old people justify a lot of bad strategies and policies based off of "young people don't vote.
".
Kind of upends that bullshit when youth turnout is the highest its been for a midterm in 30 years, so bitterness is to be expected.
It's easy to have the "highest turnout in 30 years" for an age group when that youth age group always has abysmal numbers.
They're still the lowest turnout group and the lowest voter share this election, proving once again the vast majority of young people don't vote.
