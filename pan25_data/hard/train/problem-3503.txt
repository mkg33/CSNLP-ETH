The worst part is that turnout in urban areas (the largest being Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati) decreased from 2018.
Part of the reason is because Trump wasn’t in office to piss people off, but part of it is that Ohioans are being beaten down by an undemocratic system.
Some people start to wonder what the point is.
If we can overwhelmingly pass a constitutional amendment to ban partisan gerrymandering and then they do it anyway and the courts don’t stop them, do we even have a democracy anymore in Ohio?
The plan in Ohio is even more nefarious, though, because people _will_ still get to vote, it just needs to garner 60% or more of the vote if it's to add a constitutional amendment.
So folks will still be able to get these initiatives on a ballot, but given Ohio has swung pretty far right this means more progressive items likely stand little chance of passing.
Literally 40.1% of anyone who shows up to vote for a given issue can tank the will of a pretty damn big majority of Ohioans.
What's worse, though?
Initiatives put forth by the state legislature, which is gerrymandered to fuck to disproportionately favor Republicans, still only need to pass under the 50% + 1 rule.
So for _citizen_ initiatives, those need to garner "broad support", but whatever elected Republican _politicians_ want to put forth would only require a single vote majority to be enacted.
