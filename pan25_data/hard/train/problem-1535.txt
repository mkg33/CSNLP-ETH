I'm not about to give the Swiss any prizes or accolades though.
To this day, they've continued to for the Gepard anti-air tanks they gifted to Ukraine.
Germany bought tens of thousands of shells years ago that Switzerland refuses to allow them to transfer to Ukraine.
So Germany's Rheinmetall has since and will manufacture the Gepard ammunition themselves to give to Ukraine.
They also blocked Denmark from transferring about two dozen Piranha armored personnel carriers to Ukraine.
When the Germans questioned the reliability of Swiss as an arms supplier, they retaliated with a trashy dig at WW2: “German interference in the politics of other countries has never ended in anything good.”.
I don’t care what they did with it, I’m just pointing out that Switzerland wasnt “neutral even against Hitler.” They might not have sent arms; but were the overseas banks for the Nazis which everyone knew was dirty money.
Considering that Switzerland stayed neutral in WW2 even against Hitler himself, that says a lot of how existential a threat they believe Putin's fuckery to be.
