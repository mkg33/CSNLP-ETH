Eventually something will need to be done ( like ASAP) to help Haiti out as it wouldn't be too smart letting it be run by a bunch of insane murderous gangs.
Who knows as I laugh sarcastically to myself and while I think how bad the poverty level and humanitarian crisis is down there.
Plus all the natural disasters they get on top of it.
Those people don't have much of a chance do they?
So what country is it going to be to help them out?
Probably the US, Canada, or even France I'm guessing.
Haiti has been out of control for quite awhile now "decades," but recently it's worse than just uncontrollable pure madness and chaos.
If Haiti had the means to fix the situation from within, I'd be all for non-interventionism, but it's pretty damn clear at this point that the country and its institutions are essentially destroyed.
I don't know if foreign intervention would help, but I'm not sure it'd be actively worse than what's going on right now.
the issues happening now aren't on the haitians and it's unfortunate they're so messed up right now.
the help the haitian people need (other than international aid) is psychological and PTSD treatment.
