It's kind of weird that 2.8 million have fled to Russia.
Wonder why.
Caught behind lines and they can only flee that direction or were they just ethnic Russians living in Ukraine before the war?
Are you an "ethnic Ukrainian" or an "ethnic Russian" if you come from both sides of the border - which is the case for many, many people in Russia and Ukraine?
Relatives.
A lot of Ukrainians have relatives in Russia, seeing that we used to be one country at some point, and after the division the border control and immigration policy were very lax until about 2012-14.
Think like Canada-US interconnectedness, it's about the same - used to be.
Also, "ethnic Russians living in Ukraine" is funny.
They are called Ukrainians.
Don't parrot Putin's propaganda about those mythical "ethnic Russians living in Ukraine" please.
:/.
You miss the point here.
In the border regions + in the eastern part of the country it's a mix because we used to have no borders.
People moved all the time.
Married, had kids.
It's a mixed ethnicity in these parts, and not two separate ethnic groups like most people here think.
We define ourselves by our nationalities because it's near impossible to determine one's "ethnicity", it's blended in MANY cases.
