They really think it came from pragamatuc short term political decisions and not militant labor organizing/ mass movements.
A delusional view of history.

Good then we’re not forcing a shitty deal down the throats of labor or maybe it actually would force republicans to vote for the better provisions.
Either way it’s a win.
By putting pressure on GOP to end rail strike you actually can force the concessions of more sick days instead of simply giving in.
But the reality is democrats care more about short term political aspirations than workers which is what bring a me to point 3.
Because Republicans don’t even pretend to be the party for the unions, while Democrats make it their goal to pretend to be.
Its an interesting dichotomy, but in reality it could pass if only some party wouldn't vote in a block when it gets to the Senate.
So what I am saying is the Dems may have been forced to break the bill up to get republican votes and here we are pointing fingers at the Dems.
I always notice republicans get a pass for their actions.
And what about the other 50 republicans?
Seems you give them the pass.
The Bill is there to vote on.
If the Bill had the sick days in it what would have happened?
Agreed, but then again if you notice the bill passed with the Dem vote and republicans won't pass it.
The vote tossed to the floor for sick leave was an obvious ploy that wouldn't pass.
These are retreating tactics to win some favor for Dems...
