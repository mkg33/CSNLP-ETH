Either Putin dies soon or it's going to escalated.
I see us giving Ukraine some of our Abrams and they are gonna slaughter Russia's troops and armor QUICK.
Putin panics and uses chemical weapons.the politburo in Moscow panics and kills him and hope like hell NATO doesn't respond.
Russia is Trying to use the fact Ukraine doesn't want to strike sovereign Russian soil (they do but it may escalated the conflict).
Here is what i get from your statement, "I really don't give shit about Ukrainians dying as long as Russia is losing".
Ye reality disagrees with you, check any of the hundreds posts about the war and a lot of people are happy that as long as Russia is losing they are happy for the war to continue.
I remember reading way back that this is why the war was going so poorly, nobody was willing to tell Putin that his military wasn't up the scratch, and that Ukraine was ready to rumble.
this is an obvious attempt to run away, call it quits take what he snuck out from under his enemy and pretend because Putins the one who walked away any follow up response from Ukraine would then be considered agitating a world war, which will scare first world countries enough to stop supporting Ukraine.
Sadly just for Putin though, this is a pipe dream and Putin being on the receiving end has only benefited most the world, so this won't be stopping till he's deposed or crippled politically at the very least, he'll say "nuke" a lot though Im sure.
