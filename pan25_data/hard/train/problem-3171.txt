probably because the elderly are still the bulk of our legislative votes & represent their own interests first.
They're still the bulk of our legislature because the 45-64 and 65+ age groups are the ones who turn out in high numbers.
Their interests are more moderate or liberal positions over progressive ones, since the Dem Party is mostly comprised of moderates and liberals.
Compared to the Red Wave that was expected due to political headwinds the Dems faced, this was a pretty historic outcome for a party in power during a midterm.
the dems are likely losing the house majority & barely holding onto the senate, that's not "historic" it's treading water.
Had Dems lost hard this cycle, it would show that the public wasn't in favor of them at all, which would mean an uphill battle to keep the White House even as the incumbent, and a very high chance of Republicans still maintaining the House and Senate (doesn't happen often, but not outside the realms of possibility).
The reason why it isn't just 'treading water' as you put it is because the next election cycle, assuming trends continue and there's no super unexpected shakeup and neither party entirely shoots it's own foot off doing something ridiculously stupid (and it's Democrats, there's always a chance of that happening any day of the week), Dems will be projected keep the Presidency as the incumbent, to retake the House by a decent margin and gain more seats in the Senate.
Then in the follow up midterm they'll have seats to lose while still having an above average possibly of holding the trifecta.
