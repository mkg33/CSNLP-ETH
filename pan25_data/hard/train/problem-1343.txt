The most I do is remove any per-installed app on windows and call it a day.
I've got all the telemetry turned off, but only as deep as the system naturally allows through the set-up menus.
I use windows defender and firewall for security, and all my mobile devices are on a vpn with my house, but that's it.
I still run windows on my daily driver.
Don't even have a dual boot.
I've got a couple laptops I use regularly that are windows also.
I've been using linux since the late 90s.
I use it on literally everything I own except my daily driver.
I run my own home's routers, switches, media and file servers, backup server, smart home server, I even have a home dns server and intranet.
Using salvaged and refurbished hardware for all of it.
It does get worse and worse, I just keep being lazy I guess.
I've fought so so so many battles getting things to work in linux over the years I guess I'm just okay with the minimum bullshit I actually have to deal with on windows anymore.
I'm still on windows 10 and my IT guy did his wizardly ways to get rid of the windows store from my computer and other programs so I don't have to deal with that crap.
I like a clean experience and might even switch to Unix because it's gets worse and worse.
Someone did give me a raspberry pi that's inside of a keyboard but I have not yet had time to take out of the box and set it up.
I might make a suitcase computer if I can find the right screen.
