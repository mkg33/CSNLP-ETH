Address the "deal" aspect of this directly.
Again, it's the normal thing to drop out and endorse the frontrunner when you're losing.
Every other primary candidate did so.
So what do you think happened?
So, what exactly do you think happened?
This is now the third time asking you, which is about three times more than should be necessary if you're so confident in the idea of a "deal" lmao.
It's so weird that people think there was some kind of "deal" between Buttigieg and Biden, as if there's something odd about dropping out and endorsing the frontrunner when you're losing.
An endorsement by a candidate who's dropping out of the race doesn't guarantee any substantial number of their voters will be swayed.
That might have worked 50 years ago, but much less so today.
Especially when it's a little known and inexperienced politician endorsing is a former VP.
Pete Buttigieg was no Teddy Kennedy and Biden was already the most known and most experienced candidate in the field.
This wasn't a situation where Buttigieg had any real leverage.
I don't think it was actually that obvious buttigieg would lose.
If Biden didn't catch he'd probably have the centrist lane.
It was a longshot bid but not doomed to fail.
