After the tiny man loses, Iâ€™m sure Ukraine is going to sign some documents allowing US military bases into the country both for defense purposes and for training purposes.
The US should also thank Ukraine for providing evidence of how well this equipment works in battlefield conditions without US soldiers needing to die in the process.
We need to thank Ukraine for proving that our weapons work well in actual battlefield condition unlike some Russian weapons that turned to be more of a joke.
We're not battle proven in Ukraine they were battle-proven elsewhere by US soldiers fighting around the world.
We currently use Bradley fighting vehicle as well.
M2 M3 How do you think we know how much help they are to Ukraine.
The US is one of the biggest arms dealers on this planet.
Ukraine is just most recent recipient.
They are doing a hell of a job too.
Those people are fighting for their country.
We probably wouldn't care if it wasn't Russia they were fighting.
This way Ukraine fights Russia for us.
Weakening them on world stage.
Marketing.
No that's not why this is done It's a puppet war.
Unfortunately Ukraine is the puppet right now defeating Russia using us arms .
Not a bad deal for US.
Plus we get paid.
Idk you can use any terminology you like.
But if the strings got cut.
Ukraine would be screwed.
Nobody said the victims aren't real.
However this situation is Ukraine fighting Russia which they couldn't do without all this weaponry Intel and various forms of aid.
Those are strings holding up Ukraine.
The US is always fighting somewhere.
There's a good reason for that.
We keep battle hardened troops our weapons tested.
Bradley fighting vehicle are not new weapons to the US.
Neither were those bomb kits or the himars or anything else we send them.
