Veto rules don't work when there are bad actors on the council.
It doesn't work in the UN, it doesn't work in NATO.
If going forward, the eligibility of new NATO members rides solely on the political decisions of Turkey and Hungry then either they need to go or a rule change needs to be made that a 3/4 or 4/5 majority vote is sufficient to ratify new members.
They should change the NATO rules to make it a 90% vote that is need to ratify the members, not a unanimous vote.
Only 28/30 nations would need to vote for Finland and Sweden.
And I thought Turkiye want to let Finland in but Sweden not.
Why Finland insist to join Nato together with Sweden.
If they join before Sweden, they definitely inditectly protect Sweden byba lot anyway.
Albeit, not to mention Turkish- and Hungarian governments are pricks who may not hold what they say anyway, but still.
But is continuing to hold out on that actually still popular with the people of Turkey?
They have blocked access to the Black Sea, and openly supplied Ukraine with powerful drones.
Why would his people cheer for him to continue dragging out a powerful NATO expansion at this point?
What I don't get is why blocking NATO memberships to powerful allies is winning him points in his election campaign.
I understood him wanting to milk it for as much as he could, and force them to make concessions.
Flex his ability to affect international affairs while it is at its strongest.
