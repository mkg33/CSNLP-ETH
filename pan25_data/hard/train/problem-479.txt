It's not quite as stupid as that but then it becomes much more stupid than that.
The reason they're asking for money now is because they're ending their free streaming which DirecTV says invalidates any claims that it's DirecTV that's reducing accessability to Newsmax content.
Right now, DirectTV pays $0 to Newsmax, but DirectTV also does not require any advertising time and lets Newsmax offer its streaming services as well.
Although the specific amounts are not public, Newsmax wants DirectTV to PAY newsmax, for the privledge of carrying the channel.
So newsmax is essentially demanding that directv pay them for their channel, despite still not having the viewer numbers to justify any fee at all.
And when directv said no, newsmax literally cried to the republican congress members to ”make them pay us!”.
Basically newsmax new republicans would support them so they demanded more money, it’s a shakedown.
If I were direct tv I would say “fine, but you are no longer part of our bundles, instead you are a premium channel like HBO that people have to separately ask and pay for”.
