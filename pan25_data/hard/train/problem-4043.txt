I am just realizing that the whole war will be a slapstick comedy show one day.
Putin being surrounded by yes-men who occasionally and randomly fall out of windows, troops that get to read super old maps that still show funny archaic landmarks, guns just breaking at the most inopportune moments, people surrendering to child's toy drones.. it's all just so absurd.
Months ago I made a comment about untrained Russian soldiers looking up "How to fire a bazooka" on a smartphone and then getting blown up by a tank while the Youtube ads were still playing.
One of the weirdest thing about this has been the cases of soldiers sending photos of KIA enemy soldiers to their families over IM so that the Russians cannot pretend that they didn't die in combat.
It came up a LOT during the early days of COVID.
There were initial calls to have the national guard set up treatment and testing centers, but then people realized that those soldiers didn't pop out of thin air and all they would be doing is pulling active medical personnel off the front lines.
It wasn't even a one-time thing.
He was a Washinon State National Guard soldier who had at one point been sent to Ukraine to train soldiers there on the use of the Javelin.
He gave them his contact info and once the war broke out he was getting regular questions and resolving multiple issues, the guys he was helping would later respond with photos of the tanks they killed with his advice.
