This is the part that kills me about these nut jobs.
There are many Nazis, Nazi sympathizers, white supremacists, etc in our very own government at every single level and yet they are totally fine with it.
But a few shit stains in Ukraine who are Nazis are justification for a full scale invasion?
If that's the case then the rest of the world should be invading the US to denazify our country too.
It's not like the Russia is going to invade the US.
Should those bombs only stay in storage for when we want to start a pointless war?
They're literally stripping nuclear missiles of their warheads and using them as decoys to try and get past Ukrainian air defense.
Seems like a very cheap way to make the US safer compared to the trillions of dollars that have been pissed away on defending nothing.
Russia and China are the only credible military threat to the US and supporting Ukraine very effectively reduces one half of that threat.
If there was ever a defense for spending TRILLIONS on US defense, then 40 billion to defend one of our allies against one of our biggest threats is an absolute bargain.
They're already down to stripping nuclear missiles of their warheads to fire as dummies to fool Ukrainian air defense.
Every nuke capable missile they fire at Ukraine is one they no longer have to fire at us.
Not to mention Russia is one of the only actual geo-political threats to the US, so any spending that helps degrade their offense capability helps make the US safer.
Russia is suddenly more paper than tiger and China has to be rethinking their own capabilities considering their corruption and military budget relative to the US.
