As an American, I feel weird reading some comment in this thread of Canadians wanting to flee Canada for the US due to high living cost and low wages.
All the while reading about Americans complaining about the US wanting to flee to Canada.
Well Canadians wanting to leave for the US is more of a brain drain thing.
Far better pay, vastly more opportunity in terms of relocation, and better living conditions.
For example a doctor in Toronto can afford to purchase a condo, maybe a townhouse.
That same doctor can move to Texas, get paid significantly more, and buy a 4 bedroom house with like three cars for the same cost of living.
And on top of that, if you don't like one of the many major cities in Texas, just move to another state with equivalently sized cities that offer the same lifestyle.
This is not a thing in Canada; if you're in one of our major cities, you have 3-4 other places you can move for an equivalent lifestyle.
Aside from that, there's 3 main areas where immigrants go and they are: Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal and Calgary.
Personally I'm looking to immigrate back to Europe (born there and immigrated to Canada in the early 2000s) and give there ago.
Might not be any better, could be worse, could be better but atleast its a change.
I'll have to work out my options, again could be better or could be worse.
I just want to try something different some where else.
