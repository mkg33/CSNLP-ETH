There will be no nuclear war.
Russia has fucked this to the point China wants an end before Japan and the US become too prepared for war in tge South Pacific.
I think China expects Ukraine to reject this plan and they will then use it to justify arming Russia.
I think Ukraine should accept it for the simple fact that it has terms in it, that Putin will never accept (reinstating Ukraines borders to where they were in 1991) Vladimir Putin cannot accept, so I believe it would be wise for Ukraine to accept and let Russia be the one refusing peace.
This could be crucial in keeping Chinese arms out of Russian hands, let Putin be on the outs with the CCP.
Ukraine's independence was recognized by the international community following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Ukraine declared its independence on August 24, 1991, and was subsequently admitted as a member state of the United Nations on March 2, 1992.
Since then, Ukraine has actively participated in the work of the UN and its various specialized agencies, programs, and funds.
To respect the UN charter you have to respect Ukrainian borders as they were when Ukraine was admitted to the UN.
Technically Ukraine, as the Ukrainian SSR, was a founding member of the UN.
The same applies to Belarus.
Of course the vote was determined by the USSR, effectively giving the USSR three votes.
The Russian SSR didn't have a separate vote.
The other SSRs did become new UN member states after the dissolution of the USSR.
