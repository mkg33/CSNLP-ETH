I don't think voting should be mandatory for people who don't want to vote.
But it should definitely be made a federal holiday.
It's the one single holiday that could actually serve the country and for some reason the U.S. just ignored it.
I think that's a fantasy.
People who vote barely have a clue what is going on, people who don't vote are going to have even less of a clue.
I'd bet Republicans would get even more votes under such a system, especially in midwestern and southern states where a lot of people just don't want to hear about politics.
Unfortunately I don't believe there is anything to say that making it easier to vote would make any actual difference.
I think a lot of smart people don't vote, because they understand the mathematical insignificance of their one vote.
They think, "why should I waste half a day standing line to vote when my one vote won't decide the outcome?
".
Well, yea.
Trump was sexually assaulting other women.
Abortion rights impacted them directly.
The R ethos is full on "fuck you, I got mine".
