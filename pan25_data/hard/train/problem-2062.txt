History usually involves learning about world history as well.
It's actually disheartening that you didn't learn about other countries outside of Europe in school.
We don't even learn about that shit in Europe and I doubt you learn about that stuff anywhere in the world exept the middle east.
History normaly only teaches things your country was involved in or the region that is now your country.
As an example I am Austrian we learned all about medevil Europe espacily about the continent nothing about the Mongols or Britain we also learned nothing about China or Africa we than moved on to talk about 3 years of our 4 years history about ww 1 and ww 2 over and over and over again.
I imagine it is like that everywhere like Americans will probably learn over and over and over again about the American Civil War and Japanese people about sengokushidie.
Oh we did atleast a bit but not in history most if my school knowledge about other continents cultures and countries outside of Europe comes from my geography/econimy not history class.
We learned a lot about North America espacily the usa as an example diffrent places like the rust belt the great plains we learned about the economic system and the red scare.
We also learned about Japan and their culture stuff like their school system their economy and how strict they are over there.
We also did a lot on Australia we did the least amount of stuff about Africa mainly geography like names of rivers and mountain ranges.
But we mainly focused on the trade triade of Europe the US and Japan as they are the 3 biggest economic factors of the time approximately 2012.
So we learned quite a bit about diffrent places but a lot of history more like how it is now.
In Austria we also spend a lot of time with the Habsburg monarchy line a lot of unnecessary time just learning about what lands we had how we lost them how we gained new ones and so on.
