Fortunately, all the qualities that would make him a more effective Trump also make him less attractive to Trump’s base.
DeSantis will be very dangerous if he gets elected but I don’t think his success in Florida is going to translate to the presidential election.
That is actually my greatest concern for this next election cycle: that the world is so focused on making sure that Trump doesn't get elected that we end up ignoring Desantis and he gets elected.
I think he is actually far more frightening than Trump, because his policies are essentially the same but he has the backing of the mainstream party.
On top of that, he's not as outrageous or obviously a criminal con-man, so he won't turn off enough voters to torpedo himself.
Either way he’s being sold as the acceptable face of the GOP, so he is not near as toxic to centrists as Trump, charisma or no, record or no.
And that should be a huge warning.
For all the resources Fox etc.
devoted to defeating Obama, Romney and McCain were clearly closer to the center than the vast majority of their voting base.
Thus their act rang hollow, and we didn’t start seeing the full effect of all that extreme propaganda until Donny started winning primaries.
It is just very, very easy for me to envision Ron D capturing enough of those activated fascist voters, plus mollified moderates and never-Trumpers, to offset any full-on Trump diehards who decide to sit out the general.
Combine that third with the third that are "swing voters" who don't have any strong opposition to fascism, they just want more money, and you have a recipe for some talented wannabe dictator to come along and push a teetering country over the edge.
