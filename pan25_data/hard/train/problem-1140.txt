Edited a bit for accuracy.
Not for you, but for others who may not have seen the videos.
They may have misinterpreted the "ridiculous shooting" part and thought it was the actions of the Ukrainians that was what you were calling ridiculous, not the war crime of the one russian soldier that got the rest of the russians killed.
This obviously isn’t the case, and as soon that man opened fire, Ukrainians had full authority to kill every single one of them.
Prisoners can only be taken once the enemy decides to fully surrender.
There’s a bunch of the prisoners laying down on the ground surrendering, and then there’s another guy who CLEARLY lifts up his rifle and starts firing at the camera man, or someone near by.
It might be able to prevent the ridiculous shooting that happened yesterday or the day before.
That guy ended up getting all the other men killed because of his actions.
Once that last guy decided he wasn’t going to be taken prisoner, he immediately got all of they other men killed.
Russia is going to spin this that Ukrainians are desperate/disgusting people and murder POWs.
Soldiers cannot be lowering their weapons in the middle of the battle to “guess and choose” which enemy has surrendered and which ones are still fighting.
If bullets are flying, it is still and combat zone.
No POWS will be taken despite them trying to.
