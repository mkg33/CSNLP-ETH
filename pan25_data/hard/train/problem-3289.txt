When NATO changes the charter it was founded in.
Under article 10 it limits to only nations with land in Europe joining after its founding (Canada and Us are exception).
The actual important part is that the treaty says new members have to be European, meaning not even countries like Mexico could join even if they wanted.
Canada and the US "gets around this" by being founding members.
That said, yes Russia could theoretically join NATO.
I doubt it'll ever happen though, since it's the reason NATO exists in the first place (unless it truly does become a proper democracy and another country like China becomes the new "main threat" for Europe).
It's highly unlikely that you'd get unanimous political agreement for Japanese membership in NATO and it's highly unlikely that Japan would want to join NATO.
Which is to say if the unanimous political will is there, changing the charter is no problem at all, and if it isn't, it's not the charter change that prevents an accession.
But if the political will were there, the geographical restrictions of the original 1949 NATO Treaty text would be entirely irrelevant.
