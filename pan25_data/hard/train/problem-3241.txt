I am not surprised that Putin is capable of slipping and having accidents at home; I am surprised that this news was allowed to spread beyond Putin's household.
EDIT: also it’s a bit of a stretch to claim that only a very small amount of conservatives love Putin.
They cheered for his name at CPAC and other events.
The most popular conservative news channel in America is frequently praising and defending him, with one going as far as saying that they are “rooting for” him.
Claiming it’s only a minority of the party is damage control PR messaging at best, a flat out lie to cover for their support at worst.
The problem with that line of argument is that those same conservatives that point to those problems as why we shouldn’t help Ukraine, will then turn around and vote against doing anything to address any of those problems.
Very small amount of conservatives like Putin, most just don’t think Ukraine is our problem or responsibility to deal with.
We have a failing school system, crumbling roads and other forms of infrastructure, and enough problems here that a.
Lot of conservatives don’t think we should waste money on other countries.
I absolutely think we should cut the militaries budget by a massive degree.
Also for bases in allied countries don’t bring the gear home, sell it to them to avoid shipping costs when possible.
Shop class is way more dangerous and needing of qualification to teach that gym class imo, I think the role you’re putting on gym class should just be health/sex Ed classes jobs.
Gym coach imo just needs a good understanding of first aid/CPR, and to understand proper exercise forms.
