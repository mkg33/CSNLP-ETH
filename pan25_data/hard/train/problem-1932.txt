People I encounter in Washinon are genuinely nice people.
It weirded me out for the first couple years I was here, I always assumed they were being backhanded or had an angle.
I had to learn to stop asking people "how're you?"
because they'll tell me about everything going on in their life instead of just the typical "good n'you?
".
Yeah, I have to explain to people all the time that "southern hospitality" isn't what you think it is.
People in the south aren't genuinely nice people, they're fakely nice cause they think they'll go to hell if they don't pretend to be good people.
It's fucking awful.
That's where you get the passive aggressive "bless your heart" bullshit.
As someone that grew up in the south and moved out here to the PNW a few years ago I've had the opposite experience.
I've found people here to be more genuinely friendly than anywhere else I've been, almost intrusively so.
On the surface, yes, they're not very friendly.
But everyone's the same once you get the know them.
I grew up in Arkansas, where the people are super friendly, but more likely to be just faking it.
