I find this very fascinating.
Im from the Baltics, and as you may have heard ''we allegedly hate Russians here''.
On the other hand there are the rest of Russians and Belorussians and ‘stans etc folks who have hated commies and Putin for a loooong time, with some folks in between.
It’s hard to put exact percentages on this.
But I’d say it’s 30/30/40 where 30 are for, 30 unsure and 40 against.
When everyone is quiet, it looks like a majority supports it with 60% all singing propaganda out loud and rest quiet but it can flip in a flick of a dime once the 30% “unsure” swing their opinion.
So basically I am optimistic that a lot of these brainwashed folks will self select themselves into a meat grinder, Putin will literally keep sending men to no end which will deplete that segment and once enough Russians die, the other 30% will flip and all of the sudden 70% will turn against war and Putin.
I just don’t know what will happen with Putin himself or how he will be removed.
Worst that can happen is him being replaced with another sleeper agent which will continue this.
Sobchak comes to mind here.
If Ukraine (or any other country) wasn’t suffering, I’d be happy about this Russian house cleaning that’s been long overdue.
But as is, the world, and especially Russia, will owe Ukrainians immense debt with basically finishing the Soviet Union and people willing or weak or stupid enough to die for it or it’s echoes….
There may have been plans to do this after Russia took over Ukraine but they fucked it up so massively they most likely don’t have the equipment and troops to even think about it anymore.
So in the present and near-ish future this true.
Of course it helps that Lukashenko kisses Putin’s ass at every turn, unlike Ukraine who was trying to move out of Russia’s influence and become more a part of Europe.
Who honestly takes Putin’s statements seriously anymore anyway?
