That would certainly be better, but there are still people for whom that would mean very little.
A billionaire, for instance, could easily afford a million dollar fine.
Percentages aren’t inheritabtly equitable either.
Losing say, 10% of your daily wage has a much bigger impact on someone who doesn’t have much to begin with.
I think you need to reread my comments.
I’m aware that’s the punishment everyone receives.
I’m arguing for a change that’s more equitable and actually has some consequence for those that have so much money that fines don’t mean anything.
Not to say that punishment shouldn't be equitable - any person making more money should face bigger fine totals than a poorer person.
I think that it should probably carry some kind of points based penalty on your license as some kind of meaningful punishment that isn't just the taxman coming to bump his take.
I'd add that the police do have some discretion if they believe there is a public good to not give a fine.
It's fineable offense, I'm not sure that taking it any further is fair?
He already looks silly for it anyway and carries more of a political penalty than legal.
