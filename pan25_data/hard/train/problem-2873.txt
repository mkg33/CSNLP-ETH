It is so ironic that the Republican and Democratic electorates are pointing fingers at each other each blaming the other side for raising ridiculous divisive and sometimes petty issues to distract each other from the real threat which both sides agree is the elite class, but in blaming each other for it, they are participating in the very thing they are complaining about.
It’s not just normalizing it: they are helping support the false narrative that the right is just a political party we disagree with sometimes and things are really just business as usual.
They’re not and it’s not and fuck suggestions to the contrary.
EXACTLY.
They are knowingly pretending that this is the result of some sort of ignorance or confusion on the Republican’s part, rather than the hate and racism it actually represents, and that they know full well it represents.
Ever line of dialog the left deliveres in the stage play that is “United States is a Functioning Democracy that Just Has Political Disagreements” is them acting as “good cop” on the side of the fascist Republicans.
