To the sound of an air raid alert, Biden paid tribute to the memory of the fallen defenders of Ukraine.
Edit: OMG, I just saw that Biden and Zelenskyy walked out under air raid alarms to lay a wreath at the Wall of Remembrance.
How badass can you get?
I saw tweets earlier talking about how downtown Kyiv was blocked off, and there was a ton of traffic, and everyone was wondering who might be visiting that was that important.
PM Meloni was scheduled to visit Kyiv today, so a lot of people thought it was for her, but the security seemed excessive.
There were a few people who wondered if it was Biden, but no one seemed to really believe it.
Biden's visit underscores so many things but, just to think about how Fox news and MAGAts said Biden was too old and feeble to be President.
I wonder if Meloni's and Biden's visits were coordinated, to provide cover for the increased security so Biden could sneak in.
Deputy Foreign Minister Andriy Melnyk: "A surprise is being prepared in Kyiv in connection with the visit of high-ranking foreign guests"........ Getting real likely it's Biden.
