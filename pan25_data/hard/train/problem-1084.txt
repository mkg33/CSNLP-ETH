It'd be like if a "potentially allied" nation said you could join the club only if you changed your laws to be convenient to specifically them and only then will you get their necessary vote.
Your nations democracy is being violated and extorted, "the people will" overturned in their own country by a foreign government.
That sets a dangerous precedent for its peoples right to self govern and also a very dangerous precedent going forward for NATO itself and any nations seeking to join.
I want my country and Finland to join NATO, but I don't want this to happen by sacrificing our democracy and disrespecting human rights.
I want more of Scandinavia in NATO, but I don't want it badly enough to go along with sending 130 political prisoners to their deaths at the hands of sultan-wannabe Erdogan.
Since the number of countries that want us in NATO far outnumber those that don't, they should come to some kind of agreement eventually.
If not we will just continue without NATO like we always have, now with the added benefit of defense guarantees from the UK and US.
Exactly, in the end Turkey is destroying NATO's reputation.
We had Stoltenberg and the leaders of other NATO countries assure us that joining NATO would be easy and quick and that they would welcome us with open arms.
Now it's clear this is an alliance where the members hate each other and rather than communicating, they'd rather backstab and sabotage for each other.
Makes you wonder how much Article 5 would actually matter if it came to that.
Would Turkey really send all they have to defend Sweden, or Greece for that matter...
