But the reality is they are just threatening them because both of their conventional deterrents aren’t effective as proven by Russias war and North Korea’s army being stuck in the 60’s.
The reality is with North Korea is that China needs a buffer state to keep US military bases anyway from its border and a United Korea would pose a threat to China in the future so I don’t even think China would let North Korea go to war because the North would be crushed by the US South Korea and Japan and plus it keeps fear spreading in the west that rocket man “might” nuke the US.
Kim is like one of those kids in school that constantly acts up to get everyone’s attention plus Kim isn’t very happy that the Government in South Korea is going to be getting some fancy new drones whilst the Norths are less powerful than a toaster.
The Russians and the North Koreans just like to scare people with their nuclear weapons.
Putin is doing it to basically say hey stop giving Ukraine weapons and let me destroy my neighbour and Rocket man is just doing it purely for attention going “hey everyone I’ve got missiles and nukes to Please be afraid of me”.
I think they’re actually just idiots wasting what Putin gave them in exchange for those artillery shells that literally every intelligence agency on Earth saw N.Korea give the Russians (via giant damn trains), but which they both deny ever happened.
Putin has probably been giving him the rockets to distract from Ukraine too, this is why he’s stoking a fire in Serbia-Kosovo too.
He thinks he’s smart, but no one gives a toss about N.Korea, the annoying Chihuahua of the world.
