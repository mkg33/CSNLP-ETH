They've still got some of the money Putin bribed them with for the 2018 edition in their bank accounts... What else did you expect from FIFA?
This was a pro move on Zelensky's part because Russia had to spend cash to bribe the FIFA officials, in a time where they are low on resources.
Yeah, that's how FIFA gets away with its rampant corruption and HR abuses, because people "dont wanna see the ouchies and jus' wanna watch sum futball".
I would bet actual money that the real reason they're not doing a fifa game is because someone pointed out they could still sell soccer games without needing to pay fifa a licencing fee, so bigger profit.
There were a few people who were looking into that behaviour several years ago, after a previous fifa fuck around and the attitude of the fans was likened to religious zealots, don't really care whats happening or who's in charge provided the matches happen.
Ahh, I saw they weren't making another fifa game and stupidly thought that must mean they weren't doing a soccer game for a few years.
To be fair to the other sports orgs, they also usually have some concern for the sport too, but that I mean as something other than a vehicle to get money.
