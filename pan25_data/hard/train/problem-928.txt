The big benefits are that the BBC can air 24x7 with no adverts at all.
They have a fuck-ton of income that they can use to make programs that are interesting, without having to consider whether or not they're going to be a commercial success.
And then they can make more money by selling the international distribution rights for their shows.
And, the BBC can produce a news service that is not as subject to money-bought bias like commercial news networks are.
The UK broadcast watchdogs also require news broadcasters to be impartial, which is nice.
Not just the BBC, either, Channel 4 is also partly funded by the TV licensing, even though they do have adverts.
Not sure about ITV or Channel 5, etc.
What does that have to do with the BBC?
The BBC is the brush broadcasting corporation they didn't go round colonising those regions.
Why do you think teams are playing?
It's thw world Cup it's a once in a life time chance for a lot of the players.
They aren't going to miss it so some people on the Internet can pretend they care for a month and than forget the issue as soon as the competition is over.
The issue is places like reddit didn't care one bit until a week before than everyone actslike they cared all along and are outraged by it.
Also you do know like every country has some dark shit they did to their own people or other people.
So if your say look at your own history you could say that to every country as what country is actually innocent?
