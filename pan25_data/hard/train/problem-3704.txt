I think there’s people in leadership positions, within world governments that also have this mentality.
Which leads me to believe many of these warmonger keyboard warriors are probably paid shills or bots, echoing thoughts of these pundits.
I would be unsurprised if this actually was a Russian missile.
Their low-tech equipment would allow this margin of error..
Although, there could be debris with a Russian flag and video footage seconds before blowing up, and I’d hope world leaders would still deny Russian origin.
I’m not saying it is absolutely a Russian missile, just that, what has been stated is literally the only sane and reasonable answer.
It makes sense that Ukraine is using these missiles, considering Russia is technically Ukraines largesr international supplier of weapons, by capturing them.
Claim that Ukraine deliberately sabotaged the air defense system that they got from Russia to make Russia look bad and encourage the west to deliver better systems.
This is something a lot of people here don’t get or completely switch side to blaming Ukrainians rather the missiles that the Russia launched that lead to this incident.
They may call other warmongers, but I bet they are the first one to switch to the enemy if enemies even promise somewhat better living conditions then their fellow countrymen being oppressed.
