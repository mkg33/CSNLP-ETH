I like him and could see it as a great foil to the GOP targeting LGBTQ.
I also think Newsom would be a great foil to DeSantis...They just need to start propping someup ASAP.
Exactly.
We need to hurry the fuck up and start putting our support behind someone who can win and we don't even know who that person is...I mean at Biden's age he could go at any time (you just never know).
I'm more than ok who is the best for the job but I think it'd be great to have someone diverse leading White House again that's all.
I also think we need to find someone to rally all Democrats.
We've had plenty of White Presidents..Hey it'd be amazing if we could finally have a female president but TBD.
But yes regardless of race or gender, we need to find someone ASAP!
Democrats need to pull it together and figure out who the fuck they're going to get behind because the GOP is gearing up to be fully behind DeSantis.
With the latest Biden news and his age he is a toss up.
If not Biden then who?
I don’t think Biden can win.
His narrative is set, and his age an inability to articulate well wouldn’t stand up to a serious challenger.
Trump lost the 2020 election more than Biden won it.
