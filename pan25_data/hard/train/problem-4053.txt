Israel is a military powerhouse, and yet is refusing to raise their hand to defend a Nation they have deep ties to.
America wouldn't just be giving money to Israel for the fun of it and it would be much more cost.
For example it would damage their information gathering capabilities in the middle east.
I genuinely think a lot of people don't understand how complicated international politics is.
There is a lot of reasons why it is in America's interest to have good relations with Israel.
Also the fact that Russia has a reasonable large Jewish population and ties with Israel.
I'm not saying I don't think Israel should not help more, but there are definitely well documents reasons they want to be an intermediary between both sides.
I think people don't realise how complicated international politics actually is.
In the UK people always complain about foreign aid like it's just giving money away.
It's not, it's a means of buying favour with other countries which often involves them reinvesting a certain amount back with you (say through service contracts or buying weapons from you).
