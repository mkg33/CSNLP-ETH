That kind of shit makes me wonder how much a line they walk or if they're completely honest with us.
We already know they don't report on the Economy in a truthful way already cause they're corporate owned.
They're definitely capable of dishonesty.
I'm not saying they don't report the numbers.
But they always ask the wrong questions and never give enough of a platform (if at all) to actual working class Americans and what they think.

";.
I keep hearing this.
Fact is if aliens fly here, our petty problems won't mean anything when we're enslaved or eradicated.
They aren't being shot down by our planes when they have interstellar capability.
I get what you mean - any hypothetical interstellar travelers probably wouldn't be shot down easily by an F-16 - but you can't just say 'the US can't shoot down UFOs.'
This was by definition a UFO shot down by the US, as it was an object that was unidentified and flying.
