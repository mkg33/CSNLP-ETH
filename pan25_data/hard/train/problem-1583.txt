My older sis and I were on a hunt.
We left camp and went up a steep hill to look at the valley below.
We sat in the side hill, about 10-15 feet between us.
I was 12, she was a year older.
As we scanned the woods below us, I looked over at her and was literally looking down the barrel of her 30.06.
I scooted back (up) the hill and told her I didn’t like staring down the barrel.
A minute later, or sooner, the gun went off.
It left a purple bruise on the inside of my sister’s thigh, where the butt of the gun had been resting.
Had I not scooted back, she’d have blown my head off.
She became hysterical when she realized how close she came to killing me.
She had been unconsciously playing with the trigger, and actually pulled it without meaning to.
Kids should have a little more training than a Hunters Safety Course gives.
Maybe a video of gun accidents should be shown.
It could save lives, since Missouri is going to have kids with guns roaming around.
I’m a Democrat and the only thing I want out of the gun legislation is NO ASSAULT WEAPONS!
Insanity in that state.
School and guns don’t have a good history.
The only ones armed should be police and school security guards (hopefully former cops or current cops working part time at a second job.
).
True.
It’s always up to the courts.
Which is up to the politicians.
Which ultimately, to a point, is up to the people though.
That is my point.
Op said they aren't protected right for kid which on a purely factual basis isn't the case at this time.
This law could over turn the laws we do have in place.
