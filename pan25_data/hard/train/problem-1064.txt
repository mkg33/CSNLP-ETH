Election denialism, Qmadness etc is a similar motion in that it's an appeal to the evil & insane instincts of their most extreme consituents, but it certainly isn't the strategy crafted by Lee Atwater.
Edit: If we're saying that the southern strategy is finally blowing up in the GOP's face as a whole by incentivising extreme political positions 50+ years after it was deployed, I got a feeling they'll take the 8+ presidential terms and supreme court majority they've won in the meantime.
And for the record I dont view going from McCarthy to Scalise as some giant tragedy.
They are debasing themselves before the nation.
If you stuggle to find a majority in the house youre powerless, and obviously they're going to.
It's going to effect that way gridlock plays over the next term, and that's the only thing they know how to do.
Curious why you view it that way.
All of the GOP is hopelessly fused with the southern strategy.
Dogwhistling is not what differentiates the Freedom Caucus clown car from establishment guys like McCarthy.
They all do that.
That is the point.
Humiliation, hypocrisy or irony DO NOT EXIST to fascists.
They simply want to destroy our democratic institutions in any way they can.
