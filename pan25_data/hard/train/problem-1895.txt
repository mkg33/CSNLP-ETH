Not just that & the whole US approval issue, Patriot batteries stationed in Poland will actually survive the war.
For one reason because the deal was that the german patriot battery is deployed in Poland.
That means German soldiers.
Germany is not going to station soldiers in Ukraine.
That would mean entering the war.
Start a war?
The war is already going on.
German military units defending against missile attacks in western Ukraine will mean direct involvement but it's defensive in nature and won't be in the vicinity of Russian territory at all.
And you think the radars, missiles and launchers of the IRIS-T SLM system provided to Ukraine don't contain sensitive technology?
It's arguably the most modern system there is in its class.
And it's Ukrainians that are operating them, not Germans.
I don't care about internal Polish politics, yes I acknowledge they're populist assholes, but so what?
If Germany can send air defense units to the border of Poland to shoot down Russian missiles it can do the same in western Ukraine.
This was NATO troop assistance for a NATO ally asking for protection, its as if Poland would say to the US they dont need their F-35 patrolling Poland an they should fly to Ukraine.
