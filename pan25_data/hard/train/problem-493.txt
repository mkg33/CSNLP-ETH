If Ukraine retakes Nova Khakova and Kherson in the next few hours/days, that puts them in a really good position for the coming winter, since they can cut Crimea's water off and shell the mobiks manning the east bank defensive lines.
If Ukraine liberates the entire Kherson region and disables the Crimean bridge, I canâ€™t see how Russia could defend Crimea.
Ukraine doesnâ€™t need to start with an amphibian assault which would cost many lives.
They can bomb the shit out of Crimea first.
The north of Crimea is well within range of Ukrainian weapons once they retake the south of Kherson.
"Kherson returns to the control of Ukraine, units of the Armed Forces enter the city.
The retreat routes of the Russian occupiers are under fire control of the Ukrainian army."
- Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine.
"I'm sorry but today I can't stop.
There will be many tweets.
I'm filled with emotions.
So happy!ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦".
"Police officers who mobilized to Ukrainian Army, raise Ukrainian flag over the building of Kherson police - they had to leave it on 24th February.
".
Ah yes.
Soon enough the Russians will make a tactical retreat off Ukrainian territory leaving the Ukrainians to their own fate.
How devious, how strategically brilliant.
