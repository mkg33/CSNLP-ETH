its a weird relationship when you consider modern vietnam also wouldnt exist without the CCP‚Äôs help in fighting back America and France.
holy shit you are really terminally online to write whataboutism to a sarcastic remark on vietnamese people's prejudice.
If you're indeed a Vietnamese (which I have gigantic doubt about) then perhap we could setup a real debate.
Come to ƒê√† N·∫µng/ Qu·∫£ng Nam and I will show you what's true.
Phuc was my neighbor.
I knew him since he was still a manager of a small hotel in H·∫£i Ch√¢u, ƒê√† N·∫µng.
I knew all of his scandals and corruptions at that time period too.
I will not bother to elaborate to someone who started the conversation by accusing me of living oversea and out of touch.
You're either implying that I'm "ƒëu c√†ng ba s·ªçc" - political refugee or "ph·∫£n ƒë·ªông" - anti state.
This is the common tactic of a commie bot.
I did a quick scrolling through your comment history and found nothing to prove you're my countryman.
No comment made in Vietnamese.
No activity in Vietnamese sub.
Yet you claimed coming from üáªüá≥.
Typical tactic of Chinese's bot.
Vietnam's communist party operating in very close proximity with the CCP, of course they're quick in obtaining Chinese's intelligent.
The rest of the world was blinded by CCP's censorship, hence their quick reaction in the first wave of Covid was due to them having more information than anyone else.
They couldn't afforded to follow the CCP's footprint for long however.
It turned out that shutting down your own logistic was much more costly and damaging than they anticipated.
