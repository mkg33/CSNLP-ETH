That was truly one of the moments that won't go down to well in the history books, you could probably make a montage of Obama saying exactly the same thing year after year but Europeans laughing at something that was so close to happening.
Oof that's not the best sign of unity, doesn't Europe deserve a bit of the blame for not maintaining their military-industrial complex and letting their weapons stockpiles decline so much?
Ukraine probably wouldn't have the ammunition to fight right now if it weren't for the Americans shipping them an absolute shit ton of stuff that they're paying their own complex to renew.
US: dumps enormous sums into arming Ukraine by supplying US weapons and supplies, paying US businesses to buy them.
But we've supported Ukraine with almost 60 billion already -- we would have to sell Europe and absolute shit-ton of LNG before we'd even break even.
Zelensky didn't outlaw all opposition, their courts banned political parties that were Russian influence fronts.
Makes sense, given that Russia is actively raping/murdering Ukrainians -- they probably shouldn't also be on the ballot.
The only raping going on there was done by Ukraine's own military as they went through the area accusing everyone of being Russian sympathizers, just like you are attempting to do.
While the Ukrainians were busy raping their own women, they were taping men to light poles in the freezing weather and pulling their pants down so they would freeze to death, starting with their genitals.
The problem is this money means nothing.
They are just cranking up the printing presses.
This is the primary contributor to the world-wide recession we are currently seeing.
