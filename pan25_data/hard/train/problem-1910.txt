What is your source for "the b/s being taught"?
I'd be willing to bet what you think "is being taught" is some right-wing-invented boogeyman based on some right-wing article based on some right-wing blog post based on some quote by some right-wing parent who was mad that their kid's teacher acknowledged that a classmate has two mommies.
This seems to be yet another minor policy disagreement that is amplified and exaggerated by right wing media with scary buzzwords like "woke" and "racism" for people who don't read past the headlines.
But even the right wing media article doesn't say anything about "progressives" or "racism" or "removing AP math," so I think you just made those parts up.
So, you took an article about how educators nationwide are pushing back against curtailing advanced math programs and the idea that math can be racist, and turned it into a blanket statement about what "progressives" want to do?
The article also mentions a high school that recommends students take a limited number of AP classes due to issues of stress and suicidal ideation from taking on too stressful a course load... but does not force students to adhere to that limitation... Again, nothing about math being racist or the school being "woke.
".
Lmao.
I love how low the bar is for republicans nowadays.
