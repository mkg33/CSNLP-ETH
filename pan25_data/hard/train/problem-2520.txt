Dunno if the english video was by the CBC/CTV news/Global, but those channels are always bombarded with pro-right takes and heavily anti Trudeau.
YouTube seems to be the platform they take to the most, as well as those news companies websites themselves.
I wouldn’t say Trudeaus approval rating is too high these days but those comment sections are a bit extreme; borderline trolling.
Then this has been posted on Reddit multiple times and the comments are mostly pro PM Trudeau (and reasonable comments at that).
I found this whole thing super interesting because the YouTube video is a wall of pro President Xi and anti PM Trudeau comments.
There’s a second YouTube video entirely with Chinese characters and all the comments translated to English are pro PM Trudeau.
Regardless of what you think about China, this situation will unfortunately undo any good that might have come from Trudeau directly speaking with Xi.
Maybe the "good" that there is to be had is with how Xi and Trudeau could signal to their respective populace.
Maybe Trudeau could ask about how Hu Jintao is doing to throw some shade back.
Use the language barrier to slowly morph the discussion into a "Who's on first gag".
Seems we're talking more about the rebuke than the leak.
Either the rebuke was intended to move attention away from the leak, or there was no leak and Xi is fucking around with us to keep us destabilized.
In the sphere in front of cameras the truth will often matter less than what is said when viewers have no access to the truth.
