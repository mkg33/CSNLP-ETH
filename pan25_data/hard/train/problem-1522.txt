The political parties don't do the stabbing, that's what you're missing.
The capitalist system delivers a stab wound to every person whose parents can't afford to pay off the automatic stabbing machine or who didn't manage to get slid too fast past the machine by sheer dumb luck.
Odds are, you've already been stabbed.
So, do you want to help out the people who have been stabbed around you with those Democrat bandaids, get robbed alongside everyone by the Republicans, do you try to stop the stabbing machine by yourself (Libertarian), or do you get as many people stable as you can and then take on the stabbing machine with those who can fight (socialist)?
Keep in mind, every individual who has tried to stop that machine on their own has died and all the robbers are going to stop most people from getting to the machine in the first place.
Keeping on with the stabbing analogy.
You should be participating because it's not just you who has been stabbed, it's damn near everyone.
Getting the bandaid from the Democrats buys you and everyone else time so you (or someone else) can give more meaningful help further down the line.
Yeah, but making the issue out to be a situation where the angelic Democrats are desperately trying to save us from the evil GOP is dishonest.
It's so crazy being 41 voting for Gore in 2000 and seeing 20 somethings and even 50 somethings saying both parties are the same and there is no point voting for democrats.
Yeah you can complain and say "Democrats don't do enoguh" but that is on voters because too many people vote for republicans or don't vote at all, never giving democrats enough votes to do anything.
Meanwhile they'll call you a sheep for always voting Democrat, but they'll show up at every election and continue voting for the Republican, even though "both parties are awful.
