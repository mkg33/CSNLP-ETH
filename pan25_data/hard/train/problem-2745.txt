Morocco has a territorial dispute with a territory called "Western Sahara".
This territory is as big as 50% of current Morocco.
In Wikipedia it is said "In 2020, the United States recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara in exchange for Moroccan normalization of relations with Israel.
".
Yeah.
You still have a good number of Ukrainian-allied countries continuously doing the right thing.
Of course, we also have a few Ukrainian allies that have been supportive since the beginning, but need to stop waffling and step up some more.
While there have been many horrific wars most of the world has unfortunately ignored, there’s never been a better time to the support the good guys (Ukraine) in this one.
The world cannot have Russia (Putin) win.
A Putin win will ravage Ukraine, result in even more innocent bloodshed, and also set a horrible precedent that will affect the world for decades to come.
Among other things, it will teach countries like Russia that you can maliciously invade other countries and not really have any consequences.
But I get it, they mean only those wars where hordes of expansionist Western imperialists invaded Russia's own motherland just like ... now ... in Ukraine?
While conveniently overlooking the wars Russia lost, like the Crimean War, the Russo-Japanese War, WWI, or even the Polish–Soviet War of 1918.
A possible answer to why Russia is remembered as the victim of German aggression in WW2 and not (or far less) Ukraine, Belarus and other states of the USSR.
Germans at the time of WW2 and also WW1, didn't differentiate between certain parts and nationalities of the USSR or the Russian Empire.
The people were all "Russians" to them.
