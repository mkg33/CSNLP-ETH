Hate to be the guy to defend it, but I'm living side by side with an entire islamic nation, people of which are religious, but don't execute each other over bad looks on portraits, don't force their women to stay at home or wear head covers of any kind, and in general very integrated with other cultures and modern world.
Tatars in general (in my experience) don't care, because there's enough humanity on a personal level to override hateful spots of islamic tradition.
Religion is simply the wrong target to tackle.
Fighting religion is in essence arguing with tyrants, and it should be pretty obvious that you can't beat them in an argument.
Religion sucks because it is always being hijacked by assholes and is difficult to fight against, but it doesn't turn people into monsters on it's own.
Not to insult you, but your radical outlook mirrors the worst implementations of religion, a blind conviction and hate.
Instead of dancing around it, pointing at atheists and accusing him/her of blind conviction and hate.
