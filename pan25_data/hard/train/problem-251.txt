Seriously, lead by example.
Pope has shown himself to be a complete fraud aligned with the terrible atrocities the Catholic Church is responsible for.
Pope Francis slow playing naming Russia the aggressor until only recently.
These things matter, the general population isn’t reading between the lines, he is playing both sides and clearing millions from Russian orthodoxy coffers.
Sure he’s done some good small things but he has the power to make a large impact and for the most part he’s done fuck all.
He’s given Russians major cover by saying all the war-crimey type behavior is probably chechens or some other ethnic group.
He also claims to not be covering up the sexual crimes of the Catholic Church and we know that that claim is complete horseshit.
>“The church made the decision to not cover up” abuse, the pope said.
“When honest people see how the church is taking responsibility for this monstrosity, they understand that the church is one thing while the abusers who are being punished by the church are another.”.
I think the abuses carry more weight than not being wrong to most, to the point where most people simply don't want to hear it from the church; ie, why can't someone that is more respectable be pushing this more vocally?
It's as if the messenger's reputation can only tarnish the message.
