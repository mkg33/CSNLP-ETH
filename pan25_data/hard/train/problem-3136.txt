A period frame to a painting is an antique in itself.
Museum conservators is a serious profession and that definitely will take a good amount of conservation to clean non-destructively.
Sure, it’s not the same as the multimillion dollar painting, but it isn’t cheap either.
The frames are also expensive as fuck and part of the art.
It will take significant work to restore them now.
It wasn’t in a glass box as far as I know, just had protective glass on the frame.
Vandalizing artwork and culture like this should result in jail time.
EDIT: source saying the frame was not protected.
Frame is just as much a part of the art as the art is.
Think about the painting chosen.
What is it's subject?
What is the subject of almost all art?
Nature.
We create beautiful artwork while inspired by the beauty of the natural world.
The protestors are asking you to think about what is more important: oil paint on a canvas or the incredible world that inspired its creation?
If people can get this angry about the non-damage to a painting then where is that anger when the real world is being destroyed?
It's hypocrisy.
Climate activists have been screaming for ages about how big companies are destroying the planet and no one listens.
No one gives a single shit about the massive damage being inflicted on the planet every day.
Trees are cut down, bees are vanishing, natural disasters destroy large areas of land, and unpredictable weather patterns kill crops.
We just had a massive disappearance of tons of crabs and no one batted an eye.
The world is dying.
And who suffers when the world begins dying?
Generally, poor people.
They get caught in floods or wildfires that they can't afford to run from.
They starve from the famine caused by crops failing.
These big companies cause untold destruction for a few more dollars in their pocket.
