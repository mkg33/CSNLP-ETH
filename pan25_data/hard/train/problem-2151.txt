I agree 100%.
The situation that we have in Russia now is a direct result of the chaos that occurred in the early 90s.
At this point I don't give two shits what the Russian people want.
I only care about what guarantees the safety of eastern europe and the world.
If that means regime change, fine, if that means dismantling the Russian state and removing their nukes, that's cool too.
But if people in Russia mostly want to end up like North Korea, cut off from the world and laughed at, ok. Whatever.
We, in the west and on reddit, like to assume that the war is hugely unpopular in Russia because it makes us feel better to believe that.
It's, unfortunately, just not true.
The person I replied to specifically used the term "chaos".
I am guessing that you and I have different picture in our heads when we envision "chaos" on a national level.
You think the country with the largest stockpile of nukes tearing itself apart will have a positive outcome??
People in this sub are allowing their emotions to run rampant over basic common sense and thoughts about consequences.
