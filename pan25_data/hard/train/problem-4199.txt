When the first US case was identified in Seattle our local hospitals contacted the federal government for supplies to do prepare for the outbreak.
The before version also said that when state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency.
And for good measure, they also took out the bit that said the stockpile contains enough supplies to respond to multiple large-scale emergencies simultaneously.
Immediately after Kushner's comments they actually went and changed the Department of Health and Human Services website where they described the purpose of the stockpile.
It was changed to read that its role was to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies.
Many states have products stockpiled, as well.
Just hours before his comments, the site described the stockpile as the nationâ€™s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out.
