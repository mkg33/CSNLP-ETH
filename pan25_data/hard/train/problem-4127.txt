A area in Colorado I spent a lot of time in over my lifetime thought logging was essential for the economy.
The area had decent fishing because lakes were stocked but you NEVER saw wildlife and there was nothing for hunters to hunt.
Camping was iffy because of noise from logging and getting to campgrounds was intimidating when you are sharing a narrow road with logging trucks.
When logging pulled out the place was transformed within ten years to a destination for campers and hunters.
You always see deer and other wildlife now.
The town is thriving.
Wood harvesting is necessary but it’s almost impossible to not dramatically impact the local ecosystem.
People imagine loggers thinning out trees but don’t consider all the roads and heavy equipment needed to access trees.
That has the real impact.
Clearly I agree based on what I posted.
It’s just that other economic factors are overlooked in many places.
They keep the lumber industry around for jobs when there are other options.
We do still need lumber as a resource.
Like a small part of why the price of new homes has gone up is a shortage of lumber to build them.
