Of course he does not want to be president now.
He never wanted to be president in the first place.
During 4 years of office he never did one single thing that was becoming of the office of president.
He wants to be a king.
He was a man with political ideologies that tried to use the presidency to turn himself into a pseudo dictator.
And he wants that back.
Because now he may very well need that in order to keep him from being prosecuted for possibly the highest crimes that the modern era has seen since the 1960s.
Anyone who may be laughing, tempted to think this is funny, or somehow enjoying the prospect of trump running needs to understand how dangerous this is.
This is the behavior of a man who wants to be a dictator, and this is a party who is more than willing to enable a puppet temporarily to get a dictatorship established.
Everyone knows he wants money, but we can't minimize his desire for power as well.
This man has been publicly racist for decades and spent his presidency closing up to dictators who are known for committing human rights abuses.
He not only wants money, but he wants to use that money to leverage and cement his legacy and power.
Trump is a mad king without a kingdom.
And he's trying to do his best to get it back.
Hard to know what's going on with him.
Could be that he doesn't want to be president again but wants the protection from prosecution.
Could also be that he's gotten older and doesn't have the energy anymore.
Whatever the case his chances keep looking worse.
What you have to remember is that to his base Trump doesn't hold political rallies, he holds entertainment shows.
The problem is he hasn't really changed the material, it's the same show they saw in 2016 and 2020.
They're getting bored of it now.
