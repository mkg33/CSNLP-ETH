The west keeps tip-toeing around because we donâ€™t want to make Putin mad.
It seems like we are only sending enough weaponry to keep a stalemate and not enough to allow Ukraine to win.
Like I said, this war is total BS, but we really can't be surprised anymore on what's happening in the Ukraine.
Let's just hope everyone involved gets their justice in the end.
I don't agree with this war at all, because it's complete bs.
BUT ( here it comes), if we had the same media coverage in WW1 or WW2, Would they also be covering every sort of weapon that both sides used?
New V2's, 88's' damn Buster's, all that crap.
It just seems like every news article is about what sort of weapons the Russians are using.
Guess what people, it's a war, some wild shit is going to get used and clearly Russia doesn't give a shit about any sort of laws or rules that other countries follow.
People are going use whatever they have in their arsenal on pretty much any building regardless of what it is, why in this day and age with all the pinpoint, satellite, lazer guided, bombs, ect.. who knows.m But Keep in mind both parties were guilty of carpet bombing entire cities in WW2.
Long story short, a military is going to use everything they got in a war.
So why be surprised that Russia is using all their shot on civilians.
In the context of this conflict though, it seems pretty explicit that the Russians are going after civilian targets.
They're open about going after civilian power and water infrastructure and we have intercepted communications of troops stating they were ordered to aim at civilian buildings.
Looking at how entire cities are being leveled it'd take some mental gymnastics to believe there were sticking to military targets.
