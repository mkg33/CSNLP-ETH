If Trump goes to prison because of his taxes, the problems he has concerning Jan. 6th don't go away.
If Trump goes to prison because of his taxes, that's not really a win.
He is responsible for a coup.
He tried to over throw the US government.
That's a big deal.
If he goes to prison over tax fraud, his followers and his party will say that he did nothing wrong regarding the coup.
That there wasn't one.
That it is no big deal.
"He didn't go to prison because of a made-up coup, he went to prison because of tax fraud".
This de-legitimizes overthrowing the US Government.
The next time (and there will likely be a next time) this happens, the Republicans can shrug and say "it's just like the fake one last time that had No Consequences".
I want Trump in prison for trying to overthrow the US government and many of his other crimes as President.
Tax fraud?
I want that as dessert.
That is not the main course.
That is "Oh, and also Tax Fraud".
Tax fraud.
Now he is REALLY fucked.
That's how they got Al Capone.
You can get away with a lot of shit but so help you, GOD if you don't pay your taxes.
