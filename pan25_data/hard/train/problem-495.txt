edit: FYI on the below.
lexlibertas will go on to refuse to acknowledge that China's threat to attack Taiwan and break off diplomatic ties (such as the UN) is a major reason Taiwan hasn't declared itself officially as an independent country and that the US and others haven't acknowledged Taiwan as an independent country.
He then claims that the reason the US doesn't acknowledge Taiwan as independence is because California might declare indepdence which is a total joke.
That is not why US hasn't acknowledged Taiwan and it's proven by Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.
Just the mere exercise of some independence by having a top US official visit Taiwan was enough for China to surround Taiwan with it's navy and fire missiles over or near Taiwan.
Imagine what China would do if the US actually recognized Taiwan if China would do all that just for member of congress visiting Taiwan.
Yes, those are the two main reasons and also keep in mind that almost every Muslim country that has defended China were non-democracies.
So it's hard for say some middle east dictatorship or kingdoms to condemn China in the UN when they are guilty of very bad things against Muslims in their own country.
Only two Muslim majority countries voted to condemn China's treatement of Uyghurs.
They are both in Europe, 2 of the only democracies among muslm majority nations, and both ranked the highest on human right indexes among Muslim countries.
On the positive side for the west, the west is actually reducing in CO2 emissions and have been doing so for many years.
But China is still increasing at a fast pace.
also, China has lots of money they want.
If someone pays me enough money, I'll keep my mouth shut too.
