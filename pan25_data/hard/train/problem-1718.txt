Everyone got something in the omnibus,that's why it got passed so overwhelmingly in the senate.
If Bernie was the president, I would imagine his agendas would be too progressive and uncompromising to have success Biden has had.
Plus, Biden and McConnell are friends and that helps.
Biden really was the right man for the job.
Sure, he's old.
And gaffe prone.
But he knows how the system is supposed to work.
Trump and his cronies smashed the system like a toddler smashes a Lego house.
And there wasn't anyone more qualified then Biden to put it back together.
Despite the Republicans best efforts, the federal government is functioning again.
Biden deserves far more credit than he'll ever get for pulling things back from the brink.
Even looking beyond the legislation.
He's staffed his cabinet and appointed positions with competent professionals who do their jobs, often in the most boring way possible.
Which really is the point - Government is supposed to be boring.
If he retires in 2024, he gets to be very proud of undoing a lot of damage and actually doing good in Government.
