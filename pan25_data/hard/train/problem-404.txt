She deceived voters, but she doesn't belong in the GOP.
A Republican wouldn't have voted to confirm any of Biden's judicial nominees.
She sucks, but not as much as even the best Republicans do.
I think her strategy here is to get Democrats to bow out, like they did in Utah, and back her, lest she act as a spoiler and elect a Republican instead.
Which Republicans voted for Biden's judicial nominees, and the legislation that was passed during this Congress?
But agree that 2024 will be a chance for Democrats to replace her in the Senate.
I don't think she can win as an independent, especially not one who betrayed Democratic voters.
The real question, then, is will she be replaced by a Democrat, like Gallego, or will she be a spoiler and get herself replaced by a Republican?
Unclear whether this is true.
I'd probably take her over a Republican unless 2024 goes extremely well for Democrats and her vote is unneeded.
But incumbency does have huge advantages, so ceding the seat to a Republican is probably a bad idea.
It might be better to bide their time and then oust her in 2030, rather than handing the seat to Republicans, if it looks like 2024 will be tight.
This move will definitely cost us the Senate in 2024 but I think it's better to let a republican get in for six years than to cave to simena's disgusting tactics.
