Correction, the Ainu do not predate the Yamato.
However, Ainu habitation of Hokkaido predates Yamato settlement of the island, although there have always been cultural and genetic connections between Hokkaido and Honshu.
The Ainu are one of the indigenous peoples of Japan, having settled Hokkaido and the Northern Territories as early as the 9th century CE.
They were consumed by Edo Japan in the 1600s when they signed a trade agreement with the Matsumae clan.
100 Ainu people resided in the Northern Territories in the late 19th century.
The Ainu are the true stewards of those islands.
Politicizing and turning these places into geopolitical flashpoints only serves to further erase the culture of the people who legit want to visit there.
And fish there.
And do the shit they did for centuries before drawn into this whole game.
If Russia requires humanitarian visas for Ainu to visit their ancestral graves, then it’s a humanitarian imperative to give them free access.
They’re the ones militarizing it instead.
