SC has voted for republican presidents by 10-15 points for the last 6 elections at least.
Their state house and senate are roughly 70% republican.
NC is twice the size and more evenly split with better education, much better higher education, better infrastructure, etc., and has cities.
SC has no town over 150k people, and only 3 over 100k.
Wouldn't NC be a much better representation of Democratic demographics?
Maybe evaluate why progressive candidates do so poorly when faced with Democratic voters demographically in line with the majority of Democrats nationally.
If you can only win among white conservative Dems, then what makes you think you can win the primary or the general?
If it cooks progressive chances it's because they never had a chance with most Democratic voters without the help of two white unrepresentative states making them seem viable.
Bernie 1.0 should have demonstrated that clearly.
There were never enough voters for him to win and when 2.0 came around he never bothered to win over new voters.
We all know what they're suggesting but won't say.
Leftists or self proclaimed progressive candidates cannot win non-white voters and rather than them actually try to fix that they prefer to keep our primaries the same to benefit whiter, smaller states.
Perhaps leftwing candidates need to start looking inward to why their message isn't resonating with such an important vote, rather than being mad that the group exists.
Feels like the bigger challenge for less well-known candidates is: people like their message but feel like they should vote for a compromise candidate who they think is more likely to win.
Same thing with a winnowing Candidate field: he had no plan to deal with it, and never really tried to convince any of the other primary candidates to endorse him.
