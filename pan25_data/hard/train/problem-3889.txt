You can look at it this way.
You could have safely assumed that they have 300 heavily fortified artillery positions within the range of Seoul.
Any artillery team can crank out about four rounds a minute.
I'm a cannoneer by trade in the military.
I've been to South Korea, and I've been to the DMZ, I've seen what the South Koreans have artillery-wise, and I've been heavily briefed on what North Koreans have.
In comparison Seoul is only about 20km from the DMZ (a conventional 155mm shell will fly that far) and North Korea has been stockpiling for 70 years.
North Koreans are perfectly capable of deposing the current leader by themselves.
You can sneak in CDs with South Korean movies and help them escape but the solution is certainly not starting a refugee crisis unprovoked and a war that would see tens of thousands civilians dead.
Russia isn't using artillery pieces on large urban cities in Ukraine because they are not within range to do so and they didn't have time to amass a stockpile of artillery shells and guns when advancing.
Nevertheless you can see the damage done to Mariupol as an example of what artillery can do...
This would likely be more comparable to WWI artillery barrages than WWII ones.
It wouldnâ€™t last long, but that many pieces would knock out a city in short order.
