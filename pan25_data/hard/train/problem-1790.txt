Off top of my head, the $1 billion package included 10 120 mm, 82mm, and 60mm mortar systems plus ammo, the patriot battery, more Excalibur 155mm howitzer rounds and HIMAR rockets, more MRAPs (mine resistant trucks) and HMMWVs, more HARM anti radar missiles, and JDAM guided missiles.
Then the $800 million that's actually part of the US military budget is to purchase Soviet caliber artillery munitions (122mm artillery/rocket, 152mm artillery, and 125mm tank rounds).
Then there is a whole assortment of small arms and munitions.
All these things were said about PzH2000, HIMARS, HARM missiles, Krabs, various AA systems, the list goes on.
If AFU can operate some of the most advanced artillery systems in the world, they can handle some M1A1 from the 80s.
It’s bullshit, because people been saying “Ukrainians aren’t trained” for 10 month now, which is plenty of time to actually train the troops for the new weapon systems.
It's a convenient excuse to say that Ukrainian pilots haven't been trained yet, but the war's been going on for a year and may last for years longer.
How can the Ukrainians start training on F-16s if we don't provide them first?
If we gave F-16 jets to Ukraine, they would be effective in less than a year with Ukrainian pilots.
The reasons they aren't given are political, not military.
This isn’t only a military issue, but one of general influence and diplomacy.
An ally whom can help in so many ways with trade, advancements, and militarily is worth quite a bit.
