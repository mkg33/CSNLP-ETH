I want to expand the House itself.
That’s the real structural fix for all this.
We used to do it every census, but it’s been a century since last time and now our House is smaller than equivalents in much less populous peer nations like UK or Germany.
It can’t represent The People properly when we’ve added 4 states and their 8 senators since we last added any members to the side that is supposed to represent the population.
It's so stupid when you can't rely on a single member of the GOP to help you pass legislation for majority of the country irrespective of the voters' politics.
I don't think this can happen without proper majorities in Congress, and that can't happen until voting reform pushes Congress to more closely reflect the electorate.
I just don't think that McConnell is a strong enough leader to convince his caucus that taking one step back now is worth it to ensure that the Supreme Court doesn't fuck them again ahead of 2024 or 2026.
If they could somehow convince their entire caucus to not filibuster a gay marriage bill then they wouldn't even need to vote for it.
They could just let Dems pass it with 50 votes.
And if they need to vote for it I'm sure they can find enough purple state Senators to vote for it.
I think McConnell and establishment Republicans recognize that they have no control over the Court and fear that.
