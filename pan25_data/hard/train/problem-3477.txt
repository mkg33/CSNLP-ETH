People will only accept a revised version of reality if they're placated, blood and circus, and people who're young, even if they gain circus with aging they'll remember their time as young and having no circus.
Yes is it.
Social change can happen either naturally through changing demographics due to entropy or it can happen through a social revolution by the sitting government changing attitude either by itself or by the conviction of the population.
The real cause is regimes that follow Conservative ideology suppressing and controlling the population through heavily propagandizing stuff.
You are correct, except with the claim that conservative ideology is the real cause; Authoritarian governments are the real cause and suppress and rely upon propaganda to establish and remain in control... it's similar to how narcissistic people control things around themselves.
A market system only functions as effectively as the government allows it to.
You can have a more socialist economy and have an Authoritarian government and the suppression and propaganda will be, essentially, the same or at least very similar.
Left and right market systems are different from north and south governmental structures; it's the north and south that establishes how effectively the market system can work and how much they will try to suppress.
