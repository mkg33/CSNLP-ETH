It's incredibly short-sighted and quite likely impossible to implement.
Congress struggles enough to get much done as is, but the idea that it could possibly have the willpower to stay in session long enough to effectively pass or veto the entirety of active US legislation is completely absurd.
That's not even getting into the competency issue, there's no one so well informed about US law to have a meaningful understanding of literally everything currently active on the books right now, much less the entire Congressional session having a goddamn clue about it all.
Just the time constraints alone would likely be catastrophic.
Honestly it's so deeply into "not even wrong" territory with how bad an idea it is, that Scott doesn't seem to have managed to get much support for it.
The goals of killing medicare and social security are still long-term policy goals for Republicans, no doubt, but even with that in mind it's a dumb way to go about it.
They mad cause Biden got them to promise they wouldn't touch medicaid or societal security... Now they have to pretend they never said that as they cut medicaid and social security.
But here he is, acting offended that Biden said republicans want to end Social Security and Medicare.
He had to pretend to be appalled at President Biden saying that Republicans want to cut social security when in fact Lee wants to totally eliminate social security.
Lee's Shocked Pikachu face at the State of the Union is such a classic Republican Gaslighting technique.
