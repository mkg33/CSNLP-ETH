How is it xenophobic not to want people that don't live in your country buying homes they have no intention of living in purely for investment purposes that only hurt the local economies?
Do they already have a cap on rent prices, or are they only preventing foreigners from literally buying houses, in other words any Canadian can still buy multiple houses and slum lord it up.
Seems to me it won't address the actual problem in any way, only prevent foreigners from being part of the problem.
This isn’t solved by blocking foreigners out.
You got to increase taxes on unoccupied homes and make the investment less attractive.
But then watch your middle class home owners vote out your government as their home prices plummet.
It’s literally the exact meaning.
Unless you allow everyone to become a permanent resident at their choosing it makes no sense.
The article only mentions PR and refugees, which excludes work visa immigrants.
I can only rely on the words used.
Again there are better ways to address this.
I was a non-permanent resident when I bought my house.
I would have been banned to do so with this law.
It’s xenophobic.
Period.
