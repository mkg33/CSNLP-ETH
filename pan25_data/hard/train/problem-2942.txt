Yeah employers can't take advantage of immigrants anymore, and actually have to pay proper wages that keep up with inflation.
There's NO shortage of labor.
Just a shortage of good employers.
Right now skilled trades tend to be short by tens of thousands of workers nationally.
That’s a pretty severe shortage compared to the total number of skilled tradespeople—which is why the wages are relatively high—but it’s a drop in the bucket compared to the university pipeline.
While it’s true we probably should up the number of skilled tradespeople we train, it isn’t even remotely close to a scale that is directly comparable with the university pipeline.
Like I said, well-qualified workers in the US already have high wages and fairly strong benefits.
You end up having to offer them tens of thousands of dollars a year extra to get them to change employers.
This is why we “focus so hard on university degrees”.
That’s the sort of education the US economy actually demands in sufficient quantity to employ incoming entry level workers.
