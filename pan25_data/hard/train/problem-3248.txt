I always felt while Hillary wouldn't have been a bad president, her motivations were always for personal benefit.
Not because she wanted to do some good.
I held my nose and voted for her because I really didn't want Trump, but I would have been enthusiastic about Bernie.
I didn't want Hillary either, I wanted Bernie back in 2016 and in 2020 and when he didn't get it I voted for Hillary and Biden.
Hillary would have been a good president, yes she would probably be a little too neoliberal for my taste but they all are.
The most important thing is she wouldn't have set our country teetering on the brink of its own destruction like Trump did and still does to this day.
Well considering that Trump was probably our very worst president we've ever had I really wish back in the day you had voted for the douche instead of the turd.
Seriously the only president worse than him is probably Buchanan or Andrew Jackson for the trail of tears.
This classified document shit should have got him prison for the rest of his fucking life.
That's how you know democracy's already fucking dead in this country and fascism is seeping in.
