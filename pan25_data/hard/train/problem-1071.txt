I was just reading on the guy who tackled him.
He was retired military of 15 years and retired from the military because of the violence he witnessed.
He said he never expected to experience it at home, but his combat instincts just kicked in.
He was at the drag show with his family, wife and daughter(s?
).
My coworker just said, "I can't help but wonder why this is happening like this," and I started trying to delicately explain that Tucker Carlson/Fox News/OANN/Trump/Popular Republicans are constantly expressing fearmongering and terroristic rhetoric using mainstream media and social media.
But before I could get passed, "well tucker carlson..." she had to take a phone call.
The article also mentioned that the hero dude yelled for other patrons to help him as he was hitting the shooter, and a drag queen stomped on the shooter with their heels while someone else grabbed the rifle and took it away.
He grabbed the shooter using a handle on the body armor from behind him, knocked the long-gun out of his hands, then saw and grabbed the pistol and beat the shit out of the shooter until he stopped yelling.
Hero dude thought he killed the shooter.
Hero dude was then detained in cuffs for an hour because he was covered in blood, meanwhile he desperately wanted to know if his family was OK.
The man took his kid to a drag show and ended up being a hero (even though he was handcuffed and put in a police car for over an hour after the shooting).
As far as the "grooming our children" bullshit goes, the guy who tackled the gunman and stopped thing from going even worse was there watching a drag show with his wife and daughter.
