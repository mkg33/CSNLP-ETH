McConnell doesn't have to do what he says because he'll get re-elected no matter what.
Only reason I can think of that he'd bother condemning this is to try and keep Trump from the nomination since he knows he's poison for the GOP in elections.
The problem they have is that if Trump doesn't win the nomination he will claim that it was rigged against him, run as an independent and try to tear down any republicans standing in his way.
Splitting the party like that would result in massive democratic gains in 2024.
I could see that happening but I think that Trump believes that the presidency belongs to him.
He never backs down.
I think we can agree that if he loses the primary he will find a way to punish the GOP for it.
Trump would be fine with losing if it meant that someone he hated lost more.
Let's say that Desantis gets the nomination.
Do you really believe that Trump would stand back and endorse him as the nominee?
It seems more likely that he would do everything he could to punish the Republican party for disloyalty.
And that's why the republican establishment is no longer helping him block subpoenas.
They want him to be charged before the primaries to take him off the table.
