Watch Dr Timothy Snyder or Dr Jordan Peterson speak about the new phenomenon of living a post-truth world (being exported by Ru's singular, evil type of propaganda) and it makes sense to me, at least anecdotally.
People today who seemingly refuse to think critically or are incapable, choose to believe based on how/what they feel regardless evidence which oftentimes is there yet that contradicts what/how they feel.
I've seen this for 30 years, yet not mainstream as it seems today.
It's how TFG and his ilk are able to get all those with malleable emotional cores so ginned up and messaging complete untruths.
Yeah, it is amazing and simply ludicrous some persons' priorities, if they're truly even their priorities.
Much of the time likely they've been severely affected by maga Rs propaganda.
The maga Rs propaganda is of a singular, evil type and exported from Ru.
RT is the worst case of Ruzzian propaganda, at least the one in Russia itself.
RT outside of Russia as a channel is relatively mild by itself, but they do a lot of other stuff, main thing I remember is making memes to destabilize US, especially before elections.
