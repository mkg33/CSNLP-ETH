Specifically: it seems like Ukraine has the ability to continue defending their territory against a Russian people who probably don't really want to be fighting this war for Putin.
But that doesn't mean they have the ability to march on Moscow and take down Russia.
Russians would probably be a lot more willing to defend their own country against a theoretical offensive Ukraine.
Also a lot of the blocking troops are said to be Kadyrovites - Chechens - who probably don't mind as much shooting Russian deserters as some kid from Moscow might.
And I am not even sure if it is a good thing, since it might create an illusion that Russian army is very weak and thus Ukraine doesn’t need as much support as it gets.
Actually, Russian army is strong and despite tens of billions of funding of Ukraine, we need to do even more.
And if we spread that Russian army is weak, how do you want to tell that Ukraine actually needs more money to win the war?
well, we hear stories like this basically everyday, how the Russian army is crumbling from within, have no ammo, have 60 year old gear, don’t want to fight etc., but in reality, the war is a tie.
