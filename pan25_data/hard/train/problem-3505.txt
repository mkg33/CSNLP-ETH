Musk takes control of Twitter and immediately tweets Far Right propaganda mischaracterizing a violent attack on the husband of the Dem Speaker of the House.
And now his mass firing of content moderators opens Twitter up for a flood of Russian/Far Right bots again within a week of a major US election that could very well determine whether we continue as a Democracy or not.
This at a time when many Republicans are openly stating they back Russia and will cut off aid to Ukraine should they come back in to power.
Given all of the above, Elon Musk is behaving as a Kremlin asset in assisting Vladimir Putin and Russia in their goal to introduce chaos into the US elections and potentially cut us off as an ally to Ukraine.
That is undeniable.
However, I never said I suspect Kompromat in this case.
It's possible Musk simply shares Putin's goal for a Right Wing world order, and is assisting Putin and the Kremlin in that aim.
Because Musk said “maybe there’s more to this story than meets the eye” you call it misinformation, and then procede to call Musk an Agent of Putin lol.
You’re the reason why Musk had to take over Twitter because you guys call everything you disagree with misinformation.
Anyone with half a brain understand the Paul Pelosi situation isn’t adding up.
