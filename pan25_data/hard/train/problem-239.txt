Even if they changed direction and wanted to focus on nuclear again that would still take a long time to get going and many industries aren't geared towards using electricity for their production needs.
They phased out coal and nuclear in order to instead use natural gas.
With the current war going on, they stopped buying Russian gas, but still have to get their energy from somewhere.
Gas has only become marginally more efficient, and the risk of getting cut off from Russia was never tackled.
As it turns out, after 30 years of billions a year in subsidies, gas "just isn't there yet and it just doesn't work yet to supply the country the power it needs".
Imagine what they could have done with fossil fuels if they've gotten that money in stead.
The tech is there and it was there 30 years ago, just less efficient.
It's very sad that Germany is both a leader in renewables and not even at 50%.
Germany had great damages from the Chernobyl accident, it's not unreasonable they wanted to pay the higher price for renewables when they were more than able to with plenty of time to spare.
Don't counter nonsense with more nonsense.
Perfect is the enemy of the good.
Fossil fuels have many more problems.
Radioactive waste has a very long half-life but CO2 is forever.
If the govt wasn't gonna go all in on renewables, it should have been nuclear, not getting stuck at Russian gas.
So maybe these people should stop using electricity, cars, and anything that uses coal, oil, or nuclear power to cut down on demand.
Without the need for the coal, this wouldn’t happen.
The clean electric isn’t quite there yet, not enough to power nations and industry.
I can understand them wanting to protect the town from being destroyed though.
