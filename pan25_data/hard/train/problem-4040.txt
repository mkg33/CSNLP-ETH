In any scenario I can put together, the President-Elect would be freed to carry out the duties of their office.
There are some niche scenarios where it might be an issue, but they would bar him from taking office anyway.
Its an interesting question and a bit of a constitutional crisis.
Luckily, the answer is mostly fully formed already, we simply have to follow it to its logical conclusion.
You forget this isn't about courage - its about ego.
If the GOP rejects him he may very well decide to screw them by running on an independent ticket.
I can't see him getting more than 10-15% of the vote (especially if he's running against DeSantis) but that is enough to screw any chance they have of victory.
He's likely doing this as a veiled threat to the Republican machinery - knowing that he'd split the party and all but guarantee another Dem term if they don't support him.
And, yes, he is just that delusional and narcissistic to think only he matters.
He is, after all, a guy who wants to BE (admired and loved as) president, but not do the actual work of a president.
This is a guy who sponged off his rich dad and who said that he had no idea that the Presidency would be hard work.
