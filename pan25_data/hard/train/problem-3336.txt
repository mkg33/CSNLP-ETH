Because if you burn a bunch of fuel, creating CO2, then remake the fuel and put it back where you found it, you didn't increase the amount of carbon in the air.
It may do, but it's carbon dioxide that was extracted from the atmosphere decades ago whereas the coal's CO2 was extracted millions of years ago.
The wood CO2 doesn't contribute to increasing the atmospheric CO2 in even close to the same way as burning millions of tonnes of fossil fuels.
But to offset the CO2 from coal, we have to have additional forest growth or other CO2 sequestering to make up the difference.
The question they wanted to answer was how long will it take for the forest to regrow enough to pull sufficient carbon back out of the atmosphere to balance out the difference.
Their conclusion seems to be that it will take 40 to 100 years (depending on the type of forest that is regrown) to pay back that carbon deficit and that is the time window where humanity needs to be making the greatest carbon reductions, not net increases.
