I'm sure the Laffer curve will prove as useful for measuring negative knowledge as it was for predicting increased revenue based on tax cuts.
Possibly even more so.
Well yeah, in the sense that a guy name Laffer came up with the curve and told everybody about it.
I guess that makes it real, in the same way that flat earth theory is "real.
".
That's the point.
There little evidence we were ever on the right side on the Laffer curve, let alone right now.
Also no one really knows what that theoretical curve would actually look like when applied to something as complex as a modern tax code.
It's not something you can really use to drive policy.
I think he is saying that A Laffer curve exists because the relationship between tax rates and revenue isn't purely linear and high tax rates can create economic inefficiency and push economic activity to the black market.
the Laffer curve exists in the sense that it is "a concept" in economics; it's still taught in 101/102 as a way of thinking about the relationship between taxes and government revenue.
The Laffer curve had always been a hypothetical that could only apply in extreme circumstances, and then applied to every tax policy and taken as gospel.
And even if you do accept it as true, there ARE NO POLITICIANS WHO WANT TO RAISE TAXES SO HIGH THAT THE LAFFER CURVE WOULD BE APPLICABLE!
but, you know, both siderism and all that.
