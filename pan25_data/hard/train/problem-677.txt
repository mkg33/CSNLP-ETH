This is good advice.
Iâ€™d just like to add that the man in this story has dual US/Iranian citizenship and was visiting family in Iran.
People will take a lot of risks to see their family, and I certainly sympathize with that.
Yes, there's always the chance that just by being a dual citizen you can get in a lot of trouble - but people weigh those risks when it's down to big events that have to do with their families.
It's not so cut and dry as "never go back to your homeland ever again" for a lot of people.
It blows my mind, why are there still so many high level people that should have been sanctioned such a long time ago when so many sanctions have hurt ordinary people for decades?
The IRI is always going to claim that any unrest is the US/Israel's fault... so now that Iranians have spent 4 months doing what the west has asked them to do in the face of sanctions... maybe the US can do something more than a slow rollout of targeted sanctions and saying "well there's no way we can return to the JCPOA any time soon.
