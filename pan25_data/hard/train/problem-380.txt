I’m sincerely not sure what you’re trying to get at, since the circumstances in those cases were not similar.
I don’t “feel the same” because it wasn’t in any way the same situation or the same action.
Note, though, that just because I don’t consider them equivalent doesn’t mean my attitude toward them is 180 degrees apart.
You mean leaving Iraq under terms negotiated by W, and giving Iran back their own money under the terms of an agreement worked out by the Reagan administration?
Realistically you know the nuclear deal would not have like magically stabilized Iran and looking at Iran now it's better that they have the least amount of nuclear.
Any country that could say well we became unstable because we didn't get a nuclear agreement was already very unstable.
Realistically you know nuclear technology is mostly a dying industry that can't come anywhere near generating power as cheap as solar and wind and as the grid level is trickling it means nuclear power will no longer be commercially viable because you'll basically just be throwing money away to run a nuclear reactor versus like solar panels in a battery Bank.
Realistically Trump would probably be a lame duck for 4 years and opportunistic and impulsive enough that Russia and Iran can't really trust him.
