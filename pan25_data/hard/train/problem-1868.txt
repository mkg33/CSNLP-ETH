Oh yeah.
There’s no way a fucking bomb on your ankle could ever go wrong.
Honestly if you’re considering a bomb on someone’s foot because they’re that big of a risk, fucking keep them in jail.
Why are you even entertaining the idea of letting a person who you consider a big enough flight risk that they’d require a literal bomb on them to keep them in check freedom?
Also if you’re having a medical emergency, I’m pretty sure shocks aren’t going to do anything but make the situation worse.
Imagine having a cardiac episode where electric signals play a part.
I’m sure sporadic tases are going to absolutely do wonders for that.
This is a stupid idea.
There should be tiers to it IMO.
An ankle monitor is clunky and expensive, but that’s often because they have other monitors built in like an alcohol sensing one.
Makes sense that you’d need something like that if the terms of your release require you to abstain from drugs or alcohol if they played in a part in why the person was arrested.
Make a smaller wrist monitor that’s sole purpose is to track and give them to people who committed more than minor offense, but who’s offense aren’t enough to warrant 24/7 extreme surveillance like what the ankle monitors bring.
Ankle monitors exist like this, and for anyone on probation, they pay for it (bullshit) and they have to inform their officers for approval if they're going outside their geofence.
