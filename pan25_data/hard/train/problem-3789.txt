Anytime people express that the democrat party isn't accepting or moving in the direction of progressive policy I'm kind of like, "no duh, it's not the progressive party, what'd you expect?
".
Yup.
Most people on the left dislike the Democratic Party, but what the fuck are we going to do?
Vote for the Republican cult member?
Vote for a third party that allows the Republican cult member to win?
Donald Trump starting a third party is the best thing that can happen for the nation, because suddenly I have a feeling people on the right would be open to ranked choice voting.
This isn’t a “both sides” argument because one side is clearly more dangerous to the future of the nation, but at the same time we are stuck in a collapsing nation built on fucking people over.

Oh well.
I guess just because he is black doesn't mean he is going to make it his top priority to reduce the most significant racial disparity in this country.
Too bad he isn't making a vow to lower the Medicare eligibility age while in office.
Studies show it would literally reduce how racist our country is in terms of life expectancy between blacks and whites:
Now is it possible Hakeem doesn't know about this study?
I doubt it.
So he does know but he isn't making this his top priority.
Instead it is working with Republicans?
Hmmm, how exactly can he, as a black man, be so indifferent to his ethnicity literally dying in preventable ways?
