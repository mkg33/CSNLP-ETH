Legalizing piracy does not make it any more or less piracy.
It is called "privateering" when it is done under a national flag.
If the ships are being used to commit an atrocity then piracy is an option for implementing justice.
It is much less destructive than torpedoing or shelling the ships.
Seizing goods on the high seas is piracy.
It being approved by national or international law does not make the piracy not be piracy.
Pirates taking cargo that is considered contraband is piracy of contraband.
They seized illegal weapons from ships that were illegally smuggling guns.
Now, instead of destroying the weapons, they want to give them to Ukraine.
Now, if they are just "donating" those weapons to be included in one of the next aid packages, how is that piracy?
I'm confused.. How is it piracy for them to seize illegal weapons from gun runners and donate them to Ukraine?
Serious question as I know nothing about piracy?
How can this not be piracy?
Obviously if the word holds negative connotation then we can invent positive words.
Maybe "high seas capture of freedom prize"?
