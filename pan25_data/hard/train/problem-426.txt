No, the problem is that rent control makes things better for a few (long term, generally better off) renters and the people who pay for it are everyone else paying higher rent.
Rent control doesn't even help poor people, it makes rent go up long term, it's one of the few things basically every economist agrees on.
Your envy isn't the problem, it demonstrates part of why rent control is a shit program it (badly) chooses winners and losers while overall increasing rent costs.
Dense housing also has the benefit of being dramatically better for the environment, incentivize healthier lives, shorter commutes, among other things.
What's the alternative, to economists, that makes housing accessibility better for everyone?
I don't suppose they just want to, you know, establish universal rent control?
If they were here (the rich white men who actively enslaved people), I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be thrilled about me, a person who does not own land, even being able to vote.
You seem to be saying the way it is is because that's the way its always been, and the way it can't change is because that's the way its always been.
