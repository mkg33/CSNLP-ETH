Is it just me, or is every thread about Russia doing something awful full of people saying “omg fuck every single Russian the citizens are just as culpable because they should be overthrowing Putin!”.
Or am I supposed to believe that if we just act a little nicer towards the Russians on Reddit, they’ll overthrow Putin?
I’m sorry, am I supposed to feel sorry for the “Russian Lawmaker” who was perfectly happy to run in Putin’s little gulag gang until it suddenly wasn’t beneficial for him anymore?
Suppose I'm tired of the pussyfooting we've done around Russia for so many years, and think they are all complicit in their crimes.
The German deathcamp convictions come to mind, everyone was following orders and they weren't even doing the actual killing.

I know it would be the hardest thing to rebel against your own powerful government, and death and torture might be the least of what you suffer when they get a hold of your family and village.
