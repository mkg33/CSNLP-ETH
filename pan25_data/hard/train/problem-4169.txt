Manchin's permits bill would've been a massive boon for green energy by allowing for faster building of transmission lines.
The issue with "the wind is always blowing somewhere" is that you need to transfer that energy to where the wind is not blowing, and the current US energy infrastructure isn't up to spec.
Manchin's permits bill would allow building the necessary backbone to build green energy facilities with confidence.
Ahh ok so you'd rather a completely different political system.
Well unfortunately you have to live in this reality where a majority in the senate is meaningful and Manchin gives Dems that majority.
It may not sound like much but a 51/49 Senate is a world away from a 50/50 one in terms of what the controlling party can accomplish.
When you vote with Biden 90% of the time and still somehow manage to win a senate seat in a state Trump got 70% of the vote in you get rewarded, yeah.
In a country where 70% of the people agree with the democratic platform the senate should not be 50/50 They can't even blame gerrymandering.
