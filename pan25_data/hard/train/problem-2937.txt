I understand what the law is and that the verdict was likely correct.
I still think that if you arm yourself and knowingly place yourself in a situation where violence is likely and then you kill someone there should be legal consequences for your actions.
You shouldn't get to insert yourself into a situation where you've pose an obvious risk to human life, and then claim self defense if they try to subdue the threat.
It's insane.
By that logic we should allow people to walk around in schools with AR-15s and shrug our shoulders if kids get shot trying to disarm them.

What exactly does he bring to the table politically other than a history of shooting liberals at a rally and getting away with murder?

Everyone has biases.
We see events through a particular perspective structured by a particular language and influenced by people and media we interact with.

His defenders always ignore the context for his feeling endangered.
It's like they pretend he was just some dude at a rally who suddenly feared for his life and was forced to defend himself, not that he brought a gun over state lines specifically to attend this protest where he showed up brandishing his weapon, which set the whole thing off.
It's why to gualify to speak at their conventions, you just had to be an ambulance chasing couple with poor gun handling, because they impressed your entire base and party by standing on their porch with guns and lied about protesters "breaking a gate".
