“If there is consent on both or all three or all four, however many are involved in the sex act, it’s perfectly fine, whatever it is.
But if the left ever senses and smells that there’s no consent in part of the equation then here come the rape police.
But consent is the magic key to the left.”.
And _that's_ what consent is the key for.
Rush is signaling that this "consent" business _actually_ means "the left is okay with doing ANYTHING, no matter how vile and awful, as long as they can cloak it in some namby-pamby 'consent' language and derive a fig leaf justification from it.
".
You're coming at this from the wrong angle.
You've got to look at Rush's argument through the lens of the indoctrinated.
(There's also the hidden allusion in Rush's words that what the left means by "consent" is actually more of an Aleister Crowley-esque "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" rejection of God and moral absolutism, and a direct assault on the idea that some things are moral and some things are not.
You only get to pick up that message if you grew up in white evangelicalism, but hooooo boy, it's a flashing neon sign.
