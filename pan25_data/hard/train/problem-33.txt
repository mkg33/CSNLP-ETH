They're trying to destroy the infrastructure around the plant so it can't be used when the Russians have to abandon the site.
The problem is that they're not just hitting transformers and power lines, but also the plant itself because their artillery isn't very accurate.
Maybe this will clear it up.
Ukraine was set to disconnect Belarus from the grid and start transferring power to Romania to lessen their dependence on Russia.
However Ukrainians are still running the plant and it's still connected to the Ukrainian power grid.
It still supplies Ukraine with energy and Russia has shot out these connectors before which falls in line with their targeting of Ukrainian energy facilities in other parts of Ukraine.
While Russia might have plans to reroute the plans so it only serves Russian interests that's not possible in the foreseeable future.
I’m looking at the long term end game and don’t see any situation that favors Russia with more aggressive action.
At this point, I don't see the upside for Russia to keep doing this.
If they create a nuclear incident, UN/NATO is going to show up to take control of the plant.
If they don't, what's the point again?
