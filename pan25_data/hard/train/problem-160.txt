Not a good comparison at all.
You can train your brain into habits and create literal chemical changes to certain actions you take given enough time.
You know how foods grow on you?
You're reprogramming your brain.
Driving a car could be addictive, reading could be addictive, watching T.V.
Super poor honestly.
And I'd argue we should separate gambling which has the goal of abusing how your brain functions to take as much money from you as possible.
Social Media is a totally valid comparison imo with how disruptive it can be.
Look I agree with you on the whole games are designed to create these patterns but there's still the major difference between it being introduced into your system vs.
Your own actions forming a habit.
I'd argue alcohol should be further restricted before media is.
Part of the enjoyment of entertainment is using how our brain functions to maximize the appeal.
We're addicted to doing things we enjoy so that our brains will release more of the chemicals that we register as enjoyment.
