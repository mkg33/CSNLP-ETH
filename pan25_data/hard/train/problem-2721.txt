I had a good friend's wife just blurt this out at a wedding reception late last year.
I was gobsmacked, laughed at first thinking she was being sarcastic or joking.
When it came down to it, she felt like she couldn't believe in anything, because there might always be a tiny, tiny chance that's she's wrong, so she has to keep an open mind.
When I asked her if she was worried about dying from a micrometeor impact to the head given the microscopic chance, she said that yes now I mention it, it's something she should worry about.
She has facebook brain.
Flat earth is the onramp to identify and target people vulnerable to more damaging conspiracy theories, now there's a conspiracy theory for you.
Or maybe there is a conspiracy to flood the internet with crazy, impossible, and easily disproven theories until anyone who questions the official narrative is written off as a conspiracy theorist.
There's a difference between "a conspiracy" (which is a real thing that happens sometimes), and a "conspiracy theory mindset" which is a way of thinking that avoids accountability and critical thinking.
