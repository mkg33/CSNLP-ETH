The reality is that both sides have done awful things and, if given a free hand, will continue to do horrible things.
We shouldn't be funding either of them.
Violence will cease when both Israelis and Palestinians love their own children more than they hate each other.
The only path to peace between Israel and Palestine is if they both stop trying to kill each other.
Supporting Palestine shouldn't mean condoning their worst actions, but all too often it does.
This isn't unique to palestine.
Other Arab and African nations teach similar things even holocaust denial is in some textbooks it is crazy and absurd.
This has been threatened for years but at the moment Europe and the UN are currently funding Palestinian education teaching extreme hate through their and .
There were always Jews in Israel and the only way our people spread to the middle east and Europe is through persecutions and violence.
So by your own logic, you should support Israel being a country for the Jews, and kick the Palestinians out.
Right?
