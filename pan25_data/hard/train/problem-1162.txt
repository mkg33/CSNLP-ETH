There’s a strange disconnect amongst conservatives that I’ve talked to of how serious Covid is.
Many of them will downplay the dangers of the virus, express distrust of the vaccination and acknowledge the deaths of friends and/or family in the same conversation.
I agree that the Virus is very dangerous - but the downplay that I experience is that what is not discussed enough is the HEALTH STATUS of the people who are getting it…..

This is coming from someone who is a democrat - who stopped using Facebook after having some altercations with her mother when Obama was being elected; and now has felt some distancing from her democratic friends who seem to act as if I might be turning republican (?)
but it has nothing to do with politics for me….
I have experienced my first three deaths in my close circle of people in the past year.
It was sad and agonizing each time seeing their discomfort caused by their own food habit choices.
It seems this most recent distancing is further sign that people aren’t interested in trying to take care of their mind and body.
Which really isn’t that surprising since we are living in this environment of the SAD (Standard American diet).
