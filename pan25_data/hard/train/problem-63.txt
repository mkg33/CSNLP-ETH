It'll go to the last second and, when McCarthy isn't allowing a passed Senate bill (that would end the crisis) to even hit the floor for a vote - when he knows the Dems would have some very moderate conservatives looking to avoid default and vote for it... Those same GOP members will call for the vote to remove him.
He shouldn't have accepted the rule change that lets them a single person call for it if he didn't want to be removed like that.
Luckily, the same rule the extreme crazies called for to agree to McCarthy would allow a single House member to call a vote to remove McCarthy in that situation.
If the alt crazies refuse to govern, it only takes like 4 or 5 GOP moderates to cross the aisle to remove McCarthy, vote in a moderate Speaker, and end the crisis.
McCarthy has already demonstrated that he cares more about placating the crazies in his party, and the rank-and-file GOP has also shown they are willing to go along.
Yeah but in that negotiation, his own power was at stake.
For blocking the debt ceiling, he just has to worry about the state of the economy and welfare of the American people.
Since he doesn't care about these things, he can afford to drive a harder bargain.
It is difficult to understate the tremendous pressure this is going to put on McCarthy.
If the crazies get their way, he is going to have to stand alone as the public face of a completely preventable global economic crisis.
