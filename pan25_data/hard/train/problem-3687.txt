So, just to see if I got this right.
Trump is saying that a private corporation choosing to not allow links to a single news story is "fraud".
And he's saying that "Fraud" means we need to get rid of the US constitution?
He's seriously arguing he was the right to get rid of the constitution because Twitter didn't allow a link?
Trump is basically arguing he should be reinstated as Twitter chose not to post a Hunter dick pic .. oh and the Constitution nullified (note: idea from another post on a similar thread).
No he's saying that since hunter had dick pics that were STOLEN and revenge posted online, the 2020 election was invalid.
So they spent the last couple days looking at Hunter Biden's dick pics and now they are really upset because they didn't get to see them earlier due to revenge porn laws and Twitter taking them down.
But the Twitter expos√© was just emails about the democrats asking Twitter to take Hunters dick pics down, and also information about how Twitter came to the decision to censor one of the New York Post's tweets about Hunter Budens laptop.
Not any new nefarious plot from the democrats and Twitter execs forming a cabal to control the spread of information, just two SEPARATE topics they are using to convince their base by only sharing half of each story.
