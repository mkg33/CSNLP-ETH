⚡️Ukraine expects to receive an invitation to NATO as early as July of this year, — Verkhovna Rada spokesman Ruslan Stefanchuk.
What is funny to me is that when I talk about Russian advances before other people, people just say oh that's interesting.
But when I talkn about Ukrainian advances the Russians come out of the woodwork to be like NOOO URSSS LYYAAAANG....
How much do most Russians care about who controls Crimea and Donbass?
If Putin's government falls, who are most likely to take over?
People who are more or less hawkish?
How widespread is the view (be it among elites or other Russians) that Russia should either withdraw (including from Donbass and Crimea), or at the very least stop attacking and take it from there?
Isn't the threat of us letting them join DURING the war the last tiny little carrot and stick we have to convince Russia to back off and return to the original lines pre 2014?
The idea that the West doesn't have enough F-16s or that it's some kind of super advanced weapons systems that must not fall into Russia's hands are both bad excuses.
We have plenty and Russia/China have already scrutinized the Venezuelan and Pakistani F-16s.
