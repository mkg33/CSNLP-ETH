When Israel was founded every Jew in the world could move there if they chose and become citizens.
The only thing the Arab nations have done is use the Palestinians to fight a proxy war that they could not win on the battlefield.
The Arab armies had the best equipment and training supplied to them by the British, including British officers who led Arab troops.
They were defeated by a raag army, with no training, and limited equipment.
The Arabs have proved they can't live in peace and are only interested in the total destruction of Israel and its citizens.
And some Palestinians will fight back, otherwise innocent Israelis will be harmed.
This of course perpetuates the cycle of violence and trauma.
And Israel will impose collective punishment.
And on and on it goes.
In the meantime, whenever the government in Israel has troubles you can be assured that they will do something to distract.
In this case, by “legalizing” illegal statements which are illegal seizures of Palestinian land and homes.
Subsequently the Israeli security forces will move in and protect the areas, Palestinians have a choice; either accept and live or, to resist and die.
That’s it.
