Totally see your point - location based choices.
Our same home in CA would probably bury us in electricity cost.
We happen to be in a co-op that’s only raised electric prices once in 6 years making it affordable.
Solar is an option for us but the payoff calculator says about 15 years.
Current home- 2500 sq ft, all electric with heat pump.
Winter bill is $400 month.
About the same price as gas heat homes in the NE that get below 10f frequently.
Still so much coal and oil burning furnaces in the NE.
I’m all for upgrading efficiency for environmental purposes but many can’t afford to keep proper food on the table let alone 20k for heat pump and air handler.
That’s if you have vents in place already.
Yup, grew up in a coal mining town.
Propane ftw with so many power outages.
Could cook and have hot water for showers.
Water pressure provided by gravity from a few hundred feet difference from the reservoir to our homes.
Wood stove for heat.
The other thing is stoves.
If power goes out and you have no heat, but you DO have a gas stove, then you can still keep the pipes warm and make warm drinks/food, which is a big deal.
Had gas furnaces in most of the places I’ve lived, and at all of them, when the electricity got knocked out the heat stopped working.
Sure, theoretically you could start the gas furnace or oven with a lit taper, but that’s a quick road to an explosion or gas poisoning.
My point with stoves is more that the one thing they say here every single time when there is a blizzard with a possibility of power outages is to never use a gas oven to heat homes.
And by “here” I mean Western New York, not Reddit.
