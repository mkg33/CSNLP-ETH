wouldn't it be really awkward if you were in an international competition and someone came up and apologized to you because your countries are at war, idk.
I don't think it's necessary to present Russia in a better or kinder light, and it certainly wouldn't be that woman's responsibility.
it's a beauty pageant.
edit: to clarify, I think a display of solidarity would have been a great gesture, and I think it's fucked up if Miss Russia is using the seemingly innocuous selfies to push some propaganda back home, just saying that expecting an apology from someone who's ostensibly your coworker for their government's actions that they had nothing to do with is ridiculous.
y'all are grasping at air trying to defend this Russian propaganda actor because Miss Ukraine said she didn't even show show sympathy before trying to take a selfie with her.
>"Until the very last moment I hoped that Miss Russia would come up to me and say sorry, but she only came up to me to get a selfie for what I think were propaganda purposes," Apanesenko told the Daily Beast.
"Miss Russia did not say a word about the war.
People told me it would be dangerous for her.
".
That's not the case.
They just need a visa to enter, and if they're on a sanctions list they're probably not getting a visa.
But normal Russians are still being issued travel visas to the US.
