The VA Democratic Party is still upset about that.
Originally the Dem one by a single vote.
The recount confirmed it but there was one vote that was thrown out that they allowed in the recount and tied it.
So it went to a coin toss and the Dems lost the house of delegates.
This story talks about how NH Republicans drew their own maps for this election and still lost seats.
In addition, this Democrat candidate won by only one vote after the recount.
With recounts I always expect both candidates to get more votes.
Counting votes seems super basic and something we should have perfected by now.
As an IT person that just blows my mind.
It should be very easy to make 99.9% accurate counting machines that you just feed on paper ballots.
And then hand counting takes place for a certain % to verify the machines are counting accurately.
A completely non network capable machine.
Open sourced programming.
Hand counted sounds silly with how stupid the average person is and how error prone that process is with how many votes there are.
People make mistakes counting votes all the time in every single election, itâ€™s expected.
This count is probably wrong as well.
State law will dictate how many recounts can happen.
