Simple.
USM Athletics Foundation are top donors to Phil Bryant and later Tate Reeve's campaign.
Follow the money.
Favre says build me a new stadium.
USM says how are we gonna pay for it.
Favre calls in some favors from his buddy Phil, Phil contacts Nancy New and said redirect me some TANF funds and she does it.
And now that both Phil and Brett are taking heat they asked their friend Tate to kill the investigation.
Tate fires the attorney who sent subpoenas to the USM Athletic Foundation.
I bet if you could read Tate's text messages there'd be all the proof you need that he was asked to run interference for the investigation by both Brett and Phil.
I looked into starting one and realized without support from extremely wealthy individuals, dark money, corruption, etc I could not raise the amount of funds the big guys do nor could I skirt the law to gain an advantage like the big guys.
Since the likes of Tate, Phil, etc only respond to money I realized the voice($) I could muster wouldn't be enough for them to hear.
Sadly that's the state of politics when elected representatives are hopelessly corrupt.
Seriously - what is the lower bound of effective political corruption?
$100k?
$25k?
Why don’t “we” just start paying bribes to politicians for them to do good things.
They don’t give a shit about the issues as long as they get their cut, right ?
