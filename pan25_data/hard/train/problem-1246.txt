My pleasure I was a tour guide for many years so my brain is filled with random facts and stories that Iâ€™ll probably never have use for in my life again, so anytime I spot a chance to throw one out there on the web I do.
Fun fact!
In the medieval ages the line of thinking was that churches and cathedrals were the closest to god you could get on earth, so when being buried you wanted to be as close as possible to them.
This led to the churches selling burial plots beneath the floors of the churches, which only the very wealthy could afford.
The rest about rich people buying plots beneath the floors of churches (or even in the walls!)
is true, though.
I'm pretty sure "stinking" used this way is an entirely American expression, and therefore much, much newer than medieval times.
Anyway, "stinking" in this context just means offensively and the first use of the term stinking rich comes from the early to mid 20th century American sources.
I looked this one up based on your original comment and both references said that they were "Tour guide fables" with no basis in fact.
