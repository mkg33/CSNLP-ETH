I think you are gonna have a hard time convincing Ukraine to use diplomacy when a 1/4 of the country is still occupied by Russia and there infrastructure has been destroyed.
Any deal where Russia evacuates Ukraine entirely and Ukraine hops on the NATO bus (assuming NATO in its entirety agrees to let Ukraine join) is such an insane win that it’s difficult to explain.
I mean, I could see if the deal is Russia gets out of Ukraine (all of Ukraine, to include Crimea), gives back all the people they kidnapped, and pays hefty reparations, and NATO troops will be around to make absolutely sure there is not a repeat.
Hell, I'm active duty and I'd gladly volunteer for a deployment to a hypothetical NATO joint base in Ukraine.
Ultimately it's about what Ukraine wants, so I'm interested to hear what Zelensky's demands would be to end the conflict, and I'm all for the US throwing economic, diplomatic, and military support behind whatever that is.
I think we should let the Ukrainians negotiate its peace with Russia, we and I mean the U.S. need to start looking on what’s good for Ukraine and not what’s good for the U.S. president Biden is right about allowing the Ukrainians handle this, even though we supported them with everything that we could possibly provide within the law, it doesn’t give us the authority to dictate to negotiate their peace with Russia.
We need to remember that they are the ones who suffered the bombing and destruction of their country, infrastructure and war crimes to mention some.
It is fair to say that they sacrificed everything to defeat the Russians something that no other country has done before in the modern ages.
