Having classified documents means that you're the only person that can view them you can't share them with your spouse, kids, acquaintances, coworkers, or lovers.
You are responsible for these documents and must guard these secrets.
You are the only one that can look at them.....
He doesn't know where the duck these documents are.
He needs to hire an outside party to find them.
That means that he knows that he had more in his possession, and can not account for them.
There is no accountability shield and blaming third parties for not finding purposefully hidden documents.
This is to create a patsy third-party to blame when itâ€™s revealed Trump is still retaining top secret documents that he stole.
The lawyers might be doing the same trick here with hiring yet another party and that would insulate Trump who could have deniability (1st party -.
"People close to Mr. Trump had said earlier on Wednesday that no classified material had been found during the searches, a claim that was later proved incorrect".
and he is hiring people like creating front companies to take the hit.
He knows he has more docs and if he can get a "independent" team to sign off on the looking around he is insulated.
If you are one of these team DO NOT let them have you sign a lie or deception.
You will go to jail and provide deniability to Trump.
