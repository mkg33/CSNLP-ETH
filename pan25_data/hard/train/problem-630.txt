I think it’s going to require some creative thinking.
Just raising the legal marriage age for girls to 21 won’t do it.
Many of those young women want to marry and have a family instead of going to University.
Keeping them from marriage once they are fully grown and have finished primary education is as patronizing as marrying them off as children is.
They are saying that by cracking down on child marriages and raising the age for legal marriage, girls can complete an education.
Educated and employed women have less babies and that will help with population control.
(Not said in the article but work with many Indian ladies who say this is what is happening, and they are happy about it - an educated woman has more choices.
).
India has a space programme.
Not exactly a developing country, but one where they have so many people, an inbuilt (illegal) caste and sexist system that poorer communities still grip on to as a way of survival.
