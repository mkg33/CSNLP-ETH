As a Canadian who is ABC, and will never own a gun, even I agree that the hare-brained gun control bill the Liberals trot out like clockwork every election cycle or so, is a complete waste of time.
They make something that seems good to undecided voters in urban centres (whose votes they need), that doesn't actually do much in favor of gun control, and yet massively inconveniences tons of law-abiding rural Canadians (whose votes they would never be able to get).
guns are a fickle thing when it comes to government utilization, and I don't want to get into the native canadian population's relationship with their government.
If the reports are accurate and the Canadian gov't does pursue bans on hunting guns, wouldn't that disproportionately effect the indigenous people in rural areas who rely on subsistence hunting?
It started out as something that affected only a small percentage of Canadians, and after the amendments, every hunter can look at the list and find something similar to what they're using to put for on the table.
