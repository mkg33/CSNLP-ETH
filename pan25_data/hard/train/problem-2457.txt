It's common to think "we'll deal with the situation when all the Republicans are pushed out", but it doesn't work that way.
And the idea that they "like candidates that violently try to overturn peaceful election" is based on one incident with one man during a period when, yes, the MAGA crowd was completely batshit.
Not a majority, but large enough to do damage.
If you want to criticize republicans, let's focus on issues like Roe vs. Wade, where it's very clear that most of them think abortion should be illegal.
Democrats being more intelligent through leveraging buffoon republicans (by giving republicans more rope to hang themselves with) in order to smokescreen their own areas of corruption doesn't make them innocent.
I find it so aggravating that Republicans largely want to get elected simply so they can disrupt the government from functioning and helping the people just to make Democrats look bad so hopefully voters put them back in power later.
Excellent.
Perfect guy for the Democrats to approach as being speaker of the house.
Just need a few other republicans that hate the MAGA idiots to get onboard with it.
