If you don't believe me just go to Holland.
All the affirming churches are dying a slow and inglorious death.
Go to the states - all the mainline denominations that have liberalized are shrinking at a spectacular rate.
That's funny because in the US it's the hardcore evangelical denominations shedding members faster than ever to mainline groups.
There's a broad decline in people identifying as Christian, including among Republicans, and that decline includes evangelical Protestants, while the share of evangelicals among those identifying as Christian is about the same as it was in the past.
If you have some additional take about a subset of evangelical denominations and want to call it "facts", you'd better have some data to back that up.
I don't think the person you replied to mentioned the (First, I assume) Council of Nicaea anywhere.
Ecumenical councils dealing with definitions of the ciblical canon are a thing, both in the early Church and later, like the Council of Rome.
What facts?
You've just stated things without any evidence.
/u/Mushroom_Tip at least linked some article that quotes relevant data.
If only there were on this kind of thing.
The share of people who identify as Christian and regularly attend church is the same as a decade ago, but the total number of people identifying as Christian is declining, resulting in fewer people attending church.
Relative and total numbers and all that.
