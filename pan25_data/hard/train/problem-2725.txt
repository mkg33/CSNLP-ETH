Did you miss the part where "Anyone wishing to hold on to their weapon (must) seek to obtain a legal permit" No gun rights in France, just a government granted privilege for the well connected.
>Anyone wishing to hold on to their weapon and join the ranks of France’s 5 million legal gun owners can do so if they seek to obtain a legal permit.

Yes.
In big cities like Marseilles or Paris it's mostly gang related with more modern weapon or ex soviet stocks coming from Eastern european countries but in the country side lots of murder or aggression are made with these old timers weapon.
It's not the same volume as gun violence in USA mind you but still.
Shooting/Murder of neighbours/ex wife etc in rural places are made with these weapons in France, not M4 like in the US.
And since a lot of them are unregistered since it's heirlooms who should have been declared and get proper registration, it make it harder for the police to identify the author of a gun crime, from what I understand.
