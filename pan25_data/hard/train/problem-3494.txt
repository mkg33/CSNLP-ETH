Yermak, Reznikov, and Zaluzhnyi had a joint phone call with their US counterparts.
I'd say that it's a safe bet that the Patriot missile defense system is definitely going to Ukraine.
"Talking with @iocmedia President Bach I noted the support for 🇺🇦 athletes.
Urged to contribute to rebuilding 🇺🇦 sports objects destroyed by RF.
Upset with the intention to return RF's & 🇧🇾's athletes to world competitions.
Аs long as RF destroys peaceful life – only isolation.
".
Sure.
But I don't think anyone expects an actual peasant revolt, regular civilians taking up arms.
That's what Rosgvardiya is for.
Any bread riots will be put down ruthlessly.
Civilians are no threat to Putin.
I believe that's the only place we can expect grassroots critical mass that can topple Putin.
A military coup is less likely because Putin is so far hesitant to purge his generals.
Putin is literally betting that Ukraine will run out of shells before he runs out of cannon fodder.
Well they continued, and Russia just attaked Kyiv again Time to send the fucking long range weapons and fuck Russia up.
It’s funny to think about Russia going “Oh, you promised to send EVEN MORE modern and devastating equipment if we do the thing?
Well now we’ll do the thing As soon as possible”.
