I have not.
I grew up in Eastern Europe, consuming the same media available to any Russian and I knew about Chernobyl before any movie was made about it.
I would argue that this is Soviet history just as much as Ukrainian history.
But overall I feel that this entire discussion is built on the false premise that “if they don’t teach you about something in school, you won’t know it”.
My original argument was/is that the Chernobyl disaster is known to Russian people.
I cannot speak for what is taught/not taught in Russia, but Chernobyl has a presence in the RuNet and I am not aware of any attempts to suppress information about it.
With that said, their current government is trying hard to bend history to make themselves look good, so maybe we will see that in the near future.
Yes and that’s literally what my original comment says.
If there are Russians that don’t know about it, it’s not because Chernobyl is Russia’s Tiananmen Square, but because those people live in poverty and it’s just one of the numerous things they don’t know.
I went to school in Ukraine in the 00s and it was taught to us.
I guess mileages vary.
Not surprised about the blackout as it was happening though.
The Soviet handling of the disaster was terrible.
However, what I do not buy is this idea that, for most Russians, the term “Chernobyl” does not ring any bells.
I can't say whether Russians teach about Chernobyl or not.
But as a Bulgarian (and when it comes to political issues pre-1989, we're kind of a mini-Russia) let me tell you what I know:
2.
In the 90s and 00s, nobody taught about Chernobyl, even after communism had fallen and we were "free" from Russia.
Yes, it was openly discussed, told to us by our parents, we had monthly visits from the doctors at school to give us some yellow pills (iodine, to help expel any residual Iodine 131 present in our bodies), but this was never taught at school.
