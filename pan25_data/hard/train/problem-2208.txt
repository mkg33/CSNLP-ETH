Who decides when this is voted on?
They keep voting knowing there is no winner coming.
Does a specific person say, alright it’s time to vote, or do they vote ever X amount of hours?
I know they vote but I read it as someone from R says “we nominate Macarthy” and then everyone votes.
And every time someone does that everyone votes.
So Ds can say, we nominate “Jeffries” knowing they won’t win but it forces everyone to vote again.
So it would be trolling the Rs by forcing them to vote when they know they haven’t figured out who to vote for as majority yet and the Ds know they won’t win.
I just wasn’t sure how this works.
Any idea who has been getting nominated?
Has it always been Macarthy?
Cause why keep nominating him until he has the vote?
Are the Dems nominating Jeffries just to troll republicans knowing they don’t have votes yet.
Democrats aren’t nominating Jeffries just to troll, it’s standard for the minority party to nominate and vote for their leader even if their is a 0% chance they win.
It happens every session this one is just special because Republicans have such a slim majority and can’t unite behind one person.
