Just tough it out, all you can do.
I smoked from 14 till 40 and you just have to deal with those rough 2 weeks and after that it's way easier.
I was having constant sinus infections and felt like shit every day, I feel 1,000 times better now.
You just have to find something to do while the worst of it is going on and when you get the urge just do all you can to distract your attention.
You really will not regret it and will look at people smoking after a month or two and wonder why you ever did it.
Also, as a decade long pack a day smoker, these threads are the only place you see people calling for not banning tobacco, in my expirance at least.
I get so much shit for smoking in the real world.
I've never met anyone who told me that I should keep smoking cause it's my choice.
I'm in my late 30s, and most of my friends are ex-smokers who were only able to quit smoking by switching to vaping.
Yes old people will be able to just hand cigarettes to young people but it will lessen availability and rates and work over years to lessen the affects.
So yeah, in 10 years time you might see plain packaging on alcohol if it follows the same continuum.
The reason I started with Americans is because this is how you do reform and this is what you need for guns.
