This is an archaic Law that the population passively abided by because it did not have that big of an effect on their day to day life.
That is literally what they get paid to do.
Police and enforce current laws.
All the troubles of the world come down to over-enforcement.
But when a dissenter of said Law is brutally killed while enforcing it, it's time to reasses the nessacity of the Law itself.
It is possible to acknowledge that prior Written Laws exist, but problems arise when a ruler forgets why Written Law was wrote down in the first place.
Itâ€™s also an example of an unwritten rule that had to be codified into law after someone broke it.
Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first and only four term president, and while history regards him as one of the greatest presidents, it did highlight the dangers of one man having too much power and essentially become President for Life.
The 22nd Amendment, which codified the two term limit into the Constitution, went into effect six years after Roosevelt left office.
