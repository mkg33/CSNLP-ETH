Article says they are looking at giving them a bunch of other vehicles, possible even other tank like vehicles, just not m1 Abrams main battle tanks.
That's not really 'no tanks', it's just literally 'no m1 Abrams' and it's mostly due to the logistics and training requirements for them.
Edit I'm not so sure anymore about this decision.
The US has a lot of tanks... as another poster said we should just give some m1 Abrams to the UK or other nato countries to backfill for tanks they are giving to Ukraine, I don't see the problem here.
There has to be a way we an utilize hundreds of tanks that the US doesn't need and Ukraine cannot use.
I saw some saying back-fill other nations tanks that would be suitable.. but I don't claim to know how feasible that is.
Can we really ask other NATO countries, such as Germany, to train entire new tank crews?
I wish we could just plop some M1 tanks on Ukraine and have them be useful... we have more than we would need and they were built specifically for that type of war.
The A-10 can probably take the hit, but would be a sitting duck against an air superiority fighter.
I think that's really the main problem... the sky is contested.
