But the body count in Ukraine keeps going up and sooner or later one of the Generals (or oligarchs) is going to explain to him the definition of "fragging"...
A lot of people had quibbles with your comment, but none of them pointed out that "regime change", by assassination, is exactly what Russia has been trying to do to Ukraine.
Ukraine says they won't negotiate in Putin, but if pigs fly and Putin one day just says "fuck it, we'll rolling back to 1990s borders", I'm fairly certain the Ukrainians will start to talk.
Ultimately they care more about making themselves whole than replacing Putin, especially since there's no guarantee any Putin replacement won't be even worse.
Because Putin went from president to defacto dictator and cleared out all positions of government and replaced them with yes men there is no longer a clear idea of who would replace him.
When Putin dies there will be more government murders than have happened this year, possible bombing of homes and government buildings of the next guy trying to gain control at any means.
Russia will be even worse off and take.
Over by who ever is the most power hungry.
Likely one of the top generals as they have the weak remnants of an army to back them.
If they want to talk to putins successor they need to get rid of Putin and let the war between who takes over end.
