Yeah, and I was insulted and ridiculed for saying that people who think trump is going to prison for stealing the documents are delusional, and here we are, his taxes are the new thing...
Donald Trump's taxes do prove what an awful poor business guy he is, but isn't causing a deadly insurrection or stealing top secret government documents make for higher grounds that lead to prosecution?
Ignore the clickbait headline - the real scandal of the Trump tax returns is that it highlights a system that allows high worth individuals to get away with what is effectively tax evasion.
Trump was audited for multiple years, from 2009-2013 under the Obama Admin - and he basically paid no tax.
The system allowed it.
That's the scandal.
This should not be allowed to be made into a red-blue issue.
It's not even about Trump.
It's about the system that Washinon DC has put in place that targets ordinary working Americans and high net worth individuals largely get away with paying little to no tax.
Democrats will try and make this scandal about Trump.
It's really not.
Both parties have put this system in place.
