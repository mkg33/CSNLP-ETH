Most of the time, especially when you're voting for a legislator, you're voting for a party, not a person.
I'd absolutely vote for a dumb Democrat over a smart Republican (in theory, if a smart Republican can be found).
There's no way I'd vote for a Republican over a Democrat.
I'd vote for a corrupt Democrat over an honest Republican.
it's the congressional vote that matters at this point.
If Walker was the smartest man on the planet it'd still be hypocrisy to vote for him over Warnock if you're an evangelical.
Warnock is a fucking pastor and Walker abused his family, and “christian’s” will vote for Walker just because he has an R next to his name, you can’t get more hypocritical than that.
I get people want to lay the hypocrisy card at the feet of the evangelicals here for voting walker over warnock, but the hypocrisy was already made when they decided Republicans were their party.
Look, in a general election it really does come down to R vs D. The candidate largely doesn't matter once you get to the general.
