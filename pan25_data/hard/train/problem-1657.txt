I honestly don't see any hope of abortion ever being legal in the US.
That would require a progressive dem house, >60 senators and the president.
But more importantly can Dems not push through a voting rights act through the house now?
Kill gerrymandering, secret donors and voter disenfranchisement?
And next term pass it through the Senate?
Assuming they get a bigger majority in the runoffs?
Dems could have pushed through an Abortion Rights law, but Kirsten Sinema helped Republicans with the veto to block it.
I've argued with a lot of conservatives about abortion.
Even some people I know IRL.
There is a complete disconnect between their ideology and reality on this issue.
The same women who have told me the horrors of their birth story... will turn around within the confines of the abortion debate and tell me that childbirth is not severe pain and suffering.
They will make it seem like a walk in the park.
Especially once I start proving that childbirth is torture by showing them the definition of torture.
Not only is childbirth torture but just carrying the child in some cases is torture.
The amount of long term pain I had during pregnancy was increased because I have a connective tissue disorder, but no woman should be forced to endure the amount of dislocations I did daily without pain medicine because “fetus more important than you”.
