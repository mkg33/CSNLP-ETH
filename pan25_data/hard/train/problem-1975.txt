It comes up.
You can’t force people to fight, it is wrong and morally evil.
It I am going to fight it is gonna be my choice and if I chose to flee with my family that is my choice.
It seems you missed the point where I said flee with my family.
It is not wrong to not want to fight for your nation, there is a difference between being a coward and deciding that fight is not one you want to take part in.
I never said I would flee, but it is everyone’s individual choice.
If you sacrifice the ideals of your nation just because you are at war then what are you fighting for.
If a country is worth fighting for people will choose to fight for it if you have to force them then the country isn't that great.
The alternative is to ask the people who want to fight to fight and not try and force the ones who don't.
If your country is actually worth anything you'll have enough people volunteer.
If you can't get enough people to volunteer the country is probably not worth saving anyway.
It implies 12,000 felt it was worth the risk and potentially death to try and get out to avoid fighting.
Edit: imagine arguing this foolish idea in a thread stating that more than 12,000 people have tried to flee.
Stupidity at its finest.
