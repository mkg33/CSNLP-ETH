He won't tell until someone makes him President again.
So, he is basically bribing Ukraine yet again.
Also, America.
Quid pro quo, Clarice.
I am currently listening to a book called The Hidden History of American Oligarchy by Thom Hartmann, and it is pretty good at illustrating the previous attempts at the Oligarchical control of our country since inception.
Our lives and our thoughts are almost entirely controlled by a very few people/corporate entities.

In short, they're traitors.
Trumps is a traitor to this country.

Send his sorry ass to russia and let him lick Putin's boots.
Ok, tell Putin to stop it.
Do it right now.
You can't negotiate as an official US rep, but use that personal touch to convince him to stop.
