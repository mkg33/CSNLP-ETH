Ignorant fools like yourself excel at putting words in other people's mouths and then proceed to smugly destroy an argument that was never even made.
Give yourself a pat on the back buddy, you're doing well!
Israel is a radical terrorist government.
Wtf argument are you trying to make, as if Israel is anything but one of if not the most oppressive and tyrannical government in existence.
I've never seen such confidently brazen ignorance disguised as intelligence.
Let me break it down to you in simpler terms.
If Israel did not exist, there would be no brutal oppression and apartheid that would require the formation of a resistance group to counter brutal oppression.
What makes you think an independent Palestine without Israel would've been immune to the same kind of radicalization we see all across the middle east?
You said that in Israel's absence, a secular government would be in control just like before Israel; In real life, before Israel the place was basically a colony, and not controlled by the local arabs.
If it was controlled by the local arabs, they would establish a country that's similar to Afghanistan today.
This is an insane take.
If Israel ceases to exist, Hamas or a similar extremist Islamic organization would take over the whole place and you'd have a second Afghanistan.
