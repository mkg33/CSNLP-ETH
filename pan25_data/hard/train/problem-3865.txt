Seriously.
Of course America has done fucked up stuff like every other country, but there's a reason we're the leaders of the NATO military and there's a reason everyone runs to us when China or Russia start acting up.

Japan is responsible for their own country's destruction in WWII...same as Germany.
They decided to attack all their surrounding Asian countries and tried to conquer them for their own gains.
They committed the mass genocide of 10 million or more people before America finally put a stop to that bullshit.
Nor should you, WWII was brutal and both sides did unsavory things at times.
But it's very clear which side was morally superior to the other...the Allied forces weren't performing mass genocide and they weren't the aggressors who started it in the first place.
We also saved Southeast Asia from continuing mass genocide by the Japanese.
Oh, and then we spent billions of dollars rebuilding Japan into a modern democratic power.
Japan is modern, but not really democratic.
It is one party state (with Emperor as head of state).
They have elections and all, but Russia changes government more often then Japan.
