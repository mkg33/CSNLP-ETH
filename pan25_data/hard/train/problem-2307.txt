Denying the Russians' participation eight years ago at Danbas is like denying the participation of NATO troops on the Ukrainian side now.
But that's not what this is about.
It is about the purpose for which each side entered into the peace agreement in Minsk.
On logical reflection, there is no other reason for Russia to conclude the Minsk agreement except as a way to negotiate and solve the problem diplomatically.
2) Ukraine arming itself and preparing for a larger invasion makes sense even if they thought the Minsk agreements had any chance of bringing lasting peace.
It buying time isn't actually mutually exclusive with going into it in good faith.
1) Editorial note says that she meant it would buy time for a lasting peace.
You can believe that or not, but Angela Merkel is also the one criticized for attempting to use economic ties with Russia to prevent war.
Would be a strange move if it was all a ploy to prepare for war.
3) The Minsk agreements were sorta doomed from the start with Russia refusing to admit any involvement in the conflict.
You can't establish peace when the other party claims to not even be involved.
