From a practical standpoint, there aren’t many alternatives as I see it.
Disney would want a decent climate for year round operations, somewhere close to the Atlantic so you don’t pull from Disneyland and there’s decent access from Europe.
That would most likely rule out the Midwest and New England.
I mean, nobody is going to go to Disney Detroit or Magic Kingdom Baltimore in January.
It would be a massive footprint so they would need to acquire a significant amount of real estate for a decent price.
South Carolina still thinks the Civil War is hot.
North Carolina is pretty crowded in the Tri City area.
Virginia is getting a little far north weather wise.
Heading west, Mississippi or Alabama?
Yikes.
Northwest is Tennessee and Arkansas.
Talk about racing to the bottom.
Texas?
Greg Abbott and the rest of those cowboys would love that fight more than Desantis.
Georgia is pretty purple right now…it leans conservative but if you’re not careful those suburban women around Atlanta will clobber you.
Hence Biden and two Democratic senators.
Already has a significant entertainment presence.
Georgia might be Disney’s best option if it decides to pull the plug on Florida.
Genuine question, if Disney were to pull out of Florida, what would that do to their economy?
I imagine the state brings in a lot of tourism revenue because of Disneyland, so would their economy tank if Disney decided to leave?
But Florida is in a fix, and unless they want their taxpayers picking up Disney's slack in the billions of dollars, or even risking a move, if i were Disney, i'd look at my options.
Disney is better served by shaping the politics of where they are then throwing a temper tantrum and trying to finance a multi-decade trillion dollar building project to replace what they already have in-place.
