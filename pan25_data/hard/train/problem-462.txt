No, make them pay a royalty on all their pharmacy services for the rest of their existence and use those funds to combat addiction and to fund public research into medicine so less patents are owned by greedy capitalists looking to profit off pain and suffering.
Genuinely sick of these corpos paying what amounts to chump change in the grand scheme of things while they treat their employees like trash anyway.
Again though, making the claim that a giant corpo notorious for its poor treatment of workers and always seeking money over anything else would throw away a few billion in profit (which will fund their competitors) makes zero sense.
Not to mention it would hurt all their other profits bc now customers go to other grocery stores to get their meds, why not shop there too?
Youâ€™re talking billions in profit thrown away by a greedy corpo for no logical reason.
Which is why I ask for proof.
Sure, here's your proof.
Remember when walmart used to have an entire jewelry section, I'm talking nice full row of all the things in cases that would spin to show you their flashy crap?
Walmart has been phasing those out since 2018 because it isn't profitable.
They are entirely gone from over a third of the stores and have been getting cut from stores to make room for products that make them more money.
