> Many of the early leaders of Christian Nationalist, anti-integration, and other anti-Semitic groups had ties to WW2 era pro-fascist and pro-Nazi organizations.
Literally only people who encourage and defend nazis or who support white supremacist, fascist politicians and policies.
Saying they accuse everyone of it to try to trick people into disregarding accurate accusations doesn't work because most people aren't as stupid as the nazis who try it.
Nazis are humans, trying to lighten the definition of nazi tactics is itself a tactic to make them seem better.
Good thing no one calls everyone Nazis then.
If we can't call people Nazis because they're white supremacist fascists who support people that wave swastika flags at their rallies, then we're going to anyway.
Rejecting Nazis isn't extreme.
The USA's stance on Nazis used to be to fly thousands of miles to shoot, stab, bomb, and burn them to death.
That wasn't extreme either, it was the bare minimum any decent human could do to protect the Nazis' innocent targets.
