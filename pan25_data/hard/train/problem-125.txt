A technical debate may decide whether more than 40 million Americans receive up to $20,000 in student-loan debt relief.
I generally agree, but student loan debt is so present in most Americanâ€™s lives that it would be hard to forget you owe $10,000 in predatory loans than you could have.
I expect a decision striking down student loans based on republican arguments such as "you took a loan, you pay it back" and "I paid my loans you should too!
".
Yes....yes it is.
You think people vote for a politician so they'll do things they don't support?
That's a stupid view if that's the case.
All those things you listed are happening in this country in areas where people elect politicians that do those things.
Ah yes, a politician doing the things their supporters want is "buying votes".
The entire purpose of supporting an elected official is so they do the things the voters wants.
No.....that's a literal example of someone voting for a politician because they said they would do a specific thing.
There are loads of single issue voters on the entire political spectrum.
