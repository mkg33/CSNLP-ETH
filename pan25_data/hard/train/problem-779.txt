Hum...
I disagree with the idea that Rodrigo Pacheco and Arthur Lira are Lula's allies that will help him push his agenda, like the Reuters article implies it.
They are centrists, not leftists.
And both served as the president of their respective chamber in Bolsonaro government.
They have no more affinity to Lula than the opposition.
Lula did have sort of a victory in the Senate today thought.
This is because the opposition candidate Rogerio Marinho sort of gave a decent fight on the Senate election (49x32 for Pacheco), and it was kind of important for the government that the Senate remain with a center party president, and not fell into the opposition hands, specially because the mains Lula's allies are the Supreme Court (And Lula will be able to indicate 2 additional judges) and the Senate is the only house that can legally punish judicial activism.
And having a center president on the Senate will be much better for the government to protect their allies on the Supreme Court.
They see the Supreme Court as an ally because then been working to secure democracy, that is what elected Lula.
For them, Supreme Court doing their job is allying with the devil, which is actually the victim of extremism.
