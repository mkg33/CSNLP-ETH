I think you are very uninformed.
He didnt lie shit, he went as unvaccinated with medical exemption, he even posted that on insta before boarding the plane (which stirred some shit and ultimately led to his deportation).
Australian ministry of immigration said that they dont accept medical exemptions and thats why they canceled his visa.
Basically there was misunderstanding between Vivtorian goverment and aus ministry of immigration, Novak wouldnt have tried to go to australia if he didnt get a green light in the first place.
Was he now?
Care to tell elaborate on that?
Why people before him on same medical exemptions were allowed in?
Why Victorian government assured him that its a viable option?
Why they canceled his visa mid flight, why they mistreated him in costudy, why they couldnt prove in court that he did anything wrong, why they used ministers discretional power (usually used for terrorists and criminals) to deport him?
Yeah, media didnt do him justice, and a lot of people here are completely uninformed and basing their hate on bogus headlines.
Even the topic of this thread is based on bullshit story taken out of context, and im very much the opposite of pro russia.
He shouldnt have been banned in the first place.
What reason to keep a ban now.
Some people here have no idea what happened last year, jist hating on Novak bevause media told them to.
And then same people are surprised that serbs support russia because of pro russian media...
Thank you again for pointing out the media bias against Serbia.
Take my upvote.
Here is that CNN news story:
For example, CNN did a story during the height of the pandemic about Serbia's incredible vaccine response.
Which at the time was best in Europe.
Instead of titling their news report "Serbia has the best...." they titled it "This mans country...".
