Russia just needs to keep failing badly long enough for Ukraine to fail spectacularly, and they will have won.
Russia is absolutely willing to do the same to Ukraine if they were to gain full territorial control.
That’s why it’s so important that they do not.
I think the level of aid pouring into Ukraine is likely to make that an impossibility, but that just shifts the calculus into a different place: Russia just needs to fail badly long enough for Putin to die of old age rather than assassination after having lost a war, and Putin will see the war as worth continuing.
My opinion is that it's due to how they never thought any of the said undermining could happen because Putin fully believed Ukraine would be militarily beaten in a relatively short time, after which it would receive no real help abroad and Russia could mop up at its leisure, allowing it to refocus on other pressing matters.
Instead Russia botched it and ended up mired in a conflict which it knew it had to win or it'd lose everything it had managed to gain in 2014 and after it, which in turn could easily spell the end of Putin and his entire regime nevermind the enormous loss of face, hence they're proverbially letting Rome burn in the background as they refuse to accept failure in Ukraine no matter the cost.
I'm not assuming a victory, but the amount of losses Russia has sustained, the period of time over which it's happened, and the lack of any appreciable improvement are all significant reasons to question Russia's abilities.
