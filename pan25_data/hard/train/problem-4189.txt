But that won't happen so Haiti will continue on their cycle of barely functioning and being a completely failed state.
I don’t think anyone thinks Haitians are implementing Anarchy as a political goal, they’re just falling apart.
So semantically you’re right, but in common parlance anarchy is synonymous with criminal chaos because lack of governance on large groups tends to degrade into that rather quickly.
I don’t think it’s a terribly unfair simplification.
Invading a country to force your way of life on them has, at least in recent history, not worked well at all.
Capitalism is an economic philosophy not a political one, though obviously economics influences politics as well.
But I don’t think anyone would say capitalism safeguards against those things.
A strong democratic republic with an independent justice system does address those things, and countries that seek that ideal have better track records than the alternatives.
What about the political philosophy of anarchy prevents falling into chaos with zero authority and criminal gangs running things?
I get that’s not what proponents of anarchy want, but I don’t see how you avoid that for long under anarchy.
