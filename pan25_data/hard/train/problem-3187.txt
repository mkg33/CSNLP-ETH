Or in case where a Nazi isn't allowed to spread their hate in a specific space (a university for example) -- Conservative's idea of free speech is forcing a captive audience to listen to their awful message.
The far right loves the free speech argument about a social media site because what they hear is that they'll have a large pool of people to harass and talk over, and that there won't be actual consequences for their behavior.
I think narcissism is part of it, certainly on the part of many right-wing politicians advocating the right-wing version of free speech.
However I think there's another aspect to it and that is the willingness of conservative voters to believe what the narcissists are saying.
I think what comes into play here is a predominantly right-wing belief that there is a natural god given order to things, a god-given (some believe literally god-given) way the world should work.
When the world repeatedly ceases to follow this envisioned natural order, and when those who advocate it get contradicted then people who think this way then conclude that the natural order isn't happening because people are working to prevent it, and contradicting people who advocate the natural order, and thus inhibiting it, are obscuring the message and thus suppressing free speech.
