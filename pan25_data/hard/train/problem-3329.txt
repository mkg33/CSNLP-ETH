Russian state propaganda has been trying to normalize violence against civvies at maximum gear ever since the 3 day war turned into a retreat from Kyiv.
It began with "ukrainian brothers being liberated from the nazi leadership", then turned sharply into "everyone who does not resist the nazi leadership is a nazi sympathiser".
We arent talking about gun violence, though.
Its pointless to go off topic in a random thread.
Its some weird whataboutism.
What do you want me to say, that US is desensitized to gun violence?
It has nothing to do with Russias state level propaganda with the intent of dehumanizing ukrainian population so that when the inevitable war crimes emerge, it will bear no domestic political cost.
The problem is the war its only being fought in Ukraine, with only Ukrainian civilians dying and Ukrainian cities being destroyed, they have moved to sending only people they can afford to lose to the battlefield and bombing it from afar.
Playing the time game only favours them since support from the west is uncertain to last if the conflict drags endlessly.
