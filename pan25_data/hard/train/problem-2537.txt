Well, the Independent State Legislature Theory is complete and utter bullshit and has no place even being discussed by the Supreme Court, so I’m glad you agree that Obama trying to forgo a constitutional process would be just as stupid.
McConnell abused his power.
The fault for Merrick Garland not being a Supreme Court Justices starts and stops there.
Yeah, these are the kinds of things Manchin is generally good about.
The Democratic Party lets him vote his way on some things, but when it comes to the big stuff he’s generally likely to fall in line, with the occasional negotiated concession on some future legislation.
But candidly I am sure you can find comments like these from many democrats and republicans pretending to be consistent with nominations even though they are not.
Personally I disagree him I thought Amy appointment was fine, not that I am a fan of her but republicans controlled the senate and POTUS and her nomination was fair game.
My issue was with Merick Garland being ignored by republican controlled senate so they could add Gorsuch.
I understand he is against adding more than 9 justices, but have not heard he would block a replacement if say Clarence Thomas stepped down.
But he is saying that he opposed rushing Amy to the bench and if dems had the same chance to do so he would oppose the same.
