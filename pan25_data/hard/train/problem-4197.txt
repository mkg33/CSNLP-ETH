Even if your kneecap is undamaged, your knee is still fucked and needs surgery.
Knee surgery and wounds don't only include the kneecap.
I thought that part was interesting and funny but the act is still horrific and yea, I am gonna go to a knee surgeon to fix my shit even if a bullet only hit the joint and not the cap, and I imagine the surgeons would still have plenty of practice on knee surgery even if only 2 caps were busted.
The part you brought up has nothing to do with how many were injured and needed surgery, it was solely about the term not being entirely accurate.
80 people still needed surgery on their knee dude, only 2 needed the cap fixed as well.
It is interesting only 2 had fractured kneecaps and the rest just had fucked up knees from the bullet but they still called it kneecapping.
Makes sense but still interesting.
I think thatâ€™s a discernment that must be made though.
Rescue workers in syria would be in danger because of Assad and the turbulence there.
But Turkey turned down Cyprus because Erdogan is a nationalist piece of shit.
