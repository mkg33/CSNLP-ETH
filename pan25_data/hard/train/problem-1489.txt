It is unclear what would replace the term Our Father in the Lord’s Prayer, the central Christian prayer that Jesus is said to have instructed his followers to say together down the generations.
A spokesperson for the Church of England said: “This is nothing new.
Christians have recognised since ancient times that God is neither male nor female, yet the variety of ways of addressing and describing God found in scripture has not always been reflected in our worship.
God is incorporeal so he does not have a sex, but it is not truthful to say or imply that the original hebrew scripture does not discuss him as being grammatically male, which it most certainly does.
Non trinity people will be just fine with the concept Jesus was a Jew descended from David, and ‘Son of God’ either means the Jewish version (ok, so God didn’t procreate) or the Angel lied and God came down for some funny business.
even if no funny business, the divinity was passed on to another distinct entity, therefore procreation.
Not to mention that ‘God’ is literally a non-gendered/sexed word and reference, in the Abrahamic sense.
I mean, even the label of "non-binary" is misleading, simply put, gender/sex isn't applicable to God.
It's like saying that the sun is non-binary, like maybe sure, but that qualification simply doesn't apply to the Sun.
