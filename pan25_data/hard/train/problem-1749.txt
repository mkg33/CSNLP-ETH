Do you really see no problem with the goverment circumventing our constitution just to achieve their ends?
Imagine being okay with our goverment locking people away without ever giving them a fair trial.
If they were as guilty as you said they were, then they should have been brought before the courts and let our system do its job.
You're very much right.
technically they were within their right but I can tell you this scared a lot of Americans to see their govermernt behaving this way and it brought up a lot of issues.
On the other hand, a lot of Americans saw nothing wrong with it so long as it protected their freedom so it's pretty messed up.
Probably because the US thought they could get more out of them by violating human rights.
Like I've said in my other posts, the entire setup of gitmo is fucked up, but lets not pretend like these people are innocents.
They shouldn't have been locked up in gitmo, but they sure as shit should have still rotted away in regular prisons.
It sure as shit prevented them from killing more people.
Probably saved the 14 year old "wife" he left when they were taken in 2002.
But please, you have a big heart, keep watching out for these terrorist/child rapists.
