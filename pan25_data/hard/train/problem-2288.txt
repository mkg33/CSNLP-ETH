Unfortunately there's no good way out.
Putin doesn't really care about Ukraine at this point - he cares about maintaining power...and his life.
And for the rest of us, the sad reality is if Putin goes we could very easily end up with someone far worse in control of Russia.
The best hope might be Ukraine boots Russia fully out of Ukraine but Putin manages to barely maintain power, at least for awhile, so there isn't a sudden and violent conflict in Russia.
My guess is that a lot of russia is undefended right now as they hollow out everything to feed the losses in ukraine and hope nobody notices.
Good time for georgia to take their lost land back.
With about a million total in their military, a 10:1 ratio russian military would be completely out of fighting soldiers at this point.
While I agree the military deaths on Ukraine's side are probably higher than 15k, I wholeheartedly believe they're significantly less than the Russian death toll.
The unfortunate part is the civilian death toll for Ukraine.
