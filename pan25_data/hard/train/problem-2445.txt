Obviously COVID's death count is much higher than H5N1's count so far, but H5N1 doesn't seem to be able to transmit from human to human yet.
Pretty much everyone that's gotten it either works closely with birds or ate an infected one.
The numbers will go through the roof if it mutates to transmit between humans, and that's the nightmare scenario people are worried about.
Also, severe illness of any kind tends to have lasting effects on the human body - there's no reason to think COVID is unique in this regard.
Long flu is a known thing too, and anything bad enough to have a 60% mortality rate is almost certain to have lasting effects on survivors.
This thing is insanely bad news if it's ever able to transmit between humans, and it'll be bad enough with people thinking it'll be like COVID.
The last thing we need is people spreading the idea that it'll be less severe, or worse, comparing it to swine flu, which is even less deadly than the seasonal flu.
And our understanding of flu vaccines are way deeper than corona was as we have been working on those for over a century.
In fact they're making.
