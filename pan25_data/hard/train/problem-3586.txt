Seems like Qatar just decided, when it was past the point of no return for moving the tournament, that they are going to do whatever the hell they want, and no one can stop them.
Funny joke, but in all seriousness, if I were there I would be planning on leaving early, it feels like Qatar might just decide it wants to round people up at any minute.
My take is that FIFA has been telling everyone for years “don’t worry, Qatar will be great hosts,” and at this point FIFA is too embarrassed to sanction Qatar and thereby admit they were even a little bit wrong.
It's ok, there is no way that fifa boss Gianni Infantino will let Qatar boss him around and he is above reproach as he has absolute no connection to Qatar... checks notes... Ahh, it seems he moved himself and his family to Doha over a year ago and pays "rent" on a house - probably to one of the members of the royal family...
He response will be something along the lines of "Nothing to see here, and stop wearing fucking rainbow hats.
By the way I should know what it's like to be persecuted, because I used to have rainbow colored hair".
