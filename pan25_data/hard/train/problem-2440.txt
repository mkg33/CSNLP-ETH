I can't imagine the soul crushing life those residents endure every day, living next to a 200 foot tall mountain of garbage rotting in the sun.
I'm sure India has some nice spots but I can't remember the last post I saw that didn't portray the country as a post apocalyptic disaster.
Well my issue isn't that they portray the bad side (and India has a quite a lot of it) but rather its only about the bad side, which makes it sound like its an unlivable place from the outside.
I mean I wasn't talking about the economy at all since the original comments were saying how India is overpopulated and is full of garbage lol.
I just mentioned a reason why India has so much garbage thrown around and why some other countries doesn't have that.
People throw garbage on the streets even when dustbins are around.
If you ask them why don't you use the dustbins, they will be like "Why do you care?".
These same people on the other hand would keep their homes neat and clean so I dunno why they refuse to keep the public places clean.
