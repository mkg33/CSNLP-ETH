A corporation is a legal fiction that enables durable contracts that are not void upon death of the contracting party.
Corporations are amoral, profit-seeking mechanisms.
No corporation would pull out of Russia as long as its shareholders could see returns for doing business there.
Companies will leave Russia when it stops being profitable to be there.
Don't shame them, fine them.
They arent fools either.
Likely most are already aware that it could backfire, yet the possible profit from doing business in Russia is likely far higher than a few sad, lost costumers over here.
b) There is stuff that has no military purpose and if the company stopped selling or producing in Russia, you're causing more damage to your company then to Russia.
Would you want to waste money on some random companies not selling their shit in Russia anymore?
Because whether you pay the company for not doing so, pay by caring for the people getting fired (or never emloyed) because you, or pay by missing out on taxes you lose because of oportunity cost, you are very likely gonna pay for it in some way.
