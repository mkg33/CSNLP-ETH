Of course Ukraine was extremely weak and vulnerable in 2014/2015, and of course a deal was needed to stabilize the country and stop the clashes.
As a matter of fact, it was Russia starting the conflict in 2014 by violating the sovereignty of Ukraine and forcefully invading Crimea.
And as a matter of fact, Russia itself has proven on February 24, 2022 that the fears of Ukraine and the West about more Russian aggression, more land grabbing, more annexations were totally justified.
Ah yes, the American weapons manufacturers used the Russian army to invade Ukraine….
welp I can see I’m talking to a uh, special, so I’m going to leave you to it.
Also honestly if even if they did (which no of course not that’s clearly nonsense) the fact that the Russian government agreed to start a war on behalf of American companies makes them look a lot worse than anyone else.
I don't disagree with the assertion here, just that true or not, it doesn't matter as it worked well enough for the Russians to commit and is an underlying premise for their war effort.
