Dang, for a second there I was suspicious we were related.
Brought our NICU baby home a year ago and the entire family knew we wanted everyone vaccinated - for everything - if they wanted to see her.
Most people obliged, except my father and my wife’s siblings.
So we spent Christmas alone, because my wife’s siblings refused to vaccinate and ended up catching Covid, then refused to sit out from Christmas, and ended up getting several people there sick.
Oh, and my wife’s parents both have cancer.
Haven’t talked to my own father since I told him my wife was pregnant and that he’d need to be vaccinated.
My grandma won't get the covid vaccine "because I've had the flu shot and still got the flu, so I don't need it because vaccines don't work".
Like she has to remember friends who died of polio and has to remember standing in line when the vaccine truck came through town, but she's stuck on "vaccines don't work".
They are so uneducated about science that they believe "vaccine = guaranteed to not get it" and they flip their shit if they get it anyway and then believe vaccines just don't do anything at all.
(obvious exception being people who have a real medical reason that their doctor advises them they shouldn’t get the vaccine).
I work at an urgent care and the amount of people still unvaccinated and determined that what they have isn't COVID is astounding this far into the pandemic.
