That is practically how it is here (USA).
You can make people sign noncompete, but it's not enforceable unless you give them something for it.
But there are plenty of people who sign those that do not understand how completely unenforceable those clauses are.
99% of non-compete clauses aren’t worth the paper they’re written on, because the employer isn’t going to enforce it.
You'll see companies offering things like a $2000 one time payment to sign a noncompete along with a payback clause if they get fired.
That's nothing to a company running these kind of agreements but it will snare a lot of the grunt workforce who shouldn't be under noncompetes to begin with.
On the other hand, I have friends that work for software companies in various roles, and their agreements state that they can't work for a company that makes a competing product.
When your company makes a wide range of products, an agreement like that basically locks you out of entire industries.
My noncompete seems reasonable - I work for Company A, providing contract engineering services to Company B.
My noncompete basically only says I can't work directly for Company B within 12 or 18 months of leaving Company A, or they'll effectively have to keep paying my contract during that time.
It's there to discourage companies from cutting out the middleman (Company A).
In NY State they're not enforceable if they're too broad, but unfortunately that isn't defined well enough to stop companies from threatening to sue, and that alone is enough to make you a less-desirable candidate.
