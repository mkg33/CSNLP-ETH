If we are going geographically, Denmark is not on the Scandinavian peninsula (though part of Finland is), so it shouldn't be Scandinavian.
Finland is historically Scandinavian in the sense that it's historically been part of Sweden, but as an independent country it's never been seen as such.
If we are going historically, then Finland, Iceland, FI, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway are all Scandinavian from past rule.
He said "If we are going historically, then Finland, Iceland, FI, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway are all Scandinavian from past rule" and that is incorrect.
If we're going to use historical rule as a definition in today's world then we should also count England as part of Scandinavia as it fell under Scandinavian rule during the Danelaw.
Same with part of Canada.
We should also count Indonesia, New York City and Congo to be part of the Benelux as these are former colonies of the Benelux countries.
But we don't, because that wouldn't make any sense.
What about geographically then?
Well, it's not part of the geographical Scandinavian peninsula besides a few small barely inhabited border regions way up north.
