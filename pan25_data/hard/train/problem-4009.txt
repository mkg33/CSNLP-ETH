It depends entirely on the type of work.
I did loads of different stuff over the years.
Anything on the phone will be miserable after 5.
Freelance translating text?
I could do 12-16 hours easy.
Even in the same position people will have different preferences so flexible is the way to go.
Both shorter work week, lower hours and remote work can be treated as perks so maybe let people choose?
European, I can do 4x10 and I advocated for making them optional at work.
Obviously this applies to some office jobs only, same as remote work.
I'll be useless after 5-6 hours most of the time anyway and if I'm in the office I'll spend rest of the day on cocoa/coffee, fussball and darts.
Occasionally I get creative spurts and work more than 10hrs because I'm in the zone so it evens out.
I count work days as basically lost anyway.
My current job at 50 hours a week still feels like vacation by comparison.
A 32 hour work week would be a dream.
I used to work in video game dev.
13 out of every 14 days on, nearly constant shifts.
I would put in 80-100 hours per week.
I earned $10.75 an hour (this was above minimum wage at the time) and I had so much overtime pay that I raked in $80,000 in a year.
I hate to say it, but this is a pretty great career.
I edit TV.
It's fun, creative, technical, and garners respect, plus I work with a team of talented and smart individuals.
