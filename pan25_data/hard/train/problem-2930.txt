EMT in private transport here (VA): Imagine a terminal flu case but with more hazmat gear worn by everyone around you and an unknown slate of side effects depending on the varient you acquired.
I would start with online searches and work out from there.
KN95 I use for day to day not at work, N95 I use provided by my agency (I'm out on injury atm), and if needed I wear a regular mask if I, in infinite idiocy, forget mine.
Just the act of wearing one helps reduce transmission and infection vectors, so even if you can only find a regular mask, wear it.
The flu alone is enough of a reason IMO.
I just had possibly the worst flu of my life, checked for covid but nope.
104 fever, aches that made me feel 100, night sweats so bad my bed felt like I hosed it down, throwing up.
Sore throat that felt like a cheese grater made out of glass.
Lost ten pounds in three days because I couldn't eat.
People should be masking.
I got the flu shot, but they said there would be multiple variants this year and hoooooo boy were they right.
