Jeez you said it.
He has always been the boorish, crude, mean, selfish piece of shit he is.
For better or worse there are virtually no surprises with Trump (except for maybe the lows he’ll stoop to for his own personal gain).
Expect trump to go very quiet within the next couple of weeks, or for something devastatingly humiliating to come out about him.
It looks like Putin has decided trump is no longer such a useful asset.
He's now pushing DeSantis on the Republicans.
Oh, man, I really hope Desantis does run, because Trump is going to slaughter him in debates and on the campaign trail.
Trump’s base will not give a single solitary fuck about what the people in charge want, and Desantis’ total lack of charisma will be on full display, plus some extra fun nicknames he’ll never be able to shake, just like Little Marco.
Trump will fuckin tank him.
Never stop reminding all these fucks who are now disowning Trump how they got on their knees for him.
Fuck them forever, they’re stained for life as far as I’m concerned.
