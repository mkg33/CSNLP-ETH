Also evolution is a theory, just like gravity.
The problem here is the misunderstanding of what a theory is.
The teacher failed an A+ student for turning in an assignment one day late.
However, the day it was to be turned in, the student was off site on an official school function.
The written school policy states that the student should have had an extra day to turn in the assignment.
The teachers action also violated the State Board of Educations policy.
It is dumb that this had to go to lawsuit, but I cannot blame the student and parent for doing so if the teacher refused to do the right thing and change the grade.
Just the title makes me wonder when a law will come where the teachers and schools can sue the Parents for not parenting and trying to pass on their responsibility off onto the teachers.
Regardless, you must concede that there are in fact cases where the teacher and administration refuse to do the right thing and civil action is the only recourse for parents.
It shouldn't need to come to that, and frivolous cases can always be summarily dismissed by a judge.
No public employee or group should ever be beyond reproach and accountability.
