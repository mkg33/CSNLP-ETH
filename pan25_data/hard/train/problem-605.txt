Scotland got their chance at independence and chose to stay a part of the UK.
This was recent.
There are no obligations under UK or international law to keep giving them re-do's.
Oh I'm not talking about Scotland leaving the UK.
I'm talking about Scotland potentially joining the EU.
Scotland would likely become a new alternative hub to the Republic of Ireland, as an English speaking country in the EU.
While EU would be supportive of Scotland joining and there would be very few areas that would require Scotland to change in order to apply, it would not be a fast track.
However, why would EU do it?
Why would Croatia or Portugal or Finland grant this exception if they don't have one?
What would Scotland offer those countries in exchange for special treatment.
Especially that Scotland would need that membership and EU doesn't really need it.
The eu would happily take an independent Scotland, not only to spite the Not so UK, but because Scotland would be an ideal member.
This would make the English look even dumber than they do right now, which is impressive considering how dumb they look after truss.
