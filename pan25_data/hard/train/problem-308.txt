The FBI was well aware of the planned group, that was going to go attend, and be violent, those coordinated attacks happened, and caused violence, yet the capital was olny enforced with basic measures, for Trumps speech.
to completely disregard my statement, and to put words in my mouth, i didn't say trump was innocent, trump had a huge delay in his response, and his friends in the White House, had delayed all responses, for help, and caused the scene as we know today, Jan 6.
I donâ€™t have my hopes up that anything substantive will be implemented to prevent what happened on January 6 from repeating when the next demagogue runs for President.
I think the problem is that the emphasis has been on what happened at the Capitol on Jan 6 but most of the worst stuff Trump did that led to it wasn't as explicit.
He tried hard to undermine and steal the election and that's what the focus should be on, not just his culpability for people entering a building.
He did a lot of things to directly undermine people's faith in the election, things he knew were lies at the time.
It's not complicated to see how that ultimately led to what happened at the Capitol, regardless of whether he explicitly told them to do it.
