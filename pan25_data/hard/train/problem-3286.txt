ISI is a state-within-a-state, answerable only to itself, and pursuing an agenda which is, at best, independent, and at worst, antagonistic, to the interests of Pakistan.
ISI accomplished their geopolitical goal of kicking out America from Afghanistan (whom they had more reason to fear than either the Taliban or the Pakistani government.)
And ISI will not be the one who has to deal with most of the consequences of a Taliban takeover.
Pakistan is not a democracy.
It's not even an autocracy, because an autocracy implies having sovereign power, while Pakistan's national government had no real agency over its own foreign affairs, and thus, no real sovereignty.
Ruled by the clandestine ISI junta, Pakistan isn't "reaping what it sowed", it's being held hostage.
Title misses the context.
It's not Pakistan reaping what Pakistan sowed.
It's (the rest of the government and people of) Pakistan reaping what has been sowed by the Inter-Service Intelligence.
It's true that the Pakistani government created the TTP by approving the US airstrikes of tribal areas near the Afghan border, but it's very cynical to hold that against them.
