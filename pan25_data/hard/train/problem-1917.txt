Try to find unbiased points of view, look at history, look at raw real life footage of the 2014 conflict in Crimea and Donbass and make your own decision.
Lmao.
It's an 8 year old 'opinion piece' not an actual article first of all.
Secondly, it has bunch of false claims, conspiracies and most of it is Russian propaganda talking points.
While the worst Russians seem to be on the internet spouting propaganda that they probably believe, I think there are a lot who are afraid to speak up.
Also, many fled.
Itâ€™s true, the EU should increase the range, amount, and sophistication of weapons being sent to Ukraine so that Ukraine can end this war once and for all.
I guess if you look at it from the context the the EU is helping Ukraine avoid being taken over by the thug army of the Kremlin then absolutely the EU is prolonging the war.
But don't worry Orban: Ukraine is slowly but surely grinding down the invaders, has already reclaimed more then 50% of the territory the invaders initially seized in the early months of the war and I think pretty soon will take back a big chunk more, and kill many more of the scum that invaded Ukraine.
That should see the prolonging start to wind down...
Happy now Orban?
