Taxation is the most basic form of civic participation one has.
You only vote based on your status as a taxpayer, without some form of taxation, there is nothing that would qualify someone for civic participation.
i believe the law was covering transaction totals over $600 via platforms like paypal, venmo, cashapp, etc.
Cash transactions like via facebook marketplace don't involve digital transfer of funds, so even if they wanted to audit you over them, there's no actual way for them to prove you transacted any money(short of videotaping you receiving cash and verbally saying "this cash is in payment for my couch, which is now yours" or something like that).
Well everyone's a "slave" to taxes to some extent, short of living on a boat at sea with a renewable lifestyle.
Even the wealthy who dodge taxes are still "slaves" to the effort of avoiding them without actually breaking the law.
-Use this to enrich themselves by funneling money to private corporations tied to them and/or avoiding taxes they should be paying.
