As I understand it, the past week Russia has been stepping up it's offensives on Ukraine's defensive lines with their expendable new recruits.
The goal seems to be to make one or more breakthroughs to force Ukraine to have to commit its reserves to stabilise their front line.
Russia would then start their major offensive further north while much of the Ukrainian reserves are tied up and unable to respond effectively.
So far it doesn't seem to be working as Ukrainian defensive lines have held, or they are being smart and withdrawing to more effective defensive positions.
If Ukraine sets good defensive positions, fallback lines, and detailed plans don't think this russian offensive will manage a full breakthrough.
The most important thing is anti tank weaponry.
Javelins, NLAWs, Stugnas, RPGs, etc.
Losing 15 tanks a days sums up 1800 tanks in 4 months.
And it may well be a conservative number for a big offensive.
It's the expected outcome.
Ukraine had time to lay down mines, and stock anti tank weapons in the region.
I really hope russia fully commits to this offensive and gets utterly defeated so Ukraine can counterattack later with way weaker defenses.
It shows exactly why Russia can only succeed through brutal human waves in urban areas where they're already arms-lenh away from the Ukrainians.
They ARE going to hit with a wave of humans, and the Ukrainians will probably have to give up some ground...but they've proven to be versatile enough that the 6 months afterwards will be a bloodbath for the Russians as Ukraine counterattacks from all over the map.
Every farm, every hill, every little village...will cost thousands of Russian lives.
Until there just isn't any more will to go forward anymore, even under threat of death.
