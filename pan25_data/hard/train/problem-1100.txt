Yes there is - the posse comitatus act places significant limits on the federal military to enforce "domestic policy" (with the exception of the national guard of the various states and the coast guard).
Border security outside of wartime is considered the purview of domestic immigration authorities and other law enforcement agencies.
Regardless of whether border protection is a "national security consideration", it's also a domestic law enforcement mission.
Which means federal military are very limited in what they can do there - they can't make arrests, can't collect or process evidence, can't investigate or interrogate, can't secure crime scenes, can't direct traffic (that one always seemed weird to me, but whatever), lots of prohibitions.
They can't do anything that is normally a function exclusive to cops.
Really, all they seem to do is repair fences and watch video cameras... and then call Border Patrol to go try and catch people.
That's wrong, and not how posse comitatus works.
The Border Patrol is absolutely a federal law enforcement agency, same as DEA and ATF, which are also under DHS.
DHS is an umbrella for all the domestic law enforcement agencies except the FBI, who answers to DOJ directly.
