Fined millions but please actually research how much money they made.
Paying malpractice costs is a cost of business.
Our economy is at 2008 levels of leverage and fraud.
And finally, it is to jail the CEO’s for banks and Hedgefunds for gross negligence, fraud, and/or market manipulation on top of fines for negligence, fraud, and/or market manipulation.
Mind you that these fines are for something unrelated to the 3.5 billion in fines for manipulating their loans for customers.
Try googling “WF fined” and see how many egregious errors this bank commits.
It’s astounding.
It’s stealing.
It’s fraud.
These people need to be in jail.
While we bicker about left and right politics these people line their pockets like a cheap sleight of hand trick while neither party wants to go up against wallstreet.
Their worst nightmare is that “occupy wallstreet” had teeth and cut off their ability to steal from us and not face any real repercussions.
The exchange market for FTX is a complete mirror of the stock market.
You don’t own anything unless you have it in your hand/wallet/portfolio through a transfer agent.
When banks are fined, remember that means that the money we put into banks are the ones paying the fines.
Not the money put in CEO’s pockets.
Fining the bank is robbing ourselves to pay the government for the crimes of the bank.
"You jail the petty thief who stole from the bank, but you worship the banksters who steal on a grand scale.
I suppose it's like the difference between murder and warfare -- kill an individual and you're a monster, but systematically kill thousands and you're a heroic genius.
A saner society would punish the latter, not reward it.
