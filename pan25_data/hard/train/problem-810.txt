I'm currently thinking Jeffries might actually end up as speaker.
Given how idiotic the anti-McCarthy fascists are, I can legit see a vote where enough of them agree to vote 'present' simply to spite McCarthy but they miscalculate/miscommunicate in a way that Jeffries gets it.
I'm currently dreaming of a vote where the Freedumbers all vote 'present' to spite McCarthy and don't realize they are putting Jeffries in as Speaker by doing so.
And that in the midst of Republicans voting "present" to try and force him to step back, they'd be so disorganized that they'd accidentally lower the threshold by so much that Jeffries gets the speakership.
Most of congress wants Jeffries, there just needs to be a handful of sane Republicans as apposed to 20 alt right Republicans.
I understand that but for Jeffries to win Republicans would have to vote present or vote for Jeffires.
I don't see that happening.
Except Republicans won't let that happen.
They won the majority, they will come together and elect a speaker.
The rebels have gotten the attention they wanted but they are still only 20 of 224.
So what?
Democracy is messy.
Some members thought they could use their votes to get concessions from McCarthy.
They got some and then came back for more.
They failed.
Now they need to get in line like good little boys and girls and vote for the person who helped get them elected and has the most support.
