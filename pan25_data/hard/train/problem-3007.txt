As one of Lady G’s constituents (who has never voted for him), he’s a hypocrite turd.
However, he has been extremely consistent on his Ukraine support and will not change since he’s a MIC booster.
He isn't stopped because despite what the administration claims, their goal is to bleed Russia slowly not to defend Ukraine.
At the end of the day either one of two things is true, Russia is willing to use nuclear weapons to conquer Ukraine or he isn't.
If he is we should just give up Ukraine (and every other country that borders Russia) right now, if he isn't we should defend them full force right now.
It's really not wise to escalate things more than necessary, and technically this counts as escalation, but then what if Ukraine really needs them?
If Russia is using tanks and continues to mobilise more troops, then isn't it fair game Ukraine uses them, even if some are donated from allies?
I agree to support Ukraine with tanks, but when you're actively helping Trump, who was impeached the first time for blackmailing Ukraine by withholding weapons...
If he wasn't a supporter of Trump they would have been getting weapons they needed all along instead of him using blackmail of Ukraine (see first impeachment).
Trump denied weapons to Ukraine for Blackmail back in 2019, when Ukraine could have been stockpiling and training to defend against Russia, which is what they were begging Trump to help with.
People like Graham enabled Trump and then tried to get him re-elected.
If Trump was in office now, as Graham tried, Ukraine would've never received our help.
