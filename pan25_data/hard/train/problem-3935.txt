Did they really care about the Taiwan visit?
I only remember that one random guy saying china would retaliate, which Reddit took as “XI JINPING PROMISES WAR IF PLANE LANDS IN TAIWAN”.
Any talk of war with China would be in China's back yard in the Taiwan Strait for Taiwan, and probably with the UK/Australia/Japan involved.
A Chiniese war with Taiwan would probably be catastrophic for the world.
Saying Biden or any president should demand Taiwans independence is foolish and doesn't understand the consequences of what would potentially happen.
Or saying Biden is weak for taking to China.
No, he is trying to prevent the world from economic ruin and from the US getting drawn into a proxy war with China that would make Russia/Ukraine look tiny and insignificant.
And may very well pull the US into war itself with China.
If China were stupid enough to engage mainland US on US soil, then lord help them, because they don't stand much or a chance.
Whether you're pro, anti or controlled 2A, I'd wager most gun nuts and hoarders would hand a weapon to their non armed next door neighbour to defend against an invasion.
The US has proven themselves time and again in their military prowess and they deserve a lot of applaud for what they've achieved, however I would caution against hubris, especially with dictatorships/autocracies.
Russia may have shown themselves to be all bark with only a small bite, there's nothing to say it won't be different with another country.
