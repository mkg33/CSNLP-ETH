It can be a war crime to impersonate civilians or noncombatants in order to attack the enemy, although the rules were primarily written to address soldiers, uniforms, flags, etc... and it's unclear if they would apply here.
Pretending to be a civilian and taking advantage of the protections afforded to civilian airliners in order to attack the enemy reads like it would qualify as perfidy to me.
I can't see how anyone could describe warplanes broadcasting civilian codes in order to strike and kill the enemy as "not perfidious" when it explicitly says you cannot feign civilian, non-combatant status?
FWIW, I can't find anything backing up OP's claim that Israel was broadcasting civilian airliner codes, although I did find lots of condemnation of the attack as against international laws more generally.
Pretending to be a civilian airliner in order to strike a military target endangers real civilian airliners.
It's not camouflage or misinformation - pretending to be a civilian plane is perfidy.
It tricks the enemy into affording your combatants the protection that is afforded to noncombatants only under the law of armed conflict.
There is absolutely no world in which "it is questionable" whether it applies to planes or not.
Why would it be questionable?
The definition is right there.
Civilian planes are afforded protections that combatant planes are not, not just under the law of armed conflict, also various open skies and civil aviation related treaties.
Combat aircraft are not afforded the same protection.
Bingo, the definition of perfidy has been met.
