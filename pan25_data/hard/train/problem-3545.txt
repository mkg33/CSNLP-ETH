Gotta look at the details.
The majority also favored a private healthcare system.
What people want is for the government to provide healthcare to other people; they don't want to commit to a single payer system where they lose their perks.
Of course, a government system that only provides healthcare to the poor, sick, and elderly is bound to fail.
Because for healthcare to work, you need to have the young and healthy paying into the pot.
Someone else here said "well the government can just cover the loses," which is true, but at that point the government is subsidizing private insurance by spending trillions a year to cover the unprofitable parts of the population while letting private insurance cover all the profitable people.
What the majority of commenters don't realize is the definition of "universal healthcare" in this context is the government ensuring everyone has health insurance to get care.
And the rest of the data behind the headline shows most Americans still prefer the private system we have over a public one.
Meaning the universal healthcare supported by the survey is the current public+private hybrid system we have now.
Plenty of candidates are there for some form of universal healthcare (just not the unpopular idea of single payer in particular).
Insanity that, in this day and age, only 57% support the idea of universal healthcare and less than 50% want single-payer.
It used to be more popular but the Rs and centrist Ds fervently campaigned against it.
