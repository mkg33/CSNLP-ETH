>At the same time, Vucic said he was grateful to Russia for its support of Serbia regarding Kosovo, citing it as the reason why Serbia cannot support economic sanctions against Moscow.
Russia has been a protector of Serbia for centuries and it has supported them in many occasions, regardless who was in power in Russia, the tsars, a president, or the communist party leader.
Wow... Russia must have refused to stop their recruitment efforts and the Serbian government has figured out any relationship with them would be Russia exploiting Serbia for their benefit.
Here is the thing.
If the Belarusian army was convinced Russia wouldn't interfere, they would totally overthrow Lukashenko.
The only thing stopping him is that he is one of Putin's useful idiots that will do anything he says with what little power he has.
Main reason Belarus' army isn't involved actively in the war is because the army has straight up refused to engage by Lukashenko's orders and Russia isn't looking to fight in Belarus if they don't have to right now.
