As Russian from young generation I can say, that Russian officials usually neglect role of Lend Lease program in our Victory by using an argument that it was only 4% of Soviet military production.
Even Russia forgets, is ignorant of, or willingly downplays the massive contribution of the lend lease program to preserve this false image of Russian strenh and resilience.
Their entire war machine was propped up on the back of uncle Sam and Pennsylvania steel.
We gave the soviets something like 800,000 Studebaker trucks so they could motorize their entire logistics and supply lines after it arrived by rail.
Previously it was still horse drawn.
Here's a good example.
On the Russian aircraft carrier (aircraft heavy cruiser) the fire extinguishers are locked in metal cages to prevent theft.
Only the captain has keys, since senior logistics officers kept stealing them to sell.
Said aircraft carrier has caught fire at Port multiple times including burning down the world's largest dry dock meant to house it while it underwent refit and repair.
