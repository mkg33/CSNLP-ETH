The Full Faith & Credit Clause, plus the contractual nature of marriage, gives Congress much more leeway to "codify" these things directly than is normally the case.
While the Reconstruction Amendments did a lot to expand the federal government's power over the states, the states are still semi-sovereign entities that have their own spheres of legal power.
The federal government can't just say "we're taking over this part of the law now" about anything.
There are limits.
The federal government has to have an enumerated power to act on in the first place, and then an argument for why its laws would override state laws within state borders.
The Federal Law may not gazump state law on that front, depending on how it's constructed.
States may still be able to layer more protections on top of a basic Federally mandated set of protections.
Yeah I don't mind people of different races getting married but I sure ain't letting them dine at my restaurant together!
How is refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple different than refusing for a Black couple, or an Asian couple?
Or to put it another way, if it pleases you; I'm in no more or less of a burden than a baker is who is compelled to bake a cake for a LGBT+ couple.
I think if you don't want to bake a wedding cake for a couple because you're homophobic (or racist, etc.
), you should maybe find another way to make money.
