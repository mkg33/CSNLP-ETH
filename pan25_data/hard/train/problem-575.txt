If you read the article (I'm sure you're a very busy person and are justified in commenting before reading the article) they mention that the person was not found guilty of rape but was found guilty of having sex with a minor.
I'm not familiar with UK laws, but it seems that they have a more specific definition of rape then some other countries do.
So that would be why the article doesn't use the term "rape".
Yeah, apparently UK law (for whatever reason) specifies that only a man can rape someone.
But I still think the BBC is justified in not using the term "rape" since that has a legal definition.
I just did a bit more research into the UK law, and it appears that the reason it's not legally considered rape is because of outdated language in the legal code.
The law specifies that rape can only be done by a man in the UK, so women cannot be found guilty of rape.
So this does have to do with gender identity, as well as dumb legal wording.
I think the gender identity kind of Is relevant.
Because if this was a cis woman then it wouldn't have been penetrative sex that made the child pregnant.
And if it was a man and not a trans woman perhaps the parents would have been more suspicious of the situation or the grooming might have been noticed.
In fact it may have been a more confusing situation for the victim because they have not been warned or prepared for this type of situation.
