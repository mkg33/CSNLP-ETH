It's just more oil companies vs humanity.
If every corporation that is not an oil company acts more responsibly when it comes to carbon pollution then petroleum product profits are adversely impacted.
Therefore, Republicans, with an insane amount of eco-suicidal propaganda from oil companies, are going to treat reforms as a threat and demonize/punish the shit out of any entity that promotes conservation.
Republicans will shill out for any industry, but they’re one true sugar daddy donor that will get preferential treatment over any other corporate overlord they have is big oil.
The GOP wants the Earth to be a hellish landscape because that makes it easier to kill off non-white people since studies have shown those countries are the ones that will be hit hardest by climate change if nothing is done(and even before we finish doing what we need to do to avoid the worst outcomes for them), and because it will make there be a constant need for them to flex their fascism to control people, because they’ll need the government more than ever.
And control.
The more natural disasters, shortages, etc., the more they can say, “Democratic politicians have ruined your life” even when it makes no sense, because the most brainwashed parts of their base eats it up every time.
Companies see that it’s not sustainable to have a business on a barely habitable planet(astounding that it took them this long to realize that), so they’re now all for going green, especially when the government helps pay for the transition.
Sure, it’s a good thing that it’s happening, but it’s for the wrong reason, and you know how much the Republicans hate good things and love wrong reasons.
Chaos is good for Republicans so they oppose things that improve conditions for humanity.
They hate organized systems beyond “family” doing well as it implies external “control” over “you”.
So they burn down the world to feel right AND to point at failures to say, “Look what your precious society did.”.
