California is the most ethnically diverse states in the United States - which is what the DNC is trying to achieve, reach a better consensus of candidate and appeal to more than white Democrats.
White Democrats have distinctly different priorities than minority Democrats or Independents, which the Democrats need to win state and nation wide elections.
Not all southern democrats are conservative, they can be more moderate but they believe in many of the things progressives do, but they care about who can actually win a general election to try and get the shit we all want.
It upsets people but Bernie is not a general election winner, if the only way he can win is if the field is so divided that he wins with a plurality then you aren't a good general candidate.
The whole idea of candidates getting a "boost" because they win one primary and the rest of the country being like "oh huh I guess maybe I'll vote for them because they might be the winningest" is dumb too and contributes to this ridiculous horse race mentality that caused a lot of party strife in the past 8 years.
Plus this basically disenfranchises half the population because after Super Tuesday its basically over.
Because he also got blown out in the two states that had large non-white voting populations before Super Tuesday, a primary date filled with states with non-white voting populations.
