Sure and an incident like Khasham makes that denial valuable in terms of insulating the image of their official military's competence.
But when you designate Wagner a terrorist organization then you're also - passively or directly - stating its a Russian-state sponsored one.
While the shoe certainly fits, you're essentially calling the Russian military a terrorist organization.
I don't disagree with that classification, but does that mean you handle them the same as other such classified groups?
Agreed, which is why the political ramifications of calling them a terrorist organization are complex.
Anyway, classifying it as a terrorist organization is the correct response.
If Russia wants to pretend they aren't their military and they aren't legally a PMC, a terrorist classification is a no-brainer before we even take a look at the atrocities they commit.
Also, it should be made clear by NATO and especially Ukraine that Wagner members are not granted protections and rights as Russian military under the Geneva convention.
Wagner is an irregular Russian Military force masquerading as a PMC for legal cover in a nation where PMCs are illegal.
Wagner is an irregular Russian Military force masquerading as a PMC in order to have plausible deniability.
And their deniability is not plausible at all, I don't really understand why journalists support Russia's farce by repeating that they are a PMC when they are not registered as such in any nation on Earth.
