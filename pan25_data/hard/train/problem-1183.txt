This is who they've always been.
They've been "othering" people so long they made a circle around themselves, and they really are scared.
Anyone that hasn't been othered out by now is a true believer.
And is a fascist.
Fascism comes in the door with “well it being done to those guys is ok…”.
If there’s anything to be angry at Disney about… being angry that they paid MORE to be able to ensure a police and fire department better than the one the state provided doesn’t seem to be the place to “stick it to them” on.
… but Disney kept its original deal of ownership.
They won in this outing based on DeSantis needing to, in a panic, quickly revert his original bill and come up with this as a show of “winning”.
The idea that some governor in Florida out corrupts all the other significantly more corrupt governments Disney also has to deal with is ridiculous.
The Commission has no power over Disney otherwise the local taxpayers would have had to take on the cost of Disney bonds, something the not very smart DeSantis was clueless.
Disney keeps all the power, all the tax breaks, all the control over police, fire, construction.
As soon as DeSantis moves on to attacking Blacks, burning books, attacking gays, attacking medical science, his boy will revert to sucking Mouse dick for perks.
