I don't mind pre-sale as a concept, I've bought presale tickets arranged via the artist's website before, but they have to be set up properly, with protections to prevent resales.
I love the idea of rewarding die hard fans with early access to tickets, but not when its getting manipulated by corporations looking to bilk the customer.
I've bought tickets on Ticketmaster several times, because unfortunately, the alternative is just not going to certain gigs, and missing out on seeing an artist I really enjoy.
Its not reasonable to expect consumers to vote with their wallets, when it comes to potentially missing out on lifelong memories of seeing their favourite artists performing live.
Ticketmaster is a textbook example of a corporation with practises that need to be legally countered, because it is a functional monopoly at this point.
If they think the antitrust actions of Ticketmaster are bad just wait until they get a look at the banks, internet, broadcasting, airlines, food distribution, and healthcare companies.
