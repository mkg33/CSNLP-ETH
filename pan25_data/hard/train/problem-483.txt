It's not like Iran was invaded and conquered by a foreign power which then started doing these things; a sizeable percentage of the population probably either agrees with the government's actions, or doesn't care.
Demographically speaking, change is inevitable in Iran, but the old guard is still around, still clinging to power (and everyone knows how old guys are with power.
).
Yes.
Religion on its own does nothing.
It's always some jerk somewhere that uses it for their power grab.
Plenty of aethists that commit brutality as well.
More of a faulty human issue than anything else.
Nah.
Just people using religion as a way of gaining power and controlling people.
You can easily replace religion with "x" and it will be just as evil.
People do what they want how they want and religion is just but one of the excuses people use to abuse power.
Sorry but being an atheist can be just as bad.
Don't be hurt just accept the facts.
Religion.
Can't hurt you.
Only the crazies abusing their power of authority can.
