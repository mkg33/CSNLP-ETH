National liberation movement?
It was one side in a civil war, supported by the traditional colonizer.
Because the "Vietnam War" was an intervention by the US and Soviets/Chinese in the Vietnamnese Civil war.
Sure, made them unpopular for a short while with the victorious North Vietnamnese.
You guys cant imagine how hard the Vietnamese tried to fight for independence.
In the span of mere decades, they fought French, Japan, US, China (1979), Khmer Rouge just to seek out rights to decide their fates.
The Vietminh, led by Ho Chi Minh, were victorious at Dien Bien Phu and forced the French to sign the 1954 Geneva Convention.
The Accords were between France, Vietminh, USSR, PRC, UK, and US with the participation of the coming states split from French Indochina.
Also after America “lost”, they went on to sponsor Khmer Rouge to further isolate and terrorize Vietnam.
But his dream soon shattered when American government, fed by negative information by KouminTang and French colonial government, straight up labeled him a communist and refuse to back Vietnam independence.
with a small under equipped army and French army on the door steps, the Vietminh fell to the USSR and later PRC for support.
