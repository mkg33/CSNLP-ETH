Belarus has an army that hasn't fought anyone or really upgraded anything since the cold war, if even then.
They have like 50k troops who've never seen a day in combat and a bunch of old Soviet shit that probably barely works because they've given all the good stuff to Russia.
It might not be good, they could be simply moving them so the Russians can invade and the Belarus troops will not be targeted by the Ukrainians when it happens.
The Belarussian troops and Russian troops in Belarus are also there to tie down some of the Ukrainian forces.
If there's even a resonable risk of an invasion from the North, Ukraine needs to keep a pretty robust force to guard that border and can't throw everything to the East and South.
Moving the troops to the border, means Ukraine has to move troops to counter the protentional of an invasion, tying up forces that could be better used elsewhere.
There is a slightly possibility that a continued threat is actually more effective to the Russian war effort than an actual invasion.
