It's not looking good, but thankfully the coalition has a pretty slim margin and if I was a betting man I'd have my money on it not lasting that long.
While I understand where you're coming from you have to understand the political climate and social dynamics in Israel.
Most voting Israelis have lived through concessions and half-measures to appease the rest of the world who are largely sympathetic to the Palestinians.
All they've gotten in return are rocket attacks, suicide bombings, and other acts of terrorism.
Meanwhile - the only things that have actually kept Israelis safe are more hardline measures, like the security wall and the Gaza blockade (which followed the concession of complete withdrawal of Gaza - the precursor to the rocket attacks).
Israelis are sick and tired of caring what the outside world thinks - including American Jews.
Their top priority is the self determination and security of Jews in Israel, which was the whole point of the country.
I know that Israel is just defending it's self, but it feels very bad with how it chooses to defend it's self.
Nothing wrong with protecting yourself, everything wrong when you start to treat others the way we were treated.
That's where it looks bad.
