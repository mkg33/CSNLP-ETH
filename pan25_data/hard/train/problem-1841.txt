Maybe I am misunderstanding the law as not Florida resident and was not digging into it but this doesn’t sound like you described it.
It seems a responsible approach to not sexually educate 6yo as it’s clearly too soon.
It applies to teaching heterosexual orientation too as it is all encompassing.
Read last part of the quote: in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE STANDARDS.
What constitutes "age-appropriate", and what are the standards that are being applied?
Does it seem likely that schools will err on the side of never saying anything that could be construed as pro-LGBTQ so that they won't get sued?
If you had bothered to read the law, you'd realize that acknowledging the reality that trans and gay people exist is illegal in public schools in Florida.
Technically speaking, under the letter of the law, Florida's Don't Say Gay law bans gendered restrooms from schools, teachers from wearing wedding rings, etc., but so far, the law has only affected queer people.
I could continue to list examples of how that vagueness makes it unlikely that the law will be used as anything other than a cudgel to use against LGBTQ people, but you ignored that in my earlier post so I don't think it'd be useful.
“The Trevor Project says these provisions, "appear to undermine LGBTQ support in schools and include vague parental notification requirements, which could effectively require teachers to 'out' LGBTQ students to their legal guardians without their consent, regardless of whether they are supportive.
