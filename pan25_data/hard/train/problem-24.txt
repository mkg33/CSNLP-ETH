As a parent who raised our daughter in a small, public school, parents don’t need anymore permission to force their agenda on other children.
This approach is going to backfire spectacularly.
Good parenting seems to be a dying thing in the US and these same parents want schools and teachers to be responsible for their parenting failures.
Eventually, no one is going to want to teach in Florida and you’ll see the rise of “you have an associates degree in art so we’re going to let you teach our children” reducing trained educators.
I definitely think our education system is a mess but I overwhelmingly blame parents, not teachers and the schools.
This is the result of a systematic degradation of public schooling.
The next generation is be told by the first to experience this degradation that book banning is fine and that education is secondary to our precious fee-fees.
Their perception of their “rights” are skewed kaleidoscopicly.
The good news is fascist attitudes and actions are easy to spot when you know what you’re looking for.
