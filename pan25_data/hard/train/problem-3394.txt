Realistically no one's going to have a baby because the child benefits rise by a couple of Euro a month.
This is a measure to keep up with inflation.
Even with out goversafety nets and subsidized child care having a kid is still a net drain on your income and can be a hiccup in your career.
Also, rich Households have to pay less Taxes per Child, making them gain more Money through having Children than poorer Households, which is IMO quite unfair.
There is certainly a relationship between affluence and fertility rates though I am not sure if job loss in a wealthier country would lead to more children.
People might choose the opposite, since kids cost money and earn little or no income.
In a poorer rural economy it could be kids become more valuable from an economic perspective.
In order for human civilization to be sustainable for the long run we need a smaller population and footprint and a new relationship with nature.
Many countries are facing a demographic crunch because of fewer births and aging elders, but the solution cannot be to increase fertility rates.
We need to look to both technology and redeploying workers where they are truly needed to get through that temporary crunch.
A small enough population to allow every human to thrive and to allow all the other species in our extended family to thrive as well.
