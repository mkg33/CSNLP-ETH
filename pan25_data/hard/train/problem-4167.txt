What's the alternative?
This is a civil case.
International law has dictated for centuries that people in one country have no standing to sue heads of state of others.
Even if a court did grant standing to sue, how exactly do you expect that court to enforce any judgement it comes to?
Do you think that a US court trying to hand down a monetary judgement against the Saudi Royal family will be met with anything but total derision?
The Saudis won't recognize the standing, they have no reason to, and any further enforcement mechanism the US has would then become a major diplomatic issue.
Further, if the US \did\ suddenly make it a diplomatic issue, it would open up US citizens and government officials to the exact same sort of actions in retaliation.
Suddenly anyone would be able to sue US citizens in their own country, get a judgement, and be able to argue that we enforced such a judgement on someone else therefore they may do so to us.
Second, yes, the US's stance is that Putin can't be tried in a US Court, nor sued by a US Citizen in a US Court.
That is unarguably the US's stance.
The US is absolutely not bound by international law on this.
There is a custom, not a law, allowing some level of immunity to heads of state.
Diplomatic immunity does not generally extend to murdering someone with full American citizen protections and hacking their bodies to pieces.
Sure, absolutely.
They wouldn’t have standing in a US court, but neither Iraqi or US courts are obliged to give bush immunity because he was head of state.
Can you imagine if George Bush said “Saddam Hussein as head of state has immunity against any charge”.
