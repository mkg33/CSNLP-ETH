Don't be fooled.
They've been living with Putin's propaganda for decades.
I don't think they're uniquely horrible people, but by and large they support what is happening, and if someone replaces Putin, they'll likely do the same exact thing because the Russian people have been led to believe it's right.
And this is why analogies always fall short.
Because you can hard stop an individual person, either via coercion or force, but you can't stop a nation state the same way, unless you're willing to commit genocide.
The analogy of an individual vs a country breaks down - you can end the threat from an individual by taking that individual out of play, you can't do the same to a country unless you're a genocidal maniac.
Because China will not close their borders to Russia.
So, if we want to have some influence on Russia's trajectory from here, we can't close borders either.
One possibility is that it's caused by each country having a seperate negotiation going on with Russia.
Russia might be using this to their advantage by making promises and strategical concessions ("de-escalations") to certain parties.
They only need to convince one of them.
Succeeding in that, Russia divides the response of the west and can escalate quickly to take advantage of half of the west believing that Russia wants to de-escalate.
