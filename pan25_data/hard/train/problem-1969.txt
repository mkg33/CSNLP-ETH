A few years back.. he was totally fine with Trump pushing for harsher penalties for marijuana.. when Republicans had the supermajority.. what a grifter.
The writers here cherrypick and don't bother with fairness in journalism.. always a slant, always building a narrative.
I think it's unfair to say they "don't bother with fairness in journalism."
They're very upfront and generally principled about being a libertarian publication.
If you want examples of good talking points to use against conservatives spouting off about "Section 230 Platform vs publisher" using language they might otherwise understand, check out the many articles Reason has on it.
In fact, seeing as no one is without bias, I'd argue it's refreshing to see a publication own it and be forthright about it.
I have zero issue with having and acknowledging an ideological lens.
It's outright lying and manipulation I have a problem with.
Reason is a self-avowed libertarian publication.
It regularly pisses off liberals and conservatives.
