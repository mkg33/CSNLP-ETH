You seem to know a lot more about this than I do, so thank you for the information/opinion you've provided.
I tend to think repealing 230 will clean up the internet.
My expectation is that sites would have to be ultra moderated.
If Twitter is considered a publisher, then every libelous statement made would subject Twitter to potential litigation.
Repealing 230 would make the social media sites "publishers," thus making them responsible for everything people post on their sites.
230 protects them because they're not responsible for what people post.
That's been my thought on a 230 repeal for a while.
Part of me would hate it, but I also hope I'm right since that would clean up social media.
It would not clean up social media.
It would absolutely destroy it.
Would you pay to post to reddit, or Facebook, or Twitter?
Doubt it, and almost nobody else would either.
Because every single post would have to be reviewed by a person before it would be allowed on these sites.
And that would cost BILLIONS of dollars.
