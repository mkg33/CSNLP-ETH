I think 5M vs tens of thousands is a big difference.
Unfortunately your assessment is wrong… in USA public opinion and appetite matters a lot (see Vietnam war).
In Russia there is no independent public media hence the public is kept oblivious.
If for example Russia make known to its own people the true state and death toll of the war im sure the appetite for it will wane sooner.
There’s no use in having millions more Russians die for a Russian Empire.
The kids themselves don’t want it.
Let it go, Vlad.
LET IT GO.
Yo man this shit is funny but this is serious.
5 million fucking people is a lot of people.
France fielded 1 million men and it caused a ruckus.
And you can say, “yeah, but Europe is much bigger now.”.
We can hope that he looks to his childhood and realizes this may be it.
Russia is not the power he dreamed it to be.
And it’s ok.
The west doesn’t really want to fight a war either.
All sides prefer peace.
They held their end of the bargain to the end.
They didn’t get directly involved.
They don’t actually want to kill Russians even if they could.
Russia has that going for it.
What will russia’s future look like when this is all over.
They’re killing so many of their men, young and old.
And even if they win will the people of ukraine ever really accept their new citizenship or will there always be resentment and division.
Putin bit off way more than russia could chew and it will be decades before any kind of normalcy returns for any of these people.
And for what?
