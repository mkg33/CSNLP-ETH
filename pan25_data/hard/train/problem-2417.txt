Not really, tens of thousands of goat herders were fucked out of existence by ISAF but ISAF would not level whole villages to eliminate the threat, thus when they all left, the Taliban came out of said villages and swept away the corrupt cowards in the ANA and ANP.
The Talis never won in the field with ISAF, they did win however when the US pulled out.
Lol, they aren't fierce.
The ANA rolled over and died like nothing.
They're exceptionally good at throwing children and young men into the ISAF meat grinder resulting in massive casualty imbalances and planting IEDs that became less and less effective over the years.
The main mitigating factor in Afghanistan is geography.
Go hide in the mountain caves for 20 years until the Empires spend too much money on little return and leave.
That's the Afghan way.
Afghans had a chance.
Americans were there, trying to help, but there were no will.
Say what you want about how it was a fuckup, or how they are invaders, but Americans showed a glimpse to a better world for Afghan people, but now it's lost.
Taliban are in charge and they seem to be strong in power too.
Protests has been going basically since Americans left and there does not seem to by any signs of change.
It's a reminder to us that we might have limited window to act when it comes to politics, so get involved.
