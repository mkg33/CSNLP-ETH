I was more of the opinion that they're just stupid and think taxes are too complicated and they love seemingly simple ideas only because they can wrap their tiny brains around it.
I think they only reason they like things like a flat tax rate, or reducing taxes to a single page is because they just don't get math.
It’s funny when the people who think rich people pay too much in taxes have a new plan that will “be more fair.” But don’t worry it’s going to benefit you if you aren’t rich.
Not just "pay less", the GOP's sales tax would let the rich pay so so so much less, it might as well be nothing relative to their income.
Meanwhile people with the lowest income would get the maximum 30% tax since they're the only ones forced to spend all their income on living costs.
Regular people save and scrape to buy a house for themselves... Must raise another +30% for the tax.
Such a tax system creates an automatic advantages for anybody with enough capital to insert themselves in-between producer and consumer, as a landlord, speculator, reseller, or contracting agency.
In addition to the "marginal utility of money", I would point out that the tax is only on "personal consumption", and that creates some very non-equal things, for example:
This pattern also applies to cars, appliances, food...
Possibly labor too, when you consider subcontracting or temp-agencies.
