according to this paper it wasn't so much "debunked" as much as it was just "too controversial" after 6 celebrated seasons of archaeology because geologists kept giving dates that didn't match "the story of history.
".
Same.
I think about it all the time.
If anatomically identical humans have been walking around since about 300,000+ years ago I find it hard to believe there weren't at least simple societies and technologies.
They could have even been iron age level technology and there would be no traces left, considering decomposition.
That's still very interesting!
Even if they never evolved past late Stone age tech, the fact they could have had complex socities is fascinating to me.
I find it highly likely that there were stone age complex civilizations that we have little or know evidence of long, long before 6000 years ago.
I don't find that much of a stretch at all.
There was a huge city somewhere near the Mississippi before European contact that likely was significantly larger and more economically complex than London at the same time.
But they didn't work metal, so evidence of the city was difficult to find.
It's possible, even likely, someone was working iron long before we have direct evidence of it, but it almost certainly was an extremely rare occurence.
Certainly not to the level of success expected from the advantages of iron tools and weapons.
And iron would leave evidence much, much easier than bone.
So, it's pretty well certain if it happened it was isolated and on a small scale, which isn't what would be expected of a civilization that advanced.
