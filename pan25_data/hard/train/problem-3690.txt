No one should have any classified documents in their home, in their garage, at their resort, etc.
There needs to be better custodian of these documents.
With that said, Biden has been very transparent about this whereas Trump and his attorney's have lied, deceived, and refused to cooperate.
Trump remains, so far, the only one who lied about having said documents and actively hid those documents from authorities.
If you are dealing with thousands of documents and everything is being shuffled around with a fairly lax attitude shit happens.
Yeah, they both mishandled classified documents in the most general sense.
Here’s the critical difference.
Trump lied about having them at all and refused to cooperate with NARA for more than an entire year, then turned over a few and lied about having tons more until the FBI had to get a judge involved to seize them, then claimed they were planted, then admitted he stole them as “keepsakes.”.
Trump backed a truck up and loaded it with cases of specifically too secret documents, left then sitting in a publicly accessible location with nearly no security, lied about having them, lied about returning them, tried to keep them on the basis of "I de-classified them IN MY MIND", and ultimately had to be raided to get them back.
Multiple cases of top secret documents that he lied about having, lied about returning, and literally had to be raided to get back...Not exactly an "oops I forgot I had them" moment.
