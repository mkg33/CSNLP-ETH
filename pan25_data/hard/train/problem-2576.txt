I would love for either political party to consider fiscally conservative policy, but in my adult lifetime neither party can stop spending.
Democrats lean toward a tax-and-spend policy while the GOP leans toward a borrow-and-spend policy.
Regardless of how you feel about what the government spends, raising the debt ceiling is how we avoid default on spending that has already passed through legislation.
There is literally nothing to gain by blocking it, but the GOP will try it anyway because they care more about power than they do about this country.
So, 7 House Republicans who voted in favor will be out of a job in 10 days anyway, and the other two will be out of a job in two years.
It blows my mind that the GOP is totally OK with crippling government operation just so they can try to make Democrats look bad.
Just wait until the vote on whether to raise the debt ceiling or not.
Please explain how you think failing to raise the debt ceiling will reign in spending.
Also please outline what you think the consequences of such a move will be.
In detail, please.
As we know the parties realigned from the 50s into the late 60s, so one could say this is literally the same through line effort that abolitionist Republicans were afraid of now being represented by modem day conservatives.
Biden should immediately move to direct the Treasury to pay the debt, regardless via EO.
Republicans will then predictably sue, and the "originalist" SCOTUS will have to explain why section four of the 14th amendment which reads.
