Honestly, though, I don't see anything coming of this.
If there were terms that both sides were willing to agree to, we'd have a peace already, without China stepping in as mediator.
If we're referencing British WWII-Era politicians, how about Winston Churchill: "If Hitler invaded Hell, I would make at least a favourable reference of the devil in the House of Commons.
".
Nice quote.
Too bad there are more examples throughout history that point to the opposite outcome.
There is a massive difference between the two situations.
WW1 wasn't started by one single country.
The war in Ukraine was, however.
So if Ukraine’s about to lose we should send nato soldiers in?
That’s absurd and would start a global conflict I would suspect China would come to Russia’s aid.
It wouldn’t be 3 days to the Russian border or even Moscow and come at large costs to manpower.
Idk where your from but is your country willing to put blood on the table.
Are you willing to put your blood up there?
You may be right but any commander or leader needs to know when enough is enough look at Germany durying ww1 they could have kept fighting but a lot of supply’s and manpower were expended, They didn’t want to kill all the men in there country.
That should be a lesson to world leaders that even if a country surrenders you should still give them a fair deal.
Agree on the no yielding of territory.
But, the frozen asset should be negotiable as bargaining chip.
It sicks to lose fund for recovery but, it is better than the continued loss of life.
To soften the blow, western power would be helpong to some extent and China can help too if they can successfully broker this deal.
