I don't agree that voting should be mandatory.
Participating in Democracy is a right, not a requirement.
People that choose not to vote may not be the ones we want making decisions for those of us that care enough to do so.
“Thanks, here are the detailed instructions on how to go to your polling place to cast your official vote”.
How do the people who count paper ballots today do it?
I was under the impression the ballots had peoples names on them.
This is certainly the case with mail in ballots.
What they should be pushing is that more of their voters vote early or through the mail.
Showing up on Election Day and seeing long lines can deter people from voting.
A lot of coverage I watched on conservative news programs after the underperforming midterms was that early and mail-in voting should be minimized if not eliminated.
They then doubled down saying only people that actually put the time in to do the research and are willing to go in on Election Day should be eligible to vote.
They’re fighting to limit because the more people that vote the worse they do.
There is zero doubt in my mind that the US voting systems are 100% designed to discourage certain people from voting.
Because there is no other reason you would ever design or keep such a system in place otherwise.
One of the main reasons we have good elections here in Aus is the independent electoral commisions that run them.
Having an elected official, almost always belonging to one party or another, running the elections, is insanity.
Having state legislatures draw up the districts with almost no oversight in terms of partisan bias is insanity.
If there was a top 10 list of how to run fair and free elections, I'm pretty sure the US would score about 2/10.
Well obviously.
How can you have a democracy without a democracy sausage?
I'm no constitutional scholar, but I'm pretty sure sausages at elections is in there somewhere.
