Stalin ended the New Economic Policy (which allowed Ukrainian peasants to own land they took from Polish landlords) and started collectivizing Ukrainian agriculture.
Yeah, but the point is that they did not condemn the fact, that Stalin used the hunger to eradicate Ukrainian culture and nationalism, by selling most of the ukranian grain to the world market and forbidding anyone to leave the Ukranian Soviet Republic.
There were several policies that targeted ethnical Ukranians, which resulted in them being much more affected by hunger death than ethnical Russians inside Ukraine.
It was genocide.
The Holocaust was a genocide of Jews, but it was also a genocide of more groups than just them.
The issue with your argument would be that the Holocaust for some reason wouldn't be a genocide.
But even then, the Holocaust doesn't have a comparison.
For one, it IS the largest genocide in history.
The Holodomor comes close if you count that as genocide but still not as many.
If you include all the native Poles, Slavs, and other groups, the Holocaust balloons and jumps far beyond even that.
