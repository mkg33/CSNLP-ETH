Western countries will publicly support peaceful protests but supporting a revolution in another country is very different.
Look up the definition.
Using force is part of the meaning of this word.
Your example is called the peaceful revolution because it was like a revolution but peaceful.
A study actually found that nonviolent revolutions succeed lightly more in the long term change than violent ones:
"The finding is that civil resistance campaigns often lead to longer-term reforms and changes that bring about democratization compared with violent campaigns.
Countries in which there were nonviolent campaigns were about 10 times likelier to transition to democracies within a five-year period compared to countries in which there were violent campaigns — whether the campaigns succeeded or failed.
This is because even though they “failed” in the short term, the nonviolent campaigns tended to empower moderates or reformers within the ruling elites who gradually began to initiate changes and liberalize the polity.
".
It does happen.
But when it does, it rarely does without a demonstration of unity of a large number of people.
For example, when the power balance between labor and capital + state was renegotiated in the early 20th century in Sweden, in a few instances, tens of thousand of unionists would stare down military units, but bloodshed was largely avoided.
A combination of pressure from within and without led to the elites of the time sharing power and money more equally.
