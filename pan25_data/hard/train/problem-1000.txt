Idk, I remember seeing a lot of footage of American evangelicals on the 700 club in Poland ”ministering” and meeting with government leaders and that was around 20 years ago.
I linked the Kim Davis article which was all I could find but I remember seeing her on the 700 club meeting in poland with officials around that time.
You would have to research it, but I think the focus is policymakers and government leaders not everyday citizens.
Found this, where one went to Romania but I remember seeing her going to Poland to push the anti gay narrative.
Not trying to defend some of the anti-gay sentiment in Poland, that hopefully changes.
But Poland like most Europe is extremely religious.
Point is that western countries force their ideology and intrest on Poland.
It doesn't matter how Poland joined or if it can leave.
Imperialism is imperialism anyway.
My kind doesn't fight strawmen and is capable of actualy refuting arguments of other side without retreating to cheap eristics like you.
If you'd abandon prejudice you could learn many things from us.
