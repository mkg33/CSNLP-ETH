To me, Rachelle Millers statements here paint an informative picture of the Liberal government's approach at the time, and how quickly Australia is following the American partisan media route.
Now, returning to the abhorrent actions of Miller, she doesn't seem to discuss whether the strategy she was implementing had any basis in fact whatsoever (i.e.
could the government show that their dog whistle argument 'we're catching the dole bludgers' was working through statistics, or forensic research).
It seems she took the instruction completely for granted, and abused the bias in various media outlets to create dissent that discredits actual journalism.
Similar to tactics that Murdoch media outlets utilise every day to foment conflict among groups with the explicit intent to distract everyone from focussing on the actual issues in society.
Edit: Icing - when a fellow govt staffer came to her saying they had received a notice, and was only able to dispute it with incredibly detailed records from when they were a student, she raised it with the minister who stated.
Please, if you find yourself in a position like Miller was in, it is not worth sacrificing your integrity and humanity to stay in that path.
There will always be another option that doesn't involve unethical behaviour to do your job.
You can do better.
We can do better.
I'll go you one better.
I worked short contracts for a state government during part of the period they looked at.
I wasn't working consistently, and only claimed what I was entitled to when not working, but of course the averaging process triggered for me because my annual income was over the threshold.
But it had been so long between then and when I got my robodebt notice that the government's pay system had changed, and they literally would not accept the only records the state government was able to provide from their old system.
