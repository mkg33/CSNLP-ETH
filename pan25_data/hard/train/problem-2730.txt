I mean of all countries I can at least understand why Germany would be the one to understand after a terrible historic event, that help to change and get back into international relationship is important.
Because the more isolated they become the more likely nothing will change if not get worse.
In some ways that's sort of what happened in Germany between ww1 and ww2.
So I really don't understand what's wrong with this statement.
I personally really wish for the sake of everybody that Russia finally see some drastic positive change, whatever that even means.
And if that requires assistance then by all means it must be done.
Would be better for everybody.
We'll see how things go.
I was mostly implying that's the change Russia must see before we accept them back, but I see how that hasn't been clear.
I was more focused in making a point that Germany of all countries would understand the need of help despite the horrific crimes they committed.
I'm pretty sure they had programs in post war Germany where the population was forced to confront all the crimes their country commited.
The same thing has to happen in Russia if you want an quick change.
Basically they need outside help to come inside Russia and govern for them.
Much like what happened in Germany.
They are still trading with Germany.
The nat gas is stil flowing.
The enriched uranium it’s still coming Germany it’s still dependent on Russian trade.
Translation : Germany is in terrible need of Russian gas for the coming year otherwise it’s economy will collapse.
