This is part of it, but the bigger issue is Republicans.
Republicans do not want a group at the IRS going after the ultra-wealthy.
And, they don't want it because the ultrawealthy pay them to not want it.
Ultimately, the super-wealthy pay Republicans too much money in return for preventing the IRS from ever having full resources to go after them.
Because an IRS that cannot afford to pursue wealthy people with expensive lawyers will only be able to pursue poor people without.
The IRS goes after the poor because it doesn't have the resources to go after the rich, who can afford armies of accountants and lawyers.
It galls me to hear Jim Jordan or Matt Gaetz talk about how we are "spending money we don't have" when they are trying to directly hobble the governments revenue by making it easy for the rich to evade taxes and hide their assets.
And if I remember right the funding that was recently passed for them was to help retain positions after retirements and cuts and not adding tens of thousands of new auditors as the right wing media says.
Also, did I read somewhere that most of this “new” funding is basically to get back to where we were 20 years ago as well as planning for retirements and replacement workers?
