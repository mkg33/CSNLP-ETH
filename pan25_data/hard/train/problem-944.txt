IMO if you invested in crypto you deserved the lesson in bull economies.
Speculative intangible assets are going to burn you alive the moment that recession flags go up.
What I do know is that it's the exchanges which need regulation and that the governments job isn't to safeguard specific investments(read, specific crypto currencies).
Maybe they are arguing that individual currencies shouldn't be regulated (I agree), maybe they are arguing that the govt may back crypto with something akin to an FDIC (wildly unrealistic).
I think it was clear to the institutional investors that money was being made in crypto but they couldn't see how and the staying power suggested that it was more than a decentralized ponzi scheme (spoiler alert, that's all it is) so they didn't want to miss out.
Neumann kinda similarly rode the wave of popularity that uber and air bnb were seeing.
SBF had real returns and a respectable net worth before seeking funds from institutional investors.
But it's impossible to keep stuff from spilling out.
If a whole bunch of people lose their shirts they are going to start defaulting on mortgages and such.
