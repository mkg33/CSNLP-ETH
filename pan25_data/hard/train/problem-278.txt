The level of local and state interference is disheartening though.
And itâ€™s worsened by the fact that the fossil fuel industry is able to fund an endless stream of misinformation that causes the public to bombard their local and state governments with bullshit culture wars instead of demanding they move forward on these projects.
Refusal to embrace renewable energy and attempts to keep our energy infrastructure feeding money to the wealthy fossil fuel elites, could be Americas biggest mistake.
At least, clean tech is inevitable, the only question is if the Republicans keep us living in the dirty and dangerous fuel era of yesteryear.
The US is in a great position to do so, but it hasn't because it's politicians are so focused on fossil fuels and fossil fuel companies don't want renewable technology to exist at all.
Allies should be alarmed because the US getting serious about this will diminish their chances of cornering the market significantly, even though as allied nations they would still benefit greatly from the technology.
