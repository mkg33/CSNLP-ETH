Like here you go, they lied to you about the election, every second of legitimacy they presented the stolen election shit with for the last 3 years was a complete lie, told knowingly, to get you riled up, scared, and slavishly loyal to the man who birthed the lie, and for money in the form of viewership.
Every segment, every ounce of outrage a complete farce over something they didn’t even believe and likely think lowly of people stupid enough to believe it.
They did it about this, and they do it about everything else they’ve ever told you and I wonder if for once you will actually reflect on what it is you are consuming here.
I wonder if this will have any fallout among their viewers.
I feel like the people watching this shit are just sort of hopeless and will just ignore this or move on to more extreme sources.
This really isn’t new news when it comes to how Fox operates But it does show how not enough people aren’t paying attention.

What most people don’t understand is Fox is giving their audience what they want.
If they didn’t do that this audience would move on to some other place.
As it is Trump’s base has already done that as they consider Fox to be to liberal for their taste.
You really might want to watch the special CNN did with regards to Rupert Murdoch.
This really is who he is.
