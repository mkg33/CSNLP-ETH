Someone that gets it.
Trump is a symptom, not the disease of what’s going on.
People are overlooking just how fucking scary people like MTG and DeSantis are.
Desantis has been doing his homework and, as much as I hate to say this, he’s much smarter than Trump (very low bar, I know).
Dems also have a pattern of absolutely fucking things up, and so in its latest iteration, I envision no charges or so badly fumbling the case that nothing happens.
Because reasons.
Remember the time Bernie had massive support and they fucked him over for Hilary?
That’s the shit I’m talking about.
Correct.
The myth goes that because La Malinche interpreted for Cortez, it helped facilitate Spain conquering Mexico.
And so now the term is used in a derogatory manner to describe someone who values a culture or people other than their own.
This is the cliff notes version and I’m certain someone has a better explanation but that’s my take on it anyway.
To me it’s sort of two different stories even though some can characterize murdering one’s own blood as a form of malinchismo.
The connection being that la llorona may have been an indigenous woman who bore kids by a Spaniard during the conquest and drowned the kids after he abandoned her.
So she spends her ghost life searching for them.
Some people say la llorona existed prior to the Spanish conquest, but that’s the cool thing about these stories.
No one knows!
I don’t know.
I think the major failure, and this is a major failure for the pubs, will snap some of the more moderate members out of it.
If they see DeSantis as a better bet they will cut loose he entire trump project.
It will sting them for a cycle but I think the majority of Americans are moderates and the GOP went too hard too fast.
