I personally am not ok with a voter id or a mandatory registry.
A national registry is just a stepping stone to limit rights further.
There is no guarantee that regulations wont be increased in the future, so why would anyone acquiesce?
Or maybe having to be trained to be a member of the press, having to take specific authorized classes in order to express you constitutionally guaranteed rights.
Education and training about both democracy and firearms are indeed important, but making them a legal requirement before those rights can be exercised does indeed limit one's rights.
There shouldnt be additional financial barriers to exercising your constitutional rights, be is owning guns or voting.
ANY restrictions on gun ownership is inherently anti-liberal, regressive, and a threat to democracy.
How can anyone look at this country, look at the state of our police, look at the abuses of power our government commits daily, and say they should be the only ones with the means to defend themselves?
