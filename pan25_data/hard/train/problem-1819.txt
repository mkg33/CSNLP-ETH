Fucking listen to what I am saying here.
For real.
You’re projecting a ton of hate against Musk against me.
You’re accusing me of defending racism.
I’m not trying to defend Elon here, but I’ve seen an insane rise is anti-Musk rhetoric.
Public instances of people being mocked in public for driving a Tesla.
People keep insulting me calling me a dick rider when I’m not even saying anything that should be controversial.
Lots of comments on Twitter attacking Musk.
Look inside and realize what’s happening here.
I’m talking about how I’m worried about how this anti-Musk culture is creating a breeding ground for negative behavior.
I’m talking about being worried about people seeing how evil and vile Musk is that someone might feel justified going out into the real world and acting violently.
Against Musk or anyone they think is not part of that anti-Musk group.
The whole discourse around Musk is very….aggressive.
Everyone feels very justified about it too.
There are multiple subreddits dedicated to how much they hate Elon Musk.
People's dislike for Elon Musk is based on what he as an individual has done, so it's not prejudice and it's not based on what group or groups he belongs to.
