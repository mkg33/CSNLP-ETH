They lie when they say they are centrists because a centrist is someone who works with both sides.
They wonâ€™t work with democrats therefore are not centrists.
They will NOT however turn out for the crists of the world who are just republicans warmed over.
Stop fronting shitty corporate candidates and more like Fetterman and others and watch us continue to reap the victories those voters will provide.
Not to mention when centrist fucks try and hijack those deep blue areas which cause infighting and we lost several NY elections due to shit like that.
You keep spreading this circular firing squad bullshit, the reason progressives lose is when centrists shit on them from the sidelines.
The reason centrists lose is they are sanitized and stand for nothing and give off the "bullshit politician" vibe.
I love how they act like it was progressives from other districts who hurt them and not their own uninspiring centrist politics.
It's a good thing that centrists never have to deal with "progressives" backbiting them, whiningly calling them "corporatists" and all the rest.
If they did they might never win.
