Yes, we hate them, and we have every right to.
If they want to keep fighting and dying for their shitty country and the moron in chief, they're welcome to it.
We're never letting them in peacefully again, deal with it.
You're basically proposing to reward cowardly, selfish Russians who probably supported the war for being hypocritical, selfish cowards.
We don't owe them a fucking thing.
It's great that they realized dying for their shithole country is a bad idea, but it's on them to act on that realization.
I don't care.
If they aren't willing to stand up to their shitty government, they're welcome to go freeze and die in Ukraine instead.
We don't want them.
Thing is, they don’t want to.
If choice is “killing Ukrainians” or “stand for yourself” — Russian always choice a option that involves killing Ukrainians.
I never said it’s Russophobia to hate them for killing Ukrainians, I said it’s stupid to make the ones who don’t want to kill Ukrainians go back and fight the Ukrainians?!
How is this even controversial in the slightest?
