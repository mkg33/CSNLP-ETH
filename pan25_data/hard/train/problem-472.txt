Part supplies have solved down somewhat military production and some equipment is downgraded to using worse parts, for example the sights on tanks.
Also there is a crosspoint where they can't get rid of oil, they need to stop pumping and that's gonna be long term damage to their production capabilities...
The oil sanctions were so far into the future (which maybe was needed to prep and wanting it to be a threat with a timeline)... January is the first month Russia is really losing money, on the country level, running a big deficit that comes out of reserves...
Meaning Russia might actually end up losing money on the oil, simply because they cannot risk capping oil wells, as they may be unsalvagable.
Larger damage to the Russian economy also do thisto some extent, but it's a blunt instrument which will take years to break the Russians.
Sanctions can damage the Russian war efforts to some degree and should be viewed in that light.
Focus should be on doing everything possible to deny materials which have military use.
Personally I dont think sanctions are ever likely to end the war.
Both Russia and Ukraine see it as an existential crisis and it will proceed to a military decision.
