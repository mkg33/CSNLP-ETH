An invading force must consider the armed populace hidden within civilians and even sympathizers.
It makes it much more difficult to control a population with the ability to push back.
I'm not even convinced it's a problem that needs to be addressed.
There are much more pressing and dangerous things to focus on (climate change, rising fascism, wealth inequality, ending the drug war).
If the people are essentially disarmed against their own government, anyone and everyone is a threat.
This is the end of this but its up to the people to act within their powers and keep government constrained within theirs.
And its about the Supreme Court taking power away from the other bodies of government and giving it to themselves.
Legislatures cannot make gun laws because the unelected Supreme Court decides it to be.
This Supreme Court is taking away powers from the legislature, administration and lower courts and giving it to themselves.
Since the supreme court is so out of touch with the people we can change the constitution to remove the 2nd amendment.
The Supreme Court can change the meaning of the constitution without any changes to the constitution.
Gun laws were ok, now not so much.
Abortion bans were bad, now not so much.
