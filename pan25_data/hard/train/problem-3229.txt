I was confused filling my form out for 2019 and as of this post it is costing me $9K!
Luckily I got an accountant that will, hopefully, lower it to $0 after filling out countless paperwork and essentially doing a self-audit to my amended return.
But it's ridiculous.
IRS has been hounding me on this the entire calendar year.
Meanwhile we got this buffoon telling the entire world he cheated on his taxes and they have done NOTHING to get that money back for half a decade now.
cause the president kept saying he could not release his taxes cause irs was auditing them (which is total bullshit).
Seems like one of the key takeaways is that the IRS's mandatory audit for Trump when he became president was basically non-existent.
Trump and Huckabee Sanders lied.
Trump for sure lied to his accountants and trying to keep that many lies straight may as well be impossible.
While this is true, I still fully expect that there are massive holes in his tax story purely based on the known fraud he's committed.
He's accustom to doing the minimum required and having daddy's lawyers clean it up.
