Because republicans once again voted against the working class.
Despite saying they care constantly.
Democrats fucked up too.
But the narrative is putting all the blame on them when the republicans could have voted for the sick days.
If you want to play that game you should simply fault republicans for privatizing the rails years ago.
Biden made a mistake.
That mistake could have been fixed by republicans voting for the sick leave bill.
They refused because they’re evil.
They’re at fault.
People are going to blame who they want to blame.
Everyone involved in this has some blame which is true in every strike that happens.
The workers asked for things they knew they wouldn’t get to add leverage, the railways didn’t give things the workers deserve.
The government forced a deal because not having a deal would hurt even more people than forcing a deal does.
Not to mention most of the unions had agreed to this deal, so not like this is screwing over all the workers.
If the strike would've presented worse problems, perhaps the bosses should've given their workers rights to prevent it.
After the Democrat-controlled house used the last month of their slim majority to trot out a strike busting bill when they could've just stood with the workers.
This is what the Democrats mean when they say that they empathize with the working class, that they'll stick up for workers.
What they mean is that they'll go to lenhs to union-bust and refuse very basic rights to people who need them.
