Moreover during September 1939 while the nazis invaded poland from the west the russians invaded from the east, until 1941 the soviets bypassed the sanctions the world put against germany and that only stopped when the germans invaded the soviet union, once the soviets managed to pushed the nazis out of their borders they stopped at the polish border, delaying the liberation of auschwitz, so the germans and the polish resistance could exhaust eachother and make it easier for the ussr to annex poland.
The auschwitz extermination camp might've never existed without the soviet support until 1941, and it wouldn't've exterminated as many jews if the russians didn't stop at the border.
Russia took over Nazi concentration camps and also created many of their own, but to the best of my knowledge they never ran any extermination camps.
Which is wild because there were plenty of contemporary testimonies of Russian officials horrified of the things they saw in the camps (Although the Russian army did their share of atrocities in their way to Berlin as well).
