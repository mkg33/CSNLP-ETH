Many Qataris now regret the decision.
The many fans that left the stadium half-way through their first game conveyed that mood.
Little did they know that the eyes on them would also make the world see all of the countries negative aspects like: corruption, slavery, worker deaths, racism, anti-lgbtq sentiments, and more.
I just wanna add that FIFA allegedly "pressured" players & fans to not display LGTV symbols like rainbow flags, after SPECIFICALLY getting assurances to the contrary from the host country.
Also the fact that many countries trying to raise awareness on LGTB+ rights ironically got silenced into it.
Intolerant authoritarianism won.
This is where Qatar actually won against 'the world'.
Prior to the World Cup, few Americans had even heard of Qatar.
I'm very serious.
Even the most ignorant here have heard of Saudi Arabia.
Everyone has heard of Iraq, obviously.
Iran, even the most ignorant say "Isn't that somewhere in the Middle East?"
or "Isn't that Persia, sort of?"
or something.
Even Yemen was in the news (rarely) in the earlier days of its war.
