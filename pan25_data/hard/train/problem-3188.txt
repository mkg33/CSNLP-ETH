I don’t doubt there’s people with these views, but their honestly stupid if they think Russia is simply being “soft” here.
So even if someone who believed this were to come into power, assuming a world that’s possible, they are going to find out real quick this is the best Russia has to offer militarily.
I suppose someone can always find a way to worry about extremists and nuclear weapons, but that’s the ONLY other card someone new could actually play, and not just talking about it, but doing it.
But that’s obviously a lose to lose to Russia, there’s no winning there, period end of story.
- So, in the end the Russia's complete victory will be the only choice for Russian authorities, but it would have much lesser cost if they acted correctly from the start.
- At the start of the "special operation" Russia should completely destroy Ukrainian infrastructure and, overall to act much much tougher to finish everything faster.
All the time and even now they act criminally soft which will only lead to more casualties on both sides in the end.
They also should mobilize 1-2 mln people right after the start to keep numerical superiority all the time.
