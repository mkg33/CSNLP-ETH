Did the daughter even know about her absentee ballot?
Maybe the Douche Pickle just put her down as absentee because he knew she would vote opposite of the Râ€™s?
Why would he sign her up for absentee if he thought she would vote against him?
Sounds like she lives and has residency in a different state, so he got her signed up thinking it would be a free vote for him.
Then she voted against him, so he ratted her out for voting illegally.
Voter fraud is messing with your vote (e.g.
voting more times than you're allowed to).
Election fraud is messing with other people's votes.
Election fraud, on the other hand, racks up into the tens of thousands during every election.
Especially voter suppression.
Wish I could say it's always strictly a red state problem.
But red states sure do more than their share of it.
But yeah, everything going to hell in a handbag makes perfect sense when you think about the conservative agenda getting its way.
Remember a few elections ago when they claimed Soros brought thousands of illegal voters in by bus?
Someone figured out that Soros would have needed several thousand busses to transport all the people they claimed were there.
