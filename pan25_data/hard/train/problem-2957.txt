There's also a good possibility that he laid them off so he could have a nice pool of talent to choose from at his new company.
Out of work, just before Christmas, they'd be pretty motivated to take any available job in their field.
Can you imagine the ownership people at Twitter, when he offered to buy them for $44 billion?
They must have peed their pants laughing/ crying.
Then they held him to it, got their money and ran, laughing hysterically to the bank.

Never let the accountants have a say in management.
Whenever they start getting uppity and offering opinions on how to run the company, chase them back to their cubicles and make them get back to their calculators and spreadsheets.
Nobody wants opinions from number crunchers, just accurate numbers.
Do that job, and let good managers manage.
Well but the company just wants to make money not to work well.
A company that makes money but doesn't work well or shifts the burden on the workers is still a win in capitalist terms.
