ok, yeah, makes sense.
just automatically assumed that declining birth rates = shrinking population, but the way you interpreted the data sounds correct.
But declining birth rates ≠ shrinking population, it means the population isn’t growing as fast as it used to.
Immigration also needs to be considered, though I doubt Russia is getting many applications these days.
No, you’re right.
Russia _previously_ had a growing population prior to the invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent flight of Russian citizens (especially men) from the country.
Russia already successfully committed genocide against Ukraine just in the past century alone; The was a deliberate man-made famine caused by the Soviets under direction from Stalin, and it killed 3.5 - 5 million Ukrainians by starvation.
It was Stalin’s intent to kill off the Ukrainians entirely as a people, so that Soviet Russia could seize the territory permanently and resettle it with loyal Russian occupants.
The classic genocide + invasive colonization combo.
• B) Ukraine would be the perfect multi-lane junction between Russia and the rest of Europe, as Ukraine shares borders with six other countries (seven including Russia), many of which Russia would _love_ to invade or “reclaim”.
Those countries (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, Belarus) with the exception of Belarus, would sooner die than be invaded by the Russians… _again._.
