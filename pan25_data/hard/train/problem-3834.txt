If you didn't read the article: she was arrested last year in April, weeks after the Mariupol Theater bombings.
She is being jailed for "fake news" when she stated that it happened, when the ministry of defence said it didn't.
This should be a very important reminder of what happens when you make laws where the government determines what is “fake news”.
By the way, funny thing: the words ‘fake news’ were imported here almost verbatim during Trump's run for the presidency and his years in the seat.
The term is commonplace now, such that the word ‘fake’ is calqued by members of the Duma and other top brass.
‘The Dictator's Handbook’ and ‘Spin Dictators’ both seem to be good books on the matter.
It really clicked for me why Russian policemen seemed to pretend to follow the rulebook while cooking up the charges, for twenty years already at the least—when I heard Sergei Guriev explain the gist of ‘Spin Dictators’.
One thing I heard recently from a sociology expert on one of the last independent Russian-language podcasts (I forget who exactly the man was): it's entirely possible that a random man from Russian ‘regions’, i.e.
outside of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, doesn't know what the West means by ‘democracy’—for them the word means what they had in the 90s, when the economy was in the dumpster and politics was a shitshow, up to now.
The tv and the websites say we have a democracy, so why would they doubt it when they don't read or watch independent press.
It's cheaper to have a dictatorship that convinces people that it's a democracy—than to suppress any and all dissent by force.
Putin has switched to the latter option, but Erdoğan and Orbán are still in the ‘spin’ mode.
