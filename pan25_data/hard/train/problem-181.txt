Ukraine could save Lukashenko's ass with a pact against Russia, because the Belarus people/military have shown past sympathies with Ukraine and getting Belarus on the side of Ukraine in a controlled manner would be a good idea.
Sources within the Russian military leadership say the Kremlin has made a decision on a radical “solution” to the issue of dragging Belarus into Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine.
According to the said plot, “Zas will shortly declare Belarus’s accession into Russia as an autonomous entity, allegedly to prevent the military threat facing Belarus from Ukraine and Poland.
A propaganda narrative will be spun again claiming that the attempt on Lukashenko has been masterminded by Washinon.”.
The latest reports coming from sources in Moscow speak in favor of a dramatic scenario for Aleksandr Lukashenko.
The GRU tilts toward the scenario involving the murder of Lukashenko and the appointment of Zas, analysts report citing sources.
The Russian GRU is looking into the scenario involving Lukashenko’s death and his replacement by CSTO General Secretary Stanislav Zas, who is “fully loyal to Russia and under GRU’s control.”.
“With Russian troops already deployed in Belarus and sabotage groups being sent there, the risk is high for Lukashenko to lose office and be replaced by a Russian puppet leader anytime soon,” the report stresses.
“Russia is most likely to stage acts of armed provocation in Belarus with a view to push Lukashenko into joining the war.
But fear of losing power will remain a key obstacle for him to make that step.”.
