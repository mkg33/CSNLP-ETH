The average Chinese person is already emitting less.
If you want things to be fairer then we should all try to reach the same or similar levels right?
Or are you saying some people are entitled to more emissions?
Which groups are entitled to higher levels of emissions?
Americans?
Of course per capita matters, if you care about fairness that is.
The average Chinese emits half as much as an American, yet you want them to emit even less?
You want them to consume even less?
IFS a lot easier for an American to drop their emissions if they sacrifice their high quality of life than it is for a Chinese.
China may lead on renewables, but they also had a long ways to go to improve their air quality.
It's too bad Republicans back in the early 2000s didn't get behind legislation to help fund this industry.
Now, all of our solar panels come from China rather than being made in the US.
We're finally doing it for computer chips (with the CHIPS Act), but it should have been done for solar--to keep the industry invented in the US to be manufactured in the US.
Now our biggest geopolitical adversary is the dominant player in this market.
