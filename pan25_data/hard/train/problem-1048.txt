While it's interesting to see some Republicans turning on Trump, you still get gems like this on their subreddit.
Trump knows he's in an information war with the democrats.
He and Ron are working together on this "beef" so the media will focus all of their energy on it.
This was discussed as a war tactic by Sun Tzu where, in order for the enemy to "win" they must have foreknowledge.
I believe Trump is curating the foreknowledge for an unknown reason that we will realize at a later date.
In the case I'm wrong, it's an incredibly bad move to war with nationally recognized conservatives.
However, I do NOT think Trump is that oblivious.
I’m thinking DeSantis doesn’t have to take on Trump.
DOJ will do all his dirty work for him.
I do think he will run in 2024.
The GOP sees what Trump is doing to them, and I doubt they want more of that.
I actually think DeSantis, who is a Yale graduated attorney and former Navy JAG, has a pretty good read on the legal perils facing Trump.
I think he’s going to sit back, let Trump rant and rave, while DeSantis surrogates take over any response, and watch the wheels of Justice catch up with Trump.
When they release the shit they have on Trump (much like they did with Cawthorn), to turn public opinion, I wonder if Trump fires back?
And now that much of the establishment GOP is pissed off at Trump, who knows, they might just nudge things forward to push Trump into DOJ’s trap!
