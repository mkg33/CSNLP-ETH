We can tear down literal city blocks of police brutality but we can’t organize in any real way against what causes a majority of crime.
Rich people aren’t making personal sales of 600, and this isn’t targeted at them anyways, so if the irs needs more people they must first prove they aren’t still taking back alley deals as they clearly were with trump and friends.
It needs to stop.
We need to get mad and ask why dems and republicans alike have refused to close these holes.
Remember the democrat donors use the same loopholes trump did, and that’s why democrats won’t close those loopholes.
Rich Democrats undoubtedly utilize all of the same loopholes to avoid paying taxes.
Republicans likely use them more only because more rich folks choose the Republican Party because It is more invested in helping them maintain their capital.
The reason Republicans (and others) are freaking out about hiring thousands of new IRS agents is because Trump isn’t alone in this kind of shady shit.
He’s making tens of millions off interest on existing assets and managing to pay little or no taxes by declaring business losses and various deductions with little or no documentation.
