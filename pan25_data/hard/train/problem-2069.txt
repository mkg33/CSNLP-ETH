It also annoys me that the media calls this shit "Right to Work".
Can you imagine the conservative anger if the media called it "Union Stomping" or "Right to Poverty"?
You can disagree with your union and still be part of the union.
I would say lots of people regularly don't agree with everything their union does, just like most people don't agree with everything their government does.
Literally not a union then.
That's just scabbing with extra steps.
You don't like the union in a shop?
Work in a different shop.
You don't get to fuck it up for everyone else.
No, they don't.
That doesn't meet the legal definition of a "service".
Unions are not obligated to provide these things, they are collective units to argue for workers.
Whether or not a given union is responsible for a given set of working conditions is conjecture (and if they're responsible for providing the benefits, are they also liable for any downsides?
).
Yes, but why should workers be forced to join something they personally disagree with or find repugnant?
Freedom of association works both ways: freedom to join a union also means freedom NOT to join a union.
You are engaging in empirical coercion and using nebulous statistics like worker compensation to justify it.
If you could raise worker compensation by taking away other civil liberties, would you approve of that too?
You are advocating for coercion because you personally like the structure of a union even though many workers do not.
It's not intellectually rigorous to say "all the upsides we attribute to the union, all the downsides we attribute to capitalism".
