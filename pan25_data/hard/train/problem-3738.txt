They were so pissed at the guy after Georgia and then Kevin McCarthy thanked Trump for all his help when he became speaker.
They can't quit Trump no matter how much they pretend otherwise.
Trump won't burn the GOP to the ground.
They will cut a backroom deal, toss him some cash, dangle a pardon, promise to go after his enemies, whatever.
He's a narcissist, but he's also for sale.
The GOP will just buy him off; don't expect any help from Trump in 2024.
I don't see how you can live in this timeline, where people bought out $100 Donald Trump NFTs, and say Trump doesn't care about cash or other forms of pay offs.
The man operates on quid pro quos.
I guarantee you his people have already delivered a list of demands to the GOP for his continued "support", and that negotiations are already under way.
The GOP has a lot of money at it's disposal.
Do you actually think that, if the GOP told Trump "$10 billion, no more legal problems, and we'll pay for all your future rallies in full", he'd say "No, I'm going to run third party?"
Especially with how far McCarthy just bent over to the Trump wing in Congress?
You must have access to a time machine, because you're making a really bold claim there about an election that's almost 2 years away.
Polls are barely valid 2 weeks into the future, not 2 years.
I agree that Trump running third party would hand the election to the Democrats, and I love that idea.
But, there's no reason to start the doom and gloom for 2024 2 years early.
Lots will happen between then and now that will completely invalidate the polls you are citing.
We just had an election.
Breath.
Unless you are a politician running in 2024 or one of their staff, there is literally nothing you can do right now regarding 2024.
Not even keep on top of polls.
Because, again, there is no scenario where the polls for the 2024 election at the end of 2022 mean anything important at all.
