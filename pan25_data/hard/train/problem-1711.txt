And if Republicans keep getting elected they'll probably liquidate Medicare and social security to do it.
For anyone in November 2016 who mocked those of us hating that trump got elected, the answer to your "how bad could it get?"
question is, "it can get this bad.
And it's going to get worse.
".
Yeah.
I think the election of Donald Trump, then his presidency, then the insurrection attempt all really drove this home.
To me, Trump just has absolutely no fucking redeeming qualities.
People would say they didn't vote for him cuz of the racism.
Okay.
So you voted for a manchild reality show host for what fucking reason then?
There's nothing good about him, and he keeps getting worse.
I don't understand how I'm supposed to find common ground with someone who just thinks such stupid fucking shit.
Because people are stupid and believe nonsense.
My neighbor who served in the army tried to tell me that he was never vaccinated.
When he joined they gave him a pamphlet to fill out on which vaccine he was willing to get.
Dude is a nonsensical liar and thatâ€™s all the anti vaxx idiots.
