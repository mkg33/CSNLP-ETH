Fight back by killing random civilians?
Itâ€™s not a tit for tat game dude we are talking about real lives.
The IDF is doing a lot of fucked ip things but that in no way justified terrorists attacks against random people.
And yes, Israel kills people, usually in response to terrorist attacks.
If the attacks would stop, so would the army raids.
Ukraine is a sovereign country that was invaded.
Palestine has never been a sovereign Arab country, nor was it invaded, as Judea/Samaria (only called the west bank once Jordan invaded and illegally annexed it) was actually part of the land given to Israel by the UN.
The "Palestinians" have been murdering Jewish civilians for being Jewish since the Arab colonization of the Land of Israel.
PS : The vast majority of massacres in Palestine have been perpetuated by the Israeli Govenment and Extremists aligned with the Government.
The Overwhelming Majority of Muslims support Palestine, And condemn the actions of the Israeli Government aswell.
The truth is that the vast majority of middle-eastern people support palestine, This is one of the many things that truly unite the middle east, It crosses religious, cultural and political barriers, It is a true fact.
Seriously speaking though, I support Palestine because unlike you I have excellent reading comprehension and literacy, And therefor I use it to the best of my ability and read about the history of palestine from the early 20th century to the modern age.
