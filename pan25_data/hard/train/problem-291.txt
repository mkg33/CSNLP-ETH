God didn't change his mind about child molesters.
They have always been condemned they just like to use the fact that it isn't spelled out in the Bible to try to say it wasn't.
But God condemns all sex outside of marriage.
And the Bible states that a person is to wait for marriage until they are past the "bloom of youth" or after they have finished puberty.
And yet despite the hundreds of years time difference and the places where those scriptures are in different parts and yet they agree.
But the important part here is that the Bible does not condone child abuse and those that try to use it to justify their wickedness are the ones in the wrong.
Unfortunately though their misuse of the Bible taints people's perspective of it without them really reading and understanding the Bible.
So, just so we're clear, how do we know which ones wickedly used the Bible or simply make their own wrongful interpretations, and which ones are adhering to the word of God?
I only ask because that sure would be a scary precedent to set for a religion based around reading a book written by many people hundreds of years apart on that supposed word of God, you know?
Oh ok, so the change in the Vatican then wasn't God's ruling, but man's?
A mortal and human interpretation of God's will, if you would?
