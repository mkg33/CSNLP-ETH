"Fine, after denying it for 40 years we will finally admit climate change is real BUT we're going to claim it's not caused by people so there's nothing we can do.
Maybe in 20 more years we'll admit it was us all along, you know, when it's really too late.
".
PS.
We are working towards the same goal.
I think it would be great if we could develop the technology to preserve nature and the environment.
Not to mention sustain the planet.
I'm just trying to find a realistic solution that doesn't kill lots of people.
Also if you claim to care about poor people, which I'm sure you do, then you would know that these climate policies hurt, starve, and actually kill the disadvantaged and poorest people.
So is it okay to sacrifice them?
What is your solution?
And again by the way...
I wish there were more people like you and I truly commend you.
I really don't even want to argue I'm just trying to find a realistic solution.
I don't think there's a realistic solution at this point tbh.
My whole point is that most people aren't even environmentally conscious themselves, but they want to blame someone else who is similar to them.
Everyone is pointing the finger elsewhere.
Buying products they know produce greenhouse gasses, but yet don't want to take any of the blame.
Like do you see people reducing meat consumption or making real efforts to reduce their carbon footprint?
This may be an anecdote, but where I live almost noone bikes on walks yet most of the vehicles on the road are inefficient.
