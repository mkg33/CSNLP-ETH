Call me crazy, but I'm starting to think Republicans running on "the election was stolen" and "early/mail voting is insecure and we should discourage our voters from doing it" wasn't exactly a great way to inspire confidence in their voters to vote.
Like a story says something as benign as "vote counting will take a few more days" and without fail the majority of the comments will be "I think we all know why" Or if a story is like "[random democrat] feels confident, wrapping up campaign" the comments are all "because the outcome is predetermined".
It's crazy how ingrained the "Dems stealing elections" narrative is among Republicans based on literally NOTHING.
Rconservative at the moment is an outlier with all the relatively normal visitors, but in almost every place where the commenters lean right they cling HARD to that narrative.
Judging by comment sections, republican base are NOT happy with Fox anchors attacking Trump, essentially calling them all RINO's and deep state plants etc.
Biden may not be in his prime, but they keep underestimating the guy, even after two straight election losses to him.
I voted for Biden in the 2020 primary because I thought he would not only beat Trump but would be best for Democrats downticket.
Was slightly disappointed in 2020 on that front, but this week has made up for it.
