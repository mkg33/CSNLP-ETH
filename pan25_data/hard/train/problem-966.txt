My take is that either malfunctioning S300 missile(russians were hitting themselves with malfunctioning S300 a few times already), or it was kh-101 which trajectory was messed up after AD failed to hit it directly.
Yeah.
I'm Ukrainian and my first thought was that it was AD failure.
Like during this war this would be not the first time that happened And it makes no sense for both russia and Ukraine to hit Poland, especially with S300 missiles which don't have range to fly there from russian territory and wrecks would be found anyway.
It would be kind of funny if it turned out that Russia fired the missile from Ukrainian territory, hoping that NATO would just mindlessly attack Ukraine in retaliation.
Ukraine either deliberately fired them into Poland trying to escalate the war into NATO so that NATO will enter the war.
Or Ukraine fired air defense missiles at a Russian cruise missile and it missed and the Ukrainian missile landed in Poland.
The missile fragments found in Poland are from Ukrainian S300 system.
I believe itâ€™s the latter, an unfortunate misfire by Ukrainian air defense.
A Russian misfire, or a Ukranian air defence misfire are by far the most likely explanations for this.
