What about Jordan and black september?
If Israel acted like Jordan integrating the population providing equal rights and citizenship remove military law and release all political and military prisoners then the conflict would have been over, the fact that most Jordanians and most palestinians refused to take part in the fighting should tell you something, my grandfather refused direct orders from the king and almost got to court for it, but again it was in the past like more than 50 years ago.
Yes Israel should treat palestinians as equal or leave them be, the reason why dont hear about palestinians violence in Jordan nowadays is simply because they are equal, every single incident of violence since the 70a was by jordanians or syrians, had israel taken our approach then it would jave been fine.
If israel got the same results as we have then the conflict is over, there is no more conflict, our mistake was allowing parties to be armed being to easy on their transgressions on the sovereignty while no one would think it was about if palestinians should have had citizenship, also palestinians were much better educated and were much better at trade and manufacturing so i hate to admit it but they are the ones to make this country turn from a desert not worth occupying into the most advanced and educated country jn the arab world.
2) The goal of the disengagement from Gaza was not to be nice to the Palestinians; Israel left due to the realization that Israel could never achieve Jewish majority in Gaza (no majority, no potential future annexation, no point in staying).
Even further, Sharon's plan was apparently to torpedo any chance of peace with the Palestinians with that disengagement plan:
I'm just pointing out that anyone who thinks there's any chance of peace with Hamas is delusional, because Hamas themselves explicitly state that their purpose is a neverending fight with Jews.
Unfortunately, Hamas is very popular with Palestinians - even those in the West Bank who aren't under direct threat from Hamas...
In fact, those in the West Bank are in more risk for admitting to support Hamas than the other way around, and yet Hamas would win the elections there according to polls.
