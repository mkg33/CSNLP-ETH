That's the thing.
This is what they're doing on purpose.
Putting all the power of kids' education into parents who don't know anything means you're going to get more uneducated children, kids that might as well be kids from previous generations.
After all, your narrative starts to crumble when you say you're "doing it for the children", but the children use their own minds and agency to protest because they don't support what you're doing.
So many people compelled to write a comment making kids feel self conscious about speaking up… so shockingly few comments here taking the time to provide better, more effective alternatives.
Maybe if we took the same amount of time we spent coming up with biting comments on social media towards kids trying to figure out some way to make a difference… and instead came up with a way they could be more effective and wrote eloquently about that instead we could be the change we want to see… instead of just trying to make a bunch of kids feel self conscious about giving a damn.
That’s a good thing.
It might not convince _every_ parent, but it might convince one or two stay at home parents to start showing up at PTA meetings that aren’t currently only sat in by the pro DeSantis crazies and THAT might start having an impact.
Who knows, right now the only people there are the people who have too much time and too much crazy.
That doesn’t mean the parents who, until now, haven’t been paying attention to politics but who might be against them don’t deserve to know it’s something they should be angered by.
Let those kids help try and tell them.
