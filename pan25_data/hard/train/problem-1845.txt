Lol.
Here's some grow-up juice for you.
Governments lie.
They all do.
Especially in times of stress...like war.
Just because Ukraine are the Good Guys doesn't mean they won't lie to gain an advantage.
America lied.
Russia Lies.
Israel Lies.
Ukraine lies.
Canada would probably lie.
As an American who is familiar with the "casualty math" used during Vietnam, I have a hard time taking these counts seriously.
I hope they are drastically undercounting russian casualties, but history has shown casualty numbers are just unreliable.
There are plenty of independent western analysts counting casualties alongside Ukrainian sources, they do differ in places, but not terribly so.
This comparison is not appropriate.
Governments certainly do lie, but it has fuck all to do with what I am asking and it does not give you a justification to smugly declare those numbers are wrong without proof.
Where are your numbers that disprove them?
America lied about Vietnam haha I am very smart, but likeâ€¦.that is not relevant to Ukraine, in 2022, at all.
