It happens, it's sad.
But bad actions on the part of a civilian populace cannot and never will make the Invader the 'good guys'.
As far as I'm concerned, any blame for reprisals taken by Ukrainian forces against real or supposed Russian collaborators will be on the hands of Putin.
He started this war.
Ever single bad thing that happens through the course of it is his fault, and noone elses.
Simply put, if the question 'would this have happened if Russia had not illegally invaded Ukraine?'
is asked, and the answer is 'No', it's Russia/Putin's fault.
Period.
The only one served by such inquiries at this moment is time is Russia, desperately hoping to mitigate their own war crimes.
There is a such thing as a 'dirty war', where all sides are bad actors and everything must be decided case-by-case with no weighting to either side, but as things stand, sole blame for any and all harmful actions taken by either side throughout the course of the conflict lays on Russia first, for creating the instability that led to those actions being taken.
And for the most part that will be what happens but there will be a few incidents of extrajudicial reprisals which will be blown up to say "see both sides" by Russia and its reactionary political allies in the West.
