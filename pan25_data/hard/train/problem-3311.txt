Sunk and punched a hole into it so bad it wasn't a guarantee the ship would be repaired.
I see they half assed the repair again.
Though with Russia it's probably more of a quarter ass or one eighth ass at this point.
And all the things that make them safer are shit that Russia probably sucks big ass at.
Procedure.
Attention to detail.
Discipline, being "On Job".
Training.
Aircraft carriers are extremely fire prone, historically.
They're basically a giant fuel and munitions warehouse that floats on water and happens to carry planes.
That aircraft carrier is nothing but a floating dock anyway.
Did Xzibit set this up?
Yo dog I heard you like floating docks so I put a floating dock on your floating dock.
You laugh, but it might just happen!
Not because they’re afraid of the military threat that piece of shit represents, but the long-term environmental impact of it getting anywhere near your own country’s aquatic ecosystem.
That aircraft carrier is nothing more than a floating superfund site.
In my days an aircraft carrier behaved like an aircraft carrier and was proud to be an aircraft carrier.
There used to be a time when ships had some strong steel bellies that were even triple layered with strong backup pumps.
