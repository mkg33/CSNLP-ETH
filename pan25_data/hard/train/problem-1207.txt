The UK job one the other hand is in part to be a check on the police.
They are elected by the people to be a watchdog on law enforcement.
They are about as far from a US county sheriff as you can possibly get, especially the idiot ones that say things like in this article.
Maybe Sherrifs don’t do it much given their rank, but they definitely could.
They have every legal authority to do it and some definitely do exercise that power.
They do have more authority when theyre UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION.
They're elected officials that swore an oath to the Constitution.
Use your head lmao its funny when anti gun tyrants think they have more authority than the Constitution.
And again, you're still listing state laws thats below the Constitution.
You can tell sheriffs what to do but remember, Sheriffs are elected officials that SWORE AN OATH to the Constitution.
Second, sheriffs are elected officials, but they’re bound by the same laws as everyone else.
They aren’t constitutional scholars and they don’t get to decide what is or isn’t constitutional.
If think a law is unconstitutional they need to take it up with the elected officials who make the laws, or they need to go through the courts like anyone else.
If you believe a law is unconstitutional, as an elected official you have the sworn obligation not to enforce it.
The onus is on the legislature to sue you to enforce it and prove it is constitutional.
Because the Constitution decides those laws.
Is your brain working?
Constitution>State laws.
Not that hard to think about.
Stop trying to take peoples guns away lmao guns help save tens of thousands of girls from rape by bigger stronger men every year in the US alone, and that includes your daughter, wife, and mother.
