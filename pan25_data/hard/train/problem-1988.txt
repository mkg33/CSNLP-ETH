They intend for it to not be possible.
Read what happens if it fails to be repealed.
The national sales tax just ends.
Itâ€™s a sales tax.
And while states have low sales taxes (and some have none), the last time this was tried the estimate was a 23% rate across the board.
Lower income people would get crushed by this.
Remembering that the current income tax is stepped in rates (pay 10% on the first 10,000, then 12% over 10,001 to $40,000) people making less than $170,000 a year would pay more in Federal tax than they do now.
So an easy way to get the rich yet another tax break.
You could, states do that like PA on food and clothing.
Butt you still need the IRS to manage that.
Think of 47 states worth of tax departments to manage the cash flow and the audits.
Some public schools actually offer a class in personal finance where they go over things like how loans work, taxes, savings plans, retirement plans, etc.
But we all know how the GQP is all about reducing funding for public schools, that is the real underlying plan.
Keep the next generations stupid, they will believe anything.
