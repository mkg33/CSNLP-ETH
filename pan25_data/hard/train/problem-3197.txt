You realize entering into the US without proper documentation Carries the same legal weight as a parking ticket?
It’s not a felony, it’s a civil misdemeanor.
In the words of your founding father Benjamin Franklin- “Leges Sine Moribus Vanae.” Laws without morals are in vain.
If you can’t comprehend the humanitarian crisis that abysmal US immigration law is causing, then we have nothing more to discuss.
If you want to debate realistic solutions to the immigration crises I'm okay to debate that, but what you're talking about doesn't come close to solving the problem.
There's no guarantee that even IF companies paid a 'fair share' that any money would help secure the border and immigration system.
You can't slot all the immigrants arriving at the border into every single one of those homes and call it good.
How would you match people to homes?
Who gets to go where?
What criteria would you use to mash people into a rich property vs a shitty seasonal worker quarters?
Let me be clear, I'm for a much more robust immigration system with clearer guidelines, vastly shortened processing periods, and a path to amnesty for immigrants already in country.
As the climate crisis becomes more and more of a danger the immigration waves are only going to increase.
Democrats need to enact a solution now, or the Republicans will own the issue and use it to gain power.
I don't think you should be reveling in it quite so much but I agree with the point about the government not being ready.
