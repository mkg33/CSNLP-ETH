The “moderate Republican with Dem support” is about the 3rd most likely outcome.
The most likely is still that the freedom caucus successfully extorts McCarthy for all the power and Q-fueled inanity their Russian handlers told them to demand, and the worst session in modern history begins.
He already agreed to this.
But a motion to vacate doesn’t necessarily mean the motion will carry.
In fact, for many years any one member could move to to replace the speaker, but it was rarely invoked because of the certainty it wouldn’t pass.

You don’t have to vote for Jeffries if not voting lowers the threshold needed for him to become Speaker.
If those 20 abstain it would be 212-202 and Jeffries would become speaker (they actually only need 11 of them to make this happen).
