The danger to society piece also also has shown to be too rigid in practice.
Here in NY a lot of violent offenders have been released RoR because finding the gray area in no bail or held without bail has been tough to navigate.
Infact a cash bail systems makes it MORE likely that someone will be released and reoffend as they only need to post bail to be released despite having that risk.
Making bail excessive to the point that a person has no means to pay it is a problem - but that calls for a different kind of reform than simply eliminating cash bail.
Traditionally the one making a claim, that removing cash bail has no impact on crime, is responsible for proving their assertions.

Shouldn't you prove that your desired policy (cash bail) actually serves whatever purpose it's intended to?
You can let yourself off the hook by saying you can't prove a negative if you want, but it doesn't make whatever case you're hoping to make any stronger.
In either case I'm not invested in whatever you're saying, and not making any claims, so I'm not expecting you to prove anything at all.
