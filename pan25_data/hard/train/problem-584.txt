I thought the numbers were more like 100k Russian military deaths and 100k Ukrainian military and civilian deaths because the Russians have bombed indiscriminately.
“It is estimated that 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far,” Head of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen.
Seems to be in or around 1 to 1 losses on the battlefield between the Ukrainians and the Russians.
Which is actually quite impressive as the Ukrainian military do not have access to the same huge amount of artillery that the Russians have.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) verified a total of 6,702 civilian deaths during Russia's invasion of Ukraine as of December 4, 2022.
Of them, 424 were children.
(dated December 4, 2022).
I know its necessary for propaganda purposes to make it look like one side is killing a lot more than the other side but it does look like it is a bloodbath for everyone over there.
The real truth will come out in 5-10 years.
