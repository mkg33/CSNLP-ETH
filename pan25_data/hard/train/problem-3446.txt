The question is, should the United States be a voluntary union of equals?
And I believe the answer to that question is "yes."
If, for example, Puerto Rico voted to join the United States, I believe they should also have the right to leave the Union if and when they so choose.
To keep Puerto Rico in a union agains its will would be colonialism in all but name.
And so it is with any other state.

This should be a voluntary union.
Yes, that is how secession works.
That is how it worked when South Sudan became an independent country, it is what happened when the UK left the EU, and it is what would have happened if Scotland had voted Yes in Indyref.
