People pair alcohol with music or sports events because it loosens them up, its paired culturally and drinking together is seen as a bonding exercise.
Maybe.
But its not just deep, its inappropriate conversations, its dark humour, its speaking without a filter.
I don’t hear many sober people gather and have sexually explicit jokes or conversations.
I don’t drink 28 days out of the month, but the two days I go to the pub for a few hours I do.
Would be funny if someone said to me “oh what you can’t go a few hours on a Saturday night without drinking?” like I haven’t just done it for 28 days.
I’m not into either football or drinking enough for it to affect me but it’s not really fair to say “if you can’t go a few hours without drinking”.
Tbh I'm not against banning alcohol in football grounds if the actual reason was to improve the experience for everyone, but obviously that's not what's going on here.
Have you met drunk men?
Many are perfectly fine but there is a sizeable minority who can just about behave in a civilised way when sober but are unable to maintain the veneer when drinking.
