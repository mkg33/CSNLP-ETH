Itâ€™s probably worse now post-Covid.
This pandemic unified the large amount of people who distrust science and health policies.
If we have a more lethal pandemic we are screwed.
We were poorly prepared for this last pandemic what makes anyone think that we will be prepared for the next pandemic?
Okay international Red Cross we know we are all dangerously unprepared for future pandemics.
We've always been dangerously unprepared for any pandemic.
Our species can't even handle mild isolation during a pandemic.
People are going to go insane when an actual food shortage hits.
The funny part is that COVID was actually a very small thing that only became big due to people being stupid.
COVID showed that the general population is a bunch of dumb fucks.
Even simple stuff as stay inside, wear a mask, showed an immediate and clear problem with a very large part of the population.
Granted, an actual deadly virus that kills in a couple of days/weeks, would've solved that shit real quick.
But our biggest problem is, people are idiots.
And then I won't even get into that if the next pandemic is zombies, aliens or some other invasive 'species', we'll get movements that want to protect the zombies rights.
To what extend do we actually need to plan for something, that almost by definition, is not plannable for?
