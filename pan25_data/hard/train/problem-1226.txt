It let's you see how other countries view a topic, lot of times you get a better understanding of the topics because they publish information that might not be reported in your country, etc etc etc.
it was known very well by Poland that German law requires any country that wants to send German tanks to actually send a request to get approval for doing so.
German law requires approval for the re-export of military equipment, meaning the hundreds of Leopard tanks in Europe can only be sent to Ukraine with Berlin’s consent.
"The reason: In addition to overseeing his own fleet of Leopard tanks — and Europe’s largest economy — Scholz must approve other countries’ donations of the German-made tanks.
".
People keep claiming that "Germany has said they will approve" and other variations on the same, but Scholz certainly hasn't said that, and as you pointed out, the SPD doesn't seem to want to approve them.
We've heard a few individuals in the government say that Germany _should_ approve the transfers, but that's not the same thing.
If Scholz just came out and said that he and is party supported the transfers, then there wouldn't be any confusion.
Can you link us to an article or speech in which Scholz or his party unambiguously said they would approve the transfers?
