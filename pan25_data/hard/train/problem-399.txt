Hamas.
Terrorists.
Militants killed were justified.
Just so the Antisemitism community sees that before they start with their "Israel is bad" garbage...defending their country as usual..as they always have to.
Hamas , Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad armed and funded by Iran.
So glad Netanyahu is back.
He's going to clean up the Ayatollah problem.
He's not hesitating this time.
Really simple equation:.
Don't be a terrorist, and there won't be any demolishing of terrorists' family homes.
If terrorists can follow that rule, they'd be all set .
Bad decisions lead to bad outcomes.
And then people like you wanna whine about it.
Demolishing a terrorist home sends a clear message.. doesn't it now?
Cleaning up nice.
If these maniacs decide to not be terrorists, maybe the homes would not get demolished.
Except thatâ€™s not what happened or even why they demolish the home.
Go read about the Palestinian Authorities pay to slay policy.
This is a reaction to that.
If the PA stop paying people to kill Jews this will stop.
