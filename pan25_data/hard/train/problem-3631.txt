The fact we’ve only just made a decision [on sending tanks] and already the next debate [fighter jets] is firing up in Germany – that just seems frivolous and undermines people’s trust in government decisions,” said Scholz in an interview with the German newspaper Tagesspiegel on Sunday.
That's why he says don't enter a bidding war.
Because he wants to take a more cautious approach, so it makes him look bad when they do.
But he doesn't like that it's making him look bad.
The German military has had incompetent civilian leaders for years.
Which lead to the bad position they are in now.
Combine that with him seeming to want an off ramp every single chance.
Yes it makes the German government look bad.
I mean, the German government is kinda doing that all on their own through the actions and statements they're making.
Third, why the hell should a German chancellor not have the courage to take decisions without first asking his US counterpart to "go first"?
That is precisely the indecisiveness I find appalling.
