Honestly I think Republicans would reject him..
Except They are losing seats in the house.. something like 2 - 3 have been overturned after Recounts.
Losing his seat would 100% even with another Special election would put a Dem in another house Seat.
They are going to cling to him because he's a seat in their favor, nothing more.
Yes, make fun of a man who had a Stroke.. how very Republican of you.
Also have you seen Trump's Greatest hits when it comes to speaking?
I would honestly hold off on talking about Biden until you watch Trump fuck up HIS OWN NAME.
I mean honestly are you trying to imply Trump 'speaks' better than Biden?
Even Fox News discontinued their "he can't speak three sentences" propaganda for the sheep herd the day after the election ended.
What does that mean "all there"?
Is he perfect?
Of course not.
Would I prefer a younger person as President?
Yes.
But, he has plenty of experience.
He's well liked amongst our allies.
He knows "the ropes" of governing.
He's still capable.
But, for how much longer?
No one knows.
Age deteriorates people.
I think he's much better than Trump - which isn't really saying much in the way of being any type of compliment.
Thanks but he's better than Trump at pretty much anything.
Trump has a whole laundry list of crimes and lies lmao.
Oh and Eric Trump's laptop is what we should be talking about!
