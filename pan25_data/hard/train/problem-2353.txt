There are many questions I would have about this.
Who would be on the panel and would these individuals be unbiased or fair to the victim?
Would they come from different backgrounds or walks of life?
Would they be a diverse panel?
What about their political beliefs or ideology?
Who would appoint these individuals?
All of these factors would influence how a person would rule on a panel or the outcome of the case.
How many women do you think would come forward and face these panels.
A few but not many.
Then these same individuals who want rape panels would then turn around and say that rape isn't a problem as no woman reports it.
Oh my god What a relief At first when I saw the headline I assumed these "rape panels" would be Republicans picking and choosing which women they were allowed to rape.
Do you really think these panels wouldn't be stuffed full of forced birthers who see their real job not as approving women to have abortion, but instead to re-abuse them and blame them for being raped?
This idea is already shown to not work when the panel is just a single judge, who rules that some high school girl asking for permission to get an abortion is too immature to know what's best for her, but mature enough to care for a baby.
