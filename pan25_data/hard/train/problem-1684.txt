Age was the real discriminant here.
White women under 45 were majority Democratic, over 45 is where it flips over to Republican.
The latter group just ends up dominating the overall category because, surprise, older people are more likely to vote.
No, the author of the article paints with a broad brush and never went to the effort of wrestling with the data to pull out the actual numbers.
You could, if you were so inclined, probably get the actual numbers for white women with regards to their opinion on abortion and how they voted if you fidget around with the data in White and Women and their categories.
Older white women probably aren’t getting pregnant so the roe decision has no impact on them directly, and they probably just shame anyone younger for getting unwanted pregnancies out of jealousy or some gross thinking like “I would’ve kept my legs closed.”.
Oh you mean women who typically are done having kids and probably won't need an abortion that were able to get abortions when they needed them, don't care about protecting other women because all they need to get into heaven is save the fetuses right?
Unfortunately I doubt that even women dying from not receiving medically necessary abortions will get their attention... with the way they think, they'll just look at it as successfully weeding out the "weak breeders" from the gene pool.
