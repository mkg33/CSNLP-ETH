It's called passive voice.
News use it all the time.
Like, cops never kill people, people just end up dead in "officer involved shootings".
But I’m their twisted logic would have thought the cops were coming to kill them or imprison them.
I dunno.
There’s threads showing how insane and batshit crazy Gareth Train (property owner) was about QAnon, NWO, and China stuff.
Then his brother, one of the other shooters, was deep into conspiracies.
Missing person became very engaged in QAnon and other nutter conspiracies which lead to him disengaging with his family (hence the missing persons report).
The missing person (also a shooter) was a primary school principal a couple of years ago.
Allegedly he has a heart issue and was asked to stop working sometime in 2020, his mental health spiralled.
Then his brother, one of the other shooters, was deep into conspiracies.
The Missing person/principal became very engaged in QAnon and other nutter conspiracies which lead to him disengaging with his family (hence the missing persons report).
So they likely had some idea the cops were looking for him.
