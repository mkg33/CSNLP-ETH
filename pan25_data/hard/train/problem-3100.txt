He makes a good point though that both political parties are deeply unpopular, and if circumstances are dire - recent recession, terrorist attack, PANDEMIC - the political momentum can turn on a dime.
I’ll admit that I want Trump to win the primary because I think it’s more likely he’ll lose to Biden than DeSantis.
But while Biden had 7M more votes nationally, in our unfortunate circumstances, and specifically with our Electoral College that shouldn’t even exist anymore, it really all boils down to PA, AZ, GA, MI and WI voters (sorry if I’m forgetting any).
And some acute crisis happening in the run up to an election is more than enough to change the results.
Instead there were 4 years of dangerous mania and deception and then an attempt to destabilize your whole election.
Sure maybe he can't get his MAGA Party or w/e on the ballot in those states but it doesn't stop him from destroying DeSantis's shot at election.
Goldwater would be run out of the present GOP on a rail and called a commie groomer to boot Even Rayguns would be too liberal for these fascist traitors in 2023.
No law stops Trump from giving a national speech telling his cult either not to vote for DeSantis or write him in cause the deep state RINO's rigged the party election against him right?
