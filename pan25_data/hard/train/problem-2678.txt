Where do you think you're getting less rent now?
Because rent amount is a function of what an average PITI payment would be in that area.
Basically rent = maintenance + PITI + profit margin.
And as a mortgage lender, look into buying a duplex.
You can use the rental income frm the other unit to not only qualify but to also offset your actual mortgage/maintenance bills.
I do business in the Philly area so not high or low cost of living and I'd say 30% of my clients make what you do or less.
FL and TX are not low tax states.
Their property tax is out of control.
TX income tax is only low if you're actually really wealthy.
Insurance on your home in FL is by far the most expensive in the country.
Utility costs in TX are some of, if not the highest in the land.
You are not saving money by living in either of those states.
In fact, you're probably paying more to live in either than whatever "high tax" state you're fleeing.
That’s a significant difference, plus you’re going from having to pay state income tax to not having to pay state income taxes.
You do realize that rent is more expensive in NY and Cali compared to Texas/Florida.
Even if they are passing their property tax burdens onto you, if you are paying less rent that’s really all that matters.
The people who own those rental properties pay property taxes though, which means you'll still be paying property taxes in a roundabout way.
And if people keep moving to these places the rent won't be low for long.
