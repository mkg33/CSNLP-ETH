Lindsay asks "Did it ever work for these people?"

It never does.
I mean these people somehow delude themselves into thinking it might.
But......it might work for us.

Until the semi conductor industry is finished duplicating outside tw, China isn’t getting its hands on tsmc.

Sorry but I didn’t say they would?
I just mentioned that if China invaded, I doubt tsmc is gonna blow up their own factories.
I don’t think that’s their plan.

Types 056, 051 (old), the Sovs(old), 052 (which are old), 053 (still old) 054, 055, 075, 071, and the two carriers alone would make up most of their surface combatant tonnage, since small coastal defense vessels (assuming you mean the missile boats and stuff) don't have much going for them in displacement, and most of the old vessels are old and not numerous nowadays.
