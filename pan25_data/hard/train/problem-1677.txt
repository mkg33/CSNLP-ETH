The problem is that an invasion through these marshes is dicey even if you choose the best time, because if the offensive fails then you have an army stranded which can neither be resupplied nor retreat without enormous losses.
My bet is that Putin wants to use the threat of invasion on this front to pin down Ukrainian forces in the north.
He can gain a lot merely by maintaining a noteworthy force on the border without having to suffer major losses from an actual offensive.
No, the French were not surprised that the Germans did not attack the Maginot line, which is why the bulk of their army was positioned on the Belgian border.
Their mistake was thinking that forest terrain could not support mechanized warfare, and that no attack would come through the Ardennes forest.
They were mistaken and their armies found themselves positioned too far north.
An invasion from Belarus would create a logistical nightmare for the Russians, and if the Ukrainian army proves resilient you risk having an army exposed and in no position either to be resupplied or retreat.
Surprise attacks in the manner of the Ardennes offensive are virtually impossible to achieve in the age of drones and satellites.
The border of Belarus and Ukrainian is the Pripet Marshes.
It would be insane to attempt a major invasion through this type of terrain.
I hope that’s Putin’s backup plan.
My guess is that they have a backup plan to come in through the north via Kyiv in a second wave.
Doesn’t mean it’s going to happen but they will likely try.
