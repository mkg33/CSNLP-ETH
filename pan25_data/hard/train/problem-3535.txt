That is simply NOT true.
Back in the 60's and 70's, if you were seriously rich you could expect an audit every year, but that was before we had GOPer POTUS telling us the Government was the Problem and we shouldn't even try to tax the rich because this always resulted in harming the "little guy".
Those lies are now embedded in the minds of the lemmings who elect seditionists, thinking somehow this will make their lives better because the GOPerLords keep telling them so.
Where did you get this info?
I know GOPers have been slashing IRS budgets and staffing for years but can't find reliable sources for what this has done to the actual audits - like who gets audited.
It's because the GOP is trying to justify why they want to cut funds for the IRS, by trying to make it sound like more money for IRS = more poor people being audited.
It's the same thing they did when trying to explain the tax cuts under each Republican administration.
Well the GOP wants to cut funding to the IRS for new agents, so I’m sure the poor folk will continue to get screwed.
I say toss the 50,000+ page tax code out and replace with a percentage based on total revenue/income made.
Took a loss?
No write-offs.
Oh well, better luck next year.
It’ll never happen because the wealthy don’t want it to.
