SCOTUS has purposefully adopted a “freedom for religion” position instead of the “freedom from religion” position that has traditionally been held by government.
I believe the crux of the issue is prohibiting discrimination on basis of religion itself could be discrimination on the basis of religion.
Allowing a religious exemption to human rights, which we consider our most FUNDAMENTAL rights, means pretty much any law can be invalidated by claiming it’s against someone’s religion.
That is the problem many people have with the push for religious rights to be treated higher than all other rights.
The only reason this is an issue is that it treads on Christian sensibilities and revs up their tendency to persecution.
While I definitely agree with you, I would like to point out that your arguement is the exact same one religious groups would make in response to some of the other statements in this thread.
They would argue that sexuality is a choice (it isn't) and therefore they can refuse service to people that "choose" to associate with certain groups.
