Ukraine is getting just enough to slowly push back against the Russians while we in the west can deliver weapons that would win the war in a month today.
It's sickening but that's politics, trying to boil Russia like the proverbial frog.
Depleting Russia might be part of the reason but a bigger one probably are internal politics of various NATO countries.
Militarized Ukraine is no threat to EU, where did you get that idea?
After the war or after they kick the Russians out they will need substantial forces and high-tech weapons to prevent any further conflicts and loss of life.
There is a need for both arming Ukraine AND preparing for escalation on home soil.
If the initiative is pressed too hard the escalation would likely come sooner than they can prepare for.
The baggage of corruption is on hold as membership is currently in a candidate state.
It's not moving until after the war, and will come with a mountain of oversight.
The EU would love a highly militarized and friendly neighbor who will protect them against an aggressive other neighbor.
Any country that is more militarized than their neighbours is a potential to threat to those neighbours unless there is a balance.
Nothing against Ukraine per se.
Maybe the EU wants to keep up arming their own militaries while supplying Ukraine with a matching volume of weapons, as balance and deterrent.
Right, but with NATO involved in Ukraines defense as a de factor member, what Ukraine has in military material matters not as much.
Theres one thing that Ukraine has that almost no UN state possess, and that's battle hardened/ tested soldiers a very valuable asset that might be a scary prospect to some and explain why they get and don't get different types of support.
