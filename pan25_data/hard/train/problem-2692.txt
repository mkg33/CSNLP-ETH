Usually you tell people to vote with their wallets, but if you do that here you run the risk of death.
This is literally extortion.
The taxpayers funded this, why are we being forced to pay more?
Yes, taxpayers did fund it.
In fact, pretty much every medicine you've ever heard of has been largely, if not fully, funded through grants paid out by various governments.
Better idea: anything developed with public funding can have no more than a 2% profit margin.
If it's entirely privately funded, go ahead, jack the price up 10,000%, be a dickbag.
Even 1% of it was funded through public funding, screw off.
Without violating any laws, the only other thing I can think of doing is completely changing the old guard of the political sphere with new people ideologically opposed to this kind of bullshit, and that's a lenhy process going against a well funded, very entrenched group of people, who have cultivated a reliance on doddering idiots who can't view politics as anything more than team sports, and no, I'm not attributing that statement to a single political party.
Why do you think they do public funding in the first place?
It's because they don't want to risk their own money on something that may not work.
They're greedy as hell, so risking 0% of their wealth is a massive incentive, even if the amount of profit they're allowed to make off of something is capped.
