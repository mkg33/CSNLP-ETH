Maybe you still have a chance to win, just by continuing to live and knowing that Russia could find another path.
I believe I speak on behalf of everyone in the West when I say, "We are all done with you and yiur vision of the Russia you wish existed.
We hope your cancer takes you painfully, yet fast.
Fucking die already.
".
It is.
It was used by Czarist Russia, the USSR, and the Russian Federation multiple times across history.
Of course not.
They can be as backwards and barbaric as they want, so long as they leave the rest of the world alone.
That's really all it takes.
But until humbled, they cling to this bizarre delusion of grandeur that they can just conquer Eastern Europe without consequence.
It's lunacy.
I wouldn't expect anything less.
They're Russian; hating The West and blaming it for everything from their internal corruption to their murder sprees in Ukraine is the national pastime.
Being done with them does not simply imply destruction.
The vast majority of people want nothing to do with Russian antics, and would be over the moon to never have to deal with them again.
Putin isn't the source of the "move Russians into a region, have them claim abuse, Russian military invades to support them" bit; it's just a Russian cultural staple no matter their government style.
Setting it up so that any Russian who doesn't love Daddy Vlad and isn't stoked about how things are going at all times must be a western elite and needs to be reported.
