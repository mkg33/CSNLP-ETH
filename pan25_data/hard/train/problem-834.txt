We don't know the US's training capacity on these vehicles.
We also don't know what supply lines are like in Ukraine right now.
For all we know, there could be some magic number of vehicles Ukraine is able to support, and sending more would leave some underutilized and vulnerable, until Ukraine is better able to support the vehicle.
A vehicle our military will never use again, but that is far better than the civilian vehicles Ukraine is still using for mobility.
If we were actually in this war, we'd have cleared the skies first, and have C-5s delivering massive amounts of materiel to Ukrainian airports and then C-130s and smaller aircraft (which themselves would have been disassembled and delivered by C-5s, you put the smaller, slower aircraft for this inside the first wave of larger cargo aircraft, that is not something I'm making up here's a photo:
The US military has thousands of aircraft that can be used for cargo, hundreds of aircraft that can refuel those aircraft, thousands of fighter aircraft to defend those cargo aircraft, hundreds of radar aircraft that can detect threats to those aircraft, and thousands of reconnaissance aircraft and drones to detect threats the radar aircraft can't see.
I wrote it up once before, but taking into account the various non Air Force refuelers (and not counting tanker equipped hornets) the US operates about 650 air refuelers, there are about 850 in the world TOTAL.
that's right the rest of the world combined has about 200 of them.
