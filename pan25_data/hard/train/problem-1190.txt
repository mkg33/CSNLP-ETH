Absolutely agree.
Here's the problem though.
Putin already declared the four oblasts as Russia.
Obviously this is embarrassing and silly.
However it also presents a real problem if Putin wants to literally survive the war.
Any retreat from these oblasts will be seen as failure, and so Putin has no option but to continue to fight.
I don't see any way Putin can win this war now.
The Russian economy and people won't be able to stand this for years to come, and Putin can't leave without being killed himself.
and Russia doesn't have forever, its debatable that the country itself will even survive the decade.
their "three day special military operation" has rocked the country to the core to the point that their regime has panicked so hard at the sight of their "invincible" army being routed on the battlefield, that they declared mass mobilization and are in full survival of the state mode now.
Russia is desperate for this to stop, and they are clueless to the fact that Ukraine will never stop until they leave, or until every little green man is dead.
There's no turning back after things like Bucha, Mariupol, and the Annexation of multiple cities and provinces.
Russia signed up for a forever war when they did those things.
The more Russia makes statements like this, The more clear it is that they are tired of fighting, they want the bleeding to stop, but they seem to have forgotten that after they published articles in the media stating their intentions to commit mass genocide against the Ukrainian people, and after betraying every agreement they ever had in regards to not attacking them.
Ukraine will absolutely never negotiate now.
