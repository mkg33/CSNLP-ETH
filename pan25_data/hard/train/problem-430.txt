As I’ve stated before.
The best scenario involves someone other than Trump gaining the GOP bid and Trump’s legendary ego causes him to make an independent run.
Then the MAGA vote goes that way just enough to split the vote and hand both Trump and the GOP nominee some big fat Ls.
And so the GOP is poised to repeat the mistakes of 2016: have a super crowded field of candidates, that split 70% of the primary votes while Trump grabs the hardline 30% who will always vote for him, no matter what.
I think it's very much up in the air at this point, and Trump's influence as a third party candidate seems to be way over-estimated, especially after the 2022 midterm results.
For Trump to seriously make an effort as a third party candidate would require him to spend hundreds of millions of his own money (not likely), on top of the fact that he's no Ross Perot, who genuinely seemed to have our country's interest at heart, and put his money where his mouth was.
All this talk about Trump running as a third party is just bluster.
That will not be true in 2024, especially with hundreds of thousands of avoidable covid deaths to his credit, an insurrection, and so on.
