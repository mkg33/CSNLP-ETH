Wait, so let me get this straight.
The PKK hit a Turkish military post on the border (no casualties), so Turkey responded by bombing a residential area?
Let’s be clear: PKK attacked a security checkpoint, and your country is bombing civilians in response.
Just because you had an earthquake doesn’t mean Turkey is unaccountable for its actions.
And when your own government is declining aid from other countries, I don’t wanna hear that the problem is so serious you’re immune to any criticism for bombing civilians.
OP didn’t “turkey bash”, unless bashing to you means reporting factual events that happened.
Also, to be clear, the area turkey shelled was affected by the earthquake too.
All of our hearts grieve for the people whose lives have been lost in these horrific earthquakes, but we’ve also watched as the same thing happened in Ukraine and Turkey used the crisis for political posturing.
So no, you’re not getting off the hook for dropping on civilians, sorry.
And don’t ask us to stop talking about it because of the deaths in turkey when you all could give a fuck less when it happens to a country on the other side of the Black Sea.
Secondly, do you know how many Ukrainians have been killed by Russian rockets and soldiers?
Turkey’s response has been to increase trade with Russia and extort countries trying to join NATO for political gain.
Turkey has no problem watching other people get bombed and in fact tries to use that as leverage to bully Sweden and Finland - the contempt held for turkey in the west is a grave it has dug itself.
