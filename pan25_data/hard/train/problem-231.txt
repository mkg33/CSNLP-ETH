These aren’t actually pistols.
They’re shorter barreled ARs that are legally pistols because they don’t have a stock.
Then the “brace” is a stock that ostensibly contains some parts to brace it against a forearm rather than a shoulder.
You’re missing something here.
These are commonly 5.56 AR “pistols.” This isn’t actually about handgun ammo, these are weapons using rifle rounds, with the same receivers as rifles.
They’re saying people are intentionally buying AR pistols and braces to have a weapon identical to an AR rifle with a shorter barrel.
It’s not easier to conceal than the base pistol, it’s easier to conceal than the rifle.
And we’ll agree that a pistol braced AR is like a small crappy rifle, and we shoot them like rifles, not like pistols.
If the rule is designed to stop guys in the 20s from walking into banks with sawed off BARs with shortened stocks, then i think it’s pretty clear that pistol braced ARs are covered.
Do i think the NFA is stupid for trying to protect us from this?
Yes.
I don’t agree with reclassifying braces as rifles, and i think the NFA is stupid, BUT let’s at least be clear about what they are saying: The guns they are referring to are not glocks, they are AR style guns with e.g.
6” barrels that can be used more like a rifle with the aid of an arm brace.
It is literally the power (reduced somewhat due to barrel lenh) of a rifle cartridge but much easier to conceal than a full sized 16” barreled non-NFA AR.
Pistol format ARs without arm braces are just not as useable.
My guy, nobody I know with a "pistol brace" on their AR uses the damn thing as a pistol brace.
Its just a rifle stock with velcro attatched.
Its less accurate than a standard AR with less power.
Its just shorter and usually only by 4 to 6 inches of barrel lenh.
I would also like to point out that an AR pistol fits in my backpack only a little nicer than a standard AR with a folding stock.
I've done both.
