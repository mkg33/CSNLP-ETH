Just reading about the Bradley Fighting Vehicle... Russia has gotten itself into a complete morass.
Just everything they bring to the field the rest of the world provides equal and opposite strenh plus a bit more, bleeding them out.
It's a fair argument that the restricted flow of equipment to Ukraine in one sense prolongs the fight but it casts the whole war as a situation that can cease anytime Russia wants it to by GTFO, which hopefully will mean a lasting peace.
Sounds good on a first read, but like others have mentioned would a ceasefire only benefit Russia and "a vision of a fair solution" sounds awfully like Ukraine should cease territory to pacify Russia.
There is nothing serious in Russia's offer for "ceasefire" other than to have an operational pause.
It is good that nobody takes this serious and rejects it right away, as it supposed to be.
On 27 December 2022, Oleksiyy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, reported that Russia had relocated long range aviation (LRA) Tu-95MS BEAR heavy bombers and Tu-22M3 BACKFIRE medium bombers to Russia’s far east.
