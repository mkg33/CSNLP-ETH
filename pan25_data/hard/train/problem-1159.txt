I'm not sure Russia knows Russia's endgame anymore.
Their original plan failed and they're now stuck in a much different war than they had anticipated.
Their goal now may simply be to save face by not losing, weakening and destabilizing Ukraine, demonstrating Russia's ability to project military power on it's neighbors, and having some Ukrainian territory to show for it all in the end.
At this point they have realized they're likely not taking it, ever, and their best hope of keeping any of the land (and keeping Putin from falling out of a window) is to pressure Ukraine to accept some unfavorable peace deal in exchange for an end of the destruction.
It's really hard to be selfish and complain about energy prices when you see Ukraine standing up to Russia despite the terror, and I don't see support for Ukraine in the West (at least within Europe) wavering either.
I think the assumption is if Ukraine starts striking back at Russian energy infrastructure it might convince Russians we should stop doing that.
That is coming anyway, but sabotage could help speed up the process and make the Kremlin understand that bombing Ukraine’s infrastructure comes at a price to their own infrastructure.
Would it though?
My understanding is that the social contract the Kremlin has with the populace is that they will tolerate autocracy as long as the government keeps providing economic growth and better standards of living.
Whacking their infrastructure would cost the Kremlin dearly, both in terms of the cost of repairs and the budget they will have for social spending, thereby breaking that contract.
How about good old-fashioned sabotage?
We haven’t seen much of that yet.
I am sure if Moscow’s suburbs started having regular electricity and gas outages that would breed some discontent within Russia and make more people think about whether war with Ukraine is worthwhile.
