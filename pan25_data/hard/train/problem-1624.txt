The bill mandates states to recognize marriages from other states as well as codifies federal protections and benefits for couples as long as the marriage certificate is valid in the state it was issued.
If Obergefell v. Hodges were to be overturned, theoretically a state can ban gay marriage but it would still have to recognize a gay marriage as valid if performed in a state recognizing said marriage.
Basically, the law allows states to discriminate within their own borders and refuse to issue marriage certificates, but MUST accept marriages performed outside their borders within the US as valid.
That's why this law does so much less than the Obergefell decision - it doesn't force any state to marry anyone, it only forces them to recognize marriages which were legal when and where they occurred.
And more importantly: if Obergefell is overturned and you’re already married, you won’t become instantly unmarried in those states that have laws on the books.
If the Full Faith and Credit clause was overturned, states wouldn’t be required to recognize or believe any documentation from another state.
