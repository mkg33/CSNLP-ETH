If the GOP lost half of the open fascists and white supremacists in their party, it would be enough to cripple them on the national level for a decade.
Please let both of them be very popular within the GOP so that when Trump doesn't win, he steals 15-20% of the red vote when he goes independent, instead of 3-4%.
And because Trump was still somewhat on the ballot via election denial, abortion via his shitty supreme court judges, and Jan. 6th traitors he snatched defeat from the jaws of victory for Republicans.
And then Trump demonstrates his mastery of the bigoted hordes that vote “conservative“, and every god damned one of them falls back into line.
yeah you can see in r/conservative and on conservative news sites there is this sudden realization that Trump is absolute poison for the GOP.
his election was more about Hillary and the DNC's failures than his electability.
but it will take a LOT more than finger wagging and some "hey Trump, scram!"
(I shit you not was the final line in a conservative piece from today) to clean the rot that's in the GOP.
I mean there was a lot of rot there already, but the Trump faithful will not go quietly into the night--and neither will Trump.
it's going to be a bloodbath between now and the 2024 primaries.
I am pretty certain DeSantis will cruise to the nomination, but Trump is gonna make a mess for them before, during, and after, and I can't wait.
