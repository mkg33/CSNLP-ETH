Basically the problem is that there are many millions of classified documents.
Most people cannot remove them from secure areas, but the president and VP may get them constantly in the White House/Naval Observatory, and those are homes as well as being secure containers.
A president may ask to see something in an Office or in a living room (which they are empowered to do) and then make it harder to track.
I don’t hold it against him for cooperating and don’t thinks it rises to something chargeable.
Pence and Biden are handling this appropriately by cooperating and letting their stuff be searched.
Pence also made a huge show of saying he’s not like Biden, the FBI isn’t searching his premises, he has nothing left, etc.
I don't know if he gets a ,pass, but if he's cooperating and there's no intent to deceive, I think his situation is far closer to Biden's than it is to Trump's.
The salient points are he took them on purpose and with intent to conceal--at the very least-- and that's why what Trump did is different from Pence or Biden.
