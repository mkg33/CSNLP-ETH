For a start you have no right to insult someone calling them fat.
I never insult anyone I have respect for everyone.
I don’t want to engage in conversation with someone doesn’t respect another person.
I was brought obviously very different to you to have good manners and respect.
Bye.
I am not American I am as fit as a fiddle and worked my life in construction.
I want all countries to bring back manufacturing to their individual countries.
Supply chains are broken and basically China now is holding world to ransom.
This is ruining the supply chains and having serious knock on effects.
This is what happens when you end up relying on one country manufacturing the world’s goods.
Like Europe relying on Russia for its energy.
It’s not cheap also like it was in the first place to manufacture in China wages for the Chinese people have been rising very fast.
I don’t begrudge the people of China a better standard of living.
But it’s time people manufactured in their own countries.
Getting other countries up to scale to supply global manufacturing demands will take way more time than we have.
