Good maneuverability at slow and close-in fights, but most likely outranged by modern Western radars and definitely outranged in beyond-visual-range missiles.
For air-to-ground they still primarily use unguided bombs and rockets.
Russia isnâ€™t able to keep up production pace on guided bombs to actually employ them much in conflict.
So at the end of the day, what Russia can offer is the kind of military equipment that Iranian industry can't produce.
That's mostly going to be aircraft.
Russia has been very sparing of its use of aircraft in the war, likely because their serviceability rates are pretty bad and they're unlikely to be able to replace losses.
At the same time, because of that, they can afford to send Iran some airframes.
(Well... "afford" in the sense that there's not an immediate prospect of them being deployed to the battlefield; they ain't winning the war so it's way too early to say that this is actually a good strategy!
).
They're receiving munitions (drones/guided missiles - the distinction is kind of blurred when you have a drone that's the munition itself) from Iran.
They need to be able to give Iran something in return.
Iran doesn't care to receive Russian oil because they're themselves an oil-producing nation and under sanctions that prevent them from passing it along to the world market.
Russian currency is also of little use to Iran.
