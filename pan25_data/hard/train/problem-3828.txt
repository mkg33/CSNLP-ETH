Well, in Canada our life expectancy is higher, we have a much lower infant mortality rate, and nobody has to fear going bankrupt over medical bills, but our system isn’t perfect.
Unless your condition is life-threatening, you’re probably going to be waiting awhile for treatment.
I remember around 2008 or so, the GOP were trying to claim that Canada had ”death panels”, where a small group of people decide if a person would live or die.
This has never been true, it’s a horrific, inhuman idea, and the GOP are loathsome scumbags for trying to scare people into voting against their own best interest like that.
It's not just to make a profit: it's also to create a permanent underclass with minimal critical thinking skills who are vulnerable to propaganda, and such who will always vote for their policies.
That’s because one side is brainwashed into thinking their politicians are helping them fight against communism and the other side is brain washed into thinking their politicians are helping defend against corporations.
It’s a truly amazing two step divide and conquer approach that has worked since Regan.
One side is convinced they have to do everything to stop the socialism and other “non American” shit.
The other side recognizes that the other side is being manipulated but think their politicians aren’t doing it to them on behalf of corporations.
So half the people are fighting the wrong side and the other half are fighting the wrong target, no one is fighting the corporations.
