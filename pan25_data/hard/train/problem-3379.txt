Trump is referring to 2018 when in his mind he "sent the FBI to stop Florida from counting fraudulent ballots" which is weird because I swear I remember that election being decided in like the first hour or so because for all its faults, and they have so many that to list them would take me typing a multi page report single spaced, they have managed to streamline vote counting to be very very quick and efficient.
Then you have the FBI confirming that the election systems in Florida were "breached" by the Russian's in 2018, when Rick Scott and DeSantis barely won, and now Trump saying he was the one that did this?
And now Florida is bright red, and Miami-Dade is red?
Come on, something is seriously wrong here, and no one is questioning it!
EDIT: I'm not saying that DeSantis or DeWine wouldn't have won if it weren't "rigged".
They were both really popular.
I'm saying that the numbers don't add up compared to the rest of the country, and how there was no "red wave", yet in those states (Florida especially) it was like a Tsunami.
As an example: There was no Red Wave this year, yet Florida and Ohio ran way outside the rest of the country.
You're telling me that Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Toledo all did a 10+ point swing to R's this election?
Gen Z in Ohio University/Athens county did a 10+ swing to R's this election?
There's no way.
You're telling me that young voters in Ohio, and voters in the big cities in Ohio are completely different than the rest of the country?
No.
nah.
I doubt it.
there are enough republican loyalists in FBI for them to pull it off.
just like the the FBI's statement about Hillary days before election.
