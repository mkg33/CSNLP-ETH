Which is not to excuse the way they were treated by Europeans at all, but it seems a little arbitrary to just declare that the land belongs to the most recent invaders.
Assuming their claim to the land to be "legitimate" are there any other countries that ought to be returned to their previous owners?
You'd be hard pressed to find an example of a modern day country which didn't at some point in it's history get conquered by its current inhabitants.
Are we going to return Turkey to the Byzantines?
We can make it Constantinople not Istanbul.
The most recent non Israeli claims to the land there are Syria, Turkey, and Egypt, who lost the territory the same way they claimed it- by driving out the previous governance.
It's not like there's an independent state of Palestine who governs the area within Israel's borders, it's Israel's land to settle on if they want to.
Nah these people will unsurprisingly be only for Israel's land being returned, they might agree with other lands afterwards but that's only so they don't look like what they are.
