There is no way to teach AA history without teaching the history of racism in the US.
When you’re trying to convince students there is no inch thing racism, that becomes a problem.
Schools: “Black people were made slaves to white people in the south.
They were taken advantage of, beaten, murdered, and raped for generations.
Freedom for slaves is what the civil war was about.
There are movements in America to discredit black folks, white wash slavery, and downplay the many lingering issues that slavery and racism have in the United States of America.”.
What is it about learning about the abolitionist movement, or about the Civil Rights movement, or about the history of the US Government's deliberate and methodical effort to economically disadvantage African Americans for more than a hundred years after Emancipation that is a "political agenda"?
If learning history of the three century long struggle for equal rights fought by Americans is a "political agenda," wouldn't learning anything about any aspect of US history be political?
They are trying to portray learning and teaching this history as an inherently political act.
And if it were, isn't all history political?
