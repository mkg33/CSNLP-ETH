Strictly teaching individual facts that can be directly observed and repeated is not science.
The entire point of science is to construct broad theories and models of how the world around us actually works, to make testable predictions that can continually challenge and expand upon those theories and models, and to leverage the resulting knowledge for useful applications.
That has always been the goal of the scientific method.
Observation and repeatable experimentation are only a small part of that endeavor.
And even with all that being said, we can directly observe evolution in a repeatable and predictable way.
We can literally recreate evolution in the lab.
We can control evolutionary processes for our own purposes, and do so routinely.
So banning evolution from the class would actually contradict the premise of only teaching facts that are directly observable and repeatable.
But I wouldn’t expect the architects of this bill to care about all that, because that would imply they actually care about logical consistency.
To be fair, many public school systems fail to properly teach that a scientific law is not actually the natural gradation of a scientific theory.
Mine is guilty of the same.
That’s a universal issue in primary science education that needs to be resolved.
I think what creationists have a much harder time wrapping their heads around is the fact that current shortcomings in evolutionary theory (ie paleontologists failing to find a transitionary form in the fossil record for a particular group of related species) doesn’t necessarily lend support for creationism.
They really don’t understand that challenging one theory doesn’t automatically support another (and to this I cringe at implying that creationism is actually a theory when it is the furthest thing from it).
>There was one proponent to the bill at the hearing, who likened the teaching of established scientific theories such as evolution to children as fraud that goes against the bible.
