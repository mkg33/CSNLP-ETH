Health issues are why the for-work shepherds and the show shepherds are vastly different.
I personally prefer the work breed as they live longer and healthier lives.
They're basically two different breeds at this point.
There are now tests that reputable breeders can do to ensure that mating pairs will not pass on genetic issues to children.
It's why nowadays there are basically two different kinds of German Shepherd dogs: work breed (90 lbs of pure muscle) versus show breed (sloped back and early deaths).

In 1915, "Dogs of All Nations" described the German shepherd as a "medium sized dog" weighing just 55 pounds, with a "deep chest, straight back and strong loins.
".
P.S.S.
Work breeds versus show breeds are one of the things that made me want to go for a degree in genetics.
The difference between show breeds and work breeds is that of the breeder.
A show breeder will often select based on looks alone, regardless of health impact.
Note that this is one of the reasons that I despise most dog shows.
