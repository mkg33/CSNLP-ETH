They'd lose all of their western aid.
They're being given it on the condition they don't use it in Russia.
That would be a nasty escalation for the other Nato countries.
Then they're not defending the Ukraine, they'd be actively attacking Russia.
I heard that russian missiles flying to Kiyv... Wouldn't it be fair that Ukrainians missiles would fly to Moscow?
FFS nuclear weapons is so Fucken cheating... Like literally Rashist can do what ever they want to Ukraine... For example try to destroy electricity, heating and etc...
Meanwhile if Ukraine would try to do something like that to Russia, Ukraine probably would be nuked...
This is bullshit... World should really do something about this issue... Or there should be some sort agreement that each non nuclear county must be protected with nukes by country having them (so more NATO type alliances, I guess), or then nukes for every country (which would be terrible)... And 3rd option is probably de nuke the world, what is not possible, because there is at least few countries which have nukes and won't give them by any cost...
