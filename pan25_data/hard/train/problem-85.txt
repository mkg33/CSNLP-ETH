lol, calm down bro.
I was just pointing out that there is such a thing as “zero-COVID” as that refers to the name of the policy.
As a side-note: China’s own flagship vaccine (Sinovac) was developed and released at a comparable speed to Western vaccines.
I think you’re misunderstanding what is being referred to by the term.
“Zero-COVID” is what China’s policy for handling the spread of COVID has been dubbed.
It is a thing that exists.
Whether or not it is _effective_ in achieving its aspirational aims is another story.
But by insisting there is “no such thing”, you reveal your misunderstanding of what is being discussed.
I can see you’re ducking and diving the “zero-COVID” thing, but I’ll assume you’ve realised you were in error.
Also, in a more recent study, Sinovac has been shown to be no less effective than mRNA vaccines, at preventing serious illness and death (Source: ).
Although 50% effectiveness is far below the greater than 90% real-world protection of COVID-19 vaccines made with messenger RNA (mRNA), it may still be good enough to curb the disease's spread.
The whole COVID thing was considered a pandemic, it is now endemic, same as the more common flu viruses or respiratory cold.
A lot of symptoms described as long COVID can also happen with the flu and other respiratory viruses.
They may not be as common, but it's not accurate to say "after effects we don't see with the flu" etc.
