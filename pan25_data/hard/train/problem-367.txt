This does not justify Russia invading another country and tossing bombs into cities, but it explains why Brazil's whole diplomatic apparatus (and not just Lula) are not super gung-ho about opposing Russia.
Russia is far away and too weak to interfere in South America, they're not "our problem".
The best way to get Brazil to cut ties with Russia is to provide Brazil with better business than Russia can.
Otherwise, who cares about a war in Europe?
Putting sanctions on Russia isn't going to put food on the table for Brazilian workers, who are Lula's voters.
Also Brazil is insanely reliant upon Russia in trade but Lula would still believe this even if they weren't.
Lula probably believes that Russia's success, at the expense of the EU-USA, is an overall benefit for the Third World of which Brazil is a part of.
He's distrustful of the USA, and historically the French also like to poke Brazil over the Amazon and cause tensions over Brazilian sovereignty over the rainforest.
Additionally, as a Leftist, Lula still sees the USA and Western Europe as the supporters of the Rightist Juntas which ruled much of Latin America during the Cold War.
If the West (that the people in r/Brasil have recently decided they do not belong to, apparently - the tankie brigading there does not stop) did not collectively back Lula on a few weeks ago, you would have had a fucking coup in Bras√≠lia.
The fact Lula apparently cannot do 1+1 is unfortunately a sign that the threat to Brazilian democracy did not subside and might in fact be much worse than antecipated.
The disease that created Bolsonarismo is not exclusive to the far right.
