The GOP don't want things to pass or the government to work thiugh, snd with a Democratic white house, they'd love to break the government further from the House and blame it on Biden.
The thing is with such a narrow majority and so many new reps from Biden or barely Trump districts doing shit like Debt ceiling shinnanigans gets a lot harder.
In short, Dems won't get good legislation passed, but they'll get the bare minimum legislation to keep the country running passed without as many GOP political spectacles.
I can tell you NONE of those new reps want to vote on Impeachment if they vote No they probably lose in the Primary if they vote Yes they probably lose in the General.
In an ideal scenario, Biggs and Gaetz and the other whackjobs refuse to vote for McCarthy in the whole House vote and he fails to achieve a majority.
The Dems work with Bacon and Valadao and Newhouse other "moderates" to elect a "moderate" GOP leader.
This isn't very likely, but it's fodder for the pundits.
That's unlikely to happen.

The GOP Speaker won't allow legislation to be voted on without a majority of the GOP supporting it.
It's Dems holding the Senate that stops the GOP from banning abortion nationwide.
It doesn't matter if the House is 51% R or 55% R; either way the Senate can vote against legislation passed by the R House.
