Sure, long term we aren't powerless, and from an anthropological standpoint we aren't helpless at the national or civilizations-level, but the reality is that this is a real woman, not just an idea or concept, and she will almost certainly be raped, tortured, and executed at some point in the near future for even daring to have an opinion.
Nothing we say or comment on will change the fact that a woman with this much bravery and fire is getting culled from the Taliban regime at some point -- certainly at this phase in its existence and stability -- and that fucking sucks.
The Talibans move to ban girls from university is as dumb as they can get and these men wanna rule their country for the better, wow such stupid people at the helm of the Talibans how will they respond to that smart and courageous girl.
Will they attract more international shame towards themselves if they kill her and what kind of international image will this project to the world when everyone is moving to universal education for everyone and they are banning one half the population from attending university and contributing to the economic well being of their country, bad politics mixed with their fucked up religion and they consider themselves educated and sage leaders.
Religion should be banned from the face of the earth and made constitutionally allowed for individual following but allowing a bunch of state sponsored religious zealots to rule their country, who the fuck do these people think they are, they are not God or God’s representatives on earth, God created everyone equal that’s why we are all here together, he didn’t separate genders into classes.
Even if someone wrote that kind of shit into the bible it doesn’t mean that is sketched in stone, the world evolves and times change women must be allowed to attend university who are these men that impose such political annihilation on a gender.
Totally unacceptable in today’s society.
