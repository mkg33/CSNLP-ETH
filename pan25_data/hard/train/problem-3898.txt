The problem is that many trans people aren't straight.
IE, there are some people who were born "male" and are attracted to women but transition into lesbians and some people who were born "female" and are attracted to men and transition into gay guys.
(And obviously trans people can belong to any of the rest of the spectrum of bi, pan, ace etc).
Part of why trans people joined the greater LGBTQ community is because there's such a big overlap of trans people who are also L/G/B/Q.
In some states, trans people would be recognized for their gender identity and were only allowed to marry accordingly.
So a trans woman was viewed as a woman and was only allowed to marry a man.
It also led to interesting laws trying to prevent gay marriage in some US states before the Obergefell decision.
Some states didn’t want to recognize trans people’s gender status, so if your sex was male and you were a trans woman, the law allowed you to marry a woman but not a man.
It's important to decouple the Western idea of trans rights being the step after gay rights.
Other nations and cultures have different ideas around gender.
Trans rights in South Asia starts more from this angle of hijras, rather than from an expansion of the queer identity.
