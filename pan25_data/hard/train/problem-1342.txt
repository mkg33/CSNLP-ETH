My point is that regime change in Russia is not a desirable goal.
The idea that whatever regime replaces Putin will be sunshine and roses is a fantasy.
You’d have better odds of winning the lottery.
It’s far more likely that the person that replaces him sucks (see William Burns’ quote about Russian opposition to the 2008 Bucharest summit) or even worse, the country (which has the worlds largest nuclear arsenal) spirals out of control like Iraq and Libya.
Or that the glue holding together an inherently unstable country let’s go.
The idea that russia descending into chaos wouldn’t be orders of magnitude worse than Iraq spiralling out of control is delusional.
Imagine what would have happened if the Soviets killed JFK in 63.
Or even if enough people just thought it.
Think what US resolve against the Soviet threat would look like.
The idea that killing Putin would subdue the Russian people is crazy.
This far-right facist shit is the political cancer that will politically kill Russia very fast as well.
Just look at other Russian transitions of power to see how nasty it can get.
Whoever takes over may need to do a Stalin-esque purge to consolidate power and that may not work out.
