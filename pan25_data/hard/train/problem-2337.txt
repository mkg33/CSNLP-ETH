That's what the bill is about though - cutting government funding for colleges in Florida that offer those programs.
However, a degree in those topics is a bullshit degree.
You can't do anything with a gender studies or CRT degree that you couldn't do with a sociology degree.
Those topics are way too specific and don't have much use on their own.
They don't want universities they are subsidizing to include those topics in the core curriculum.
They also don't want the universities they are subsidizing to provide degree programs that are misleading or socially controversial in their natures or dubious in their usage.
I'd imagine a lot of prospective students don't want to essentially go to a state school whose curriculum is being forced to resemble Liberty/Bob Jones University.
Won't this fuckery make diplomas from those schools depreciate?
It’s gonna kill those schools’ credibility, and no one is gonna go there to get degrees anymore because it’ll be worthless.
Brain drain aside, this is money he’s throwing out.
