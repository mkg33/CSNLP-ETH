I think your comment and the following comments kind of put the cart before the horse.
Like, I want to be clear, the influence there and its bad.
I believe they seek out the influence because of their already sympathetic ideology and are further corrupted by it, instead of the influence causing the corrupted ideology.
But, here's the thing, your narrative comes from the idea that Russians are buying off politicians essentially, and that's the only part of the structure that I think isn't nefarious.
I think it's simple, conservative minded people tend to foster peole who like strong centralized power structures, and enjoy imbalanced psudo surfdom.
With that in mind sympathetic, power hungry, wealthy people curry favor with their idols.
They look at what oligarchs have over there with envy.
It's ironic that the "my freedoms" people support that, because they would have jack squat in Russia.
It's not that they were in Russia's pocket - it's that Russia's interests happened to align with theirs and they are opportunists.
I think the GOP are all blackmailed by Russia, while the Tories were just taking "donations" while their interests aligned.
