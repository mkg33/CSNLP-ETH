Don't know what you mean by many...if you mean majority then I strongly disagree.
I read some cases where russians from ethinic minorities where forced, or economically forced to join the army to feed their family.
But even then, the only respectable choice would be to sabotage, slack, or desertion.
If you fire at an innocent to save your family ,yoy are still a murderer.
They don't have commanders, they are left alone in forests without guidance, they can leave at any time or surrender.
There are great people among the russians who risk their liberty by protesting, are choosing the sane option to flee, to hide, etc.
But waging war on a country is a choice and should, and hope it will have, dire consequnces for ALL involved.
The average citizen is not jailed..Lied yeah, but they like and accept those lies, because it makes them feel good, sonetimes even knowing they lies.
The average citizen either support the regime or does not care.
Sure is Putin's fault and he should be judged, but he would be able to do nothing without support.
Ok, Putin is MANY terrible things all at once.
The man's a delusional, murderous, psychotic, tyrannical, autocratic thug.
But very few people would call him a moron.
He is not a person to be underestimated.
