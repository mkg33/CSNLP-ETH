The truth doesn't matter anymore for russians.
If TV says they're winning, they believe it.
If TV suddenly said Ukraine is bombing Moscow, they'd believe it.
If they said US jets are sinking their fleet, they'd believe it.
The rabble truly believes they're in some kind of existential self defence war and that Ukraine was 'just about to invade Russia' when they stopped it on Feb 24th.
Russia is a genuine threat to Ukraine, who with better western weapons could win this war faster at a lower cost to Ukrainian lives.
Even after the last twenty plus year’s of wars of American involvement in multiple wars…invasions…secret shit i doubt we will get close to Russian losses.
There will be no reasonably likely circumstance whereby the US will suffer grinding gradual attrition in a Russian conflict as seen in the wars mentioned.
Indeed, if we limit ourselves to conventional war only, the Iraq wars are a much better example.
Unlike the proven incompetence of Russia, the US would secure complete air superiority in short order.
There simply isn't any scenario whereby there is an opportunity for Russia to kill tens of thousands of US soldiers to demotivate the US citizenry so they'll leave the poor, poor beleaguered Russians alone as they rightly de-Nazify and bring freedom to their neighbors.
TL;DR: He's just preaching to a Russian audience capitalizing on fear.
So he doesn't need to understand the US so much as his audience.
Problem Two: Beyond the failure to understand the reasons for reactions from the US relative to thousands of deaths of soldiers, this is a matter or grave inability for self-reflection.
There are a strong parallels here that this imbecile is missing.
This shows that he doesn't understand even how to apply the lessons he's cherry picked.
