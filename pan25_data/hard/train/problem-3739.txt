Problem is every time the virus infected another person, there is a possibility the virus mutate to another variant which can goes either way whether becoming more dangerous or milder.

Should the US be involved in fighting terrorism abroad?
Obviously yes.
Should the US use drones for that?
Well, yes, why not?
Will there be instances of bad missions?
Obviously yes, have to break eggs to make omelette.
You can then quibble about the details, the quantity and quality, and the whole.
But just saying that Obama did drone strikes should not qualify as a "real controversy".
Sure, then argue that or similar as a scandal, instead of just vague "drone strikes".

Don't take my comment to mean that I think Trump and Obama are equals in terms of bad actions.
If your read any of my comment history you will see that I have no love for Trump.
However, if you are going to make comparisons between bad actions for two parties choose examples that fit.
Obama has plenty more to be criticised for, but overall he was a good President.
Trump should have been in jail for life 30 years ago for financial crimes.
