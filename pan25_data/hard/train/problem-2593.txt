This means a lot more paperwork to sell the product in US friendly countries, and even more problems in non-, friendly regimes, which I imagine would have a population that would benefit the most from open internet access.
If the US were to determine Starlink is now subject to EAR or ITAR, Starlink would need to shut down all international connectivity until it can get licenses for each export in each country, which could take years.
ITAR is not military secrets.
That would classified information.
ITAR controls anything that can be weaponized.
When a system begins being used as a weapons system it becomes regulated under ITAR.
When spaceX was being used for communications its a-ok as soon as it becomes a guidance system you are breaking the law.
If the US enforced this it would make spaceX shutdown worldwide as it would not be viable for export.
SpaceX is upholding US law if the US lowers itself to ignoring law for war than they are not different.
If you wish to remain the moral ones order must be maintained.
