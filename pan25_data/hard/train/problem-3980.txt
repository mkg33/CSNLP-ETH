Reagan would’ve been fine in the modern Republican Party.
He would’ve just adjusted just political beliefs to fit the times, he was an actor after all.
He would’ve loved Donald Trump and would’ve had us sending weapons to Putin officially or unofficially.
Ronald Reagan was a racist who told Nixon he didn’t like the UN because, in his words, the African delegates seemed like monkeys who didn’t know how to wear shoes.
He began his campaign with a states rights speech at the site of a famous lynching.
He ended school desegregation (with the support of blue dog democrats such as Senator Joe Bide).
And while he may have offered amnesty he began the more modern conservative approach to the southern border aiming to deport migrant workers.
Also Iran contra.
Also all the other things he did in Latin America.
Also the War on Drugs.
He welcomed dictators to the White House and supported them all over the world.
I get what people mean when they say Reagan would be seen as a lib today.
They mean republicans are getting more extreme.
But the point misses that Reagan’s beliefs were moving as well with the time.
Like Trump he would just move to the right along with the base.
And then the reason that’s worth arguing is because the modern far right exhilaration is due to a lot that happened under Reagan so trying to return to that is self defeating.
We shouldn’t be doing “make America great again” but for republicans.
Please please please Desantis, don’t bend the knee like all of the other republicans he made fun of before.
I want to see the battle between these two.
