A Republican who just voted for an $858 billion dollar defense bill said, "the country frankly doesn't have the time or the money for the partisan, expensive provisions such as [the] Child Tax Credit.
".
Make no mistake, this isn't about any sincere or intrinsic conservative "values', it almost never is, whether it's family, fiscal spending, government overreach, freedom of this or that, because this is about maintaining a strategy of obstruction and indiscriminate antipathy towards "the left" and everything it supports.
For even more perspective, Trump's tax cuts, which Republicans practically eulogize, cost upwards of $2 trillion dollars and cut government revenue heavily.
This never "paid for itself" and essentially overhauled the tax code to disproportionately benefit the rich, gutting the corporate tax rate and temporarily (key word there) lowering taxes for individuals, until next election cycle of course, and all while being disguised and advertised as deceptive "trickle down" policy.
By comparison, the House and Senate voted this month to increase U.S. military spending by $90 billion dollars over Fiscal Year 2022 levels.
This is about doing what their party demands of them, it's about a culture war, it's about continuing the facade, about catering to wealthy donors and special interests, about serving themselves and the rich at the expense of most Americans.
You got homeless people, poverty, healthcare issues, and you're pumping money into weapons, just because party donors want contracts to get a return on their investments to the parties.
Republican representatives are paid to funnel money to military vendors while no one is paying them to funnel money to fight child poverty.
Now, guess which one Republicans support and which one they don't.
Trump may have made the transactional part of the Republican party public but it was there all along.
