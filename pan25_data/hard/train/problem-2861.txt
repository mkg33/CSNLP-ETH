What about the same crime that Michael Cohen did, the obstruction of the Mueller investigation, the "do us a favor though" to Ukraine, etc.

Worse is that the special counsel will only consider going after Trump's most recent exploits and nothing else that happened during his Presidency or while running.
Because Garland is a political appointee, and Trump is a potential political rival to his boss.
We care because the perception of independence and impartiality is as essential to the rule of law as actual independence and impartiality.
The DOJ HAS been investigating Trump this entire time.
Unfortunately, these things take years.
They now have to pass it off to a special master because:
Garland had long opposed naming a special counsel, but the political dynamics for 2024 left him little choice....
But Mr. Trump upended Mr. Garland’s approach by formally announcing his 2024 White House run.
The ongoing investigation into whether a former president mishandled national security documents and obstructed investigators was recast as an investigation by President Biden’s Justice Department into top political rival — a perceived conflict of interest that Mr. Garland could not overcome.
I agree.
Also, things are going according to plan as far as I can tell by following legal analysts.
These things take years and it is hard to argue with people who think it should take months.
I mean, that would be nice!
But that is not reality.
For real.
He was not only caught red handed but given an opportunity to give back the documents and still kept them, then was caught.
Should have been in cuffs the moment they confirmed he had taken those documents and they were found in his safe.
There’s nothing to prove, there’s a bunch of above top secret documents in his possession.
This is so insane.
