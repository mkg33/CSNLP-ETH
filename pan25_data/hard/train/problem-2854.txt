As GOP goes down the rabbit hole of investigating its own bizarre conspiracy theories, Biden makes them look foolish and then pulls the rug by not running.
Biden doesn't need an protection.
I'd let the GOP waste time calling him as a witness and letting him testify.
One of the funnier aspects of the GOP owned and operated media (Fox, CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, Xinfinity, Sinclair) has been the portrayal of Biden as demented.
As anyone who watched Biden win debates against Trump and, previously, 11 other Democrats, anyone who has watched Biden joust with the media at press conferences, the all know Biden is sharp and on it.
Yeah Biden can once again step up and take the heat as Republicans endlessly attack him and a younger Dem works to get the 2024 nomination and Biden just retires.
House Republicans will throw everything they can at Biden and nothing at the insurrectionists within their ranks.
That's an excellent point.
Reminds me of 2012.
The Republicans took the House in 2010 midterms and had the wind in their sails.
They genuinely believed they would coast to victory in 2012 but then reality hit them hard.
