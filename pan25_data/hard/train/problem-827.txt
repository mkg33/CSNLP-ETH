Its the same game they always play.
When Gay marriage was legalized they completely ignored legal marriage and pretended that churches would be forced to marry gay people religiously.
They pretend that marriage certificates don't exist and pretend that marriage is purely a religious thing instead of a lawful thing.
Yup, they don’t get the difference between holy matrimony and legally married.
You can be married in the eyes of god/church, and not get a marriage license or the reverse(court house wedding).
The LGBTQ+ community just wants the license that allows the legal family, tax benefits and rights stipulated by the law for married couples.
Holy matrimony with no license, you don’t get any benefits, but you are married in the religious sense.
Older people do this to not mess up their estate plans and such for when they pass(or if they’re VERY religious, they do it that way so god gives them the thumbs up for sexy times).
Additionally, it is up to the church and pastor/priest/etc to host a same sex marriage.
If the church leader and goers don’t see it as a problem, then they’ll perform the holy matrimony.
My issue is people who want to appropriate the Christian marriage ceremony.
Like I said, go create your own marriage ceremony.
Then marry who you like in a ceremony of your choosing.
While not giving a shit what anybody else does.
Or spend your life miserable about all the things totally out of your control.
