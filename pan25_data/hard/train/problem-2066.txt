Republicans will have a razor thin majority in the House that cannot afford far-right defections and nearly a month later still can’t secure the votes for a speaker.
Democrats gained, albeit one seat, in the all important Senate and flipped three governorships.
Don’t get me wrong, it was still way too close but things could’ve been far worse for the US.
A massive chunk of the Republican voter base is evangelicals who support their religious views.
If they change their positions, those voters will just flock to the Republican candidate who still supports the religious views they do and defeat the more moderate Republican in a primary.
First of all, your statement is wrong - “The fact that a significant majority of their population voted for increasingly right-wing and divisive political forces”.
The most disturbing element of the recent political developments in Israel is the fact that a significant majority of their population voted for increasingly right-wing and divisive political forces.
Israel is in an interesting position, where the extremely fast growing hyper-religeous segment of the population is warping policy towards conservative, violently resources seeking positios (having more children is strongly encouraged by the more Orthodox aspects of the religion).
Interestingly enough they are exempt from many of the consequences of their positions, as they are exempt from eg military service, but are still allowed to vote (everyone else must serve).
