Chieftains might even exist somewhere: guns would be capable enough but whether they would make it far across Ukraine would be doubtful!
New they were temperamental after 30 years of mothball they’d be I don’t know what.
Doubt we have enough Challenger 2 to have any spare even after fleet reduction and with Challenger 3 on the distant horizon.
They apparently have some to spare since while 386 Challenger 2s were delivered only around 227 are said to be in service so they might be able to spare 50-100 tanks that are currently in reserve.
If Britain sends tanks it will most likely be Challenger 2s (since i doubt there are Chieftains around).
Though with the Polish Statements about being willing to send leopard 2s to Ukraine if they could get replacement tanks it might make more sense to have Poland send leopard 2s to Ukraine and then have the UK Lend Challenger 2s to Poland until the K2s and Abrams that are on order arrive.
Pretty much all of the Challenger 1s were sold to Jordan (392 out of 420) so unless Jordan is willing to Supply Tanks to Ukraine i doubt we will see Challenger 1s in Ukraine.
