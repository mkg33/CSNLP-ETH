He's lost them 3 elections in a row now.
The problem Republicans are facing is that he doesn't just rile up his base, he riles up the opposition too.
It's now a net negative for them.
The worst part is, he's still going to dominate the primaries because primaries tend to be dominated by the more dedicated or extreme parts of the base.
It's the Trump Trap.
This is saying fox will not back trump.
Granted, if he wins the primary they will, but the biggest propaganda machine for conservatives says it will not back him.
I'm thinking you are a bit generous that they won't fall in line.
Hierarchy is what conservatives believe in stronger than any religion.
If powerful conservative figureheads tell them to vote a certain way, they most likely will, as that is a person higher on the hierarchy giving them orders.
Not saying trump can't win.
Not saying he isn't dangerous.
But I think Republicans in power are trying their darndest to keep him from winning the primary.
I am more afraid that trump runs and wins enough electoral votes to deny either party a majority.
Sending it to the house which would be a serious cluster fuck.
