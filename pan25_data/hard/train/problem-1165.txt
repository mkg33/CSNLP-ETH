Hate to be pedantic, but in the case of the North Carolina Supreme Court, those partisan hacks were elected.
North Carolina had two seats on the Supreme Court up for election at midterms.
North Carolina had an opportunity to maintain its Democratic majority on the NC Supreme Court.
The GOP flipped two seats on the state Supreme Court to get a majority and they picked up four seats in the NC General Assembly so they are now one seat shy of a veto proof supermajority.
Our state Supreme Court overturned a partisan gerrymandered map and actually enabled a fair map to be used for the US House at midterms.
The court that voted to rehear the cases has a 5-to-2 Republican majority, courtesy of the partyâ€™s sweep of state Supreme Court races in November.
The potential beneficiary of those reviews is the Republican leadership of the state General Assembly, which had both drawn the political map and enacted the voter ID law that the court struck down in December.

Yup.
There are people on the Federal bench, put there by Republicans, who've never tried a case.
Now they're deciding how to follow the rules of evidence.
