Imagine if your work brought in an awful management team that intentionally undermined everything you did with the goal of getting you and all your friends to quit.
Four years later you get a call saying “we changed management teams, come back!” You are now fully vested, rising through the ranks, and in full control of your career.
Your former employer burned bridges that can’t be rebuilt no matter who is at the helm.
The trust you had in them is long gone and you’ve sampled what the world has to offer.
Your answer is a polite but firm “Thanks, but no thanks.”.
In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
