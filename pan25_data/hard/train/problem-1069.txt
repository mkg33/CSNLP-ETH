Canada does not have a great need for armored forces.
I understand the reasons it maintains an armored force, but there won't be a "caught with their pants down" situation because of some missing tanks.
Tanks played a small role in Afghanistan.
It was a fight for light infantry supported by air power.
The only way tanks saved soldier's lives is by being armored against roadside bombs, a job done better (and more cheaply) by MRAP-style vehicles.
There was no need for the treads or main cannon in Afghanistan.
Are you calling for Canada to build its own tanks?
And being able to build your own tanks means not just building your own tanks, but continuing to build new tanks for generations or else you lose the capability.
This is why Canada buys jets, but it builds non-tank armored vehicles itself.
What does Canada need tanks for anyway?
I mean, outside of NATO assistance it's extremely unlikely that Canada is ever attacked in a land war - to the south there is only the USA and on the Eastern front there's Alaska (again USA) to protect against possibly dumb AF Russians.
Yeah because the only country we have to worry about defensively outspends the rest of the world combined so it's awful hard to justify spending more on land forces when we have more than enough to fulfill our peacekeeping duties now that we have transports to actually move our stuff around.
Canada's military spending needs to be focused on creating a navy that can adequately patrol and protect our northern sea routes for our allies to use commercially.
I think that will provide more benefit to our allies than spending money keeping 80 or 100 tanks at 100% readiness at any moment.
