The last thing the world needs right now is for the US to decide to go to war with each other and then leaving all those military bases we have scattered across the world empty or half-assedly armed/manned.
You and me both, I just want to go back to worrying about normal shit like "What will I eat today" or "Should I put pants on?"
rather than "Should I actually buy a gun or two in case we get into a civil war?"
"Should I buy a supply of iodine tablets?"
or "Will my stocks vaporize (Literally) along with Wall Street this year?
".
True.
We are all dependent on each other.
No offence though, but we have a bigger issue being closest neighbours to Russia.
It’s been wild here for a while….
It sounds to me like the slow beginnings of a new genocide of sorts.
Those always start by ostracism towards an already marginalised group in society that nobody will “miss/happy to get rid of”.
I hope I’m wrong but you sure make it sound like you’re heading towards that.
Wherever hate is allowed to take over, there’s a risk for this happening.
Fearmongering is a good word to describe all this.
