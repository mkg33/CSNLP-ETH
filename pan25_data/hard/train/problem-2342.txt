And this new labeling of the Wagner Group doesn’t actually affect the aid being sent to anyone.
What it does is allow American governmental agencies to conduct operations against them, which will most likely take place in their African strongholds.
This isn’t “Americans rallying behind the terrorist word”.
These are actual terrorists.
I can’t think of a single group that the US has declared a terrorist organization that isn’t actually a terrorist organization.
Wait I’m sorry, you’re saying the government is branding people terrorists to allow aid to Ukraine to keep going?
That is the dumbest thing I’ve heard all day, and I heard Putin say that a Russian victory is guaranteed.
Politicians don’t need another reason to keep sending aid.
Despite what FOX and some smaller news networks like to say, in the US, support for Ukraine and sending them stuff has only gone up since the war started.
I have no idea who you’re talking to who think we shouldn’t be sending stuff to Ukraine, but they’ve probably spent too much time online.
It’s not just politicians who are divided on this topic a lot of people here state side don’t think we should be sending much of any aid to the Ukraine.
All I said was the word terrorism is a great unifier in the United States and gets the people moving in the same direction.
