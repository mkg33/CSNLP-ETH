The relevance is that unpopular candidates can’t win easily with a system that doesn’t force people to choose between two evils.
Anyone that’s tired of right-wing extremism should look at this as a huge positive.
That’s my point, people that wanted a non-extremist were willing to cross party lines as a second choice and the voting system gave them that option.
It’s possible some dem voters associated him with Mark Begich (his uncle and former dem senator) but if that’s the case it means there are more votes for Dems in Alaska than conventional wisdom suggests.
As long as Democrats boost more Native turnout and appeal to more independent minded thinkers, they can make Alaska in play.
I have to wonder whether the main lesson to be learned is that RCV gives native Alaskans much greater electoral clout.
If so, great.
May Alaska Republicans learn what it takes to court those voters.
Murkowski, notorious RINO that she is, seems to know.
Since Alaska apparently doesn't publish the 2nd choice of the ultimate 2nd place finisher's 1st round voters, there's no way to know how many voters who had Palin as their 1st choice had Begich as their 2nd choice.
Thus, it's impossible to know whether Begich would have been elected had his and Palin's 1st round votes been reversed.
Edit - she only won because the republican vote was split and even in ranked choice enough Begich voters couldn't swallow Palin for second choice.
Palin+Begich together won a PLURALITY of the vote, but not a MAJORITY.
Maybe all Begich voters would have opted for Palin had this been a traditional election, but were the 11% of Begich voters really so confused about RCV that their 2nd choice for Peltola was accidental?
