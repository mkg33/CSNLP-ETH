The PPP program was intentionally written to be abused like this.
It was a massive transfer of wealth to the wealthy.
The PPE loan program was biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the U.S.
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer.
Thanks Trump.
He helped out his people (the rich) but screwed his base as they are too poor to qualify for PPE except for the big farmers who are subsidized anyway.
Most of his rural voters did not go to college and resent student loan relief.
The rich want us to be in debt so we have no choice to work for them.
Same reason they don’t want universal healthcare.
All of that causes us to have to stay working in undesirable situations.
I’m so sick of the US with its greedy spiteful people.
And they wonder why we have so many suicides.
They call them opiate overdoses and I can tell you a lot are not accidental.
People have no hope left.
But the rural poor want to keep “traditional family values” which really means the continuation of the patriarchy.
Can’t have women getting uppity and forgetting their roles as housekeeper and breeder.
The more educated a woman the more likely they are not not want those marriages.
The Republican Party has said educated women are their biggest threat.
So let’s gut education as much as we can and keep them under their husbands thumbs.
