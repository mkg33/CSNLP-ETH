Has anyone seen any coverage or proof this charlatan is a US citizen?
How about a birth certificate?
With all the falsehoods and the indictment in Brazil I have a hard time believing he is.
Just really odd that this hasn't been a larger point of emphasis in the research into this con man's background.
If he's not a citizen he should already be behind bars.
Even if naturalized, to serve in the House requires US citizenship for a minimum of 7 years.
He is naturalized but the 7 year period is in question.
Apparently all this is just on a honor system, no checks or balances.
Crazy, kinda glad he highlighted the issue, he was dumb enough to get caught.
How many others have abused this and haven't is better question.
They could all be spies kinda scary tbh.
He is not a US citizen, dude was born in Brazil and has felony warrants there for running scams and defrauding people.
What a strange coincidence....This dude is literally an international criminal of the worst kind and here the Republicans sit with arms wide open.....
Here is a guy, an illegal or possibly a foreign national either way the man is a shining example about a gazillion things they complain about daily.
It is okay when your "team" does it.
When you let them begin to divide the populace that generally agrees on most things by tiny little trivial pointless matters like race, sexual orientation and religion.
You allow them the control over your lives and thoughts that wouldn't occur otherwise.
It is all a distraction to keep your attention away from who is stealing "life" from you everyday...
