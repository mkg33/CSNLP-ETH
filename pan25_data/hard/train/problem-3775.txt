Hakeem Jeffries represents the status quo of the old guard and the monied side of the blue aisle and neither of those should be dictating our partyâ€™s future.
At the end of the day, the House Democrats should stand with teachers and the progressives that have delivered them so much success.
The Democrats do not have the same issue with progressives.
The Democratic party is a big tent party with a good chunk of third way Democrats, social liberals, and the like.
Deny all you want but MOST voters are either center right or center left and most democrats are NOT progressives.
I think the annoyance is that the Democratic party fights progressives more in primaries than they do Republicans.
If anything it's the other way around, you have progressives hurting their own party by attacking them and stupidly "forcing the vote".
Take it as you will but most of these folks really do believe the way things are being done makes things better in the long run and they arent interested in progressives ruining that.b.
A sizable chunk of the Democratic party is progressive (not the majority unfortunately), but there is more neoliberal representation than progressive.
In private neoliberal Democrats get along fairly well with Republicans.
Most of what we see is theatre.
