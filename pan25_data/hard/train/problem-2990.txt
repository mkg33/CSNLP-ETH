"In 1993, at least 16 Yanomami, including women and children, were killed by a group of wildcat miners, known in Brazil as garimpeiros.
".
I was not trying to defend Balsonaro I just feel no Brazilian government has clean hands when dealing with indigenous population.
Regarding this particular situation even the article says Balsonaro government.
Did he know or ordered to stay everyone back personally in a hope that Yanomani would get eradicated ?
Nobody in Brazil's and Venezuela's governments as well care about Yanomami.
Destroying and killing happened during Lula's reign 2003-2010 as well.
Yes I'm slanted against Lula as I do not believe in his honesty knowing little bit about him.
Now I did not know this about Bolosanaro and it definitely look bad yet calling it genocide ids streech.
I guess what irked me Lula accusing Balsonaro of genocide while he was in power he could do more, let say set up laws and rules such way that territory of Yanomani could be out of limits for exploration.
Anyway I will watch how Lula will handle it.
I really hope that Lula gets a defamation charge because of that.
The court that judges him is filled with political allies, and nothing will ever happen de facto.
But man, making up a genocide and telling to the outside public i really damaging to the country image.
This type of stuff shouldn't just go unpunished.
At least pressing a charge to show that this is wrong needs to be done.
