Also, for the folks unaware and all ‚Äúwar is terrible‚Äù: the russian war machine made the spectacularly sound decision to place live ammunitions right next to the bunker üòë.
Still no warm feelings for Russian soldiers, but let's be honest, they have half a dozen of possible ways of action, and _all_ of them are incredibly bad.
At some point I'm still glad the Ukrainians are doing some damage but you start feeling bad for the Russian troops.
That being said, the only end in sight for Ukraine is to kill as many of them as they can and make the war so terrible and miserable that the Russians have to leave one way or another.
And that's horrible, I would prefer Russians dying given the choice, it's still horrible it has to happen.
I've killed a lot of people in war and would do it all again, it's still horrible that it had to happen that way, even if it's the necessary choice.
War is a horrible thing, and I hope this one ends this year with a Russian retreat.
I'm not defending Russia in any way, I just wish all these people didn't have to die for an old dying man trying to salvage his legacy.
It is what it is for now, but I can't seal clap reading these stories knowing what people on both sides are going through.
I want Ukraine to win and win in a dominant fashion, but I still know a lot of young people are getting eaten up by the war machine, and that sucks, even if it's on the other side.
Killing is a task, when you take glee in it, you become less human.
