What's more likely- that the four seasons (which was five blocks from where Philly's ballots were being counted and likely the most prestigious venue in the area) somehow couldn't manage to accommodate a press conference organized by the sitting president's reelection campaign (we're not talking about their main convention room for the night, we're talking about a short press conference outside the place just like the one they had at the landscaping place) and that the campaign then decided that the next best thing to do would be find another business nearby that happened to have the same name and say it was just as good... Or that those inept fucks from trump's camp googled "four seasons" and didn't finish reading before they placed the call?
Because I think there's next to zero chance at all that the four seasons hotel tells the president of the United States of America "nope, we can't help you with your press conference.
".
Wow.
Over at r/conservative they are pissed at Trump.
Yeah theyâ€™ve been turning on him since the election but damn are they mad.
Trump had a decent cult thing going but it looks like he messed that up as well.
Sad.
