To enrich their shitty friends who own education businesses and to intentionally dumb-down the population into joining the ranks of Republican voters.
Also why they stay too dumb to realize that the Republicans are just milking them for their votes in order to keep enriching themselves and doing absolutely nothing to help the people who keep voting for them.
Those people are stuck in a vicious cycle and are too stupid to notice.
The really ironic thing is that the Christian Nationalists were the ones screaming for years about how Muslims were trying to force sharia law on all of us here and yet it’s those same Nationalists that are trying to take rights away from women, including forcing them to cover up in the Missouri legislature, and everyone who isn’t a straight, white, male Christian.
Someone tried that in Texas (I think?)
and predictably all the Christian scumbags down there rejected just those signs (I believe one had In God We Trust written in Arabic and another one was done with rainbow letters).
They’re not interested in displaying their love for God so much as they are in marginalizing other religions and the people that believe in them.
