I fucking hate seeing suffering, but hate it or not the the US/UN gave the Afghani people 20 years to choose.
When we left they choose the Taliban.
That may be controversial but compare the Afghani people how the Ukrainian citizens responded to invasion.
What is the level of insurgency today?
If a partisan group was killing Taliban leaders that would make international news.
Afghanistan will not change until Afghani diaspora have built enough leaders, wealth, and allies to retake it themselves.
The world needs to hold back it's hand in any action that can strenhen the Taliban until they can achieve this, or else we would just be prolonging the suffering.
Afghans themselves need to step up and take control of their lives and fate , to make themselves and their country better, they wont though.
Now is time to change and they wont get rid of the taliban or make themselves better, They “let” the TB come in and take over and now its back to sharia law and shit all over again.
Going into a Afghanistan in force was a colossal mistake, cost trillions of dollars over time for no gain.
The argument was going into Afghanistan was a mistake, not the years of war that followed.
Afghanistan had to happen unless you wanted more attacks by both al-Qaeda and copycat organizations.
