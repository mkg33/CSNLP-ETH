The Republican loser is claiming that redistricting hurt him because in the towns that were new to his district, he was an unknown.
He seems to think that being an incumbent means you don’t have to work to gain voters’ confidence anymore and should give you an automatic advantage over any opponent.
That means you're basically conceding very close elections because you told your supporters to only vote in a one-shot way instead of the easy way and a small percentage aren't going to make it on election day.
They're counting on short term electoral gain, but we're already starting to see the limits of that misguided strategy, and its going to get worse.
There's a plethora of maga idiots that are going to damage elections(God willing) going forward.
Unfortunately, in some areas they will win, but I think by and large this evolution of Republicans is going to cause some serious damage in mainstream elections and to the mainstream party.
Especially if they try to break away from the party and run against more traditional Ds and Rs.
Until they start splitting away with their full Qmaga BS.
The tea partiers set the stage for this crap by tearing apart the GOP.
The magas will vote R down ballot, but if given a chance to vote for a True Patriot, vs a boring old RINO, they'll do it, probably not realizing that will thing the GOP in general.
