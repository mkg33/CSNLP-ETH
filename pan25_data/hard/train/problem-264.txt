I'm originally from NY, lived in VA, but have spent a lot of time in parts of Jersey for many reasons.
Highly underrated state.
The shores are great, great places to live, all the things you've mentioned.
The earlier in the morning you vote, the older the crowd in most places.
Young people tend to vote during lunch hours, and after work, early voting, etc..
That being said, you get people are more likely to vote after work, during their lunch, mail-in, early voting.
They don't usually have the luxury of being off on a Tuesday.
Right now, we are at a turning point, where the extremist positions used to push for the conservative policies that help the elite are actually being bought into with the religious-like conviction.
Now that they've changed from trying to keep the status quo to actually regressing, they're embracing literal fascism as they'll always need an "other" to hate and keep their base riled up.
But to paraphrase a very wise man I once knew said: "if you're ever feeling sad, bored, or depressed, all you need to do to motivations yourself is to get an enemy."
Thankfully, this was a kind, smart man who knew the right enemies to pick, and it helped carry him to do extraordinary things and change countless lives.
And his enemies tended to be fascists.
But the fascists know almost nothing but enemies, and do everything in their power to give people one and reasons to need them.
