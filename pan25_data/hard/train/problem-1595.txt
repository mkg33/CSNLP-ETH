Gorsuch is fine.
Guy is conservative but he is a champion of native American rights and doesn't seem as bad as the others.
Alito,Thomas, and Barrett/Kavanaugh (lesser extent) are the dangerous ones.
Barrett, Alito, and Thomas are worse than Kavanaugh.
At least Kavanaugh isn't handing down racist opinions (he penned Flowers) and will protect LGBT rights.
I disagree with your take on Roberts.
He's an old school republican, not a crazy republican.
Meaning he doesn't want a theocracy, he just wants his rich cronies in charge at all costs.
What he wants most is for the republican party to rule indefinitely, even at the cost of democracy, while still appearing to be moderate, civil, and reasonable.
That's why, e.g., he wanted to erode Roe bit by bit rather than overturn it, and why he votes to let Republicans cheat and undermine democracy (Shelby, Rucho, etc.
).

All the while knowing full well that Walker if he gets in is basically going to make Bohbert and Taylor green look like Mensa candidates.
