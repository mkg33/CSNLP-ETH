Yes, this is the main reason she changed affiliation.
She can’t get primaried (and there had been serious talk about candidates lining up to beat her in the primary), and it puts the Democrats in an awkward spot because if they run the risk of likely splitting the vote in a general election if they enter a candidate.
By coming out as an independent, she doesn’t strenhen her chances of being reelected, she merely weakens the Democrats chances of keeping that seat in 2024.
She is ostensibly pro LGBT, but her relentless cash grab in protecting big Pharma and the Trump tax cuts, she really is putting control of the senate in danger, which intern is bad for the LGBT community.
Because we know that extremists in the republican party, have it in for the LGBT community.
She cannot serve two opposing agendas hand effectively defend either.
Ruben Gallego is the odds on favorite to be the Democratic nominee for her seat in 2024.
He will certainly get the lion’s share of the Latino vote which means even though Sinema may peel off a few Democratic votes, those votes might easily be offset by the number of Latino votes that Gallegos gets.
There is a chance that she doesn’t run for reelection and merely retires and takes a job on the board of a large pharmaceutical company or investment bank.
