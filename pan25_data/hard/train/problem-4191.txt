I really think we just need to make it an accountability issue.
If you sell to someone who commits a crime, you’re an accessory.
If you leave your weapons unsecured and the get stolen, you’re an accessory.
If people want to own killing devices they need to be held accountable.
If known you could face charges up to those of the one committing the crime, sellers would push for background checks and owners would actually secure their weapons.
No, I know they provide a lock for every gun sold, but something more substantial.
If there was better and more cost effective technology, along the lines of biometric locks.
That would be awesome.
That's the thing.
They still will find a way and get their hands on these guns.
You're just hurting yourself and responsible gun owners.
I have stated earlier, but owning a gun also needs to be taken more seriously.
We need better back ground checks.
We need mental health evaluations.
We need political reviews and social reviews.
I personally see the line being bombs/bioweapons.
No one, not even the government, should be messing with bioweapons.
I am so against bombs it's not even funny, how many innocent people have governments killed by dropping bombs, but rarely killed the intended target?
