What precisely did you think we (if you mean the US) has ever done that hasn’t designed to be inherently it its own interests?
(I use the word designed loosely here.
It turns out that continually arming and training groups that you know nothing about without even a toddler’s understanding of history or culture or languages or politics turns out to NOT be in your own interest.
Pretty much all the time.
Oopsie).
What make you think that the people of Iran, protesting and dying since the US and the UK orchestrated a military coup against a popularly elected and leader , don’t want democracy?
Like the US supports a thriving democratic government in Iran that only considers the well-being of its people and can influence the citizens of other nations in the region who are currently living under the rule of absolute monarchies to change their government.
Imagine an established Iranian democracy and you’ve imagined what could be one of the most thriving countries in the world.
Thing is: If the Islamic republic gets overthrown what’s saying that a democracy will come in its place?
They could go to another form of government like for example an authoritarian monarchy since the claimant to the throne has some level of support.
They could just go in a dictatorship of some form aswell.
