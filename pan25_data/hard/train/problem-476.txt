But this means nothing when anything substantial is filibustered, right?
Just more of the same useless, keep the lights on bullshit?
What does 51 in the Senate actually accomplish that isn't being done with 50+1?
But 51-49 would still be great considering the Senate Map of 2024 where Dems have to go full defense.
The senate seats in 2024 up for election are mostly Democrats at 24 and only 10 are republican.
Also most the 10 Republican seat are in Republican stronghold with the only real exception being Ted Cruz.
So the senate could possibly flip back to Rep in 2024.
it also paints the FALSE picture that 50 or 51 senate members being the same party should be able to pass bills all by themselves.
that is NOT A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY, people arguing that "Democrats held all three branches and got nothing done" are going to bat for republicans, trying to get people to stay home and not vote.
It is completely unhealthy to pass bills requiring 100% of your party's vote and 0% of the opposing party's vote.
Republicans are so uniform that they have very good luck doing that, they passed many bills doing that, Democrats are very diverse, they only passed a few bills using that method, it is NOT TRUE that 50 Democrats is a "majority", and it is completely unhealthy to expect congress to operate without crossing the aisle, which republicans have been refusing to do for 15+ years now.

(I think this overall bill did not pass, looks complicated to me:
Republicans had a trifecta from 2017-2019 during Trump's first term with Pence being the tiebreaker in the Senate:
