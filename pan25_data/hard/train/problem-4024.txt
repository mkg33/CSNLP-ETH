In Islam, one of Allahs names is As-Sabur which translates to The Patient.
Allah is more patient than anyone else and that is why his names start with The as in THE Patient.
So this verse shows that he gives people time to ask for forgiveness and better themselves after doing wrong.
As a Muslim, I don’t sugar coat anything when it comes to Islam and try to be as straight forward as possible.
In terms of the Charlie Hebdo making fun of Islam (I’m referring to their old magazines years ago), yes, the correct answer is to let God sort them out.
When it comes to the “let god sort them out” comment, it’s a case by case basis and every case is different and should be seen differently.
“If Allah were to punish people ˹immediately˺ for their wrongdoing, He would not have left a single living being on earth.
But He delays them for an appointed term.
And when their time arrives, they cannot delay it for a moment, nor could they advance it.”.
Probably the same thing that happened last time.
Send some terrorists to go shoot up the place.
Quite pathetic if a few cartoons about the atrocities you committed cause you to do more.
