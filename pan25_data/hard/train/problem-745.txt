Fani Willis is the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia (Atlanta metro area).
A DA's job is mostly prosecuting violent crime.
She is woefully ill-equipped for investigating election fraud.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a DA with experience investigating these types of crimes, especially involving a former POTUS.
Her office doesn't have the manpower or the budget to be doing this, so it's taking a long time.
I also think that lends a lot of legitimacy to the situation.
Every dollar and man-hour she spends investigating Trump and his cronies is a resource she can't spend prosecuting violent crime in Atlanta.
She's an elected official and her job security depends on keeping Atlanta safe.
This whole investigation is a gamble for her.
After two years, I think she's really "pot-committed" as the poker players would say.
Donald John Trump was one of the only targets of this investigation who did not appear before the grand jury.
Just a reminder that Judge McBurney specifically cited the due process rights of people who did not appear before the grand jury.
But if she then goes ahead and discusses what the judge told the grand jury not to discuss, or strongly infers something from the report during the interview...
...This foreperson is NOT helping the DA and I'm willing to bet the DA is hopping mad this person is giving interviews before she indicts anyone.
