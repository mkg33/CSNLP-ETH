It did really happen.
That's not the point.
The point is that rich people see fines for crimes as just a fee to be able to do them.
For poor people, getting fined for not wearing a seatbelt can actually be a little scary.
That might mean no groceries for the week.
This keeps then more likely to obey those laws.
As a method of deterrence though, it's not even close to proportional.
When a speeding ticket or a seatbelt ticket could mess up your ability to pay rent, the consequences are actually much stiffer than someone who could afford to drop $100 bills on the ground every hour for months and not even notice.
For rich people they see it more like "I don't have to wear my seat belt if I just pay the $50" or "I can park in this no parking zone for $100, nice".
This story serves to make people think " ahh cool, they didn't just let them off cuz they're the prime minister.
They had to suffer the consequences like the rest of us" even though the consequences aren't proportional.
The consequences not being proportional dosent stop them from having suffered the same consequences.
