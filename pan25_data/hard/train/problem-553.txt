I'm trans, and I know why.
The right in the US has been, without any exaggeration, using the exact same language and conspiracies against trans people that was used against Jews in the 1930s.
Jews were accused of grooming children, spreading degeneracy, etc.
They are telling everyone what their intentions are.
They're openly and proudly declaring that they're genocidal, fascist terrorists, in those exact words, and that trans people are the first on their list of many targets.
And one of the first acts of the Nazis, all the way back in 1933, was burning down the Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft, which researched and provided care for LGBT people, including performing some of the earliest gender affirming surgeries for trans people.
"Moral decline prior to Nazi Germany, which spawned an increase in the acceptance of homosexuality in German society, occurred about 35 years before the Nazis took power and it paved the way for the Nazis to take power.
A large part of the increase of support for homosexuality beforehand, including Germany becoming the birthplace of the so-called "Gay Rights" movement...".
Even if they did read about him and what happened...they literally think the Nazis were bleeding heart liberal socialists who loved trans people and hated guns.
Didn't know I'd see the "Nazis were too gay to be real conservatives" argument today, but here we are.
What to you think Carlson means when he comes on and says things like "just another day in Weimar" and talks about LGBTQ+ people existing as forcing people to put Nazis into power?
Him and other alt right influencers say this kind of stuff, like LGBTQ+ people existing or being included in media are somehow forcing them to go further to the right.
