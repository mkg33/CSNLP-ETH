They like Israel because it is the place the Jews are “supposed” to be.
It’s basically saying “I support the state of Israel so there is somewhere for us to deport the Jews to during the ethnic cleansing.”.
Its just rebranding of an antisemitic trope claiming that Jews were sacrificing children for their religious beliefs.
It was used during the Spanish Inquisition to justify killing Jews, during the plague in medieval Europe, in 1930’s Germany, the Satanic Panic, LGBTQAI, and now drag queens.
Albeit throughout most of its use its been to vilify Jews but the claims of children being threatened or sacrificed is a key component.
I remember all that rebranded antisemitic blood libel crap.
Like supposedly dungeons and dragons was a gateway to sacrificing babies to Satan and listening to Judas Priest would make you unalive yourself.
Just ricockulous.
Judas Priest were involved in a court case where it was alleged that there were subliminal messages on a track that caused two teens to commit suicide.
