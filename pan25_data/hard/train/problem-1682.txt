The EU was to Britain what Britain is to Scotland, except trade is much higher and more critical.
Between the EU and Britain, the much bigger economic hit is a Brexit from Britain.
And i cant really agree with your comparison with brexit, I havent seen any big promised of how much better it will be outside the UK like it happened with brexit.
The reasoning is pretty much a distrust if the UK and wanting to be in the EU again.
More like a reversed brexit yeah, scotts only wnated to remain in EU and they got dragged of it because the rest of the kingdom voted to exit.
Still, the idea of idependance was here way before brexit, it just conforted scotts they want to be autonomous even more.
No issue with self determination in principle, although the idea that the UK is just a ‘union’ that you can leave, rather than a nation state, will always underplay the complexities of independence.
The idea that Scottish "independence" from Britain is any more enlightened than a British "independence" from the EU is typical nationalist rubbish.
