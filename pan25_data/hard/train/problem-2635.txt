Because those are in Red States.
It’s not about housing these people.
It’s about using them as props to score political points with the Republican base.
Republicans have made their point.
Now let's see if Polis, Abbot, DeSantis and all the rest are actually interested in doing something about the issue.
they aren't illegal, they have been screened and released to await their asylum hearings.
These migrants we're talking about crossed legally, followed the process and have broken no laws.
Calling them illegals makes you look like an ignorant, racist moron.
"closing the border" doesn't mean what you think it means.
You can't close the border and also allow traffic for import/export or travel.
Closing the border would kneecap the economy.
Not only that, these migrants aren't just going to turn around and leave, closing the border will only increase illegal crossings.
Nobody is denying that there is an immigration problem, but how is this helping?
The only point of it seems to be "own the libs".
