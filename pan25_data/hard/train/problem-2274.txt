What is the significance or ramifications of closing embassies?
I’m not very well versed in this so I’m trying to understand why a country like Iran would react to that.
Yeah but tbf anything that happens in Iran that our government doesn't like and they're going to blame either the USA or Israel (or both).
Since the protests started and have grown, the USA/Zionists/Europe have all been blamed at various points.
Even last night, Khamenei was tweeting about this being the CIA's fault!
Some people think protests in the US don't do anything for the people in Iran, or that writing to your politicians won't do anything.
But it does.
Secondly, our shitty dictatorship can be pressured by western governments.
This temporary halt on these planned executions is proof.
It's partially because governments like the Netherlands have summoned our ambassador and said "if you go ahead with more executions, you'll get more sanctions."
That coupled with the protestors in Iran putting domestic pressure on them stopped these killings.
