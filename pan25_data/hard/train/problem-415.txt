I was thinking the same thing.
Russia no longer seems to have any military strategy other than killing as many Ukrainians (and in the process thousands of its own young men) as possible.
Under that kind of interpretation, it’s better to let Russia attack Ukraine and tell Ukraine that they won’t get a missile system if they can’t restrain themselves from shooting into Russia.
Yes, because Russia is afraid of NATO attacking it right now... NATO won't even let Ukraine launch missiles over the Russian border in fear of retaliation, but they're going to launch a full scale invasion of Russia once they see that Russia is running low on cruise missiles.
What people forget is that russia has some very aggressive forces on there borders Georgia and Chechnya as an example, they are going to need some of their missiles to quell an uprising there but have been shown to not be the strong military they were thought to be.
This in essence makes it a war of Russian attrition, in which the Russians are constantly loosing and slowly recognizing the absurdity of the situation.
Because Putin is a calculated man, and a patriot, forcing him into a difficult position slowly might temper his response in the case that he recognizes that Russia may have lost, but it’s not the intention of the west to actually see Russia suffer.
