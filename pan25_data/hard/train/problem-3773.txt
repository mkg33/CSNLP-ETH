There are tons of Christians who don’t buy into the right wing or nationalism, or even conservatism in general.
The Trump brand of Christians make all the noise and subsequently get all the attention because people are drawn to the culture war.
In essence, doing what they can to be the best representation of what they believe Christ is exemplifying and teaching.
If you want that to mean gaining and exhibiting some kind of forceful power to put down anything that’s not that, you’re not going to find it in that kind of Christianity.
Maybe that invalidates that kind of faith to you, and that would be understandable, but perhaps right wing Christian nationalism is going to be its own undoing eventually anyway.
You don’t have to be an expert in Christianity to know nationalism under a Christian umbrella is not fuckin heresy lol…and when you throw words around like that only idiots will take you serious.
Apparently these Crazies and Fundamentalists are not different enough for Real Christians^^TM to bother taking a stand against folks doing Evil in your name.
Gee, if it makes those so-called christians mad, it would make Christ themself absolutely furious that this religion has screwed up the world in so many ways.
All because they had no concept of literacy or respecting the word of GOD.
