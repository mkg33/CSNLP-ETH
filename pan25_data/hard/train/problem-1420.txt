Yeah these elections are close and the campaigns are stressful, but a win is a win is a win.
If they can capture this energy and apply it in other states, you’ll see Democrats making inroads in traditional Republican strongholds.
But as I'm sure most of us know, the establishment Democrats serve as a stop gap against meaningful reforms, which is why we've had a ratcheting effect in our national politics for the past 30 years.
But now I look at the state of American politics and I see Republicans talking a lot about lessons to learn from Trumpism and how to navigate and reorient toward successful strategy and I don’t really see that from establishment Dems as much.
I see much more sentiment from Dems that leans toward a continuation of the belief that they’re just better, and would win outright if not for those damn Republicans without any reflection on how bad they look themselves.
Edit: to be clear, I agree that establishment backed candidates would do better in the general, but I don't think it's currently possible to get those candidates through the primaries because of how crazy the Republican base has gotten.
Yeah I was very hopeful that if Trump won in 2020 it would cause Dems to wake up and start pushing really strong, viable candidates who are open to working across the aisle, because I don’t think that Republicans have to do that from a political standpoint anywhere near as much, even though they should.
