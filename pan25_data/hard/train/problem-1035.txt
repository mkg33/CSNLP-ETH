I think y'all are getting too wrapped up in the idea of reporters as personalities who are "just asking questions".
A lot of times a reporter asks a question to allow the interviewee to simply answer.
Not every question is a veiled attack.
The guy asked a question, let Pete answer at lenh, and offered zero retort.
He wanted to let Pete answer that question well and to give him the last word.
Pete did very well here.
I don't know that it would have ended positively, but a part of me wanted Pete to press the point home.
To not let the host move on without answering his question: Why was this not questioned when all these other folks did it with their partners, but it is questioned when Pete travels with his?
Possible, certainly.
But then I'd question the competency of the producer/question-writer.
They couldn't have believed that Pete was the first person to travel for the US government, in this capacity.
5 minutes on Google would have given then the necessary background info to ask this question properly.
This isn't two dudes at a bar asking questions, this is a national TV show where people's entire jobs are wrapped around writing and asking questions.
