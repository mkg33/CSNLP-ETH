Russia is the guy that brags about how he could buy your house out from under you but then the waiter comes to him and says "Sir, there's a problem with your card.
".
Interesting.
Yes, it is common for a waiter to take your card when you are paying at a restaurant in America.
I always love hearing about the little differences in life between different countries.
ðŸ˜Œ Thank you for sharing that.
Yeah, if the Ukrainian military surrounds the gates of Moscow, it's still an "oh well" to me.
Don't start a fight, then complainabout losing.
I feel for the people of both countries who didn't have a choice in the matter but there's nothing the Ukrainian military could do to Putin that would make me feel sympathy.
It's like he still genuinely believes that the Ukranian people outwardly desire to be Russian but those pesky meddling Ukranian soldiers are stopping the two from joining.
So the article does add a crucial bit of detail that they're complaining about Ukrainian aggression towards civilians in the Donbas, not necessarily toward Russian military units.
\- Western governments warned their citizens to leave Ukraine in advance of the invasion (which, while completely understandable, does make things easier for Russia in not killing non-Ukrainian citizens thus provoking a bigger reaction).
