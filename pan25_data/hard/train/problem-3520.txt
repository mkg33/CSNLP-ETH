That seems like a good starting place.
We can even be nice and let that rule apply to their spouses as well.
As a federal employee I am allowed to accept unsolicited gifts of $20 or less per occasion and no more than $50 a year.
As a bank employee, I can gift $20 to a federal employee if I spend the necessary few weeks filling forms, get manager and legal approval and can justify a special occasion.
Under the $20 rule, an employee may accept an unsolicited gift of $20 or less per occasion and no more than $50 in a calendar year from one person.
If the market value of a gift offered on any single occasion exceeds $20, the employee may NOT pay the excess value over $20 in order to accept the gift.
What specific rule is that?
I think there is a threshold, and I think water and coffee fall below that threshold.
What specific rule prevents the providing of coffee and water?
I don't think that's true.
There are limits that were born out of things like Tailhook where tons of money was being spent on "entertainment" but cofee and water seem like basic resources for sitting through hours of meetings.
