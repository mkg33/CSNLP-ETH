Yeah, but it’s not just the Presidential elections because at the national level it takes the House and the Senate as well and those margins are extremely narrow at this point.
Democrats may own the largest populated states but as a country we are fairly equally divided.
Besides even with majorities in all three branches of government the majorities the Democrats had were not enough and they still needed Republicans in the Senate to pass any legislation.
Now with a bit more breathing room in the Senate that still wouldn’t be enough because it takes 60.
But Hell, since they narrowly lost the house nothing is going to happen for the next two years.
Hell, there’s a good chance they default on the debt.
The fact that Biden was able to get an infrastructure bill when the had the majority which was decades overdue was a feat in itself And you would think bridges and roads that work would be popular with both Democrats and Republicans.
Thing is when your Party on the whole supports someone trying to be a dictator in a Republic that Party can no longer be trusted to govern in a Republic.
The Republican politicians have supported Fascists concepts for so long that they are the power of party.
They are above the law and have even usurped the Supreme Court of the US.
