The French (weirdly, given their ability to produce arms) routinely spend way below their obligation as a NATO member, each member state is supposed to spend 2% GDP on Defence.
France rely on American forces in region, as most European countries do tbh but they can, because America spends so much.
America makes a lot of money off of that the least it could do for every other western country helping to make America the richest country on the planet is try and keep the world a bit more secure.
That depends, do you like your industries being the easiest to access on the planet?
This includes tech companies too by the way, Google, Amazon, Meta, etc.
How about the rest of the western world supporting you so that you can have the world's largest military and because of that being allowed to get away with a number of extremely questionable wars to help fund your military to keep giving your country impunity?
That is true, but it certainly canâ€™t be denied that the US has unfairly interfered in the affairs of governments all over the world in order to satisfy our own security and monetary interests.
