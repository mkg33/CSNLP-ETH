It was batshit crazy thatâ€™s why.
Full of made up phony fantasy problems to goad poor, ignorant people into voting for them while they get their pockets picked.
If the GOP wasn't selling only hate, if they were actually competing fairly for hearts and minds of voters...why would anyone vote for such an incompetent group?
The only time the GOP doesn't fail is in whipping up hate.
They can't even deliver a simple rebuttal to a SOTU, they can't run a state without banning books, trying to collect the menstrual history of high school girls...they are just fucking incompetent.
They tried to have a congressional hearing so they could prove that Twitter colluded with Democrats to censor conservatives...and what happened on day 1?
They revealed that Trump wanted tweets removed.
They are such buffoons.
These people need to be laughed at.
They think they're providing a serious community service and it makes me sad when I see one of these people.
Maybe they'll come to their senses if everyone is pointing and laughing at them.
