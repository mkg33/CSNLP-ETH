You could also look at the terrible turnout and conclude that was due to Trump NOT being on the ballot.
Midterms never have a potus on the ballot, but Trump endorsed candidates lost bigly.
He put his name all over this election and it went bust.
People tire of theatrics and trump's four years he had was largely just that.
He did nothing to bring the nation together as good leaders do, he just set out to divide us over every little thing.
This country will go on forever if we stay united in our common interest, it ends the moment we let divisions supersede that.
United we stand, divided WE WILL FALL.
So what exactly do Republicans want if it isn't the end of this great nation?
Their actions speak louder than words...
All the systems he Said he was going to destroy are still there and functioning as normal.
Hell of a job.
Guess that is why he lost huh?
Trump has sway with a certain voting block sure, but I wouldn't characterize it as charisma.
Are mob bosses charismatic?
Cause trumps mannerisms, posturing, even how he talks is reminiscent of that old mafia style gangster approach.
The midterms spelled out trumps power within the gop base is greatly exaggerated anymore, he has his hard core followers but the middle right, the largest block is skewing away fast.
