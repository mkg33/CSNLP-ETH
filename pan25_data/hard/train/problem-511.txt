Why would Chinese women want to marry?
They will be slaves to both their own parents and their in laws.
Probably even all the grandparents.
With no siblings for generations and men not eager to do any caretaking marriage will just double the amount of expected caretaking if she marries.
My point was why would they want to take on a whole family they are expected to take care of.
Most wouldnâ€™t unless they will be marrying someone with enough money to hire help.
A man couldn't run a farm without a wife and vice versa, simply because it wasn't a one person job.
And it was a shitton of work, way more so than today since most people didn't farm commercially but to supply themselves.
Everything to do with clothes alone was an insane amount of work.
And plowing needed to be done constantly as well.
The idea of the housewife who does nothing but childmind is very, very recent and applied only to a small elite for the majority of the time.
You clearly have no idea what kind of back breaking labour women historically did.
Throughout most of history most people were farmers and women werw busy with hard physical labour there all day, hauling water, milk, firewood, digging, mucking etc.
If you've ever worked on the farm, you'll realize why women cannot persistently do the same kind of hard physical labor as men.
Plowing a field, chopping fire wood, etc.
require immense upper body strenh, and women simply were not equipped to do it.
