He was rich before he word vomited his ‘plan’ for colonizing Mars.
He said he would be launching 100s of ships a year to mars by now, hasn’t launched one starship yet.
Also living on Mars would be hell and all in the service is his ego.
10 years ago he wanted to be the first person living on Mars.
Then he got so rich he decided "why not just rule the Earth?
".
Yep.
I was double guessing myself in this view for a bit but a couple of anecdotes helped solidify it for me.
1) Someone on Reddit commented that a maga relative of theirs liked walker because “at least he’ll do what he’s told” and then 2) I heard on CNN that there was more support for Walker among rural white voters than other groups (including black/brown people).
Then there are multiple instances of Walker at pressers silently nodding and smiling while being a prop for the white politicians speaking for him.
Absolutely just anecdotes but they certainly support and to an extent validate my theory.
Just look at the personalities that have been embraced and the policies they’ve advocated.
Sure, if they were just compassionate and fair they would have broader appeal but the only moves they have are being their.
It may sound cynical but the events of the past 6 or 7 or so years have led me to believe that shitty people don’t know how to do anything other than.
shitty selves and trying to figure out how to make that work (which generally involves lying, manipulation and other shitty things because, well, you know…).
