Utah mails a ballot to every registered voter.
They have since like 2010 or 2012.
Republicans don't mind mail in ballots, they only mind Democrats being able to outvote Republicans.
Itâ€™s an acknowledgment that the policies Republicans support are not received well my a majority of voters.
If they narrow the vote pool, they have a better chance of winning with the groups that reliably vote - older Americans, evangelicals and single issue voters.
Unfortunately they see their goal as getting a win, not getting the largest number of votes from all eligible voters.
Elections in many parts of the U.S. are often very close races, sometimes separated by just a few hundred or a few thousand votes.
Even a small shift in either direction can change the result and Republicans are well aware of that, it's the only reason they keep demanding things that just by coincidence have the effect of preventing people from voting.
Here they thought limiting early voting, mail voting and "harvesting" was their best option, regardless of the consequences for anyone else or the country itself, but that didn't work so now they're scrambling to undo it all because it was only ever about manipulating the election result.
They have no deeply held beliefs or strong opinions about anything, only opportunistic lying, so it's trivial to do a complete 180 and go the other direction because everything they previously said about early voting, mail voting and "harvesting" was a lie.
