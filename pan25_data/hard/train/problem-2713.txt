I have a friend from Bosnia who went back to visit recently.
He told me one evening they were eating dinner at a relative's house and he heard the dull thud of an explosion.
When he looked up to see if anyone else reacted, one of the relatives said "something set off a mine, probably a deer.
Happens often.
".
Sure.
But are you aware that is Russian/Separatist occupied territory.
Ukraine has to fight through it.
The Ukrainian military was not something that could even hope to standing up against Russia in 2014, even with western weapons.
Also the reason Ukraine did so well in the North East on that first big push was Russia had moved most of its actual soldiers to Kherson to be ready for the Ukrainian attack.
Ukraine had to keep enough pressure around Kherson during the NE offensive to avoid russia redeploying the troops from the south.
This unfortunately meant a lot of Ukrainian "attacks" at Kherson that were unlikely to make any real progress, but had to be done anyway knowing their poor odds of success to ensure russia would keep troops in place.
