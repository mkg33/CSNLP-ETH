I paid $410k for medical school until I paid it all off at 43.
And I even went to undergrad on a full ride.
All loans, zero help from parents.
Had some “private loans” from the school at 9%.
And lots of government loans.
People with student loan debt are workers too.
Why complain about college debt forgiveness when there are billions of dollars in handouts to corporations that will never be paid back into the economy?
So only student loan borrowers should get some relief like that and the other 2/3 of Americans who already make less than college educated are just out of luck?
Even if the loan forgiveness is in itself a good thing, I think people really need to acknowledge here that almost no federal student loans were having payments made over the last three years anyway.
There's no material shift in cash flow from loan payments to leisure.
With that said, I have even more in student loans/higher payments than you.
I get that it's helpful and I really hope the forgiveness comes through for people even though I myself won't be eligible for it.
I'm saying people have largely spent money on things other than their student loans and THAT has to change -- forgiveness isn't going to result in leisure spending.
It's silly to think that after people haven't even been paying their student loans for the last three years that suddenly now they are going to spend more on travel and dining out.
Where has that money been going over the last three years then?
People had incredible amounts of savings.
There were no loan payments and ZIRP, evictions were effectively banned, and there was constant stimulus.
