I have seen people say thins, but I have not seen a single major news source back this up.
I have no idea what "benzinga.com" is.
However, until a major US or EU , etc... news source reports on this, I am not believing it.
Given how much coverage twitter is getting, if this is accurate a major news source will check it.
Arbitrarily banning people from Twitter is shitty for sure, but these journalists work at some of the biggest news outlets in the world.
The claim that they are being silenced, their free speech rights violated, or even that it's some kind of national security risk is just bonkers.
Facebook, Mastodon, Medium, YouTube, Instagram, WordPress, Reddit...
There are a plethora of alternatives to Twitter.
And just to be clear, I don't think the US is doing enough to help Ukraine.
But being blocked from using Twitter is not the same as being silenced.
Thats because it is the only social network where Russian officials accounts have not been banned.
There are a lot of pro-war channels there with literally nazi posts, and they dont get moderated by Telegram at all.
Telegram is no better than Musk twitter.
