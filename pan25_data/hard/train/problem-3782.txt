If employers, as you state, are no longer paying for time, then we should go to a piece work standard.
But as long as employees are paid hourly, if you do 8 hours work in 6 hours, you should report back that you are done, then the employer can make an informed decision as to whether or not to assign you more work.
If the opposite were true, if it took 10 hours to do 8 hours work, you’d expect more pay, right?
So in the interest of “equity”, the employer has a right to have you work for 8 hours if that’s how long you are paid for.
In the end the job I'm talking about are folks who get paid for their efforts not just their time.
Because as we all know not everyone puts in the same effort, but instead of finding better ways to ensure the work gets done businesses are pushing to violate privacy to ensure.
I don't think you fully understand.
What does your daily value of pay come to.
We are very used to see the, an hour, method.
However if you think about it for many office folk, especially the ones who do the same level of work a day really your just being paid for your time to do the work.
I can understand the need to keep people from misusing equipment, I can see that companies want to make sure their employees are doin the work.
Yet, you know I hear the story about the worker who could handle a days work in six hours then being called out for the other two becoming more common.
Really as long as the work is done, why does it matter?
Really your not paying for the hours anymore but the assurance the work is done to standard.
So it comes down to control.
These companies just want to maintain control over their employees that they would have in the office they can't have in the home.
They don't need this level of control unless the employee legit gives a reason.
As long as a working quota is met by the effort of the user companies should be content with that.
