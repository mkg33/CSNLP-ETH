You can't do electrical circuits or even make motors with optical.
Digging up and replacing data infrastructure to replace copper with optical would take more effort or cost more than just making it new.
That would mean digging up that copper is cheaper than the copper available on the market.
At that point everyone would be complaining about high cost of living and not being able to afford basic appliances like heat/ac, refrigerators, stoves .etc.
Not to mention electronics such as cellphones and computers.
Take a look at the largest companies each year in our recent history.
Titans crash, and new companies that never existed come to take their place, as more wealth gets created.
It's the consumers who bear the benefits of capitalism with accessibility to goods and having the goods becoming more affordable.
A supply issue would affect the cost of production no matter what economic model you use.
Consumers would have to bear the increased costs, and businesses would have to bear the cost of lower demand which may turn into an existential crisis for the business depending on the business and industry it is in.
Why is it always the consumers who bear the costs of capitalismâ€™s failure to be sustainable, and not the owners, who historically increase their share of the wealth while the rest of us get poorer.
