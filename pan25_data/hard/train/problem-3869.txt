Theoretically, they already have the ability given what they've been able to do with drones on Russian air bases.
Probably the only reason they haven't is that if things go wrong, they could go very wrong, as in bus full of dead kids wrong.
Ukraine would instantly lose a lot of the goodwill they've built up and are counting on to see themselves through this.
There's a chance that even the US would pull back support if citizens in Moscow started becoming collateral damage.
Basically, Ukraine needs to be damn sure about what they're going to target and whether it'd be worth the risk.
But it would be extremely degrading for Russia if they claim it had been Ukraine hitting MOSCOW.
I can understand an oblast like Belgorod, Crimea etc, but MOSCOW?
?
How can they possibly justify with their population the fact that an Ukr drone flew all the way to the capital with no one stopping it?
Their narrative aleays resolve around Ukrainians = lesser beings.
It usually means that the war is lost too.
If you strike the capital, what's left to defend (morale's wise)?
It was not a case that they went straight to Kyiv the first days.
