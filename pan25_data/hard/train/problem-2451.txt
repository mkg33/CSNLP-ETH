Basically this.
Everything was good for Putin / Russia.
EU, and especially Germany, was dependent as fuck on cheap Russian gas, Putin and his Oligarchs became even more wealthy, all while getting invited to the most important political events.
If the moments comes where Ukraine pushes Russia out of their country, he will simple stop sending his forces over the border and just say "Mission accomplished" while never losing a word about this.
And now that we actually getting fucked by Russia because we gave it all up to work with the west, we get no planes, no western tanks, no long range missiles, that would push Russia out of Ukraine, because that would upset Russia.
With all the abandoned Russian gear getting fixed up and being used by the Ukranians maybe Russia should just attack itself a bit to slow down the militarization!
Im with Kuleba on this one, if west took away our Nukes, helped disarm us, its time to give back every non nuclear weapon back so we can drive Russia back.
In the past West allied with Russia and took away Nuclear deterrence from Ukraine under the guise of "secutiry guarantees".
Then under programs like DTRA and many others, made Ukraine destroy majority of our strategic weapons to "improve security situation in the region".
West also influenced and "helped" Ukrane destroy weapon stocks, ammo stocks, rockets, remaining 300+ km missiles, and many more weapons.
You know, for "security".
