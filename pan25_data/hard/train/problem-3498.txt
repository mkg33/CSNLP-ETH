This is by and large wholly true.
Examples being the rigidity of decision making in the Third Reich.
The part about having the heart to see things through is probably the most important aspect.
Underlying lots of "failures" by democracies in war have been a sense of moral ambiguity about the aims and the desire for men to not die needlessly, something the Russians feel they can capitalise on by making the cost of the war too great for public opinion.
Thankfully I don't envisage that happening at all in Ukraine although my sense is things are going to get very messy before it's all over.
Putin thinks he's literally fighting for his life and he probably is making this an all in face off.
Foremost for Ukraine to win is to keep the message about the collective need to defeat Putin uppermost in the minds of everyone in countries supporting the war effort.
If that aspect is achieved the Russians are totally screwed from an ability to fight modern war.
The problem is the Russian soldier can't see that Russia's exclusive and extractive mindset results in the way they act on the battlefield.
That's a Russian tactic, attack so the enemy can't.
There's still an expectation of a somewhat larger Russian offensive, which, once Ukraine beats and causes large numbers of Russian casualties and equipment losses, will then cue a larger Ukrainian counter offensive.
So Russia tried to pull what Ukraine did in the Kharkiv offensive, which is to start a punishing offensive in one section of the country and then secretly launch a second one, taking advantage of all attention and resources being focused on the first one.
