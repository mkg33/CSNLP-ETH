DeSantis was there to lead them into a new Era when they dumped Trump and I think this week showed he probably could have pulled off a hell of rally in trumps absence.
Thankfully for Democrats they were too devoted to the orange lord to take the easy route.
They fought for this outcome and I'm glad they get to savor the fruits of their labor as they choke on the lost opportunity to take both houses.
Maybe moving forward they can must a tiny modicum of respect for democracy.
They could have been honest at the impeachments, they could have had a bipartisan investigation, they could have not obstructed the Jan 6 investigation in every way conceivable and several ways previously unconceivable.
They could have accepted the election rather than campaigning for 2 years to dismantle or otherwise cripple dmeocracy as we know it.
They had their chance to put him down with the big lie election fraud.
They could have all stood with Raffensperger.
They had their chance with Jan 6.
They were given chance after chance.
You're right - they had the chance, and they flinched.
And they're likely to do the same this time, too, because Trump still controls enough of the loyalty of their voters and will not go away quietly.
