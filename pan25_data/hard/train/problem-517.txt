Jeffries is a supporter of M4A which the progressives never "force the vote" on because it would get crushed and set them back a decade, but sure the progressive caucus guy who got every vote from the squad only got it because there's obviously a difference between debating policy and the speaker vote.
Jeffries got every Dem vote in every round of voting, so what “major inroads” does he need to make with progressives when even the squad fell in line?
Well I wish there was a better metric for progressives in the house that doesn't include 50% of dems... but unfortunately the CPC is the furthest left caucus and they let basically anyone who wants to join in.
I’m not saying he’d be a bad President but he would definitely face a primary from the left which could hurt him a lot (ex.
Clinton and Sanders).
He’ll run into the same issues Biden and Clinton did once his actual policies and voting record come to light.
The progressive voter base and the progressive wing of congress (the Congressional Progressive Caucus).
