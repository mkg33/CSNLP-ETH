"I'm not in favor of abolishing the government.
I just want to shrink it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.
".
I get it.
I’m afraid of lingering problems from covid too.
But I’m under no illusions about post covid symptoms being caused by the vaccine not covid itself.
People need to remember what 2020 was like.
I know people who still have fatigue and brain fog from that period.
Covid is a nasty virus, and it isn’t done with us.
We’ve all just trying to live.. the science will catch up, but maybe not in time for us.
It’s been like this for all humans across all times and places.
I haven’t even told her about the roofer I talked to last month who blathered on and on about the PLANdemic when I asked him about the availability of roofing supplies so he could patch the roof.
Here’s the plan: Long covid is messing people up, but it’s super inconvenient to acknowledge that a sizable portion of the population can be crippled for a short time or a long time by an air borne disease and that there’s not much we can do about it.
That’s scary.
But if you tell people all of their lingering symptoms are from the vaccine, not from illness, then people have someone to demonize (“big pharma”, Fauci, liberals, whatever).
That energy can be turned into political gain for DeSantis.
He’s done it before.
Oh but it is not just him.
And it is not just advice.
His choice for FL Surgeon General is a total quack MD, raging against masks & vaccines.
The person responsible for medical oversight in the state!
Legally he has taken direct action as well- preventing nursing homes for restricting visitation during the height of covid.
Actively firing school officials that enacted masking protocols.
He has been willing & successful to enact legal punitive damage to those that go against him, and his base just eats it up.
he is the closest we have ever seen to fascism, and no one seems to care.
