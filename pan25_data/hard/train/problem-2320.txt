And they lost control of multiple statehouses and governments in swing states, potentially killing one of their backup plans to install a dictator.
And they can't stuff the judiciary with lifetime appointments of nutcases which was their bulwalk against losing their asses as soon as Gen Z started voting.
2 more years of D judges, losing absolute control over multiple swing states, inability to stop anything Democrats did from 2020-2022, inability to block Biden Executive Orders.
Trump's reputation in shambles.
Because of the filibuster, this is barely better for them than a D trifecta.
Nationally, they've lost power.
They can't even run Trump in 2024 anymore!
What could they have stopped had they won both chambers of Congress that they can't now?
Biden would have and will be governing largely by executive order regardless of whether Dems retained the Senate, because of the House flipping red.
We'll see if that sticks.
I don't think it will.
Personally I hope he tears that whole party apart with a diaper baby tantrum.
They're very likely winning the House and therefore stalling any Democratic legislation for 2 years at minimum (and looking at the 2024 Senate map, 4 years at minimum).
No, they didn't win what they expected to, but let's not act like this was a total loss for them.
