He isn’t running for President because he’s trying to avoid jail.
There are easier and cheaper ways of getting that done.
He could grease a few palms and have his whole Mar-a-lago looney bin made a legal voting booth.
And you can’t arrest someone while they are in a voting booth.
You think this isn’t possible?
People thought it wasn’t possible that he’d be the president either.
My faith was lost before Trump.
When nothing happened after Sandy Hook, I knew the game was up.
It’s broken.
Let the thing die.
It’s obviously terminally ill.
He’s running for office because he likes the prestige and power.
He learned that, even during a global pandemic, he really didn’t have to work that hard.
He met a ton of other rich and influential people.
And he got to serve a sports team about 1,000 Big Macs (Filet o Fish for the observant.
).
This is the answer.
DJT, learned that the parth to the white house is paved in gold for the unscrupulous, and he loved it.
His current bid to rejoin the gravy train is a marketing study.
He did not expect to win in 2016, but raked in coin, he did expect to lose, but had a plan for that, in 2020, and, raked in coin.
Never in modern politics have we had a political party thats only desire was the possible graft, and, absolutely no plan to actually govern.
The complete lack of preparedness to take the reins of power by DJT, the lack of a cabinet, the mass confusion of 2017, can never happen to this country again.
Sure he wants to stay out of jail, but the possible grift in to lucrative to ignore.
