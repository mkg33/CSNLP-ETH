The olympics are meant to unite countries under one idea, sports competition, something much more trivial than the nuclear arms race or whatever else might be happening in this specific point in time.
It's the west's decision here to make Russia a pariah state in this regard, it's for the west to decide that this particular invasion is the single worst thing to happen since WW2 and is worthy of banning athletes from competing at all.
Crippling Russia's economy to hinder their invasion is a good thing.
They're attacking their neighbor unprovoked, make up a bunch of lies, peddle into genocidal rhetoric on state TV, their government is full of corrupt prideful assholes.
I do not care that athletes support the war or that they're neo nazis, unless they use the olympics as a platform to spread their message, in which case they should be sanctioned, they can think the holocaust was a good thing in private, for all I care.
During the doping scandal, I think the IOC handled the situation correctly.
They let the clean russian athletes compete, but not under the banner their country, who broke the trust of the international community in the olympics.
What the fuck does that have to do with Russia and being part of the olympics for time and time again cheating and now they are committing murderous genocide of another nation.
Which includes much rape just to be clear.
