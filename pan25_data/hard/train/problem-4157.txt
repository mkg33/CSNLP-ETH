There is no way to complete eviscerate fascism, because they share the same roots: liberalism (not economic liberalism, reaganism, tatcherism, etc, but the cultural and societal one).

Before anyone call me a right-wing nut, I could not be happier from seeing Bolsonaro leaving the country as the loser he is.

But it's easier to just downvote and pretend the left is never wrong, even when actively supporting dictators.
