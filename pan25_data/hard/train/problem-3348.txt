That is not the case in the West mate.
That is being caused by excessive corporate greed and stagnant wages.
Overpopulation in Subsaharan Africa is not raising my expenses.
Yeah I know.
I have an income that is much above minimum wage, and even I am struggling to find houses I can afford.
I legitimately cannot fathom how people on minimum wage get by, it needs to go up.
Because that is the only known solution?
As far as we know, a society as large as a modern country needs to have a certain number of working people to support each retiree.
The unfortunate truth is that all modern medicine does is keep you alive, not keep you healthy and working age longer.
So we have an ever increasing rate of retirees and elderly who can not work, so we need.more workers.
Iâ€™m not qualified to answer that but I would guess that as a country becomes increasingly aged in its population, it would put a greater strain on health services and reduce the capacity of the non-retired workforce.
If you want to retire with something akin to good care, then sharply declining populations are a very bad thing.
No, that isn't to care for retirees, that is also to replace them and sustain the economy.
If your pop growth falls below 2.1 per woman, and you can't make up the difference through immigration, you actually lose participants in the economy, and you will be in dire straits in a few decades when society literally doesn't have enough workers.
