I never understood how these election deniers thought they had a winning argument.
Let's think about this logic for a moment.... Joe Biden won Arizona in 2020 because more people voted for him.
The Republicans threw a hissy fit, lied about fraud, and tried to invalidate votes/overthrow the government.
So.... Kari Lake thought ANY of those voters were going to forget that and vote for her?
If I lived in Arizona and had voted for Biden, how could I possibly accept a governor who won't accept my vote?
You're absolutely right.
The thing is.... Biden voters (made up of democrats, republicans, and independents) didn't take kindly to the Republican party attempting to negate their vote, thus motivating them to get out and vote in the midterms (where turnouts are typically lower).
Contrast that with a hypothetical where a "sane" Republican who respects election results runs third party and who garners that hypothetical "at least 1%" of the vote.
I'm saying that Cheney running against Donald Trump in 2024 WOULD ABSOLUTELY HURT THE DEMOCRAT'S CHANCES - that it would be a bad thing for Democrats.
>This is also why people are mistaken to believe that Cheney running against Donald Trump in 2024 would hurt the Democrat's chances.
This is also why people are mistaken to believe that Cheney running against Donald Trump in 2024 would hurt the Democrat's chances -- it's complete self-denial to believe that the sort of voter that is highly likely to pick Liz Cheney on a ballot would have otherwise been inclined to vote for a Democrat.
The media environment has made most of these voters unreachable, and it's a far more efficient strategy to toss them a bone so they can vote their conscience and at the same time, not do damage by doing so.
