In the French Revolution, an unarmed populace stormed the Bastille.
The reason for that was not because they wanted to storm a fortified position and die in front of the building.
It is because they had weapons in the Bastille.
Weapons they could use to fight the French Army.
So I don’t know where this “adequate weaponry doesn’t help win wars.” Bullshit comes from.
It just means lots of the rebelling citizens have to die using improvised weaponry vs military weaponry or die in the attempt to acquire military weaponry.
Yes, shifty people use military weapons to commit atrocities in America, but the fact we have a 2nd amendment means that our government does have to appease the general population.
A great modern example is the draft in Russia.
The only option they had is to flee if they do not want to die in Bahkmut.If they had a right to bear arms the Russian military would have to be fighting insurrection at home in addition to fighting the actual war in Ukraine.
Your example is already accounted for.
This is why you need to do your research you would know that anti-war protestors are way more than “some kids that died at a uni” .
You do know that the US army shot college aged anti-war protesters on a college campus right?
It’s happened on US soil before.
May 4, 1970, Kent State University.
4 students were killed and 9 critically wounded.
If the military can get restless and start shooting college kids protesting the Vietnam war, it could definitely happen during a religious protest.
If you don’t have arms, and the government just kills people, support just grows and grows for the protesters, who are so clearly, even if you don’t agree with some parts of their politics, not deserving death.
Support for the government withers and withers, until it collapses.
