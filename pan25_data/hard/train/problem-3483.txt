Children are repeatedly punched in the stomach as punishment if they try to take food from the restaurants etc where they are trafficked and enslaved.
They are strictly rationed a diet of beans and lettuce, and sometimes only consume lemon juice for days as punishment.
They beat them and starve them and deprive them of sleep all while forcing them to work without pay for years and years and years with no holidays or breaks.
So again we see that their status as a hate group is related to the fact that they are bigots and they hate people, not because of their supposed "advocacy" for black people.
Note how the Southern Poverty Law Center considers them a hate group because of the fact that they promote hate, not because for their so-called "advocacy for the Black man".
NOI is considered a hate group because they advocate for “the Black man” specifically.
They want a separate blacks only nation and a separate whites only nation.
They’ve actually talked with neo nazis about their common goals.
