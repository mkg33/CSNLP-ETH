Yes this is what they’ve been working towards for the past couple of decades at least.
This shit is the shit that I heard them talking about as a good thing at the church I grew up in.
That all said, there are more than just a few that feel the same way I do at my church.
I felt I was the only one at first and it made me feel like an enemy at my own church and treat them that way until I took the time to really dig deep and be vulnerable about the issues with trump/maga stuff.
It’s hard to see past the crazy beliefs of maga and see the human behind those beliefs, but it is necessary to restore them.
I am a Christian and I denounce nationalism and any other form of hatred against other humans.
I fight this fight with love every day and on Sunday at church.
There are many in my church that support trump as if it is in line with their Christian belief, that you have to support him.
It is extremely odd at best and more likely very dangerous at worst.
I am making progress on some though, and helping them to see the error in their ways.
It might just be my experience, but I find empathy and focus on forgiveness and restoration is the best way to get their heads out of their ass.
