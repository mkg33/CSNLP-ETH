I disagree here.
These are Republican congresspeople from Republican areas.
If they get removed they’re going to be replaced with more Republican congresspeople.
There isn’t any situation where the entirety of congress flips Democrat.
I mean… yeah.
That’s what makes it so special.
They knew there would be backlash and they voted for it anyways.
This was so important that Rs were willing to cross the line for it to happen.
That’s pretty damn bipartisan, at least in this day and age.
Since enough people on both sides of the aisle voted in favor, this makes it a bipartisan achievement.
Bipartisan: any political act in which both of the two major political parties agree about all or many parts of a political choice.
There is no bipartisanship.
There are a handful of Republicans - tops - willing to suffer some backlash from their party as a whole, in order to hold their seats in Congress.
That's it.
And we shouldn't be seeking bipartisanship.
The Republican party continues to reject the concept of compromise.
The White House needs to drop this and focus on getting shit done despite the Republicans, while highlighting Republican obstruction at every opportunity.
