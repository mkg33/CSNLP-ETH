Edit: And here you are defending riots when you can condemn the riots but stand up for the protests.
I live in Minneapolis I know people were there for the right reasons but I know a fuck ton of people were there for the wrong ones.
The BLM protests weren’t all bad, but when you can’t even condemn people stealing shit and lighting fires how can you expect the other side to behave any differently.
And people should condemn when people are burning down cities yet people supported them.
Political tribalism at its finest all around, rules for thee not for me.
Lol oh yeah, should’ve been more precise.
No cites actually burned down sorry didn’t think I needed to make that distinction thought that would be pretty obvious.
$500 million in damages to my local community with only 20% of the local businesses hit coming back smoke seen from over 20 miles away.
No, I know what I’m saying, you just want to argue semantics like it’s clever.
Damn you got me, only 500 million in damages in Minneapolis alone, and only 20% of the local businesses combing back in the black community where the riots happened.
My bad.
sorry, there is plenty that makes him a bad person.
i think people give him far too much benefit of the doubt as being a clueless dope whereas i see it more as blind, faux-cowboy arrogance.
