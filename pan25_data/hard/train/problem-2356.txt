I myself got vaccinated last time on 2021 December and recently at the start of October got sick along with my Grandma and Mum.
Thankfully only 2 days at the start of getting sick had any big symptoms, like higher temperature, body pains, coughs.
After those days only a cough remains and nothing else.
COVID vaccines do wear out over time, but even then, their main purpose is to make getting sick much less lethal.
Also, over 95% of the population is vaccinated so many of those who catch COVID generally have less severe symptoms.
When I got it I just had a slight headache and a runny nose.
Last I heard it was Omicron.
A quick google search suggests that XBB is a subvariant of Omicron.
Omicron is statistically far less severe than the Delta strain and I recall reading a study that suggests its no worse than the common flu in terms of symptoms and the only thing it really has over the flu is that it spreads far more easily which, inevitably, results in far more people actually getting sick.
We stopped caring.
The current strain seems to be no worse than the common flu.
It's not even a requirement to isolate if you're COVID positive now.
