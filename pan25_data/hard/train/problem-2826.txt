Don't get me wrong, he sounds like a stand-up guy, but listening to your constituents(all of them, not just the ones who like you) and working to advocate for their interests should be the baseline standard for any elected representative.
He's probably too progressive (for Texas) to run for Senate, and he's older, but he seems focused on helping other candidates and at least agitating for better legislation and not higher office.
He's got a real Fetterman vibe -- he was just a small business owner until Trump was elected, and he saw that twerp divide up his social circle, demonize good people, and generally fracture things and felt he couldn't stand helpless and wanted to do something.
I'd vote for that guy for any damn office he wants.
Down to earth, charming, and he's not hanging out with us in February of non election years to pander for jack shit.
He wants to know how we're doing, what worries us, what he can try to do to make things better.
He's not pushing for votes (the GOP shoved him into a new deep blue district because his first election he won in a real red district).
He's literally just there to learn about queer lives and take our concerns back to the Leg.
Not that it does shit in Texas.
There's a state rep here in Texas that makes a point of coming to LGBTQ events all year round, not just marching in Pride.
He's cis and straight, but he's there at least half of our meet ups and friendly,approachable, and talkative.
