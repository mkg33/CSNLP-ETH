What we came across in Ukraine that day was obviously unplanned.
The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered.
None of us knew how to react or how to feel.
I should have never ordered that special military operation.
I should have pull the tanks out and stopped what we were going through.
There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't.
And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.
I want to apologise to the international community.
I want to apologise to anyone who has seen the video.
I want to apologise to anyone who has been affected or touched by the special military operation, or washing machine theft, or mobilization.
But most importantly I want to apologise to Zelensky and his family.
I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven.
I’m simply here to apologise.
>We're sorry.
