Now, there's concern on other areas of things as far as Presidential Electors go, but there's no indication that's going to be in question at all here (and the Court has recently declined to hear attempts to push the ISL theory in that area, so no reason why they would want to when they didn't before).
I don't know if you listened to the actual oral arguments, but the fine details of Moore's argument is that the state judges overstepped their power by blocking the state legislature, while arguing that the legislature has the prime authority at the state level.
He actually punts the ultimately authority up to the federal level, as grounds for why it's being heard by scotus, by saying that that this is a federal issue and matter.
So, it's not an argument to lessen the judiciary out right (i.e.
federal) but to challenge the power of the judges, and other governing entities (governors and constitution), at the state level.
Technically speaking, it already has that power, specifically in areas where the Federal Constitution conflicts with that of the state.
So like, if a state constiution says Slavery is legal, well, nope, 13th Amendment supersedes that, etc.
Wouldnâ€™t this also be saying the SCOTUS would have the power to override state constitutions?
If that is the case the SCOTUS would become the super Supreme Court for all 50 states.
