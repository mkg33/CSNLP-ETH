Ukraine captured enough equipment for russia to become one of the top "military support providers", so obviously russia would capture some of theirs.
You realize these types of weapons are regularly used directly by troops on the front line, so it's highly likely some would be captured, just like we see a lot of Russian stuff being captured by Ukrainians.
Javelin (although not exactly new either) or NLAW might be more interesting, but more for trying to find a way to defeat/confuse the system, than reverse engineering.
Iran already does have their own MANPADS system comparable to Stinger for some time... which is based on Russian IGLA.
I would expect all of these to be generally comparable.
Stinger is 40+ year old system at this point, although it got various upgrades, it's not really anything that has any significant value for country like Iran, it's well understood system at this point.
Afghanistan and Ukraine are not remotely comparable, that's why plenty of people support this, even though they opposed Afghanistan.
Escalate?
Same inspectors that said they confirmed whole process is transparent and found no issues?
