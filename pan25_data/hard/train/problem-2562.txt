Let me play devils advocate here... assassinating a former head of state isn't exactly an attack on the state and wouldn't necessarily invoke Article 5.
Other NATO members would have to determine whether the killing of one private citizen would justify the thousands, perhaps millions, of lives it would cost to respond with a declaration of war.
And that's assuming that Russia botches the assassination by failing to make it look like someone else is responsible... which is on par for Russia.
Now, Russia could launch artillery, missiles, bombs, paratrooper terrorists...voting would not be safe.
When the US held those elections it was winning the war.
Voters were safe in every Union state.
Confederate states did not participate.
The election is in 2024.
Russia is running out of missiles.
I think by then we'll hopefully see the war's end, and subsequently an election.
If not it may not be logistically possible to hold one.
If Putin starts strategically blowing up counting facilities and people's ballots by the thousands, what then?
