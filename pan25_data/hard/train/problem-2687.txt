Ukraine has been nowhere near joining to NATO even if it wants to, meanwhile Russia is not attacking former Soviet Republics and Warsaw Pact countries which HAVE joined NATO showing why it made sense to join in the first place.
Russia does not get to decide what other countries do.
I agree with you that Russia cannot and should not decide what other countries do, but Ukraine not joining nato is just false on so many accounts.
And according to US'S own Monroe doctrine Russia views nato expansion to Ukraine as an existential threat to them.
And yet Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 despite the fact that Ukraine had made no attempts to join NATO.
Can you people just stop with the "NATO expansion caused the war" bullshit already.
Russia knows that NATO is never going to invade them, it's a fake argument used to hide what the war really is, an attempted land grab.
How can you be so sure that nato will never invade Russia.
Nato is controlled by the US and every politician desperately wants regime change in Russia.
As they did in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and Venezuela etc etc.
Not because they are being held under tyrannical dictatorships as you are told by the msm but because these are resource rich countries.
Back in 2006 putin made it clear to Bush after his speech and pursuance of Ukraine to join nato that if this carries on he will take back Crimea.
And that's what he did, the west has a hard on for regime change in Russia not because of putin, but because of the resources Russia has right now.
It's the motherload and the final frontier for the US.
Doesn't matter if it's getting its ass kicked or not, 100k Ukrainians already died according to Ursula.
Merkel said in 2013 if nato expands to Ukraine it will be seen as declaration of war by putin.
So it means they knew the eventuality of it all and still pursued disastrous policies at the expense of innocent Ukrainian lives.
I'd rather have keep Ukrainians and the bears alive, but that's just sane old me.
