Soooo nobody would buy it thenâ€¦ think about being an Exxon exec.
You could buy from two different location for the same price but one of them is going to support an enemy of the state and probably cost more in shipping.
This is a ridiculous concept.
As such, it's not a ridiculous concept, it's the way business is done.
And will be done, again, unless governments intervene to ban them from doing so.
Why do you think all the regulations on business currently even exist?
Not just oil, other aspects of business like dumping of chemicals or labor laws, that sort of thing.
Because businesses would and even currently do the Bad Things(tm), because better profits.
Such would be the case here.
I Wonder how other producers feel about this?
I mean, the US is part of that, and it would be exceedingly stupid to pass up that kind of deal if you're ExxonMobil or something, eh?
Just business, after all... .
Business is business.
Emotions, family, friends, even self in some cases are irrelevant when it comes to business.
