In the case of the first Iraq war, NATO itself wasn't directly involved but the command structure of Allied Command Europe was leading the coaltion that invaded Iraq.
In the Korean war it was the same command structure doing the leading.
NATO always plays a large but indirect role in wars of major non NATO allies.
I'm not an expert and can be wrong here, but I think the close, non-NATO ally designation is a USA thing, not a NATO thing.
ie when South Korea or Kuwait was attacked, NATO didn't get involved but the USA did, since it was a close non nato ally to the USA.
In the case of the Korean War that technically was a UN-sanctioned intervention into the war led by the US while the Gulf War was a coalition that included a lot of NATO allies, but also a bunch of non-NATO US allies and wasnâ€™t a NATO operation utilizing NATO command structures.
NATO proper has only ever been involved in comparatively minor anti-terrorist operations in the Mediterranean in response to the 9/11 attacks, though most NATO nations did join the US in its wars against Afghanistan and Iraq they were not required to (Belgium for example only joined the Afghanistan war not the Iraq War) and those that did, did so under different coalition groups such as the MNF-I.
