I feel those that have been free are more willing to fight, but if your gonna die either way in a war for the future of your own country to be free from Putin.
There is no running and hiding worth waiting for and the world will be behind of the people revolting against Putin.
Putin would need to give up something, more than just going into hiding.
Perhaps money, probably help in reshaping the Kremlin, possibly expanded constitutional constraints for future Russian Presidents... then this could be seen as a win-win.
Putin would be required to pull out all the stops to do make this work.
This would be possible, and similar things have been done in the past, but they are usually hugely difficult to convince everyone that it's a good idea.
Doing them in private (secret negotiations) are the only way that this can be managed politically, and the fallout tends to be huge.
E.g.
President Ford and Nixon.
There simply are not many examples of this being successful in history because of the political fallout.
You can see this with crime bosses and sometimes in negotiated peace deals, but a deal also demands something from the one surrendering.
I see this as a distinct possibility.
If we could stop regarding Putin as obstinate, and negotiate a way out for him (negotiate hard), then we would all benefit: expecially the Russian people.
If those talks are being hard AFTER Russian troops return to Russia, that’s bout “negotiations” anymore.
That’s just the loser begging their new overlords.
That’s never gonna happen.
That is wholly nonsensical.
If that’s your steering point, then just say you’re not negotiating.
That’s the part that is stupid.
This is one of the dumbest things I’ve read.
And I can’t believe something this dumb comes from the US.
If that’s what gonna say you might as well not say anything at all.
