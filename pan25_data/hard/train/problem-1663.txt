My friend is a public school teacher.
She has to suppliment her income with food delivery.
She also has to use a stupid amount of her OWN money to get supplies for her kids that the state won't pay for.
She can't even leave her work at the school.
When she's not working, she's preparing to work.
45k per year and 60 hour workweeks is what her Masters degree (that she's still paying off) bought her.
But really, the argument is more that regardless of being able to get by on $45,000, she works much harder for her 45k than I do for a significantly higher amount and no Masters degree.
She should be making at least as much as I do, more probably since I'm posting on reddit instead of working right now.
It really depends on where you live and how you live.
In the past years in the city I live in, it has become pretty difficult to find a place to live that is under about $1500 per month.
Add to that the fact that nearly all landlords require you make 3 times the rent and things get tricky.
3x the rent at 1500 per month would actually require $54,000 a year just for them to accept you as a tenant.
Rent goes up 10% a year, so unless you shop around and move, that $1200 is now $1300-$1400 next year.
Otherwise, you can probably move your stuff for a few hundred a year and your time.
Let's just say that you can save that same amount every year, even though inflation is going up higher than your wages are.
$2400/yr savings because life has gone perfectly for you and you have had ZERO unexpected expenses.
After 10 years you would have saved $24,000, which seems great... but now your minimum down payment is $51,000 because housing costs have gone up.
Shit... well okay save for 10 more years... and assume we have doubled our savings capacity somehow in those second 10 years.
We can now save $4800/year.
We have $24k + $48K - we have saved EVERY DIME and have had not had children, no emergency fund, no savings, no 401K, NOTHING.
We have saved $72K - awesome.
Well, now housing has gone up 10% every year, so the minimum down payment is now $134K.
womp womp.
After 20 years of saving EVERY LAST PENNY, you went from $20K away from a down payment to $62K away from a down payment.
what model car if you don't mind?
what does it cost today?
saying you bought a 19K car 6 years ago is a lot like saying you bought a $200k house 6 years ago.
it doesn't really provide much to the conversation considering that I could not go buy that same car for that same price today.
