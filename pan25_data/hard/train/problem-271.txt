Since reproductive freedom was protected by voters in MT, KS, and KY, Republican senators from those states should vote in favor of federal legislation, but I know they won't.
They're so out of touch with their own constituencies.
If conservatives were smart, they would come to the table and negotiate this issue in good faith.
The GOP tried to reinstitute a total ban in MI, and what they now ended up with is probably the most liberal law in the country.
Have Manchin and Sinema both said they won't vote for it?
Can legislation be passed in the House before a possible Republican majority takeover?

Put it to a vote Especially while people are paying attention.
I think we are moving beyond debating our loved ones on the interwebs and actually paying attention to what is going on and its encouraging people to vote.
We need to keep this momentum up and really put the GOP on the defensive.
We want to know who to vote out next.
We no longer want to be stripped of our rights.
