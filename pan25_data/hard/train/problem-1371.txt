Oh just to be clear, the bible also doesn't really say these things.
Or it contradicts itself if it does talk about sexuality.
To them, being gay or trans is inherently sexual.
They see it as a fetish.
They see it as perversion.
And so showing that “fetish” or “perversion” to kids (or even worse to them, implying that kids have that “fetish” or “perversion”) is vile.
And now we're being forced to defend that explicit sexual content as school-appropriate (it's not), because it touches on LGBT+ themes.
I mean, is your argument that Gender Queer is being targeted unfairly because it's LGBTQ+, or is your argument that American schools needs to loosen up and carry more books with visual depictions of sex and blowjobs?
The book at the center of this latest GOP fight, Gender Queer, is not child pornography, but it's also not something that would have ever been acceptable in the library when I was in school.
And when it comes to books about people discovering their sexuality, sex is going to come up, the broader point is THAT'S OK.
