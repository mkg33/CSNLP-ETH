Just because he wouldn't give back regions that they already took doesn't mean that he would attack Ukraine if he was in power.
If Russia was strong enough they would not have to use military power to subjugate Ukraine - they used military power because they are weak.
If Navalny make them strong enough their influence on neighbours will be much stronger.
It would be for sure beneficial for France or Germany but not for Finland, Baltics, Poland or Ukraine.
As for everything else he ever said, he was as pro Europe as you can possibly get in context of Russia.
What an asshole he is to be at least somewhat careful with his words while being in prison of the bloodiest regime of 21st century, right?
And that crimean quote from almost ten years ago, i say, good job, you.
Things change, it would be a political suicide to just say "give it back" at that time.
And to add up: it would not be a problem if he succeeded because if he would, there would be no crimean annexation in the first place.
It all changed once propaganda machine got stronger, but all that it shows is that opinions can transform quite fast, and it all comes to agenda that is being pushed and it has nothing to do with "historically evil country" or whatever nonsense being pushed today.
