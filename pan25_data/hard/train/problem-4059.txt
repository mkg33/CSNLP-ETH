You’d have to be crazy to not consider a few plausible options, Luke Russian rigging some kind of dirty bomb that would be explained away as ‘Ukraine was planning to detonate it in Moscow and it went early’ to blowing the dam, or simply allowing Ukraine to take it and then trying to flatten it with every piece of artillery they have.
Thankfully, Ukraine seem to have decent intelligence and arn’t just sailing in there.
Ukraine has the best intelligence.
USA itself helping with intelligence is amazing but I bet other western countries like France, Germany, and the UK are helping too.
Remember when Moscow called Ukraine terrorists for blowing up the Crimean bridge?
After they have been murdering and raping thousands of people in Ukraine they call Ukraine terrorists for attacking a legitimate war target.
If this war has taught me anything, it's that Moscow is a piece of that will say anything and everything, if it means gaining an advantage against its enemies.
No matter how false or ridiculous it may be.
It’s not even just unreliable, it’s always a lie.
They’re not even good at misinformation - they always lie.
Back to back we heard intelligence reports their special forces were digging in and placing traps, then Russia says ‘oh no, no, no, we’re leaving, honest!’.
Russia: "Let's say on TV that we're retreating when we're actually not - that'll convince Ukraine to just waltz on in without expecting a fight, then we crush them!
".
Ukraine: watches TV broadcast; compares it with their intelligence "Heh.
Yeah, nah" goes back to slowly advancing.
