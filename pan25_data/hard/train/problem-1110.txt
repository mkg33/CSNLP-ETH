Ever played Empire: Total War?
Playing a campaign as Sweden has similar AI events, but perhaps a closer comparison to modern Russia.
Russia notices you have Ingria.
Being a vital port region, those fuckers want it.
They demand you give it to them.
Reject shitty offer.
Steadily kick their asses while fighting off simultaneous unprovoked wars with Denmark, Courland, and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (it's must have been hard to be Swedish in the 18th century, everyone hates you).
Russia eventually offers a peace treaty out of desperation, even giving up their demands for Ingria... for now.
Well if Russias demands are met, what makes you think they wouldnâ€™t send soldiers over to denazify other countries and then again ask them to end the suffering by meeting their demands?
Yeah, Russia could promise they wouldn't invade a now weaker Ukraine again (which, as part of any deal, wouldn't be allowed to join NATO) and take those regions, but given that they made a similar promise less than 30 years ago that they've already broken, why would anyone believe them?
The people of Kherson are demanding that the Russian military be fought until it is no longer on any land recognized as Ukrainian by the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, and it has been defanged as a threat to Ukraine.
