They are flying really high and are actually hard to detect unless you specifically look for them.
Just notice the news about other spy balloons spotted after this became an international news.
Plus having a balloon shot down is going to be less of an international incident than a spy plane with an actual pilot.
Then on top of all of that it is way cheaper to float a bunch of equipment on a balloon than it is to shoot it into space or mount it onto a spy plane.
A balloon is going to be able to spend way longer loitering over the target and it will be getting far higher detailed imagery because its way closer to the target.
This balloon was performing reconnaissance within Canadian and American airspace, and it is part of a larger pattern.
China did this at a time when they were claiming to be invested in normalizing political relations with the US.
They're deploying these balloons to other countries too.
Balloons have capabilities those other platforms do not possess.
That is why they are using them.
I agree that TikTok needs to go as well, but just because you have two problems doesn’t mean you shouldn’t solve one.
