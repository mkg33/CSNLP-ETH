Keep in mind that the GOP doesn't need a popular majority, or a majority of states.
They just need majorities in the right kind of places.
During the 2020 election, Biden got millions more votes than Trump, but a lot of those are "wasted" votes.
Trump got more votes in 2020 than any other previous GOP candidate.
And the "popular vote" for the US House this midterm was won by the GOP.
So they could get enough national support to win, it just depends on how many Dems decide to turn out too or stay home.
It's counting each individual vote that was cast and tallying them, it's the same logic Dems use to say Biden won the popular vote in 2020.
If the majority of the primary voters pick someone else (and the candidates don't repeat '16 and all run and split the vote) he won't get a choice in the matter.
Splitting the vote was precisely what I was thinking he might do, but by running third party if he doesn't have the backing of the establishment.
That alone would be the end of republicans' chances in '24.
There are a number of other ways he can sabotage republicans though.
For example, if he loses a republican primary, he could spread conspiracy theories and lies about the primary being rigged, which would further divide the republican base and discourage turnout.
