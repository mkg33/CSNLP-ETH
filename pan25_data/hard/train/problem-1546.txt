American here.
They could have gone very wrong ordering the F/A-18.
The Super Hornet is good, but even the US Navy acknowledges the Super Hornet is a mature airframe with a limited future.
Whatever India orders needs to be capable of accepting upgrades and remaining viable for decades in the future.
That immediately rules out the Super Hornet.
They are talking about the Super Hornet, not the original A-D models.
Super Hornets are pretty advanced.
2000's tech, not 80's.
Very much comparable to the Rafale.
Rafale is the next best thing.
Great radar, great performance, wonâ€™t get remotely bricked if the US wants to suction your country.
Not only it is a better plane, the French are not strickles about technology transfer.
The F-35 is a mess when it comes to that.
They new bloc-4 update will be what F-35 was supposed to be from the get, but some countries might not even have access to the full arsenal/tech, even after paying through the noise.
It's receiving a lot of care and upgrades whereas the F-18, in between the F-35 (the block 4 may even require new engine..) and the NGAD which the Navy will benefit from is not really a priority anymore, far from it.
The Rafale is the most modern French aircraft seeing that their 'SCAF' is in a political deadlock with Germany and other European countries.
