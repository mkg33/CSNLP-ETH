I haven't kept up with recent events, but as I recall, the Roman Catholic Church, in the catechism, defines homosexuality as being "intrinsically disordered" and forbids gay people from receiving communion (as though such a prohibition could ever be enforced...).
The church's position that homosexuality is sinful doesn't mean the church has to condone people being hateful towards homosexuals or cannot speak out against laws that criminalize it and enable mistreatment of people.
I don't recall ever saying that believing that homosexual acts being sinful and wanting people to be welcoming and kind to homosexuals were "inherently contradictory positions".
The attitude that “sinners” should still receive mercy and love is better than the alternative, but as long as homosexuality is considered a sin, it’s still condemning homosexuality and giving bigots ammunition and justification for their hatred.
Mercy towards sinners is better than hatred, BUT as long as the Church deems homosexuality to be sinful they are loading the gun aimed towards LGBTQ+ by giving ammunition to the haters.
It is still saying that homosexuality is wrong.
Instead of denouncing anti-gay laws, stop professing the backwards beliefs that leaders use to prop up the laws.
As long as you all continue to say being gay is wrong, zealots in power will continue to legislate against it.
