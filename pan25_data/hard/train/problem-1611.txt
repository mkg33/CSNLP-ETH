This is more matter of: you own a company, and on first of January you decide that this item which usually cost 6 HRK (old croatian currency or \ euro 80 cents) will now cost 1 euro, with sole reason being that you think you can make more money because people will be less likely to notice it due to getting used to a new currency.
So yeah, Croatian government probably could do more to prepare/enforce laws to prevent price gauging, but in practice that's not so easy.
In the past year I think everyone experienced some pretty egregious price gouging and I haven't really seen an effective government intervention anywhere in the world.
Well considering your exchange rate with Euro is fixed months ago, there's zero reason prices should go up other than retailers using customer confusion to rip them off as much as they can.
That said, shit like this happened in pretty much all countries that switched to Euro to various extent though, in some countries it was worse than others.
I did a little googling and I found from 2005 (3 years after the country converted solely to Euro)...
