You are the product.
Keep thinking about that until you understand it.
This is not a dig, you are probably cool and all but when you get that it changes everything.
True here as well but in a more benign sense.
On twiitter and facebook it is malignant.
Imagine if you did not participate and just let twitter die?
And don't give me the "it isn't me excuse".
Be responsible and quit being a "twit".
Happy Holidays!
I would argue that youtube provides valuable learning opportunities and needs to be preserved but they need to clean up the hate speech.
And they won't so we need legislation to force them too!
Congress doesn't need the courts.
They have the ability to arrest and fine or incarcerate people for ignoring a Congressional subpoena.
They just haven't done so in like 80 years.
SCOTUS, at that time, even upheld that power.
I should have worded that differently.
Inherent contempt lets Congress enforce a subpoena.
If they tried to use it against an EP claim, it would undoubtedly go to the courts.
But that's also why they'd never do that.
