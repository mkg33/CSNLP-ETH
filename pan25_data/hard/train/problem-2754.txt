Right, but like… why?
It didn’t work the first time and he still has literally the biggest country in the world.
This is like when my son (5) has 20 crayons, but he still absolutely has to have the one my daughter (3) is using.
I assume they know, but no one can say it.
Though I do wonder sometimes if the true depth of the failure is being kept from Putin.
He seems like the type to shoot the messenger.
This is really what I don’t get.
Russia already has SO MUCH land and resources.
And they can’t even manage what they have well.
WTF do they (or just Putin?)
want with Ukraine?
Well they really needed Crimea.
Despite all that coastline, they’ve got no warm water/deep water port.
They lost all access to the Black Sea until they retook it in 2014.
Now, it was a huge pain in the ass to get material back one forth from this peninsula, and I suspect that was the whole purpose of this latest fiasco.
They want a landbridge that connects Crimea to the rest of Russia.
I think he assumed Ukraine would just rollover and not fight for this land.
