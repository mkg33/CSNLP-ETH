I've never heard of their protests breaking more than 1% at a given moment.
Cumulative doesn't really make sense.
The last massive protest they had was the red revolution, and after that they immediately reinvaded Ukraine, because it's what the people wanted.
Not when he's the millionth dictator, system after system, name after name, even after the people had a successful proletariat revolution, after which they immediately reinvaded Ukraine.
By now it's obvious, that fascism is the will of their people.
And they're the ones perpetrating it, not putin's clones.
Edit: in fact, just right now, I'm having an argument with an "innocent russian" who is claiming that Ukrainians aren't real.
But apparently great motivation to go start another war in Ukraine.
That's the thing, always plenty of russians who are willing to die, just not fighting fascism but supporting it.
i can agree what you say about this, there are so many in russia that said the same thing when I was living there before the war.
I had to be very careful what I said to others that I was around.
