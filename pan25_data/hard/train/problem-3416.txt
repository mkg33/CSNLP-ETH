Dems donâ€™t have a blind allegiance to their leaders definitely, but I think the aim of false equivalency by Republicans to investigate Hunter Biden is more for their own base.
It is damage control and a magicians distraction at the same time, they want their party to not think they are the party of criminals and villains.
They do not want their viewers embarrassed with no defense to shout back, conservative media always fights back the truth of exposing what their party really is by providing ammo to their sycophants, no matter how obviously erroneous and deceitful.
It's really disgusting how conservatives lack the integrity to hold any of their own accountable and then try to create an "equivalence" to Republican treason with bullshit about Hunter Biden's laptop.
Not just the propagandists are guilty of this, but the rubes as well.
It's one thing to disagree about policies, but this kind of hypocrisy and "cheating at life" mentality is a personal flaw shared by conservatives.
Man I miss the days when I could just simply "disagree about policies" with my conservative friends and relatives.
That ended on 9/11/2001 and they've been getting worse every single year.
