Jordan even keeps secret how many Palestinians & descendants were counted in its national census, as those have most likely grown into a large majority by Jordan's own definition.
(Jordan as separate from the WB is a complicated notion anyway, only with the loss in the late 60s did national differences start to really crystalize, prior to that it was more fluid, based on kindred or political class.
).

Yeah Israelis are really hesitant to give Palestinians anything because the last time they gave up Gaza it bread terrorist groups.
Israel also offered the golan heights to syria for peace treaty along with the west bank and gaza and even agreed to cut Jerusalem again for the palestinians at one time.
Just noting that isreal agreed to the 1967 border lines a few times in its past in the name of peace, and has always been rejected by the palestinians or the surrounding countries.
Supporting 1967 borders is not really supporting Palestine, considering that the only countries not supporting the 1967 borders are the countries that do not recognize Israel as a country.
Palestine also does not recognize the 1967 borders.
