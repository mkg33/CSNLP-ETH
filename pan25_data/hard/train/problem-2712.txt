I’d love a concrete reason to quit my Twitter habit.
I’m down to only checking every one to two days, but I follow journalists, etc, etc.
So I say make everyone pay, or even better, pay in crypto.
You’ve put it better than I could.
I will add to the above, conversations between a journalist, for example, used to be relatively quiet now have trumpy trolls inserting insults and profanities.
I don't like feeling trolled by the owner and wish his egomaniacal ass could go just one week without inserting himself into public discourse with bait articles and posts fully intended to get his name in the news and piss people off, as well as create a smokescreen for alt-right activities.
He makes sure that he's the main topic of conversation on his own platform every day.
It's like Trump bought Twitter.
I'm actually STOKED that he bought Twitter.
I had a FUCKLOAD of Twitter stock.
It was trading at like 30 a share, when the buyout happened it was at $54 a share.
Twitter was already probably the biggest overall social media platform with Instagram being a close second.
