This exactly!
Their country is experiencing a major uptick in COVID cases because of their policies and refusal to accept more effective vaccinesâ€¦ got to slow the spread of their variant.
China will kill many of it's citizens through negligent COVID policies, before admitting that they don't know how to make a vaccine that works, and aren't even able to produce and distribute that sub-par vaccine to that majority of its population.
Yes, I agree.
The U.S. has done a really good job of creating an international, rules based order, that most countries can benefit from, if they follow international norms.
I see China as a threat to this system, and having an even more widely distributed, internationally represented, military force from many different countries, would be a strong signal to China that they need to try to join the club, instead of challenging it.
The world that China would create as "the primary world power" would be A LOT WORSE for everyone, than what the United States and it's allies have created in the last 70 years.
In the long term, it's going to take some solid team work, to make sure the current system stays in place.
