Russia's best security guarantee is when every nation on their border belongs to the NATO defensive alliance.
Russia's rightful place in the 'European security framework' is literally as the main enemy that means that Europe NEEDS a security framework.
There can be guarantees given to Russia, and the first guarantee is "NATO will not attack Russia first, unprovoked, and as long as Russia does not make military or agressive moves towards any of NATO's allies."
The conditions for that guarantee is:
The second guarantee its possible to make is "The US and The West lifts sanctions step by step", and this is conditioned on the fulfillment of the first guarantee's conditions, and based on Russian dearmament to a regular defence force, withdrawal from Georgia and Moldovia, and building down their nuclear forces to a level sufficient for self protection and nothing more.
There can be discussion of security guarantees for Russia after they end the war, pay reparations, put war criminals on trial and conduct full nuclear disarmament.
