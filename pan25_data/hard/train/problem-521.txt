Actually, they didn't even declare a war.
They did invasion and all the atrocities, but they are still shy to call it a war, they still keep calling it that special mil op.
Dunno if that qualifies as any legal aggravation.
Don't think it matters (actions are more important).
But talk about hipocricity..
That's what Russia said (re type of drones).
I'd say quite unlikely.
Those were big (size of a fighter plane) and noisy (both thermally and literally) and, well, old.
Gotta be something newer or, at least, major overhaul.
Besides Ukraine used new developments already, missiles and sea drones, and those were way smaller and more slick.
I'd expect aerial drone to follow along the same lines.
Could even be more efficient to use new tech than trying to resurrect badly maintained old.
Ukraine, as usual, did not comment.
But then why would they give up a perfectly working tech that should be kept secret as long as possible?
.
Yes.
There's a lot of banter sbout Dugin but the guy is just a propagandist parroting others' ideas.
The real nutjobs are the likes of Ivan Ilyin and similar proper nazis from the early 1900's.
