My personal take is that regardless of what is implemented, the US financial system will never be fair for the 99% until the central banking system is no longer existent.
The argument against this is the effect on the economy as a whole.
To increase a large number of salaries simultaneously, the employer needs to come up with new funds.
To acquire these funds the employer will typically increase prices.
This creates a circular effect, requiring higher wages to pay for the higher cost of goods/services.
If the demand for the product/service is not high enough to fulfil the new high salaries of each employee, the employer will cut jobs to keep financial losses at a minimum.
So now the people who received the mandatory pay increase are losing their jobs while the circular effect of rising costs/salaries leads to inflation.
While I'm all for an increase in the minimum wage, these piecemeal increases for certain jobs that California is doing is idiotic.
Just make one minimum wage and make it easier for occupations to unionize and negotiate their salary.
If they don't want to join a union, then it's their fault they have a shitty salary.
