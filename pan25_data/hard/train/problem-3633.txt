Really something getting destroyed in this war doesn't mean that much, it's a meat grinder.
When Western tanks get there some of them will get destroyed horrifically.
There's just not that much you can do from hundreds of kilos of artillery landing around you or getting shot in the weak side or rear armor by modern anti-tank weapons.
If you start over from scratch of a new vehicle building something like the Armata is not actually very difficult and does have real advantages over older tank models.
It's really not that hard to believe that the tank functions more or less as advertised, most tanks today have a heritage that is very old and have to incorporate design choices made many decades ago.
I think saying that NATO sees no need for the tank despite the fact that no hard replacement exists that can take the tanks role and not seeing the fact that tanks are still being upgraded rather than being replaced in NATO arsenals is a problem in yours.
Oh sure, Ukraine isn't asking for those because its a win button, they're asking for it because its a part of what they need to win.
Combined arms is a term for a reason.
