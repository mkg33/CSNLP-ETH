Lula wins, and more corrupt bullshit resumes just in a different capacity since it's "their team" this time?
Basically just one big gang ran against a different big gang?
I presume it absolutely is common knowledge in Brazil, but in the US we barely heard a peep (I honestly didn't know until now so it was covered up well)- which definitely goes to show how propaganda and isolation of information can divide the world.
No apologies necessary!
I was intrigued.
Another individual was able to fill out some more information about what was going on and it seems all around like pretty deep corruption that is puppeting both sides.
I read up more on Lula and apparently he actually helped the country between '03-'10 by reducing deforestation and shortening the gap between rich and poor.
Lula was president before and he was corrupt but he also implemented some much needed and effective reforms which saw an improvement in the economy and in the living standards of the poor.
He also has a much better track record with the environment and the Amazon rainforest than Bolsonaro.
Deforestation was the lowest during Lula's previous stint as president.
At the very least he doesn't praise the military dictatorship like Bolsonaro and is committed to democracy as a form of government.
