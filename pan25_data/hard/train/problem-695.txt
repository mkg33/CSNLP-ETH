Bismarck had its rudder damaged by British wood and canvas bi-planes, and it was sufficiently crippled to be finished off by our Home fleet.
German anti aircraft fire was going too high to hit and small arms was passing straight through without critical damage to these slow and ponderous aircraft.
(I shit ye not, the top speed of the planes used by the 588th was lower than the stall speed of the German interceptors.
).
This is not the reason.
There are clear pictures of the balloon taken from the ground; it's not that high.
There are photos of the balloon and it’s a sphere.
So I am assuming they mean 3 buses wide in diameter.
That would be about 120ft diameter assuming a 40 foot long bus.
1 ft^^3 of helium can lift 0.069 lbs.
that means this balloon could carry a bit over 1500 lbs (minus its own weight).
Weather balloons expand when they increase in altitude so assume it started at less than 1/3 of that size, say 35 ft diameter (I use that based on the NWS saying their 6’ balloon expands to 20’).
