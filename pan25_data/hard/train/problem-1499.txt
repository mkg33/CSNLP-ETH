Been talking to some like minded folks in my district, we may run in opposition in the next election just to stop the bullshit.
Like how campaigning democrats will often be met at the door with at the very least harsh words, if not worse.
They’ve corrupted the worldview of a very large segment of America to view Democrats as evil because they played into religion.
It’s exceedingly difficult to convince someone like that to vote blue when they’ve been convinced for years that doing so would jeopardize their soul.
It's hard to convince people that you care about them if your national campaign is "we can win without you".
I am not talking about the merit of policies, that's super subjective and an easy strawman to rip apart.
Yeah... That's a bullshit answer.
While there are christian fundamentalists that vote straight red, there are plenty of moderates in the red states too.
It's pretty hard to vote blue in an area where all your fed is a diet of red talking points and the opponent doesn't bother to challenge or talk to you.
Surely that is the way to win over the voters in rural areas.
You guys really convinced me that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the messaging.
