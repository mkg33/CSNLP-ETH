Completely agree.
Using Ukraine as an ever relevant example, they're not exactly hurting (relatively speaking) for funds.
So many countries have given so much items in monetary value as aid.
We can send them a squadron of multi-million dollar F-16s.
But without trained pilots to fly the aircraft, they're not much use to the Ukrainians.
And while we can train their pilots, they can only learn so quickly.
(Nothing against them, just that flying is difficult yo.
).
Definitely.
Just meant that $400k (maybe now $500k?)
is the life insurance that a service member in the US Armed Forces can receive when they die (or their beneficiaries will receive).
According to , between $55k-74k for a US Army soldier.
And for the US Marine side, calculates just under $45k for a new Marine.
These figures seem like they're for the basic infantryman straight out of boot camp, not including any significant follow on MOS training.
Yeah that figure has to be just enlistment bonuses through boot camp, each marine in boot camp goes through a couple thousand rounds of ammo in just those 10 weeks or so.
Throw in gear and other stuff and you are easily up there for a grunt.
