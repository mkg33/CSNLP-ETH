Apparently from what the article says.
I know they have been using this technique where they would put the fuel used in nuclear missiles or smth like that, which does not cause nuclear explosion but replicates the sound and the look kind of.
Russians are very low on missiles allegedly so yeah, them using nuclear missiles without the actual nuclear component seems plausible.
The hardest part of maintaining the missiles is replacing the warheads as they age, and the fissile material involved in that is one of Russia's significant exports, so we know they are still capable of doing it.
The rest of maintaining the missiles is relatively easy to do and based on the missiles Russia has been lobbing into Ukraine, we know they have been maintaining their missiles as well.
Well Ukraine currently takes every air threat seriously and as long as they have the systems and ammunition they'll keep on trying to take down everything Russia sends their way.
With more systems coming in it'll allow them to better layer the air defense and hopefully increase their successful interception rate.
Decoys to overwhelm the air defense systems and create a greater chance of functional cruise missiles to make it through.
Yes they could try to put in an explosive warhead but I'm guessing they don't have the time or means to do that, whether it's a lack of material/equipment or lack of technical knowledge, it's hard to know currently.
