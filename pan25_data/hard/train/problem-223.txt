The only thing for sure is some people will be saying “we don’t know how we missed this projection,” and others will be saying,”see how accurate our polling data is?”.
If you’ve done everything you can to vote, encourage others to vote, and discourage Republicans from voting, then you have to wait for the rest to play out.
Do what you like, but as for myself I voted and I'll just wait for the outcome.
I'm not surprised by anything after 2016 and Jan 6th.
I, of course, still have hope, but I won't be shocked if my hopes are dashed, nor will any impending possible disappointment ever keep me from voting in the future.
I hope super hard that Dems overperform tomorrow but you just _can't_ use early voting data to say that is what we should expect.
The only real data we do have is that the incumbent party usually loses big.
That's all we know.
The data isn't pointing the opposite way.
It's not pointing anywhere _at all_.
Because we don't have any meaningful data.
With few exceptions it isn't possible to extrapolate meaningfully from early vote data to electoral outcomes.
It just isn't.
It's astrology for election watchers.
Or tarot card reading.
People are seeing what they want to see.
