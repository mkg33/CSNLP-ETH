So taking someone from their home and sending them somewhere else, forcibly, definitely sounds like abduction.
Whether that's the legal term or not is irrelevant.
Because in common English it fits better?
Deport is what you do to someone from somewhere else to send them back out of the country, to most people.
The context is that "deport" has been effected by Mexican immigrants being deported back to Mexico.
Deportation is a term used for expelling people from your jurisdiction into another.
Moving people by force into your jurisdiction is just mass abduction.
But abduction is not specifically the forceful removal of a group of persons from a country or region to another, while deportation is.
You can abduct someone to a neighbors house but not deport.
Deportation of an ethnic group like Ukrainian minors to Russia arguably fits the legal definition of genocide.
As a non English native speaker itâ€™s just weird to have mostly Americans decide to use a word with such a significant historical meaning (and common meaning in English, Latin, French, Dutch etc.)
differently.
Its like arguing football is soccer and handegg is the real football because Americans decided to call it that, but then with vastly more gravitas.
