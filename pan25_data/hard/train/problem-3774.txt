It’s cause politics has become a team sport that people attach their identity to.
If it were about common sense issues and getting stuff done for the benefit of all, Dems wouldn’t lose.
This is correct.
Also, yes there are checks and balances, but there is also good faith governance and republicans abandoned that a long time ago.
Repubs will stop anything that “gives Dems a win” and will obstruct everything, it isn’t a check and it isn’t how you govern when you literally won’t compromise on anything.
In a nutshell, if you feel like you do worse when Democrats control congress, it's very likely that it's because of prior Republican legislation.
That's not to say that Dems are better for the economy, but it is what people generally mean when they say that Dems are usually too busy cleaning up after Republicans poor economic legislation to enact much their own.
Usually then they lose control of Congress over the poor economy caused by Republican legislation, who then in turn ride through an economic uptick caused by Democrat legislation, and the cycle repeats over and over.
What that means is that, in terms of personal finances and economic effects, when you're feeling an economic slump, it was more than likely caused by poor legislation that had been passed and implemented two or more years before.
Usually the effects of bad economic legislation (or more properly, economic legislation of very limited benefit to small segments of the economy and negative impact on the rest of the economy) are pushed by one party when they know full well they are going to lose control of congress.
They are well aware of that time gap delay, knowing that the hit that you take based on their legislation will get pinned on the now controlling opposition party.
Only if you are check listing all media organizations as being on par equals.
If you break it down into controlling market share, it's a very different picture.
