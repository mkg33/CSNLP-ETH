Nixon left (relatively) quietly, resigning when he knew it was over, waved, got on a helicopter and went home.
At least Nixon had the decency to shut up, get on that helicopter and go away.
Yikes, when you can compare Nixon to someone and Nixon ends up the one with "decency" what a low fucking bar.
Yeah, too bad Nixon couldn't get a cult going like the Donald.

Demagogues too, like Father Coughlan, the Radio Priest.

Sound familiar?

Signed some green legislation that would do the Squad proud: the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act.
Proposed a Family Assistance Program to replace AFDC that guaranteed an annual income, although the Senate defeated it.
