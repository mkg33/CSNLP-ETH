It is, but unfortunately we have the wrong people in power in all countries.
They want to prove who has the biggest dick.
When in reality people like us lose.
I see what you mean, Russia is having a hard time as it is.
Poland intervene could be troubled for Russia.
Makes me wonder if Russia actually has powerful missles.
If you can't win on ground how can you actually have these nuclear bombs.
If NATO has 200 warheads ready to go which will destroy your country and your best effort is maybe taking out one city, your nuclear posture does not work.
and judging by the way things are with Russia right now, they are closer to perform a SAD (self assured destruction) than actually destroying other countries if they launch a nuke.
If i remember correctly, the budget Russia uses on those several thousand warheads (or whatever they claim to have) is just a bit bigger than what France spends every year to mantain their nukes, that are about 300.
There is no way in hell those russian warheads work as they should, specially when you take into account how much money is diverted to personal gain in the russian military.
The Russian military has been hallowed out by corruption over the decades but out of 1588 deployed nuclear weapons there would still be a sizeable portion that would work or have been tended to despite corruption.
Even increasing the failure rate to 90% you're still left with 150+ nuclear weapons.
Still a bad day.
