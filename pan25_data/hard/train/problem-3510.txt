There was also a morning meeting at like 6:30 am (which is insanely after the prospective Bible study time) and I was repeatedly told that I had to write people up for being late or missing the meeting after they got like 4-5 hours of sleep every night for weeks in a row.
They literally were working from dawn to the early hours of morning every day and their "day" off was Saturday noon to Sunday noon, so it was not even a day off.
On top of that they were expected to spend their off time helping clean and set up for the next week, so they were not even off on their fake day off.
I was super religious and went to a religious camp.
I never made new friends at one.
Luckily our camp allowed us to go in as groups, so that worked for me, but that just meant that kids going alone had it worse off.
I went to a summer camp that had us practice fleeing from the government when they would persecute us at the end of time.
We had to choose to stand up for Jesus and die or live and lose our salvation.
Fucked up for real!
