You can paint the US as the bad guy all you want.
US wants Western influence on Europe & a larger NATO coalition, including the revered ports & resources of Ukraine.
Russia wants the same but for the Russian Federation rather than NATO.
It simply comes down to whether you would prefer NATO(US& co.) or Russia to have more power.
US may have wrongfully invaded Iraq/Afghanistan but at least they had 9/11 to fall back on.
This isnt Vietnam & we have 0 troop presence there.
We have supplied Ukraine w the tools they requested in order for them to defend their own sovereignty.
Chris has a larger issue w the geopolitical status quo which is a conversation for another day.
As for now, which imperial power are you riding withâ€¦ US or RF?
?
But you know what?
America has many flaws, but how we have handled the Ukraine crisis has made me so proud of our country.
Its reminded me of how beautiful our country can be and how we should never give up on it.
I think if Germany gave the tanks they'd be helping defend against the imperialism their country once inflicted on Europe.
Germany is reluctant to be tough on Russia because of the horrors they inflicted on the USSR, and don't want German tanks to be used there.
What Germany has that the US doesn't is several hundred main battle tanks on the ground in Europe.
Our Abrams tanks would have to be shipped half way around the world.
