Whilst I support Israel please they are not innocent.
They took Palestine land in 67, they keep building settlements on it, they bulldoze Palestinian homes.
Palestine needs support as well.
The people that the British labeled Palestinian need support.
They do not deserve the conditions that they live in.
That said, there was never a country created by it's own people called Palestine.
If there was a Palestine, name it's President before Israel was again a country in modern times.
Yes if you defend Palestines right to not have Israel build settlements on their land you are accused of bring anti semetic.
We are meant to forever turn a blind eye when Israel does wrong because of the holocaust.
Israel and palestine gave a right to exist and Israel should abide by UN borders.
Israel had its State boundaries that were agreed to in 1967.
If you want to say about 19 years then the State of Israel never existed until after WW2.
Israel ceased to exist centuries before as it was all Palestine.
Now I 100% support the existence and creation of modetn Israel given WW2 and the holocaust.
However at UN recognised territory and EVERYTIME Israel allows settlement in occupied Territory they are wrong Everytime they bulldoze Pakestinian homes they are wrong.
