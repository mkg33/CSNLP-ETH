Just a side note, assuming a leadership position in international politics is a rather unpopular thought here in Germany.
Due to historical reasons, you know .
?
I don't know a lot about how Germany is represented in foreign media, but imho most Germans simply do not wish to be "leaders of the free world".
So based on recent performance, I certainly would not think the world would be a more moral place if Germany was the leader of the free world, instead of the US.
Which I think is not a statement many Germans will appreciate...
Germany's expanding their purchances of Russian gas after Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine was one of the most blatant examples of realpolitics I have ever seen.
While that may not be realpolitics, the illogical result is equally bad.
And yeah, watching e.g.
the German nuclear debate I see what you are saying.
The reason Germans don't like nuclear is the waste.
If there were no radioactive waste we would be very happy to build more power plants.
But just because the problem of nuclear waste doesn't make much headlines it is still there and its a huge one.
No one on earth knows where to put it.
Even if a safe method of storing it for millenia could be found, the cost of dealing with the waste would make nuclear entirely uneconomical.
It's as if humanity lived in a room and started shitting highly infectious poop that doesn't compost into a corner of the room with no one knowing what to do about it in the future.
Germany decided to stop shitting in a corner.
