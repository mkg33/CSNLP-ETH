I think it's more that elected officials aren't treating classified I information seriously.
This isn't a plague of everyday government workers; this is an issue with people who do not have and never have had a security clearance and probably never signed an NDA about classified information (because presidents and presumably vice presidents don't need a security clearance and get access to the info anyways due to their position).
One thing they might want to put in place is a declassification of documents that don’t need to be classified after a certain amount of time has passed, like schedules, certain briefings, and things that are equally easy to overlook but don’t actually currently have any bearing on national security.
I’m also all for government officials, when leaving office, having FBI/secret service/what have you do sweeps for documents like this because politicians are human.
I don’t much care for Mike Pence but I doubt he’s going to be the last.
Clearly how we’re doing things needs modified.
The gentlemen's agreements that we've been running the country with need to all be retried and replaced.
The GOP have already demonstrated a willingness to discard them at a moment's notice if it means they have something to gain, and we are currently electing actual con-men into office (Santos) which means its only a matter of time before one of these gentleman's agreements regarding top secret materials gets someone killed at the hands of the GQP and the hands of our enemies.
