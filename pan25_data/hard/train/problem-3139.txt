Since New Jersey already pays more in taxes than we receive in benefits I think the feds should kick a little of that money back to us instead of squandering it on subsidizing profligate red states.
Congress is extremely gerrymandered.
If Americans truly wanted free lunch for kids across the nation it would die in committee and win 47 votes in the Senate.
If Americans truly wanted free lunch for kids across the nation, then Congress would have extended the program instead of letting it lapse.
Therefore, if individual states want to make their lunches free for all kids, then they can raise taxes in their state to pay for it.
Do you not realize all the blue states mentioned in the article fund their expanded free lunches through state taxes?
Because it's not March 2020 anymore, the program was temporary, and we're not suffering the same effects from the pandemic.
So we don't need a federal level program to handle this if states want to extend access to free lunches.
If NJ wants to expand it then they're free to do so, they just have to find funding for it in state which is reasonable.
If NJ wants to make lunches free for all students, they're welcome to tax NJ residents to pay for it.
Seems like that makes the most sense since it's a state issue.
