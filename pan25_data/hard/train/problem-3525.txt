Charging them with terrorism seems a bit much.
But it does sound like the protesters were unlawfully protesting.
Absolutely doesn't justify their deaths, but they shouldn't have been doing that.
Protests should be done lawfully if they are going to be done at all.
If lawful protest won't solve something, I don't see how unlawful protest will be more likely to work.
Listen, I’m with your overall point but in certain circumstances you have to admit that a lawful protest is going to change nothing.
The fact that someone got away with protesting on private property before doesn't mean it is some unreasonable thing for them to eventually face consequences for doing it.
While I understand that the property was private, my question to you would be; how does one protest something they feel is unlawful when the very law owns that land?
While I will always be pro peaceful and lawful protests, I don’t know how any protest on public land would stop the progress of this cop city.
This was also made worse though when an operation was carried out and apparently not a single camera captured the incident.
So if police can act without oversight, why is the average citizen being held to higher standards?
