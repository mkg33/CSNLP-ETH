I hope this bill becomes law, and that more people feel empowered to participate in making their community a better place.
There's an argument in the article that the state constitution says only citizens can vote.
However reading the constitution, it clearly says that citizens have the right to vote.
It doesn't say anything about non citizens.
DC residents can still vote in local elections.
Same for residents of Puerto Rico.
This bill would make that an option for tax paying non citizens in RI.
I don't like the fact that those two places don't have federal representation, but I'm not knowledgeable enough about the specifics to really go further than that.
