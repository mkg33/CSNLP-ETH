In France nuclear energy have a lower CO2 output including the cost of construction than any renewable energy according to ADEME since the production isn't the same as other country.
Maybe read some better literature and learn about the country.
So maybe next time when you say read some better literature, read your own literature first before you emberace yourself.
.
You mean the report that has an idiotic big range?
Sure if you leave out all the other costs and pollution a nuclear power plants brings and only measure the costs and CO2 output when it's running everyone can get to such bullshit numbers.

So yeah.
If anything, solar baguettes would be a sign of the problem (again, specifically the problem of small bakers staying competitive) getting _worse_ rather than better.
It's plausible that a large bakery chain might invest in its own solar energy to manage its electricity costs - it'd take a capex hit and amortise it into running costs over time, so their profits might take a small hit but it wouldn't have to affect shelf prices.
But a small bakery doesn't have the luxury of real estate to put up windmills and solar panels and battery storage, nor the capital to do it.
So, when the opex works out and the supermarket leverages its energy savings to keep prices stable the next time energy costs go up, the little guy gets screwed again.
