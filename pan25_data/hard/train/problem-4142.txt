Any party that starts talking about repealing the 2nd amendment is going to do absolutely nothing but give the opposing party total government control.
Say that's the Democrats.
Next thing that happens is that the 2nd amendment isn't repealed because there aren't anywhere near enough votes to make that happen.
Democrats then start losing elections all over the place, we get a Republican supermajority, and then...that's game over.
There are an absolute shitload of Democrats and Independents who own guns.
There are an absolute shitload of LBGTQ people who own guns because they're under attack.
Not just political attack, but from being outright slaughtered in public.
A person really doesn't need to be a bigot to cause massive atrocities.
This is what propaganda does to a person.
It takes saying something that would normally be unacceptable, and slowly making it more acceptable little by little.
However, what if a frame it a different way?
Take the same scenario, but I say, "You are a surgeon, cutting people up is not fun, but you're doing it for a good cause.
".
This.
Republicans are about as conservative as Democrats are socialist.
Which is to say, not-very to not-at-all.
Republicans have been very successful at defining terms in a way that is beneficial to them without regard to what they actually mean (see CRT & Pro-life for more examples).
