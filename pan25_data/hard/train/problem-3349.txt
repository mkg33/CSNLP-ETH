In the early days of the wind energy development ie 2010ish in southern Australia (specifically the western districts) some farmers would get turbines and others wouldn’t as the monetary incentive isn’t small this virtually destroyed some communities.
Some small towns in Australia created “wind turbine collectives” where the funds paid to landowners who allow wind turbines to be installed on their property are pooled and distributed to the community.
In some cases, you have farmers basically just leasing land to wind projects and that's an alternate revenue stream (you can have a failed crop and still get money from the wind leases).
Solar panels have been installed on some farms above either grazing land or crops, in some cases they’re actually beneficial to the thing being farmed.
Turbines can obviously be installed in farmland above the fields with limited if any impact on the farm.
Wind turbines need maintenance, no shit.
All machinery needs maintenance, including power plants.
What’s the worst possible failure mode for a wind turbine?
It catches fire?
It collapses?
