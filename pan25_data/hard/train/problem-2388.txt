The term "thousand-yard-stare"￼ is believed to have originated in World War I, and was coined for the faces of battle-weary soldiers.
It was popularized in World War II and named for the perception that such stares really do seem to be able to see very far ahead.
Eyes cross a little when focusing on something reasonably close, but eyes not looking at anything will behave like eyes looking at something very far away.
Dull Eyes of Unhappiness can look similar to this, but they're chronic while this trope tends to be transitory.
Compare Empty Eyes and Blank Stare.
Not related to the "Thousand Yard Stare of Impending Flashbacks", an affliction near universally shared by the characters of Lost.
See also Heroic BSoD, for what usually goes hand-in-hand with this.
A character who exhibits this may be on their way to developing posttraumatic stress disorder￼ and thus may develop into a Shell-Shocked Veteran.
Such a veteran though may show it as well, particularly if it's something which helps them feel comfortable and cope after their duty is done.
As someone who has been in combat and seen first hand the thousand yard stare, I speak with authority when I say you are wrong.
That's why I said you are funny.
The thing I got from it was he thought he was talking to a friend.
He thought if he just told them to find more votes they would.
I bet there was ketchup everywhere when he found out the call was recorded.
