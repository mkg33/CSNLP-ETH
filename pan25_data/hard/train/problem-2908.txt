Also worth nothing that gun crime in Canada involving legally purchased firearms is almost nonexistent.
Legal gun owners are subject to a huge number of restrictions in terms of licensing, background checks, weapons storage and transport, random spot checks, and so on.
I mean, outside of a few exceptions like Chicago, etc, where some of the strictest gun laws in the nation are in effects.
In violent neighborhoods, easy access to guns actually serves to reduce crime, because you give the law abiding citizens access.
When you ban guns, only the criminals have guns, and everyone knows it.
Yeah and the criminals get them by stealing them from legal gun owners lol.
How else do you think they make it to the black market?
Look it up the overwhelming majority of illegal guns used in crime are stolen from legal gun owners.
Those guns have been in circulation for ages and will continue to be until our idiot governments crack down on criminal gun use and leave law abiding gun owners alone.
The government has done next to nothing to clamp down on gun smuggling and has also consistently pressed for lighter sentencing for those who commit the crimes, instead choosing to relentlessly go after legal gun owners.
