Just removed?
It was formally removed about 6 years ago and replaced with a two child policy and currently it's a three child policy.
But even before it was removed there were increasing amounts of exemptions for several years leading up to 2016 (e.g.
at point if your first child was a girl they let you have another child in order to combat the cultural discrimination against girls).
The biggest disfavour the one child policy did for China was warp the gender ratio.
In terms of population, industrialization would have done that anyway as raising children in urban environments is far more costly than in a more agricultural based society so people sort of naturally just choose not to have children.
This is why other east asian countries like Japan, Taiwan and South Korea all have extremely low birth rates despite never having a one-child policy either.
China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, combined with an enormous population, and they’ve had a very low fertility rate for decades.
Beyond that their economy is still very very labor intensive.
The West solves there issues 2 ways, one they have a ton of immigration which props up demographics.
Two, most western economies aren’t manufacturing based, and are far less labor intensive.
That doesn’t matter, the issue with demographic collapse isn’t the actual number of people in age groups, it’s that modern economies rely on having an expanding labor pool at all times to pay for the retired generation and to continue to generate growth.
Take the US for example, if 10% more 65+ existed and a similar number of 20-45s were gone it would collapse our entitlement programs and economy nearly overnight as there’s not enough young workers to feed taxes into Medicare and Social Security.
