It's ironic that the only thing approaching an accomplishment of his is the one thing that he can't possibly brag about least his base turn on him.
By no means does Trump deserve sole credit here - or even a large share of credit.
Still, in a normal political situation, he'd be claiming that he singlehandedly got everyone COVID vaccines, wildly exaggerating his role to make himself sound more important.
He can't even brag about this without angering his base, though.
In fact, Trump's base demands that he criticize "his" vaccine efforts or else.
The COVID vaccines are the only real accomplishment that Trump might plausibly be able to tout.
Even that was more "got done despite Trump" than "got done because of Trump."
Still, it wouldn't be 100% lying if he ran on "I helped make it possible for COVID vaccines to come out.
".
he always has been.
for 6 months before the 2015 announcement he had a staff listening to hours and hours of right wing talk radio to find out what people wanted to hear and he gave it to them.
he believes in nothing.
