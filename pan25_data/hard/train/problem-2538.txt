I'm then told to not focus on how others live their lives and instead live my life in service of the lord.
Basically the grown up way of telling people to shut up and stop asking questions.
If you despite him so much, call it like it is and stop with this nitpicking word play.
Call him a racist piece of shit, he’s earned it.
In 1991, he’s quoted as saying “Black guys counting my money!
I hate it.
The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.
… I think that the guy is lazy.
And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks.
It really is, I believe that.
It’s not anything they can control.”.
This is tangentially related, but his dad was arrested in 1927 at a KKK rally/parade (details are scant, there’s no record of him being in the KKK, the only details of his arrest were one of seven arrests that day for “failure to disperse” and he was discharged.
One of these incidents could probably be dismissed.
But you combine the history, and some of the people Trump openly associated with, and his comments, and it’s not hard to see him as racist.
He may not be overt, but certainly seems like he has a racist streak in him.
When he’s open about it, it makes it hard for them to support him without being branded racist as well.
