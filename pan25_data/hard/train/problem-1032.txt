It's just odd.
Show of hands.
How many of us constantly need to know about underage girls and their periods.
Or obsess about the how, what, when, where and why for people going to the bathroom and their particular apparatuses?
Or now with the inordinate fascination these men have with this other man's member.
It almost certainly is silliness and projection.
Outrageous indignation is part of the Reddit experience.
These issues aren't going to meme themselves after all.
As for real life, I am more interested in whether most of this talk translates into voting or other actual positive activity in one's community.
As for my personal real life experience doing government tech support in a Republican state, I saw little evidence that even vaguely approached reddit's level of interest over 1000s of devices.
So yeah grain of salt.
Cheers.

Yes.
I just have a need to admit my sins every now and then.
I understand nothing will change the past and all that matters is that I've changed for the present and that's good enough.
the redemption arc feels good tho.
Honestly like 10 years ago when I was technically anti trans, even then I then didn't question the bathroom thing.
I just didn't understand the whole trans thing but y'know, I gained some trans friends over the years and got my questions answered pretty nicely.
I feel bad for having doubts in the first place but at least I learned from it.
it really is no ones business whatsoever and the GOP really is a bunch of bullshit.
I'm sorry to everyone because I voted republican in 2016 and that I got suckered into their shit.
I'm so fucking sorry god damn I can never let down that regret.
I've had a few drinks and I'm going through shit right now so like sorry guys once again.
dark brandon will rise above all.
