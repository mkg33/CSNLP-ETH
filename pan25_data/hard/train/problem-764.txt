Note that even Barr couldn't rewrite the Mueller report--he provided a misleading "summary", but the actual report is heavily critical of Trump's actions, much more so than Barr would have allowed if he had a heavy say in it.
Fair enough.
The "legacy" explanation is something that has come up repeatedly in other people's explanations.
What's Garland's motivation for "landing the plane"?
He doesn't benefit from Trump being out on the streets.
He has to issue a report to Congress stating why he didn't prosecute.
It's part of the standard Special Counsel procedures.
So yeah--if you're really looking to say, "We're not prosecuting Trump because he was president", the easiest way to do it would be to slow-walk the existing investigations and just not answer questions about 'em.
To reiterate: If the plan is "We're not going to be prosecuting a former president", the simplest and straightest route to that end goal is simply not to prosecute, not appointing a Special Counsel who then has to explain why he declined to prosecute.
So, are you saying this prosecutor is required to answer as to why he isn't going to prosecute if that is his final decision?
I could instead see this just dragging out until the public loses interest.
