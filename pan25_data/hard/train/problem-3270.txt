They’re not gonna execute 15,000 people.
They simply don’t have the means to do so, nor would the population and other countries just tolerate it.
They’re using this as a justification to mass execute the more vocal protesters/leaders and to let other protesters know that they could be next if they don’t step back.
Would they get away with it if they publicly executed 15,000 people in the town square?
Probably not, this is not the Middle Ages anymore nor are they Genghis Khan.
I know this type of shit happened in Srebrenica for instance, but the situation is a bit different now.
There’s no war and they’re killing their own population.
If you kill 15,000 people you will have at least 10,000 very pissed off families and many many more people who were friends with these people.
They’d have to turn into NK in order to maintain power after that and I don’t think the population would tolerate that.
But you know what, if they actually do kill 15,000 people, that might just be the event that finally toppled this insane regime.
15,000 people is maybe not a lot in the world of some of the worst mass executions, but it's still a fuck ton of people.
I'm sure this has been said, more than once, before mass executions and genocides...so...not sure why you're so confident they won't murder 15k people.
Your type of belief is why genocides still happens.throw yourself a party for loving people getting killed unlawfully , I’m sure your love ones will come.
