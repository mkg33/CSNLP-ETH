Honestly, it probably depends.
In some cases they might drug them, in some cases just toss them out and in some it might simple be a message "suggesting" jumping from the window is the option for them.
Its not unknown for that to happen.
Multiple countries used to have the idea that someone would leave you a pistol if you were disgraced and you knew why.
The general point us everybody knows why it happened and who was responsible (directly or indirectly) and they know it might happen to them.
I'm guessing they want to make sure everybody knows who did it, while also being able to deny any wrongdoing should the mode strike them.
"Oh the poor thing just fell out of a window Crazy how that keeps happening to top Russian officials" /WINK.
When are these guys going to get a clue, band together and have Putin fall out a window?
It is only matter of time before the mad Russian get everybody around him to fall out a window or down a stairs.
Isn’t that about the 57th high ranking Russian that “fell” out of a hotel window?
Apparently, the KGB or whatever they are called now, isn’t very creative.
