I don't understand why people think that using a fax machine is outdated.
The number one country in fax machine sales is the U.S., and the number two is Japan, and the number three is Germany.
I mean, the more developed countries tend to use fax machines.

The reason why fax machines became popular in Japan is because Japan has the most developed telephone network in the world.
This is the reason why fax machines are only popular in developed countries because developing countries have imperfect telephone networks.
There are data that show that fax machines are much safer than sending information over the Internet.
The entirety of Scandinavia has a population less than Florida.
It's like saying Tokyo London, or NYC is developed.
It's easy to modernize when you have a few million people.
Again it's easier to make changes when you have a few million people vs tens of millions.
Not saying that it's right, but you'll surely have to recognize why it's easier to modernize a country like Singapore or Iceland than it is the US.
Well, youâ€™d have to have access to the physical line in order to intercept a fax.
Nothing of that sort is needed for end to end encryption, at least theoretically.
Though I do agree that if given access to the physical line, encryption would be far more secure.
There is nothing inherently "secure" about fax machine or its data transmission.
It's definitely less secure than the end to end encrypted data transmission over internet.
