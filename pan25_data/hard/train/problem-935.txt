If they can't find enough conservative professors, they'll just hire conservatives with no teaching experience and call them professors.
The end result will be the firing of liberal professors and replacing them with conservative professors (if they can find enough).
The quality of the universities will begin eroding as most professors would prefer to find a job at a university that respects tenure and doesn't have politicians dictating what they can or can't research and teach.
The real damage is ending tenure for professors and giving the governor complete control over university leadership hiring/firing.
Governor controls the leadership and the leadership can fire & hire professors at will.
But that's just one example.
Stripping professors of tenure and putting political appointees in charge of hiring and firing will have a silencing effect on teaching and research as well as encouraging professors to work in other states.
DeSantis is putting political appointees in charge at universities and giving them the power and mandate to make it about politics.
Unless a particular faculty makes it clear their politics, what is the university going to look at?
How does anybody even find out what a professor's political ideology is?
