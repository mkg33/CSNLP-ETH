Why stop there?
Why not guarantee every working American 7 paid sick days per year.
Since we are gonna fix our health, let's also restructure Amercan healthcare so when you get sick, it doesn't ruin you financially.
In the USA, you generally just don't get paid at all while you are away sick.
The Dr's note will excuse you but you won't be paid.
Some companies offer paid sick days as a benefit.
But if you have 5 sick days you stop getting paid after the 5th day absent.
So would that mean that those are all unpaid days when they remove themselves for illness?
If they're so short-staffed why would they want someone to take an unpaid day off now, and then take an additional paid day off in the future, instead of having them just take the day then?
By having it unpaid, they're hoping to push people into not taking the day at all, and only ever using the scheduled ones.
They'd rather have the people come into work sick.
They have paid sick leave though, right?
They just have to use their other PTO to take it, which is how every other jobs I've had is.
