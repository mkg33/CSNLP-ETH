The link for the last citation is broken, but for the rest for the rest of them, the White House brought the receipts.
In case you needed more evidence, here's Wisconsin GOP Senator Ron Johnson on a radio program this morning:
>- Ron Johnson: Yes.
That's why what I'vetalked about - from the first time I ran in 2010, I just laid out the reality of Social Security.
It's a legal Ponzi scheme.
It is.
It's a pay as you go system.
Edit: for the last citation, I did find this CBS article: [Republicans want to push Social Security, Medicare eligibility age to 70.
>Under a plan developed by the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservatives in the House, senior citizens would face a five-year delay to claim Medicare, the government health care program for seniors that currently allows people to access the program when they turn 65.
And the retirement age for Social Security would also increase to 70, compared with today's full retirement age of between 66 and 67 years old.
We should increase the age of retirement, and to ensure people live to an old enough age to cash it out, they should probably be given access to healthcare.
