because, like I said, Ukraine is internationally recognized.. China doesn't recognize anything "de facto", they don't recognize Taiwan just like it doesn't recognize Crimea as a part of Russia despite it is currently "de facto" a part of Russia.
totally different issue.
Ukraine is internationally recognized as a independent nation, even Russia recognizes it before the invasion.
Taiwan is internationally recognized as a part of China.
what is "flawed", in my opinion, is to say that Crimea is a part of Ukraine, despite it is currently "de facto" a part of Russia, yet refuse to say that Taiwan is a part of China base on some "de facto".
Crimea is a part of Ukraine, Just like how Taiwan is a part of China.
and if you think Crimea is a part of Ukraine but refuse to recognize that Taiwan is a part of China, then you are not being logically consistent.
China refuses to do business with anyone who sees Taiwan for what it actually is, so many of the people who support China on paper (like the USA) actually align with Taiwan.
