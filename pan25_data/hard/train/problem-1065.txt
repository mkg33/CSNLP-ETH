2) I will attempt to detail the chain of events that caused this situation, I'll start at an arbitrary point, but keep in mind there's probably been decades of events prior to that.
1.
Kosovo passes the license plate law requiring holders of Serbian license plates to obtain temporary Kosovo plates when entering Kosovo.
A bit wrong here with step 1 in your chain of events, it wasn't Serbs entering Kosovo that needed temporary license plates issued by Kosovo, it was ethnic Serbians living in Kosovo using plates issued by Serbia.
They were being asked to use Kosovo plates.
Kosovo story is quite complex.
It cannot be compared to Ukraine.
Kosovo was (is?)
a part of Serbia.
It was an autonomous region.
Do they have "the right" to a separation?
Eh, difficult to tell.
The constitution of Yugoslavia was as awful as possible, granting everyone the right to "self-determination" (choosing freely your own destiny), but at the same time adding "with the consent of EVERYONE ELSE", which is bonkers.
Like saying, the law gives you freedom to do literally anything - for as long as everyone in the town agrees.
That's not how laws (and logic) work.
