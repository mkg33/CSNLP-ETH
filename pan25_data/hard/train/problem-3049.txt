This is in part ensuring the IRS is allowed to do its job, and part making the presidents tax returns public?
I see the precedent brouhaha focused more on “we could get any private citizen’s tax returns after this!”.
This will make public a report on Trump’s tax information AND his actual tax returns (!)
per lawmaker on W&M.
The latter will take longer due to needed redactions.
Democrats say the Trump tax documents they obtained showed that Trump was NOT getting audited in 2017, 2018 and 2019, despite the existence of a supposed mandatory IRS audit for sitting presidents.
the IRS failed to audit any of trump’s tax returns under the mandatory audit program except one year, and that was AFTER the House asked for his tax returns.
An IRS memo said there were too many problems to look into.
Here are a few, INCLUDING the 7 springs easement:
Republicans in Congress could retaliate by releasing President Biden’s tax returns.
Oh wait, he already released them like every president of either party besides Donald Trump for the last 40 plus years.
So Republicans voted along party lines against releasing something that Trumpclaimed he wanted to release 6 years ago.
And now Republicans are screaming about how unfair it was to release them.
