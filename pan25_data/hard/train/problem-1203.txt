All this to say, Focus On The Family has been training their faithful followers for decades to not think, just obey, no matter how bizarre and harmful the rules might turn out to be.
I do try to drive carefully, but what I was trying to say was that the importance of following every single rule to the letter was blown wildly out of proportion by many voices in my upbringing.
Then I grew up, and discovered that, not only had I been capable of being my parents' intellectual equal in my teens, not only that I'd actually been programmed to be a simpering doormat for anyone with a raised voice who happened to be in my life, but I'm LGBT myself, and it's actually really hard to get yourself killed or even hurt from things like cannabis, or going 40 mph in a 35 zone, or having friends who aren't Christians, or being a huge fan of heavy metal, D&D, random childrens' book serieses, tv shows featuring characters who are witches, horror movies, video games that happen to have violence somehow, etc.
Focus On The Family was a huge part of my childhood.
I don't remember a whole lot about "Beware the gay agenda!"
from their materials, but I do remember a lot of preaching about what a stupid, naive, weak, foolish, sin-sick brat I was, and how lucky I was to be raised by Christian parents, who were somehow automatically wiser and smarter than non-christians, and how if I didn't shut up and listen to their every word, I'd probably self-destructive and die in my thirties from sinful behaviour.
I grew up in the Baptist church in the 90s, and I remember our bulletins would often have a leaflet in them this organization was involved with that would tell parents what horrible pop culture influences to keep your kids away from.
We definitely always pocketed them as a cheat sheet on what movies to see and CDs to buy.
Thanks for the help, guys!
