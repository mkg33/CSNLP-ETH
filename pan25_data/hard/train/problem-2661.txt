I'm in europe, nobody gives a f\\\ anymore, pandemic status is gone for sure, idk about the unvaccinated though, but if you're not going to do it by now, nothings gonna convince ya.
Also, idk what fucking monster you are that you can leave your home, go to the nearest clinic/hospital, have no wait time, sit down, get a flu shot and then arrive home/ur next destination in 10 seconds.
Wanna know a funny story that will get me downvoted?
You can't get the flu from a covid shot ,since there's no active virus inside, but you can get a pulmonary infection from the vaccine.
The vaccine doesnâ€™t stop you from getting it, but it probably make the illness more mild when you do catch Covid.
I was vaccinated three times and still got the covid.
Clearly different from the flu but very mild.
Main symptom was being sleepy all the time for five days or so.
Also I got covid a couple of months ago when everybody had stopped wearing the mask.
It is like people collectively decided war is a bigger threat and stopped thinking about covid.
At least I did.
