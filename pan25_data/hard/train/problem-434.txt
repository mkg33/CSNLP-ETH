Chinese belligerence is predictable.
They said they wanted peace, they want nothing of the sort.
They are pernicious liars and bullies who seek to legitimize their stupidity on the global stage.
China can go fuck it’s self.
China is just pissed at the precedent being set right now.
They don't want to have to deal with this in 10 years when they start their invasion of Taiwan and everybody arming Ukraine gives Taiwan F-15s and Typhoons, anti-ship missiles and probably most of the USA's derpy Littoral class ships.
They can’t afford to go all in on supporting Russia, but they also can’t just let the status quo come down solidly on defending Ukraine and rejecting Russia either, so they’re mostly taking a stance of “everybody should stay out of everyone else’s business instead of getting involved to help Ukraine” since that’s ultimately what they’d prefer people to do when it comes to their own aims towards annexing Taiwan.
China’s stance is pretty consistent.
Russia is doing to Ukraine what China wants to do to Taiwan, so they’re doing their best to mitigate the blowback against Russia as the invader without totally alienating themselves from the global order the way Russia has in the process.
