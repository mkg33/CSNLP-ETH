Of all Arab countries at peace with Israel, Jordan is by far the most hostile and has decided to limit trade with Israel only to necessities.
Countries that have only now established relations with Israel have already far surpassed Jordan's trade with Israel by orders of magnitude.
They trade water and electricity, and have some security cooperation, but they are definitely not best buddies.
Egypt too has the Pyramids, so makes sense for Arab nations to have the means to accommodate foreigners.
You are actually correct, Egypt was the first Arab country to make peace.
I wrote my comment from memory, sometimes my recall ability is not the best.
Indeed, but if I recall they have some level of armistice deal, which I am not sure if Israel break or not when doing bombing campaign in Syria.
But armistice does allow people visiting from Syria.
I personally saw one in Ben Gurion airport.
Came out of a plane and was stickied by military guys with red stickers which said that he has 48 hours to visit relatives and after that he must be out of the country.
Unlike Pakistanis who might lose citizenship if they arrive to Israel.
That was the basis of the first peace deal between Jordan and Israel.
Jordan was the first Arab country to make a peace with Israel.
Egypt later followed, but there has been no peace deal with Syria since the independence of Israel.
Egypt was the first to sign a peace agreement with Israel, in the late 1970's (1979 ?)
with president Carter hosting the negotiations.
Jordan and Israel signed a peace agreement in the mid 1990's, with president Clinton aiding the negotiations.
