It will be a dark day in America but in the end?
Trump will rally 100-300 people and they all leave by halftime.
Some MAGA hats would fight and die but I'm thinking maybe 5%-6% of them.
The rest will bring guns, leave when it gets real, die just by inexperience, or start blasting and get shot quick my military/police forces.
But once they start shooting, it will be more about how to quickly neutralize them/stop the active fighting rather than how to legally arrest them.
The National Guard would be easier to send.
However, if the local police decides to just "disengage" from fighting this new insurrection due to pro-Trump loyalties, the insurrectionists could do some serious damage before the National Guard arrives.
Also, if they are adamant about using guns (As in, if they take Marjorie Taylor Greene's claim here as an order to be carried out during a new attack: ), then the time the National Guards arrive will be the bloodiest part of the insurrection.
I still would not underestimate him.
He has a lot of fanatics, several militias under his control and a considerable capability to cause damage.
Once he feels he has nothing else to lose, he will lash out and so will they.
