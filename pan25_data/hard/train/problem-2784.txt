News is smaller, but there was a large push by the alt right during the Trump era to try and take it over.
There are still remnants of that in the comment section with people with ultra right-wing views cropping up more often then usually expected.
How it works is far-righters hang out on other social media and a link is posted whenever there's a good brigading target.
This isn't some big secret, their plans are an open book.
They simply pop in and do the range of "just asking questions", post fake / misleading sources and generally troll + vote brigade.
Yeah, /r/news is still significantly astroturfed by the far-right, just watch what happens when crime stories with a black suspect is posted.
Often the top 2-3 posts (with thousands of upvotes) are blatantly racist.
Though I guess it was worse under Trump.
You can't conclusively determine that on an individual account level, after all there are probably a few actual Nazis/alt-righters there who don't co-ordinate outside the site.
We can see which Reddit posts get linked to on far-right social media though.
It's also highly suspicious when certain types of posts will have large numbers of fresh accounts posting far-right propaganda.
World News is much larger, and therefore is targeted by bot farms more for misinformation campaigns.
