Could legit ask this about any Russian dissident with a lot more "clout" than Sushko (who I don't even think is a dissident).
In reality though there are plenty of people active in the FSB, SVR, FSO, etc.
that do supply leaks and are actually risking their lives inside Russia proper, but the situation internally is likely so ridiculously convoluted and shitty that sorting out or organizing anything is difficult.
I mean there are many within those agencies that are leaking (the entire apparatus of the invasion itself was practically given to the Five Eyes it seems) and we are at a phase now that Russian internal opposition to further blunders (from within its own security services) is likely at critical mass.
It's thus not at all surpring if a lot of the guys who both are much more likely the be in the loop with regards to the true state of Russia and who are in an area which is a lot about operating covertly, are quietly working to get rid of Putin and his clique.
ex KGB are the only ones Putin trusts, if these two people have plotted against Putin, then they either have ex KGB backing or they will be disposed of.
Nothing new... it's been going on for years.. Putin eliminates those that get in the way... mysterious deaths , sudden heart attacks , bogus charges , falling out of windows " accidently " who in their right mind believe any of their concocted lies.
