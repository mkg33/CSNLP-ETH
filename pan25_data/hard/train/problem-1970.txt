It seems unlikely that the majority of these laws are going to stand once they have made their way through the courts.
The most recent supreme court rulings make it almost impossible for red flag laws to withstand constitutional scrutiny in a historical context.
Now, granted, how red flag laws are implemented in various states may not satisfy due process in some cases, but the general concept(court intervention when a complaint is made that someone poses a threat to themselves or others) is not unconstitutional.
All of them.
Even the ones where the order is made ex parte, a follow up heating is mandated for the defendant to challenge the decision.
Due process.
Due process is also any issue for any other crime though.
People sit in jail cells waiting for trial.
People already lose their freedom and end up in jail cells as they wait for their judicial process to take place.
Is the argument to instead jail people for making these threats instead of removing their weapons and still permit them to walk freely until their hearings?
You're saying just because it's gun rights, it's okay to circumvent our constitutional right to due process?
You don't have to agree with gun rights, but we shouldn't support removing someone's right to due process.
There's other ways.
