It's vast and there is a LOT of cheap uninteresting plonk produced and even with some of the more expensive better known Bordeaux wines it's not always easy to make an informed choice and actually get something good.
When I was still living in the Netherlands, I had much better access to Italian, Spanish, South African and US wines than I do now living in France.
French wines are still plenty interesting in other countries, even if there is much more international competition these days.
Lol, by and large US wines crush their French competitors, that's the problem, France \had\ a big internal wine market, their international trade has been on the decline for years now.
The problem with living in France is that you don't tend to get a whole lot of other wines, and you really have to look for them...
Major wine producing countries just don't tend to import as much as countries that don't produce a whole lot of wine...
For the most part, only high-quality wine does, and that stuff still has no trouble finding a buyer.
The vintners affected by this low demand were mostly producing cheap table wine that sold for under three euros a bottle, which was popular back when many French people drank wine with every lunch and dinner, but now lots of people are either going teetotal or drinking more expensive wine less often.
