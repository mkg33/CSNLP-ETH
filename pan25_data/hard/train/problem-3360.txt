Michael Cohen makes a pretty convincing case that he's not going to run.
He's made an announcement and signed a single piece of paper stating his intent to run for the Republican nomination but that's it.
He hasn't hired campaign staff, a strategist, PR people, lawyer team (Hah As if he can get anyone else to agree to that), Etc.
Under his current PAC he uses to fundraise he can use 90% for whatever he wants, only 10% has to be used for official campaign stuff.
If he runs and gets the Republican nomination suddenly his grift is over and his money has strings attached in a major way.
He will keep milking it and running through the motions because A) he thinks it will get him protection from prosecution in his many court cases B) The money is too good.
I expect if he isn't outright prevented from taking office by 14th amendment charges or conviction he will pull the plug at the last minute and truffle shuffle off with the money.
People are saying DeSantis was visiting his Muslim Kenyan communist family when Trump died, they were attending a party thrown by Caesar Chavez in Cuba.
"No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.

See.
This shit right here.
This is the kind of stuff I'd do as a joke, and I absolutely hate that I cannot tell if this is a sincere product, or made by people like me.
