I wonder why they still use checks.
In Germany they fell out of use for normal consumer payments some 30 years ago or so.
To me, my parents writing checks to pay for groceries is a 1980s childhood memory.
My aunt wrote me one, some time in the 1990s, because she thought I should have had the experience of cashing in a check at least once in my life and that it probably wouldn't be possible for much longer.
A man found a lost check worth $4.8 million to Haribo, only for the confectionary giant to reward him with six packets of gummies.
The eagle-eyed traveler, named as Anouar G, 38, from Frankfurt, Germany, spotted the check on a train platform after visiting his mum.
Supermarket group Rewe reportedly issued the cheque to Haribo but it somehow got lost at the station.

But notice how the title is worded.
It’s trying to get you to be angry about it which is very lame.
This should derank msn as a source of information in people’s eyes.
