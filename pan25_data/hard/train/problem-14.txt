I would argue its not that important to modern warfare at all.
It's essential to modern survival though.
Even tactical nukes are useless in modern warfare, like in Ukraine, without risking unacceptable escalation with not just the opponent but with other world powers.
You can also see it in the Pakistan-India skirmishes.
Both have nukes but still attack each other and are still unwilling to escalate to that level.
Even in India and China confrontations they are so afraid of escalation that fist and stick battles have been almost unofficially agreed upon as the upper limit.
Unfortunately, some day someone WILL use them again and that day will suck beyond anything we have experienced.
This is the incredible downside to nuclear weapons.
We also know that the threat of a nuclear strike is much more useful than the nuclear strike itself and they overused it.
We've literally become so desensitised to nuclear weapons being mentioned that this shit is just another day, another threat.
Nobody cares anymore Russia.
Flex all you want, it's no longer working.
Keeping your mouths shut would of been better - silence is deadly.
All show, no real threat.
It's a visual threat is all.
Actions speak louder than words, etc.
Seeing the silo loaded will impact people differently than having been told since the 60's they're ready to launch.
Nothing more than a cheap scare tactic.
