Either way, "also burn wood fuel" does not mean that they are entirely heated by wood but could be a mix of all and partial wood based home heaters.
Edit to clarify: practically all our wood-burning houses have central heating with hot-water radiators and a wood-burning oven that heats the water.
In the house I'm in now, there's an automation that switches to electric heating at night if the water temperature drops to a certain point.
These systems aren't generally built into new houses, since not many people are willing to make their own firewood nowadays.
Wood is perfectly good for colder climates, as well.
Plenty of houses here in Finland are either wood-heated or running a wood/electricity hybrid system - I'm in a house like that right now.
The uk has the largest wood pellet power plant in the world… so in a round about way I’m sure lots of people are technically heating their homes with wood.
Plenty of people around the world use a fireplace as one of the sources of heat in the house, in Europe, Australia, and North America.
It doesn't mean it's the only or even primary source of heat, but one of the sources in that household.
