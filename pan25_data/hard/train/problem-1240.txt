If my aide packs a box and ships it to my garage and I never open it the fault is not on me and the odds are pretty good this is exactly how it went down.
In the interest of full fairness.
We do not even know who checked out Biden's blockbuster tape.
He does not pack his own office, those files have probably been there for years after some aide packed them improperly.
The investigation will get to the bottom of it but I highly doubt Biden was even aware/given them directly.
There is no criminality without intent but I do not even think we will have a case for thinking Biden even negligent.
I also think that most people are happy for biden to be investigated to hell & back too and put criminal charges there if need be.
But if it was criminal, I'd like for Justice to be upheld and for Biden to deal with the appropriate charges and consequences of his actions.
Nobody is above the Law.
And this is the key difference between Conservatives and everyone else.
Conservatives only want Justice for the people who aren't Conservative, and a free pass for everyone with an R next to their name.
Everybody else (at least those that actually believe in Law and Democracy) want Justice for ALL.
