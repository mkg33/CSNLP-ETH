And yet the "democratic" government we installed had little support from the population, and they couldn't keep control for even 24 hours after NATO left.
The membership of the Taliban is estimated to have nearly doubled from 45k to 75k between 2001 and 2021.
How is it that even as Afghanistan's standard of living improved, the Taliban could recruit many more members to replace the ones killed or captured during the early years of the war?
I think how an Afghan might answer your last question has everything to do with whether or not the new warlords are going to hunt them and their family down and execute them for how they spent those good few years.
Sure, you're going to find exceptions here and there, especially in Kabul, but the people of Afghanistan were given 20 years to choose what their country would be like and they choose the Taliban.
In fact, they love the Taliban so much this is the second time they've chosen them since they also chose the Taliban back in the 90s.
The bottom line is that the Taliban represents Afghanistan's values.
The Afghans picked the Taliban over western values.
They made their choice.
Now they must face the consequences.
Edit: To all the global political experts with edgy opinions replying to me, I can not stress how little I care what you think.
