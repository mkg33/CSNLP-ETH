This isn't a moral equivalency, because Republicans are going to make it infinitely worse.
Democrats dropped the ball on many major issues though, and I have yet to find people in real life who don't think the same.
Just because I disagree with Democrats doesn’t make me a Republican.
That’s not a good dichotomy to live in.
I’m saying Democrats didn’t go far enough with their agenda, and it’s primarily because they stood in their own way via Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.
That would be agreeing with my sentiment then.
If you have yet to find people in real life who agree with me, and also yet to find the same people who think Republicans would’ve done a better job, then that’s what I’m saying.
I can agree with the need for Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to get in line with the party.
There needs to be consequences for them when they don’t.
Sinema is going to be voted out though, which is good!
They did vote.
They got your guy in power.
He did nothing.
You need to actually do something when you win if you want to stop this.
Stop punishing people for voting.
