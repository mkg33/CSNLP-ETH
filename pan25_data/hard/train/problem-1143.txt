“Son said that on Tuesday night, a student discovered that they lost VND1.4 million.
The other students staying in the same room suspected that a female student stole it.
The student did not say anything, rushed outside, screamed and cried, believing that she was wrongly accused.” This is so NOT logically right.
how can someone scream with the top of their long just from accusation.
so fucked up.
try and visit the vietnam subreddit.
the government are trying to cover up this incident and dismiss it.
the news are everywhere before this statement are out that the government are going to cover it up.
which they did.
there are a lot of witness in the school saying they are rape.
and also more than 5 are raped.
theres no fucking way all these witness are lying and theres no way all these 5+ girls are stealing money.. and all these witness in the school are saying the official are gonna cover it up as they used to before this statement comes out.
as vietnam society are confucian based.
its all about image and the government are trying to cover it up.
i dont see any reason whatsoever a girl would be screaming at the top of their lung over an accusation of money being stolen unless they are being raped.
the official are obv bullshit.
It's fake news.
They literally said the recorded screams were from girls who argued that money was stolen.
The girl cried because she felt accused.
Rape is severely punished in Vietnam and is not as widely spread as some Westerners want to make you believe.
