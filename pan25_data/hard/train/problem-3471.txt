Tornado fatality numbers are actually very small, and they're getting increasingly good at predicting outbreaks even days in advance.
As long as you have a decent plan in place before any storm approaches it's really not much to be concerned about, especially given how extremely rare tornadoes are compared with the immense scale of the landmasses where they can potentially form (and strong tornadoes much more so).
Earthquakes are much harder to predict and much harder to avoid the effects of.
There are many places across the world where earthquakes of this magnitude don't cause nearly this damage.
Saying "they can't prepare for it" is rediculous.
You really can’t though.
Look what happened with the storms last year.
Shit was so squirrelly they evacuated people INTO the storms path because of a sudden shift of the storm to the south of its projected heading.
And you have to have $$$ to leave.
Most people don’t have the financial stability to just up and walk away from their home for a week on short notice.
Or the money to house and feed themselves if something happens to their home.
