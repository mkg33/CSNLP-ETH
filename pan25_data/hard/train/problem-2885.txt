ETA: kind of horrified that a doctor refusing treatment is so common and not just my story.
Things I’ve learned: if treatment is refused ask for an official note to be made in your medical file.
Ask for a referral to specialist doctor who is more comfortable with tests and treatments.
Do not argue.
Ask for a copy of your medical record to ensure appropriate notes have been made.
This all holds your medical professional accountable.
Please advocate for yourselves.
Doctors usually mean well and may be jaded in their experiences, but ultimately you are the one dealing with the pain.
Please don’t feel like you are making a fuss.
You are not crazy, this is not normal to have this type of pain all the time, and you deserve to be taken seriously.
You cant use it unless a doctor certifies your scale of pain, which historically has gone pretty bad for women.
People wont believe how much pain a woman on her period can feel.
I know there's other conditions that cause painful periods too but fuck...
I've had Endo flair ups worse than child birth and I wanted to die.
I faint every other month and regularly (accidentally) over dose on pain meds.
This is a huge win for the endo community as well as other reproductive conditions.
