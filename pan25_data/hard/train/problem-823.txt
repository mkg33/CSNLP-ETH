They want to limit EBT to just the supplemental that is needed for women of child bearing years with infants and children.
Yep- for all the 'rights' clap back and conspiracy theories about the 'liberal left environmental terrorists who want to 'take away your meat/beef/etc."
- They are openly are proposing to legally eliminate meat from the 'poors'.
I posted the WIC lists for Iowa and MI.
They are meant to be supplemental to EBT/SNAP for the extra nutritional needs of nursing/pregnant mothers, infants and children.
Actually - anyone on EBT/SNAP in Iowa would be very limited as to what they could get at Trader Joe's.
Quinoa isn't on the list- neither is flax, chia, nuts, seeds, herbs (though MI allows parsley and cilantro), spices, butter, flower, cooking oil, fresh meats, wheat/grain alternatives, pasta sauce etc.
Only nursing mothers who do not get formula can have a specific type/size of canned tuna fish or salmon- no other meat for adults allowed.
Certain infants can get jarred bland meats.
There should be more fresh, whole foods, not canned meat ffs.
An argument perhaps exists for using it to maintain supply lines of spam snd sardines, but these ghouls arenâ€™t nearly that clever.
