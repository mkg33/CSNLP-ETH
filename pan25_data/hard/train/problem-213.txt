If voting didn’t matter, Republicans wouldn’t be making it as hard as possible to do it, limiting the time and method of it, and then denying the results when they lose.
In 2024 a lot of Republicans are going to try to pretend they dropped Trump because of this crime or that treason or some scandal that was "the last straw" but it will honestly be because of the 2022 midterms showing that he wasn't helping them gain power any more.
r/conservative is quite a read, they are back to blaming Trump and MAGA-republicans again now, but we saw how quickly dissent was crushed after the midterms in November, i can't imagine it will be allowed to go after Dear Leader for long this time either.
I’d love to believe Trumpism is here to stay with Trump their new Reagan (hyper speed the party to obsolescence) but sooner or later they are going to lose enough elections to realize that while “Trump stuff” really “pwnz the libs”, it also pwnz enough would-be Republican voters as well.
I find it really amusing that at this point no Republican will admit ever actually liking Bush.
I imagine in a few years Trump will finally be out of vogue and they’ll talk about Trump the way they talk about Bush now.
