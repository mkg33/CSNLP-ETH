I have a very nice Russian neighbor who I have known for many years who flies a Ukraine flag in his driveway.
When I asked him about the flag, he said I would be ashamed to fly the Russian Flag and is heartsick about what Putin has done to Ukraine.
We shared a Whisky (he hates Vodka) and I helped him put his Christmas Lights away.
Even Russians are human.
Don't get me wrong, the Ukrainians have been remarkable.
If you had to look at what "just' war is, then it would be difficult to not use Ukraine as an example of one.
I hope they hold, I hope Russia fails, and if their soldiers do not surrender then I hope thay Ukrainian one's prevail over them in conflict.
But only time will tell... Hopefully Ukraine wins battles decisively enough to avoid subjugation once and for all.
There will be a point where Russia will have to choose between conquering Ukraine and protecting their own borders.
Russia being on the offensive against a prepared Ukraine is a good thing.
They will have to send in armor and that's a whole lot harder to replace than people.
Yes, it is horribly unsustainable.
But Russia's collapse is a slow one and Ukraine doesn't have the luxury of waiting it out.
