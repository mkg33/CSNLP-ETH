Is that why he called them dangerous...
Multiple times, and hasn't spoken well about them... really ever?
Really seems like coddling and defending when you openly call them fascists.
First off, the proxy war is between liberal democracy and far-right fascism.
Not just the US vs Russia.
Sign me up.
As for procurement, yea that sounds crap and potentially corrupt but we do have elected oversight and a free media to root out the worst abuses, unlike the Russian / Chinese / Hungarian / etc side.
You can bet for every $1M Russia spends on a missile, the same amount or more disappears into yachts and blow.
The right in Europe is celebrating the Ukraine invasion as “finally, a military front against queer feminist communism, instead of all this talking.” Once again, sign me up on the side of queer feminist communism.
Bring it on, fashies.
Russian cascading failures in their Ukraine invasion are certain to keep US procurement and auditing on point for the foreseeable future.
We have been inflicting blow upon blow on the fascist war machine and the lesson the Military-Industrial complex is learning is that procurement, maintenance and quality are not just catchphrases but they separate freedom from slavery.
