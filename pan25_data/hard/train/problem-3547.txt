I don't think so man, Trump said if he lost "you won't hear from me again" and look what's going on?
Not sure why he said that when he knew it wasn't going to be true.
He is so deep in the narcissist pool he believes he did nothing wrong so there is no need for a pardon.
He's going to run whether the GOP want him or not.
His ego is so inflated that he thinks he can win.
Unless of course it's "rigged" again.
"It was rigged.
I actually won.
Ted cheated."
All that shit.
It's crazy, he's only got one fucking note.
He's gonna go nuclear.
He's 80, wears diapers, has an adderall addiction, is functionally illiterate, and is gonna pitch the mother of all hissy fits when he isn't picked to run for president.
I don’t think he’d run as a third party if he doesn’t get the nomination but he will sure as shit do everything in his power to sabotage anyone who beats him.
Definitely shouldn't, Donald There's no way you could legitimately lose the Republican primary, the only way you could ever possibly lose is if it's rigged.
Backing the person they rigged the primary for would make you the weakest loser in all of history.
If they steal this from you, you need to take them all down.
Maybe temporarily, but eventually we'll be back to a two party system.
The good news is, we have a shot of it being a system of two parties, and neither one is abject shit.
