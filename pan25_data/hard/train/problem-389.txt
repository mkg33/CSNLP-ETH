Now if Citizens United could be overturned, and we passed some laws with actual teeth (that we actually enforced) to stop dark money flows, then we could do away with super pacs, but until then they are a necessary evil.
And even with the massive amount of grass roots support he had, it still wasnt enough for him to beat easily the worst candidate (insofar as public perception not actual qualifications) the democrats could have put forward.
And why was that?
Because the system is rigged, the media constantly downplayed Bernie when they weren't actively blacking him out.
Super PACs shouldnt be a thing period, but as long as they are its nigh suicidal (in reference fo election chances) to not use them when your opposition is, youre kneecapping yourself from the word go.
Whats the difference between Bernie and the vast majority of politicians?
Bernie is passionate, Bernie has fire.
Bernie told people the truth, that the system is rigged, and not by some nebulous other, but the billionaire class.
Bernie has made a career out of turning being a hypocrite into a virtue.
People need to start realizing they're being played.
The irony is it's dark money from Russia through these Super PACs that has led to this cult following.
Of course Bernie knows this, just as he knows several dark money PACs ran ads supporting him in 2016 and 2020.
But his brand is outrage against the "establishment", usually for things the "establishment" has nothing to do with.
