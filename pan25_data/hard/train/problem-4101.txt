I get that.
That ice melting is is bad, its gonna raise sea levels and stuff.
I just want to understand that if the glacier melts into the ocean, all that freshwater goes to waste.
Is there really no way to save it?
It makes somewhat sense.
It just makes me sad that the glacier is melting anyway and once it all dissolves into the ocean, all that freshwater is gone and we are never getting it back.
So far its just been 'this glacier will start to retreat in the next 5 years and will take 100 to 200 years to finish melting'.
We are already past the point of stopping glacial melt like this.
Far past.
The only questions and options at this point are "how bad?"
and "how fast?
".
Yes.
And again carbon taxes are only going to be effective if alternate sources are already available in abundance.
The only way for this to happen is if we make green energy based consumption way way more plentiful and (more importantly) way cheaper BEFORE we implement carbon taxes.
If we don't find a way to make greenhouse gasses so repugnant and fiscally irresponsible via price economics we will never wean ourselves off of oil and gas.
We need to make greenhouse gasses so painful to consume and renewables so incredibly cheap that it becomes fiscally irresponsible for families.
We need to adopt a loss leader strategy for green energy until greenhouse gasses are completely eliminated from discretionary consumption.
