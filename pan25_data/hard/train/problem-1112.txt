The fact that those types of people get offended by statements like that really says a lot about them and what they think of themselves.
When people talk about misogynistic and violent men I don't get offended because I know they exist and I know they aren't referring to me.
They hate other people talking about that stuff because they know the feelings they harbor.
It's similar to when certain types of people get really offended when people talk about racism.
When people talk about racism I know they aren't talking about me, so I don't get offended.
If people talking about racism offends someone, you can pretty much guarantee that they are a racist.
They think that anything short of assaulting someone while spewing racist insults is not racism.
I like to tell them that they don't get to define racism based on what they think is acceptable.
All I usually get is puzzled looks.
They can't conceive of a world where their opinions aren't well received.
Probably just a result of living in an echo chamber full of idiots who lack the reasoning skills to question each other.
