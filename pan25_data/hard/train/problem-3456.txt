"It's become clear that the American public cannot be entrusted with the responsibility of democracy.
The founding fathers foresaw this when they created the electoral college.
We're only expanding that function to all elections, ensuring that the duties of government will be carried out by dedicated officials wise enough to select what's best for the future of this nation.
".
I can see that.
I think that's part of it but I see it as a part of a larger picture.
I actually think when team capitalism defeated 20th century state socialism and communism in 1991, all bets were off.
Of course I understand that.
This is the US.
We hate connecting dots and our history.
We prefer nostalgia.
When we focus just on "Trumpism", we lose an opportunity to look at the entire ideological Right, the entire Republican party, and to do an honest accounting of how the ideology of the Right was normalized and humanized in this country over the past century.
And those people are every bit a part of the Right as any conservative, Republican, etc.
The ideological chasm between them and anyone else who identifies as a conservative is slim.
Trying to segment out "MAGA people" from anyone else on the Right is dangerous and wrong.
It's also a missed opportunity, as I said, to speak to what exactly the ideological Right is about and all the ways that ideology was normalized over the past century.
