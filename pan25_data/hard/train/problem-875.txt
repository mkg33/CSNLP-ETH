I don't understand why the government stopped buying.
(I'm from Europe btw.)
I can imagine you want private healthcare, as that is mostly about your own health.
However vaccins are at least as much about not infecting others as it is about not getting sick.
Societal benefits of covid vaccins are huge, but who's going to pay 100 dollar to get a vaccin?
"Until now, the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have been purchased by the government and offered to Americans for free.
In the latest federal contract from July, Moderna's updated booster shot cost the government $26 per dose, up from $15â€“$16 per dose in earlier supply contracts, the Journal notes.
Similarly, the government paid a little over $30 per dose for Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine this past summer, up from $19.50 per dose in contracts from 2020.
Wow, Pfizer's manufactured and sold over 1.5B vax in the first month and experienced no costs?
Cuz that's what you're suggesting when you say they made back $30B in costs selling at $19.50 a shot.
Do we count how many companies that tried to make mRNA and failed?
As an example, if it costs $30B to do the R&D, and you have around 10% chance of success, then the true cost is like $300B.
