I think the cigarette culture will die much sooner there as more and more stores will stop carrying cigarettes due to not enough demand, although it might take many decades to reach that point.
By banning cigarette sales to people born after a certain year, do you really think that will somehow make more people smoke?
Well I guess you obviously think that, but like I said, if you took 3 seconds to google anything about it you would know it has done the opposite.
Less people are starting to smoke directly because of these measures.
Because of previous measures already taken very few people still smoke.
They are already taxed through the roof and a pack of 30 costs $40/pack.
Young people almost exclusively vape now anyways.
If you smoke now you can continue to smoke.
Smokers I have no problem with, never had anyone walk up and blow smoke on me.
And if I see someone smoke I dont go standing next to them and breath in their 2nd hand smoke.

And if you smoke outside and dont blow it directly on someone (who the fk does that?
), how are u affected?
