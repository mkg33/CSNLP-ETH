Yes.
Its not Hungary who has the threat of Russian invasion hanging over their heads, so Orban takes Putin's money and KGB aid and plays these games in NATO and the EU.
Yeah, kicking out Orban’s Hungary would be a very clear message that NATO won’t tolerate fascist belligerents within its ranks, and Erdogan might be a little triggered by that notion.
As a Hungarian I call for the immediate review of Hungary in Nato - I would add Eurozone but countries do have a right to refuse policies and its a more convoluted agreement, but Nato should tell them what the stick looks like.
If you’re saying the decision to admit Finland and Sweden is only a “danger” to Hungary because it will cut into the amount of money Orban will be able to get for himself and his cronies through illicit means, I’ll agree with you.
😉.
Turkey is literally holding Finland and Sweden hostage over this because they don’t agree with Erdogan’s ethnic cleansing/genocide.
Mind you, it’s not like Sweden and Finland are about to go marching into Turkey to stop it, or are levying heavy sanctions on Turkey.
It’s just they won’t aid and abet Erdogan by sending refugees back to Turkey to be murdered.
I think Turkey is biding it’s time.
It doesn’t want to look like the bad guy when Hungary is gleefully volunteering for the position.
But I’ll take your word that you are correct in that there’s nothing specifically preventing Hungary from denying entry for any reason they want.
So I guess it could even be for an absurd reason.
Maybe Orban propositioned Marin, Marin refused, and now Orban wants to get revenge.
