With all that said, after a pretty well managed temporary zero COVID policy (we really didn't have big outbreaks until omicron iirc, and we had strict but relatively short localized lockdowns) and a very successful vaccination program, the government still had to take the plunge.
Like the other commenter said, there was a surge in cases while things balanced out but they withstood it.
Right, but over here (I also live in Vietnam), the medical system is also not as sturdy as in the USA.
It's surprisingly good, with a variety of hospitals in different price ranges for different needs and incomes, and local hospitals/clinics available even in relatively small towns etc, but at the end of the day Vietnam is still a poor country and there's a limit to how good it can be.
It's poorer than China as well, of course.
China not only has more resources, they're a hundred times more authoritarian than here.
They're totally responsible for the massive hesitancy around vaccines there because they 100% control the news, they shot themselves in the foot and to this day I still cannot fathom why.
It's not even that they simply allowed misinformation, they actively spread it about vaccines!
Their citizens don't even want Chinese vaccines.
Even so, unlike Vietnam they could just straight up force people to take the vaccine and their population would accept it with minimal grumbling compared to if you tried that here.
Yes, that's what I said, Vaccination prevents death not infection, but since people still feel sick, they will come to the hospital anyway.
the risk of overwhelming the healthcare system in the short term is still there.
