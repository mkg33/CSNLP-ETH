That isnâ€™t really the problem I have with it.
The problem is that the problem is never fundamentally a question of printing money, which is what lowering interest rates effectively does.
What the world needs is not more bank notes, it is more of the stuff people are lacking, not the paper or digital version that they use to pay for it.
So the universities will end up with extra cash, and students will just see higher tuition instead of higher interest rates.
Then arises the question of what purpose high tuition fees serve.
Certainly, a young generation with lower debt would have more spending power to stimulate the local economy, and a higher likelihood to invest their time and resources in entrepreneurship, or to enrich the value of their local communities by volunteering.
In contrast, a higher debt forces them to pursue several simultaneous employment at the detriment of their mental and physical well-being.
For society, the low-debt option seems to generate both more economical value and fewer associated costs.
Eliminating interest on student debt is a very reasonable solution.
I do think that students should have to pay some amount of tuition to go to postsecondary, otherwise everyone would treat it like second high school and spend 4 years of public money just fucking around.
But this way the people starting with the fewest assets don't have to start their careers by paying their tuition back with interest while the wealthiest just jump straight into all the benefits of a university degree.
Not only is this great for people with loans, such as myself, it also makes education much more affordable for more people that would otherwise be deterred due to costs.
