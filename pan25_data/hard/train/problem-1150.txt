Then, they removed handguns from the NFA to get the law passed.
Buuuuut left the loophole closing SBR and SBS categories in.
Because :clowns:
SB Tactical alone estimated they've sold or licensed some 9 million braces in one of their hearings.
Originally, the national firearms act of 1934 was going to defacto ban handguns.
Some bright spark pointed out that one could simply cut down a rifle or shotgun barrel and stock to make an unregistered handgun.
So, the loophole closer categories of short barreled rifles and short barreled shotguns were added to the NFA.
The reason for that is that short-barreled rifles have the greater capability of long guns, yet are easier to conceal, like a pistol.
But certain so-called stabilizing braces are designed to just attach to pistols, essentially converting them into short-barreled rifles to be fired from the shoulder.
Therefore, they must be treated in the same way under the statute.
It makes no sense.
The problem is that they give you the capacity of a rifle, but are easier to conceal.
Therefore, we have to ban pistols with braces....
Which still have the capacity of a pistol.
But are harder to conceal.
