Not only that, Afghanistan and Iraq were completely different in scope, geography, civilian population density and enemy force makeup so they're a different discussion from each other, let alone any other war not fought by the US.
The US didn't intentionally execute civilians en masse.
Never kidnapped thousands of civilians to its' own territory.
Never intentionally bomb civilian shelters clearly marked with the word "children".
Never annexed territories from Iraq or Afghanistan using illegal referendums.
Never mass rape and torture civilians as part of their genocidal campaign.
Never launched massive missile attacks clearly aimed at civilian infrastructures and residential areas to retaliate against enemy successes in the field.
The US never executed POWs (or their own exchanged POWs, like the one from today) in intentionally brutal ways while filming the whole process, ISIS style.
Saying that russia is wrong is not just the moral thing to do, it's the right thing because of the sheer evil this country has become.
Which moral authority do you have to lecture that russia is wrong.
Russia is literally following the same way USA invaded iraq and Afghanistan.
Ukraine is not the rock india is going to kill off its very reliable and time-tested relationship with Russia.
if india wants to turn itself onto the same failed states as nk, iran, and russia, so they can continue to support genocide in Ukraine, so be it.
if india wants to continue side with russia, and to support openly genocide, time to cut it off from the west, and make it pay the price of supporting genocide, and turn it into a failed state on the levels of iran and nk.
