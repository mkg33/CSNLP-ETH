Under every post of a climate protestor blocking a road for the environment or something are a million replies saying "i'm going to drive more now because of this".
England fans literally did the same thing in 2018.
Trashed Amsterdam, over 100 arrests, dozens of officers and randoms assaulted.
All this after they won.
Im not moaning about anything, its the opposite lmao.
My point is your point is nuts.
I say this as someone who's lived in large american cities that got overrun and blown the fuck out almost every single time our football/hockey team won/lost.
Pats, Steelers, Cavs, Raiders, Lakers, you name it, the fans stir shit.
I mean, why is it always football fans?
Like, I never hear about that much riots, beating people up, slurs, hate, vandalising city, from any other sports fans.
I get caring about sports, people can get attached to their idols, personally, I was in tears last weekend when I was watching the last interview of my favourite Formula 1 driver, who is retiring.
But somehow, the worst thing Formula 1 fans will do i boo some driver they didn't want to win, which is still shitty, but relatively harmless, and happens quite rarely and in specific places too.
In Poland we don't have much trouble when it comes to national team fans, but we have A LOT when it comes to local, regional clubs, most of scribbles on the walls, because it's not even graffiti, is from the fans who either "celebrate" their club or insult the other ones, sometimes in really vulgar, or even antisemitic way.
Or people throw petards after the race, beat sb up for cheering the wrong team.
