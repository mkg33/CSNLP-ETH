If I recall he wasn’t filming a segment, he want to practice drawing the pistol, which doesn’t require firing it, and 100% doesn’t require you pointing it at the director and crew and firing.
The investigation has proven that Baldwin did in fact pull the trigger, the weapon wasn’t found to be defective.
he is just trying to cover his ass.
You also have to realized that Baldwin was the executive producer for the film, and had a key role of hiring poorly trained non-union workers to keep the cost down.
There had been safety issues on set before the shooting.
Some of the first rules of handling a firearm are 1.
To always treated it like it is loaded unless you have it breached and can see for absolutely certain no round is in the chamber and 2.
Never point a gun at something you don't intend to destroy.
He knew there were real firearms on set and he screwed around with one.
It was negligent behavior.
Sorry, I agree that this is a failure on the armorer's part 100%, but as I understood it he knew full well they had real fire arms on set and still chose to ignore basic gun safety.
There are a few thing no one gets to be lazy on.
Lock me in a room with no live rounds within 20 miles of the spot and I still should not dick around with pointing a gun at someone.
It was negligent, but criminally negligent?
That is beyond my judgment.
I just think anyone, actor or otherwise, who will be handling a firearm should always treat basic safety as the Word of God at all times.
I understand your point of view, but any gun that can be loaded with live munitions should never be treated as a prop gun.
Hell, you can injure someone being irresponsible with blanks.
Legally punishable or not, it was foolish behavior.
None of this would have happened if the armorer had done their job, and none of this would have happened if he had treated the gun like a gun and not a toy.
