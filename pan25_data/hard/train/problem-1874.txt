The fun thing about the grid is that in most places it's larger than states.
Minnesota is on the grid and the eastern interconnect which means that it shares it's grid directly with and bids into the same power markets as Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, and many other states.
It's power can come from as far away as Maine or Florida in theory.
Saying that you want to decarbonize a state's sources is good, but doesn't necessarily mean your electricity is clean.
The big fat lie is that renewables are cleaner and reduce emissions, they dont...they displace emissions.
The world still relies on products made from petrochemicals and coal.
You can only remove so many coal plants before you increase energy prices...and economically it wont work.
Global emissions went up during that time because people started burning coal in other parts of the world.
I agree that we're not currently on a path to climate stabilization, but a bill like this actually moves us in that direction.
It's not going to be enough to get us to stabilize the climate at 1.5&deg;C above what it was in the late 1800s, but going to zero in the next couple decades is enough to .
That we limit how bad things are going to get is a big deal.
