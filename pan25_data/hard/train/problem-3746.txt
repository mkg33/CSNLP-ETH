I see them as addressing 2 separate issues.
We need to end gerrymandering in order to make the representation fairer.
Meanwhile we need rcv to enable a greater diversity of candidates and thus get more voter involvement.
You need both, but the pro to tackling rcv sooner is there's been less bitter opposition to it and you can implement it extremely wide at a local and state level to gain support.
Gerrymandering requires bitter fights at the state level that can easily be torpedoed by bad actors.
RCV helps a lot with republican party extremism and disenchanted voters that refuse to vote for what they view as the least worst option, but it won't fix gerrymandering since you only get to vote for candidates in your district.
Even if every district had rcv with the way republicans drew the lines they could still win without a popular majority.
It was extremely effective in 2012 (based on the 2010 Census and the gerrymandering done from that), and got republicans a 33 seat lead even though democrats received 1 million more votes overall than republicans did.
