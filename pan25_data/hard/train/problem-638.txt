Would you really?
I quit eating beef and pork for climate reasons and that might be my limit.
I still cheat.
I don't mind recycling, but supposedly that doesn't really help much.
I don't think I'd move if I had a long commute.
I'm also living in a much larger house than I need, but again, I don't want to move.
Still, it seems like I'm doing more than most people I know.
It seems like everyone's car is bigger than mine and they're driving like maniacs.
No one else is bringing their own grocery bags.
It seems like no one else cares or even thinks about what things are going to be like when climate change gets really bad.
I think we need to stop with the doomsday climate talk.
There is real cause to be optimistic about recent events.
I'm actually fairly optimistic about the trajectory we seem to be on.
I definitely think we missed our chance to limit warming to under 1.5 degree Celsius, but I think even just a few years ago warming of 4-5 degree Celsius was on the table, but we seem to be on a lower trajectory more like 2-3 degree Celsius.
I just think a doomsday message that we're all screwed and there is no hope for civilization breeds cynicism.
And despite how bad 2C warming is, every additional amount of warming is worse.
There needs to be hope that we are making progress and I actually think we are making progress (relative to 4-5C warming).
I think it is unrealistic to think humanity is going to make any kind of dent in climate change.
We don’t cooperate at the best of times even when we want to, and at least half the world doesn’t want to.
Sorry everyone, but you probably ought to start on that ark, or bunker, or whatever you think will help.
