As a lifelong Virginian, I can tell you that until I started college at a state school (in 2005, mind you) that MLK Day was more commonly known around here as 'Robert E Lee Day'.
In 2000, they attempted to do a split holiday.
It's dumb.
That's the dumbest reason to not teach something I've ever heard.
If you have opposing viewpoints, you teach them both or mention the contentious nature of the subject.
You don't just pretend like it didn't exist.
And everything is subject to change.
That's why new books are written and updated every decade or so.
I'm sure you've seen "Edition " on plenty of books.
That's my point.
If you're migrating, and you end up staying for whatever reason, you're still not an immigrant.
Most of them were following resources.
They weren't moving to settle or colonize.
No, they're migrants, who happen to be the first inhabitants of the land.
They moved from one place to another looking for resources.
They didn't move with the express goal of staying permanently or colonizing.
They are indigenous.
Bud I have news for you the proper term is Indigenous people not Native Americans.
America did not exist as even a concept then.
Indigenous people came to this land over 25,000 years ago via Beringia, and they didnâ€™t murder, rape and steal land from some other tribe that happened to be here.
Comparing them to immigrants who did just that to claim the land as their own is white washing what really happened here.
Removing facts from school curriculum and inserting your own alternative reality is propaganda.
