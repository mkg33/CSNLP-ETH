The TS reference was in another article; I don’t remember which one.
At this early stage I’m not going to even try to defend a detail like that.
I doubt any reporter has an accurate picture yet, and I might have mixed up the facts.
Republican response?
“That’s not important.
We want to know why Twitter didn’t let us publish Hunter Biden’s dick pics.
We found them on the laptop we stole.”.
“… a Trump aide (who works for Save America PAC) had previously copied those same pages onto a laptop and thumb drive—the aide reportedly did not realize they were classified.”.
"a Trump aide (who works for Save America PAC) had previously copied those same pages onto a laptop and thumb drive—the aide reportedly did not realize they were classified".
The aide may have been unwitting, but someone needed a security clearance to obtain those documents before they were (illegally) copied.
Because if I was taking documents from the president that said top secret, i would definitely think twice about where copies of it ended up.
Which is very different from working at a small company that doesn't handle national security... it's kind of a shitty hypothetical if I'm honest lol.
