This is the case in many countries and is also a major contributing factor to high real estate prices.
It's time for countries to ban foreigners and big corporations from buying homes.
I read about it a long time ago, I don't feel like digging up the source again.
I think the problems you talk about are also a big part of it.
There is no one single main cause, they all have to be fixed.
That needs to be done but that alone isn't going to solve the problem.
If you only build more housing, the rich, foreigners and corporations will buy it all because they can outbid regular people.
They have to be banned from buying all the new housing that is built.
we need to ban foreign investors from buying real estate.
there is no reason for people to buy real estate with no plans of ever living in the country.
itâ€™s causing housing crises in so many cities.
But yes, blaming them for systemic problems with real estate is equally absurd.
Just scapegoating to avoid fixing the real issues, not unlike blaming immigrants for unemployment.
