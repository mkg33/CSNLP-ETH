afaik they aren't buying time waiting for western vaccines to be imported.
The Chinese government is specifically preventing western vaccines from being imported in favor of locally made vaccines.
China’s outright refusal and unfair trade practice is the reason why they arent getting the much needed efficacious vaccines.
It was only 4 years ago did they finally give the nod to Western vaccines for fucking HPV (cancer vaccine!
).
Very much this.
Long term vs short term - and without the politics pressure of elections and etc that have made western leaders focus even more on the short term.
Because they can do statistics, tend to think long term and are not afraid of short term democratic consequences.
This is absolutely not an endorsement of their system, which is a horror show, but an observation that their system produces very different incentives than western democracies.
I’m many ways I doubt the dead are their biggest concern.
Long-covid and permanent disability are.
If you let your population catch covid twice a year on average, and there’s a 5% chance of long covid each time, after 5 years 40% of your population has measurable disabilities.
If you let covid rip through a society and everyone catches it twice a year after five year roughly half your population is going to have long-covid to varying degrees.
As we live with covid longer and know more about it long-covid, aka long term damage and disability, is becoming more obvious.
Even in mild cases there seems to be a 5-10% rate of long-covid in various forms.
“susceptible to long covid” makes it sound like it’s a separate infection.
Long covid is just the name we’ve given to permanent damage left behind.
Like paralyzation was “long polio”.
It’s not really about if you “get” long covid or not.
It’s whether the accumulated lung and vascular damage from each infection is noticeable.
