The handling of the rail strike issue, to put it lightly, greatly irritated many on the left, and will likely remain in the thoughts of many for quite a while.
I've taken the position of believing that a breakaway would just cause us to be spoilers and play into the hands of the GOP, but the anger is, from my perspective, understandable.
The current state of affairs from the DSA working within the Democratic Party is an alliance of convenience against the GOP.
The end result at this point is that contradictions like this happen, and if the GOP were to fall from political relevancy, it would not be completely surprising to see the progressives, social democrats, and democratic socialists break off.
That and if the Democratic Party were actually concerned about "playing into the hands of the GOP" through a split with anyone to their Left, they would function very differently.
I just have to ask though, how is the Democratic Party shown itself as anything separate from neoliberal capitalism?
Both parties ultimately serve the interests of capital above all else.
Thatâ€™s why we see corporate profits skyrocket during social unrest, pandemics, and other crises.
If aligning yourself as a socialist means upholding capitalism through the Democratic Party, how is it any different?
