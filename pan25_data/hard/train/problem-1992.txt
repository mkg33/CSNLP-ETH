No the mechanism is simply the rest of the NATO countries saying "we're kicking you out regardless of there being no written mechanism to do so.
What the fuck are you going to do about it?!?
".
No, it's not.
It's the real world where countries will break a treaty in a heartbeat if it benefits them more than it harms them.
The only reason Turkey is still in NATO is because the rest of the counties still see more positives than negatives.
Pretty sure the way the alliance reads Turkey would be attacking a NATO country and get countered by the rest of NATO.
Sarcasm aside, both sides are aware an attack on the other would bring the rest of NATO to put the offending country on their shit list right?
You’re responding to a comment talking about a NATO country attacking another NATO country unprovoked.
You think the consequence of that is “well, you better hope you’re not attacked sometime in the future or we won’t come to your defense.” Even IF that’s how it worked, who WOULD come to their defense if 5 other NATO countries invaded the aggressor afterwards?
Well, if there’s zero consequences for attacking a fellow nato member, why not just every other nato country invade, overthrow the government, and have the world no longer recognize them as a country?
We can call that plan B.
That’s never been specified in the articles.
There’s nothing about a member attacking another member.
I’m pretty sure you said that yourself.
So, since invoking article 5 means an attack on one is an attack on everyone, you’re ok with Turkey being erased from the map but not being removed from NATO because of “rules”?
