Ok, so to summarize your essay: “cults are not all the same”.
Perhaps not, but when the majority of senseless acts of mass violence are committed it turns out there is an cultish or religious extremist POV involved somewhere in there.
"It is not accurate or appropriate to make generalizations about people who commit violent crimes based on their religious background.
It is also not possible to determine the percentage of people who kill police officers with a religious background, as this information is not widely available and would be difficult to accurately track.
Violent crime, including the killing of police officers, is a complex issue with many potential contributing factors, and it would be inappropriate to attribute it to any single factor such as religion.
It is important to focus on the individual circumstances and motivations behind each act of violence, rather than making broad assumptions based on religious or other demographic factors.
".
Nope, our leaders in the US often make a big point to show they are "religious" yet I find it mostly to be put on for show as I know leaders of nations must make decisions that God wouldn't approve of.
