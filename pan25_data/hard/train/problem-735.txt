Not to mention the intercepted phone calls from Russian troops talking about it, including conversations where they casually mention it to their wives and the wives encourage it.
But I question that any significant proportion of Russian wives are actively encouraging their HUSBANDS to rape civilian women they find.
I see a lot of people questioning the veracity of these claims - not that Russian soldiers are not raping - mostly people questioning wives encouraging it.
But the claim isnâ€™t rape and torture is widespread, the claim is that wives of soldiers are actively encouraging them to rape.
Happy to be shown a poll of Russian wives to show how pro-rape they all are, but one audio recording of one or two fanatical wives saying "go rape" isn't enough to make this a credible claim.
seems to be pulling together some sources which show that there's a fair few such calls that have been intercepted, but tbh I want to see some context: how many calls intercepted, how often did rape come up (wtf), how often did the wife encourage it.
