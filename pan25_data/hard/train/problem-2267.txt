There is no parallel between Biden and Trump in this matter.
Stating as such doesn’t make you partisan.
Pretending like there is simply to appear nonpartisan is an abandonment of objectivity.
Yes.
This is not a presidential scandal.
Unless additional evidence is found to warrant a special counsel.
Other than that..this is pencil pushing paper work.
The fact that Trump is being investigated shouldn’t dictate whether Biden deserves a special counsel.
Can we discuss Biden's case without even mentioning trump?
Bottom line is that Biden shouldn't have had a single government document stored in his think tank office or in his garage while he was ex-VP.
And even if the docs found at his garage were brought there after 2021 they were unsecured and stored improperly.
All I know is this; they shouldn't have been in his office or stored in his garage.
Biden really fucked up and I'll be pissed if it influences the special counsel looking into trump.
For the record, republicans not only see this as the same, they think Biden situation is worse.
Word in their bubble is that "trump declassified but a VP can't".
