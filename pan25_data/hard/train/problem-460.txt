And yes, I am using "voting Republican" as a proxy for "70 year old men should be making my reproductive decisions for me".
But I honestly don't see how that's invalid.
And it's not unrealistic.
His ego is enough that he feels he is owed another shot.
He has zero party loyalty (hell, his 2000 run was with the reform party).
He is still raking in huge amounts of donation dollars, which we know from other GOP leaders that he is not sharing with the party.
And he would 100% do it just to spite DeSantis for stealing his thunder.
I mentioned it elsewhere (and I'm sure others have as well), but DeSantis winning the GOP primary, and Trump taking his whole MAGA line independent would be such a massive blessing.
Neither of them have enough pull to take it themselves, and the split would all but guarantee it goes to whoever the Dems put up.
Be it Biden or someone else.
Oh, he knows Biden won.
He's too smart not to.
But he pretends to think that the election was "stolen" in order to keep grifting off the T\\\\ supporters.
As soon as the GOP extricates itself from its unholy embrace of Cheeto Mussolini, he'll be back to bashing him like he was during the 2016 primary.
