We came so close to abolishing it back in the 1970s too.
It was the default position of almost everyone in the country.
A 1968 Galllup poll showed 80% of Americans were in favor of changing to a direct popular vote for President.
Imagine what a different America we'd be in right now if they had passed this and also abolished the filibuster.
Even if you were to accept that mostly silly notion, the more commonly raised idea is that you could just first pass an ammendment that removes that sentence, as the suffrage of a state in the Senate would not change by removing that sentence.
State borders do not change, so while they aren't "gerrymanderable", people moving between states can impact how an election turns out, even if all the people that change states vote exactly the same as in their old state.
That is a problem.
Uncapping is absolutely a huge issue, but calling the EC not really a problem is... unsubstantiated?
National election overall outcomes should not change if you change where people in the nation are.
State election overall outcomes should not change if you change where people in the state are.
Municipal election overall outcomes should not change if you change where people in the municipality are.
Anything else means there is at least some gaming of the system possible by the distribution of land ownership and/or redrawing of lines (or of new state lines as rare as it is these days).
