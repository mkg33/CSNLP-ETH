Police will use the reason that "He pointed a gun at me" as justification for shooting every Black kid who carries a gun while cheering white kids with guns as "keeping their community safe".
I guess Missouri wants to kill those Black kids before they have a chance to have children of their own.
Are you suggesting Republicans want to allow minors to carry guns because they want black children to be murdered?
If not, I don't know where you're going with this...
Not just "people", minors.
We penalise minors for things they haven't done yet all the time, for a million reasons.
Not the least of which is the fact that they're more likely to do stupid shit than older people.
Wanting an explanation doesn't mean I'm going to agree with any explanation given.
What if you responded saying: "The reason Americans are so obsessed with guns is actually because Julie Andrews is secretly the leader of the Illuminati and it heavily influences people at all levels to champion gun rights in order to overthrow the government.
".
Yes.
They are fascists.
After January 6th we'd all be absolute fools to think they are after anything other than an authoritarian form of government.
History is repeating itself.
