I know far more people on the left here in Germany who support Ukrainians than back in north america.
For some reason lots of Marxists in the us are pro putin and it's pathetic.
Whereas with hundreds of leftists here in Berlin, anti putin chants are met with cheers, and putin supporters are assumed to be antivaxxers (Querdenker) and/or AfD supporters.
Some of the Die Linke leadership notwithstanding, I have yet to meet a left party member who supports the russian invasion here in Berlin.
The support for Putin's Russia in Germany comes mainly from three groups: Russian immigrants, Far-right idiots and a few far-left idiots who have not quite caught on that Russia is no longer communist and NATO are the good guys this time.
Its a lot of people age 50+ who seem to have forgotten how bad they felt living in the former DDR (east german region formerly controled by russia) which tend to support Russia/Putin in this conflict and who refuse to believe in most of the atrocities the russian army has committed in ukraine.
Oh and the same people (for some reason) also are super susceptible to Fake News, Russian Propaganda and Conspiracy Sh\t ... not only regarding the war in ukraine.
The only time I've seen that 14000 number is from lying dumbasses trying to spread disproven Russian propaganda.
Maybe you are talking about something different though, so very clearly and with sources why don't you explain that.
