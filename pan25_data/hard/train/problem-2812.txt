Yeah I lived through a large earthquake in Indonesia and learned a lot about earthquakes in the aftermath.
The truly scary part is not knowing if youve already felt the main quake or it it's still to come.
The first, larger earthquake created a lot of damage and put many thousands of people at risk.
We know from current reports that between Turkiye and Syria, that over 1,400 people have died due to the first event.
00:13 UCT \- Good morning - Guardian has finished live coverage - Nearly 4,000 people dead in Turkiye and Syria.
14,000 injured and over 7,000+ rescued.
Hoping we get more good news as more teams arrive.
Location \- 4km SSE of Ekinözü, Turkiye.
This is still in the same area that has felt the brunt of the first 7.8 earthquake.
However this location is further North from the border of Syria.
This also means that villages, towns and cities within Turkiye's interior who likely felt the first quake, may have felt this quake more.
I was a kid when we got hit by the 1999 earthquake here and i was actually in Istanbul so i felt it, hard.
This one i don't feel due to distance but it is giving me more horror.
Freakin out honestly..
