Republicans have been in control of Texas for decades now and when confronted with the dangers that their rickety power grid and inadequate water supply pose to their constituents they try to deflect and find a way to blame Democrats or wokeness or goblins.
Their idea of neutral is that anyone who isn't white, male, cis-gender, straight, and Christian needs to STFU.
These are the same kind of people who quote MLK's "I have a dream" speech as espousing the need for colorblindness.
They intentionally leave out his bits about how the US was still screwing over black people.
It needs to be screamed from the rooftops.
Their campaign for "neutrality" has a poison pill in it: provisioning the white, straight, cis-gender, Christian, male dominated demographic that is freaking out about how they don't have all the power anymore and have to share this world with non-whites and trans people.
White supremacists keep throwing out these stories about totally unqualified black people getting things because of affirmative action, and those stories are nothing but bald face lies being used to justify discrimination.
