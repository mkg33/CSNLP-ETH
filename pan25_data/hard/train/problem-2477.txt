Called it years ago.
I said repeatedly that when RvW gets overturned it will actually take the wind out of the forced birth movement (after their initial celebration of course).
Anyway….
I know that doesn’t help you or make you feel better about your situation.
I’m sorry you are stuck in such a backwards place right now.
The women of Nebraska (Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, etc) do not deserve to go through this.
There have already been numerous horror stories and sadly there will be more.
I am privileged enough to live in a state that has codified abortion rights into our state constitution.
I hope someday Nebraska will do the same.
Legislatures, like yours, are going to face referendums on laws like this.
Most states, when put to a vote of the people, will vote to legalize abortion.
Some, of course, will not but over time they will find themselves in an ever shrinking minority.
Meanwhile there is nothing to rally around at the national level.
Attempting a national ban on abortion will not go over well and that message has been sent loud and clear this last election cycle.
As for the March, they're doing it because they want to ban abortion everywhere.
They won't stop marching unless abortion is banned worldwide.
