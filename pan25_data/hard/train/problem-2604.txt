They got their loan forgiveness, climate spending, and saw RvW overturned, yet still were only 10-12% of the vote share this election.
If Congress authorizes student loans and requires them to be paid back, the Dept of Ed can't just unilaterally decide not to do so and just forgive them all whenever it feels like it.
Regardless of how you feel about student loan forgiveness, executive agencies have to operate as Congress has authorized them to.
If Congress didn't explicitly authorize loan forgiveness and the Dept of Ed tries to do it anyways, it gets challenged in court.
Which is why these cases are working their way through since the question remains if the Dept of Ed has this power.
No it doesn't.
ACB just refused two emergency appeals for the SC to hear the case and pause the forgiveness.
She refused both appeals in order to let the lower courts decide first, which is the normal judicial process.
Wait how does this work if the supreme court refused to take it up?
I really just donâ€™t know and would love if someone would explain this to me.
I thought if the supreme court wouldnt take it up that was the end of it.
SCOTUS is shit, but they didn't stop it this time, the 8th circuit court of appeals did.
Amy Coney Barrett, surprisingly, chose to not halt forgiveness.
