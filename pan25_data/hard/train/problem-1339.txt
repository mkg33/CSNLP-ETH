That's laughable considering SCOTUS judges don't have term limits yet corruption is endless with them.
Also Congress can keep electing the same trash endlessly and they can make laws, but the President limited terms and cannot make laws.
Explain the logic.
The Founders didn't see the dangers of SCOTUS judges, they didn't think they can be "partisan" when they clearly can be.
There ought to be a way for people to remove any official regardless of how long their terms are, if any.
Politician then makes suggestions that tenure should be removed (to make it easier to fire those who stood up to him).
But one of the main rationales behind tenure is to protect faculty against students who don’t always realize what good and bad teaching is or that faculty obligations go far beyond the classroom.
Someone please correct me if I’m wrong, but aren’t professors granted tenure by other tenured professors?
It’s sounds like the party of no government oversight wanting to have oversight over a self governing group.
Once again the party of small government seeks to insinuate itself into areas it does not belong.
They are not conservatives; they are the fascist far right!
