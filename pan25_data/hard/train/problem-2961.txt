Yeah I think he should defer them until Jan 19, 2025.
If a GOP candidate wins the presidency, let it be their problem to resume payments after 5 years for people.
I keep thinking retroactively setting the interest rate at 0% would help way more people and by a bigger dollar amount.
That way people can still pay back what they borrowed, but at least then the government wouldn't be in the business of profiting on the debt of American workers.
Most people I know who still have student loan balance 10, 15 years after graduating have already more than paid back what they borrowed.
Student loan borrowers also pay taxes—if they have jobs that earns less than $billions—so it is not really the same comparison.
Because the entire U.S. financial system depends solely on student debt payments and the interest those debts accrue during the payment life cycle, right?

I totally agree with you.
These MAGidiots who voted for the TRE45ONOUS orange nut job will fall in line and claim that the radical liberal left is just looking for a hand out.
