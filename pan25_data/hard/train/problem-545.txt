Correct me if i'm wrong but don't think you can accidentally detonate nuclear weapons by destroying them, though it would disperse radioactive material over small area.
Also, hitting a nuclear weapon with another weapon doesn't cause a nuclear detonation.
If it did, there would have been a lot bigger tragedies the last fifty years as planes have crashed with them aboard...
Get them back?
I suspect that Israel would shoot planes out of the sky, sink ships, and bomb any land vehicles even suspected of transferring nukes from Russia to Iran...
As I mentioned in another post, I'm sure the US and Israel would try to intervene but the point stands that they certainly do have something of value to offer for Iranian ballistic missiles.
Yep - no way Iran gets anything from Russia w/o Russia getting a big dose of Israeli preemptive strikes.
I say ---- give Israel the green light to destroy the Iranian sources of drones and missiles.
Yep --- "we're begging for your missiles and other military hardware because we're short but we'll protect you in return for those weapons.
