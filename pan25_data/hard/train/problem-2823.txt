There are people who are about to be elected that are openly saying that if they win, they'll guarantee their party never loses another election, no problem!
It's incredible what Dems have been able to accomplish with their razor thin majority, and even more incredible that they're going to be punished for it.
It’s not like they’re going to do what the Dems have done, like present a case, have a hearing, involve witnesses, make an appeal to the electorate.
They will do what they have been doing, screech on social media.
Then they’ll take a private vote in the House, then immediately take a public vote in the Senate.
When Biden isn’t removed they’ll screech more in social media, then start the process over again.
They want to dilute the concept of the impeachment process entirely so that the notion of an un-removable, forever President becomes normalized.
Diminishing the impact of impeachment by turning it into another political weapon rather than the nuke it is now, all just so Trump can feel better about being the first President ever impeached twice.
