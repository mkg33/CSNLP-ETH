Not just any brain-damaged football player.
A dead-beat father.
He also paid for abortions, which I don't have a problem with on the surface, but it's always an odd look for the party that considers it to be more like murder than willfully denying a woman lifesaving medical care.
Just hang in there.
The large left-leaning counties still have many votes to count.
Dems are currently in the lead for Senate, Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General.
The gap is smaller for the non-senate races, but (knock on fucking wood), they have been growing in the Dems favor.
I'm seeing the Democrats ahead in more places than that.
GOP will probably take the house but it's going to be tight.
I doubt they'll break 220 seats leaving the Democrats at around 215.
Based on current trends at this stage, the Democrats look to pick up maybe 10 more seats, putting them at 207.
They still need another 11 seats to get the majority, and those 11 seats are all leaning Republican by a tough margin to overtake at this stage.
If the GOP does take the House (likely), it’s going to be by a razor thin margin with many of those GOP reps coming from extremely close elections from purple/swing districts.
The will have a short leash and probably won’t be able to fuck around as much as McCarthy wants to.
