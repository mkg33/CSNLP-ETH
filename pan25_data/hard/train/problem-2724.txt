The person above is not right, support for gay marriage reached a majority in 2012, and at the time that dems briefly held enough seats to get legislature through was in 2009, right after California, one of the most liberal states voted to ban it (you can argue that it was close and there was tons of fear mongering from out-of-state interest groups).
Democrats had months were they could pass legislature and it was not a universally popular position and they were trying to pass healthcare legislature at the same time.
I'm gay, I think being against gay marriage is an wholly immoral position, but there was not much dems could do.
It is plainly unconstitutional to tell straights they can get married and at the same time tell gay people they cannot.
Citation needed.
People have been getting married without the church being involved for pretty much forever.
And that's not even getting into the question of "which church?
".
Huh.
It's almost like we need something in our constitution that makes it so we can't discriminate on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
Marriage isn’t anywhere in the federal constitution, except in that by its absence the legality and regulation of marriage(s) can be inferred to be a power devolved to the states via the 10th Amendment.
Codifying Equal Marriage now wouldn’t enshrine the right into the constitution - that would take an Amendment.
Codifying the right means that the federal government recognizes something and requires that Full Faith & Credit be extended to valid marriages conducted in jurisdictions where they were contracted.
That doesn’t mean that all states would be required to permit equal marriage.
Especially with a revanchist Court like we suffer now.
