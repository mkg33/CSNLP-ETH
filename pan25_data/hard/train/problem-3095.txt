The guns we made to be able to aim quickly and put a lot of rounds into high buildings to suppress infantry from raining shit down on them.
So, yes you are correct that it is a heavy armored IFV, but it is the way it is to be better at urban combat.
No, it's simply a heavily armored IFV.
The armor was to allow it to survive more likely attacks in urban combat that would destroy other IFVs.
BTR can't shrug off an RPG, BMPT can.
You use it exactly the same as any other IFV though...
Again, since reading is apparently hard, it's LITERALLY the same autoturret as is used on their lighter IFVs, to include the muzzle break, which as an FYI, doesn't reduce effective ranges (muzzle breaks are used to reduce recoil to allow more rapid firing)...
If you have some super secret information on muzzle breaks reducing firing range, you better fucking let Barrett know, since they use them on all of their marksman and sniper rifles.
Same goes for BAE, given they have muzzle breaks all 100% of the US Army's artillery platforms lol...
Russian combined arms doctrine (when they choose to respect that at least) calls for 2 BMPTs per 1 tank in urban combat to protect the tanks from infantry, and 1 BMPT per 2 tanks in open field combat for the same purpose.
