Not to the degree that the US does.
My youngest was born while I and his mom (both Us citizens) were both in Germany.

Citizenship is based more off your parents then where you are physically born.
The US started this to deal with the aftermath of slavery.
Because you have to find a way to get it through without forcing those in immediately out of power.
If term limits were ratified now without having that, almost all of the current politicians would be forced out immediately and cause a power vacuum.
Call it what you may but it ultimately makes sense and would be the only thing to have a chance of passing.
He was born to an American citizen on a US military base, that absolutely grants him citizenship by birth.
That only started because of the nonsense about Obama supposedly not being American.

The only way you'd ever have a snowball's chance of passing that is if the senior members of Congress support it.
How would you ever have senior members of Congress in favor of it if they all self selected to serve only two terms?
