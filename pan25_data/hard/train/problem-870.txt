There are certainly problems with policing and our Justice system but increased funding doesn’t just go lining cops pockets, it goes to getting technological updates, new equipment and facilities.
The idea that we need to “starve the beast” isn’t a good one.
I do agree there are non violent alternatives but we have to start from the system we have not the one we would like to imagine exists.
There is some proof that effective policing reduces crime but your right that funding doesn’t necessarily mean less crime but there are lots of weird variables that do into that stuff.
All cops are bastards - and the small ratio of good things that are done by them could be done in greater numbers with fewer murderous side effects through different methods.
I don’t love all the things cops do and our Justice system has lots of problems but on net I would still rather live in a neighborhood with good police response times than bad ones.
Arresting criminals is great, the cops just suck at doing their job because they can rarely ever do it properly.
If you can’t see why people arresting other people committing crimes is good than you are really out of step with the average American.
Arresting people who commit crimes is good, if they arrest the right person and innocent lives aren't sitting in jail from days to years.
And if it's where they enforce arresting people evenly and arrest as many white people, as they do black people, instead of letting them go for the exact same charges.
But to arrest a criminal they need to not murder their suspect, who may or may not be guilty of what the cops suspect they are guilty of.
