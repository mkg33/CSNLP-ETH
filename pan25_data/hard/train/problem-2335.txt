I read this in the Texas sub, but y'all really do need someone like Louisiana's Jon bel Edwards.
Just democratic enough that R voters will hold their noses to vote for them, and just republican enough that D voters will sigh and vote anyway because the alternative is worse.
1) Turns out Americans are actually quite fond of democracy and nominating a bunch of ‘big lie’ promoting whack jobs who “can’t say” if they’ll accept the results of a legitimate election isn’t a winning formula.
Instead, he’s about to announce his candidacy for 2024 and cost them what should be another easy election.
2) Abortion was on the ballot in five states and in all five it won.
It was even upheld in KENTUCKY of all places.
Turns out abortion is still a key issue.
3) Trump isn’t the kingmaker he claims to be.
In fact, since 2020 he’s been helping Republicans lose what should’ve been easy wins.
republicans could still win some races, but in any case it won’t be a red “wave” like they were expecting.
really it’s a big win for the democrats to hold the republicans back like this especially with inflation like it is.
So yeah, not as good as the Democrats gaining ground, but a far cry from what usually happens which will essentially be a failure for the republicans.
This is looking like the republicans might barely take the majority in one of two parts of the legislative branch when, historically, they should have had clear majorities in both.
Typically two years into a presidency the opposing party makes massive gains in the legislative branch.
If the house goes Republican and the Senate ends up 50-50 then almost nothing will get done in terms of Democrat policies getting through (as it has been as 2 of the Democrat senators have actually repeatedly voted against the party on a lot of big things).
Tougher to tell with Ukraine.
It's an easier thing to get 1 or 2 opposing votes in favor of compared to like, investing in infrastructure.
