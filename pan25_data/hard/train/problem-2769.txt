All we’d need to do is pick off 5 or so moderate GOP house members.
And have all Dems vote for her.
Cheney is a stalwart conservative…but not McCarthy, not MAGA, and frankly not a complete piece.
That being said, I’d rather we not have a Cheney be speaker, but it’s better than McCarthy or whatever trash the GOP pulls out next.
Which is almost amusing when you realize that getting rid of the VP just means that… you don’t have a VP.
Edit, there is also nothing to stop the President ir VP from resigning before conviction, allowing a new VP to be appointed.
As I said, as good as impossible for the speaker to take over under this plan.
That plan was stupid.
Let's say Biden is Impeached and removed, VP becomes President and a new VP is appointed.
Impeach Harris as President and remove her, the new VP moves up and so on.
Speaker would never become President.
Speaker is a powerful position, quite aside from being 3rd in line to the presidency.
Giving that away to an 'outsider' isn't going to be a popular option among those who have sought (and achieved) power.
