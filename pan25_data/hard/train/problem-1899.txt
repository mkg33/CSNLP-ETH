Thing 1.
It's a way of taxing people and depositing their tax dollars into the coffers of churches who are trying to indoctrinate students into a faith the individual tax payer may disagree with vehemently.
Thing 2.
The reason private schools "seem" better than public schools is that they cherry-pick their student populations from the most affluent families.
Those students almost exclusively come from 2-parent homes with virtually every advantage.
Once you start taking students whose parents wouldn't normally have the means to send their kids to private school, you will find the test scores will start to equalize.
I'd say the high school you went to has skewed your view of what's realistically available for a lot of students and parents.
What school choice really means, is picking other parents you think are doing a good job at parenting.
Apart from that, the schools don't really differ that much.
My daughter and her friend from private school had the exact same text books and the curriculum was basically the same.
The class sizes were the same.
And the teachers had similar credentials.
The only real difference is one place was exclusive and catered to wealthier families, and the other one took anyone who enrolled.
The only objective benefit to private schools is that they’re generally comprised of more affluent families.
These families network and that network can provide higher paying job opportunities in the future.
I mean, every private school has some dumb asshole that goes on to get a cake job with a huge paycheck completely divorced from said asshole’s skillset.
And that dumb asshole got there because of their family and their school network.
