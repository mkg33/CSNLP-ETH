Because the guy holding the purse strings moved into his district and took all the institutional backing with him.
You think the DCCC is gonna back the guy trying to primary its own chair even if it was his district before?
He never represented them in the first place.
He represented the district next door and redistricted his house into a safer seat held by a progressive Democrat and kicked them out.
We can celebrate democrats being successful but Maloney is a culmination of everything wrong with the party.
A comfortable wealthy white guy who felt entitled to a safe seat to wield power and influence for his own gain without any consideration of the people he represented.
The DCCC deserved so much better.
His district deserved better.
And he's an excellent example of why I never donate to the national fundraising committees, DCCC, DSCC etc.
I donate to individuals.
Especially when you know that Maloney was responsible for redirecting more than $4m in funds funds away from extremely winnable races to his race in the last weeks of the campaign when he finally caught wind of his own fragility.
