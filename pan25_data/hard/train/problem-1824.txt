Unfortunately a huge amount of our election laws depend on public officials doing the job they’re sworn to do, and there’s a huge blind spot in the law if they just … don’t.
(See also: Arizona).
The issue that is likely to remain unresolved, though, is what happens when a legislature persists in submitting unconstitutional maps.
Another Ohio situation is unacceptable.
Nah.
State courts very clearly have the authority to rule on election maps and very clearly have no authority to draw their own maps.
A ruling that reflects that reality is more than fair.
In the law it’s said there’s no right without a remedy.
If the State courts can issue a ruling, but the legislature can ignore it without consequence, then the state court has no power.
Elsewhere I read some of the judges suggested the state court ruling could be appealed to a federal court.
I’d prefer that as a compromise.
Is that a better compromise, cause everyone here is trying to find the worst of every situation here.
There are 3 republican Justices that are actually playing as moderates in this case.
Having this proposal.
