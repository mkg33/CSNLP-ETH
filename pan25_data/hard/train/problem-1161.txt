Now is russia building more of their "modern" systems such as the T-90Ms?
Yes, but at a seemingly reduced capability as they have been .
While it is still hard to say how many tanks Russia had pre war, it is certain they have lost a shitload of them.
- 83,500 tanks lost: 5,200 heavy tanks, 44,900 medium tanks, 33,400 light tanks (including 11,900 Lend-Lease tanks and self-propelled guns lost[17]).
Also you can see it in the composition of Russian tank losses.
In the beginning phases there were a lot more t80 and t90 losses.
But after a while this became more and more T-72, T-64 and even T-62s.
This shows that they don't have nearly as much newer tanks as they did.
Which is compelety obvious after losing 1700-1800 of them.
Bottom line is that we really don't know how much tanks Russia has.
And they probably still have enough.
But there clear signs that the war has had a big impact on the tank inventory.
But there are clear signs of them either not having that much tanks (or trained personnel) available from footage.
If you compare footage from the beginning to now you see a drastic decrease of them.
In the beginning you saw convoys of dozens of tanks during battles.
They threw tanks all over the front.
Now you don't see it at that volume.
Look at footage from bakmut where infantry is used way way more.
