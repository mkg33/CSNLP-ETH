I don’t find this to be a fruitless battle, but this particular monopoly is nearly 13 years old.
Why act now?
Because it was problematic for a Taylor Swift concert?
It’s been problematic far before that and ending this monopoly now will do nothing to fix systemic inequality in this country.
As soon as this monopoly is gone another will pop up.
These are symptoms to inequality problems in the US not causes.

Breaking up monopolies addresses all of those things.
Our entire political system is unduly influenced by the rich and taking money out of their hands allows us to actually engage in democracy to address society’s problems.
Do away with excessive wealth and we’ll have a government that can address poverty.
