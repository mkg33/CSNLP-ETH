The "drag bans", the "bathroom bills", the attacks on trans youth and now adult's medical care, the attempts to pull information about LGBTQ but especially trans people from public scools and libraries, and everything else they're doing, they are systematically criminalizing our goddamn existence.
It being unconstitutional and flatly insane is not an impediment to it passing and being used to harass trans women.
The fact that itâ€™s an irrational, impossible standard is the point; it can be selectively applied against whoever the enforcer chooses (which is going to be trans women).
It also outlaws woman from displaying such a persona, but I think I can safely assume that this is purely targeted against men or those born male (because drag kings are seemingly not a problem as well), only adding the 'or female' part to preemptively prevent trans woman from circumventing this.
The laws they're trying to pass are so vaguely worded, the existence of trans and gender variant people is being classified as inherently sexual/"adult"/obscene/etc.
And if they are able to pass these bans on "performers", they are absolutely going to use it to attack us in every other area of public life too.
