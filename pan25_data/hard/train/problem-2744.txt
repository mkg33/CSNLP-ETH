6:Mandatory minimums for cops who are convicted of crimes that are harsher than sentences for citizens.
But more fundamentally, why do you think the police have any right to issue an extrajudicial capital punishment for the crime of fleeing?
Seriously, thatâ€™s a really simply question.
He was on the ground.
He was being held at the wrist by one officer and at the thigh by another, with a taser pointed at him.
They continued to shout and scream at him to comply when he was evidently complying and restrained.
At what point would you have tried to flee?
Or would you (knowing you were innocent of any wrongdoing) have just lay there while 5 police officers brutalize you?
If you make a cop civilly liable for killing someone, they are going to think twice about it.
If you make that cop's supervisor civilly liable for them killing someone, you can bet they are going to really think twice about turning loose some fuck-up on the people in their jurisdiction.
Well, the officers are black so they probably won't have the same kinda police loyalty that a white officer would get to enjoy, so we have that going for us... now if only white officers could get arrested for murder.
