I feel like they used to make it annoying and time consuming to check people on food stamps/WIC out on purpose, to make everyone else get annoyed at them.
LOL I can say that refried beans are a very very very very very popular type of food.
Like, that's about as popular for one crowd as rice is for another.
Also people who bash white rice and praise brown rice, how do they square up when you're talking about other varieties like jasmine or basmati?
Those are very popular staple rice varieties in other cultures.
Basmati has practically the same nutrition as brown rice.
Specifically white rice, a processed food made by polishing the nutrient and fiber packed hulls off of brown rice.
If you're buying rice in a store to cook and eat, then white rice is an acquired taste for a processed product.
White rice is processed.
That's why it's white, and why vitamin b has to be added back.
That's why it's called "enriched", and brown rice doesn't require enrichment.
Stripping off the brown outer layer removes the vitamin and leaves you with white rice.
There is no plant that naturally produces white rice.
