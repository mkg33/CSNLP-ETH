No it doesn’t… the price is a reaction to boom / bust cycles, not a cause.
How would you propose setting oil prices if not with oil markets?
Central planning?
I'm just responding to you... what I'm ultimately getting at is speculative oil markets aren't inherently bad, that the price discovery provided by speculative oil markets is a pretty efficient way of managing this global market.
How would you even set things up to get rid of speculation?
Can you explain how speculation specifically leads to boom and busts cycles?
We have to set price somehow, why is using speculation to set that price causing all these issues?
If you were buying for the present day, thats true, there is no speculation then, you just buy what you need.
Futures markets change that.
You can buy a contract for oil today for oil that will be delivered in the future, and resell it without ever actually having it in the first place.
If people think oil will go up, they may lock in contracts now to try to save money, the increase in buying contracts will drive the price up.
The price of oil usually offsets whatever cycle we're in, when we're booming, the price of oil is typically high, which creates downward pressure on growth.
When we're busting, the price of oil is typically low, which creates upward pressure on growth.
