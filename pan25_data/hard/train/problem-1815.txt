This analysis misses that the Dobbs leak could likely have been done by Alito, and that the intent of the leak wasn't to change the content between draft and final, but to lock in conservative justices away from Roberts compromise position.
Because this is the result that is largely desired in Federalist Society social circles, and they would have to explain, uncomfortably, why they didn't side with the leaked take given the had a majority.
Once it was seen that the leaked draft was popular in conservative circles, that would create pressure on uncertain conservative justices.
After they saw the reaction to the "leak," I suspect the Justices were more inclined to modify the opinion.
The SC could have -- if they were inclined -- changed the leaked opinion between the leak and official announcement.
For all we know, Roberts -- or some well meaning clerk -- released the opinion early in hopes it would change things.
It didn't, not because negotiations were crippled but because the Justices are hardliners on abortion.
At least the SC didn't go out of its way to help trump's election woes.
