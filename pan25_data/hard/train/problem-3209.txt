What I read was that when Fujimori was dictator, he changed the constitution to cement power in his party in the congress.
That Castillo didn't have any allies in congress, and Fujimori's kids and allies in congress basically made it impossible for him to govern.
Is any of that accurate?
Do you have an accurate poll?
Maybe an aggregate tracker?
Because if Mexican media is polarized on the matter than it could very well be innacurate polls, but I didn't find any and even then I gave the disclaimer.
And I'm not interested on whether either of us think AMLO is good are bad, just asking are there are the papers that were supportive of Pena Nieto/other candidates even disputing that if nothing else hes popular?
And I don't even like him.
Tren Maya and the canal would be disastrous to indigenous communities.
But him being a thorn in the neo-liberal world order has made him popular in Mexico regardless, the anglo speaking mexicans don't reflect the electorate if these polls are accurate.
Please, it’s not Mexico, it’s just the president that the 60% of the population didn’t realize has a mentality of someone in the 1960s when they voted for him .
Mexican here: as someone who is part of the 60 million people who didn't voted for him, I apologize for all the stupid things our president has said or done in foreign affairs matter.
