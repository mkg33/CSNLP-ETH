I've been saying this for years.
Furthermore, the more GOPers who jump in to oppose him, the more they actually help him since it dilutes the vote of the "not-Trump" faction.
DeSantis is not prepared to get down in the muck with Trump, and with the current voter base of the GOP, it's going to hurt him.
There are thousands of legitimately bad things that Trump has done that DeSantis could bring up to hurt Trump, but the base wouldn't care.
They'd call it a leftist talking point or fake news.
You can't beat Trump with traditional politics.
Republican primaries are where his childish, bizarre tactics seem to work the best for him.
Until a candidate starts putting Trump in his place by using his childish bullshit against him, he will win.
But they are all so scared because he is a dangerous mob boss.
Wimps.
Cohen is on my list to watch to make sure nothing suspicious happens to and look at him go.
He isn't afraid of him.
With a straight face, when Cohen is on MSNBC or CNN he ALWAYS says "Maro Lardo" and nobody corrects him or acts like they heard him.
This is the way.
A bully is a bully.
They only respond to being degraded and having what they so desperately try and hide by throwing insults brought to the front.
