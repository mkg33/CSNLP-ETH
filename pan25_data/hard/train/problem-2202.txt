Thomas was also the only dissenting vote to releasing a batch of Jan 6 text messages to congress.
Only after the release of these messages did we know she was directly involved.
No fucking way he didn't know about her involvement, and actively tried to cover it up.
"30 years ago you determined that I could move forward to the full senate for confirmation, therefore you have to ignore my heinous conflicts of interest today.
Check mate.
".
Yes.
If anything we need to have separate rules for entertainment and news broadcasts.
This having your cake and eating it too bullshit has to stop, and it's exactly what's affecting the minds of people who trust it.
So many stories of parents who used to be fine started obsessively watching fox "news" or similar and they spiraled.
But the government doesn't care, especially if it means they get votes.
But I sincerely hope the party eats itself and collapses soon and suddenly becomes motivated to fix the problem they caused.
True, they've gotten away with it in court by claiming they're "entertainment" so therefore don't have to tell the truth.
Yet they present like they're actual news and convince people they're telling the truth by repetition and insistence.
This should no longer be allowed.
