To be honest I can’t see North Korea even being able to deploy its manpower to Europe without mass defections by soldiers wanting to escape the Kim regime, let alone without having worse logistical problems than Russia had.
Iran doesn’t really have any ability to project power beyond the Middle East so they’re not much use either.
All in all, I highly doubt they would stand a chance against Poland and Ukraine, let alone the whole of NATO.
Yea but Ukraine wouldn't be able to defend that well at the start.
Before the war Russia seemed strong even if people knew there's corruption and inefficiency if they went all out from the start they would still seem too strong for Ukraine to beat so US and allies wouldn't help at least not to the extent they're doing now.
According to some reports they still almost didn't because they couldn't agree how hard their response should be until passionate Zelensky speach.
A lot of it is psychology and momentum, the army/government/police/etc is strong as long as people believe it's strong.
When their ground efforts stalled and Ukraine army managed to stand the ground and push back it showed just how unorganized, incompetent, underequiped, unmotivated they really are.
