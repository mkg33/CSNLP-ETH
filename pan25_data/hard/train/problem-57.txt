What a bullshit sentence.
She should be in prison where the doctors follow her personal theory on practicing medicine.
If I trust you to inject me with something, and you inject me with ANYTHING else, even saline solution, fuck you.
This lady injected people with shit they didn't consent to be injected with.
That's incredibly wrong.
While this is true, to a smaller extent its true on the other side with the number of people who at the height of hysteria wanted people to be vaccinated under threat of government punishment.
Even if none of those 8600 people died from this, it could have seriously lead to misinformation about the vaccination.
That’s 8600 people that were “vaccinated” and still got covid…causing people to believe that the vaccine isn’t effective.
Hell, I have absolutely no idea what were the names of any of the nurses who gave me any of my covid vaccine doses - do you?
If I am one of the possible victims in such situation I expect to be notified by the the clinic rather than be expected to read about that on the news.
And that's beside the fact, that knowing the murderer's name may make him more popular and cause imitators like Sandy Hook.
