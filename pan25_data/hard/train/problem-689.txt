True.
The 90-91 recession was a lingering effect of the Savings & Loan crisis under Reagan, which was a typical Republican recession.
The only reason that wasn't so much worse for the country was because the strong defense spending at the time helped prop up the broader economy.
Public opinion will need to shift more towards progressivism for someone like AOC or anyone who shares her politics to win a national election.
As long as "socialism" is a dirty word and people think national healthcare is a death sentence, they won't be electable.

Eisenhower was the last GOP president to hand his Democratic successor, JFK, a strong economy.
Every GOP president since has crashed the economy near the end of their run, with each time being significantly worse than the previous.
I've said this many times, but I firmly believe that if Hillary would have won 2016, COVID would have never spread outside China, the economy wouldn't have crashed, and we'd be living in a very different reality right now.
If Hillary had won in 2016 she'd be in jail right now for the \5 thousand deaths in the US due to COVID, oh and also the Republican supermajority from the 2018 midterm election.
