Because it's rough going through the wrong puberty in your teens, and then bearing marks from that, and then not getting the right puberty until adulthood.
Because everything seems to embolden further moves against trans people, e.g.
bills banning care until people are 26, kicking any doctors who care for trans patients off of Medicaid reimbursement, criminalizing being trans in West Virginia, etc.
Tennessee's on track to be the third state to ban gender-affirming care for trans kids in 2023 alone (after Utah & South Dakota).
This is on top of arkansas which banned it last year, texas where they'll send CPC after you for doing it, and florida which is banning it through the medical board.
Because we don't trust right wing politicians to fairly judge what medical treatment is/isn't allowed and would prefer that decision remains with the affected individuals and their medical providers.
Yeah.
that's part of why it's so scary.
I've been big on donating to legal funds because i think that's a practical way to get some of these bans overturned but a lot of that can be undone by an ideologically driven supreme court.
