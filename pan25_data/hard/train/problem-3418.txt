Two things - Russia didn’t attain air superiority even before western weapons poured into Ukrainian; Russia bombed civilian targets from the very beginning of the war.
They still should be considered capable in air-to-air combat, also if they manage to empty the ukrainian Air Defences, they might have a real shot at stoping the Ukraine from winning this war indefinitely by disrupting supply lines.
Because Russia still has very effective ways of "dumb" Air-to-Ground attacks.
But Russia didn't lose their planes to air-to-air kills but to SAMs and Manpads, so their advantage wasn't worth much.
Funny that you mentioned the wild weasels; one thing I noticed about the war is that Russia hasn’t done a great job of neutralizing Ukrainian air defense.
Seems like they don’t really have an equivalent to the Weasels.
The soviets spent so much time and effort into anti air capabilities while very little effort was put into figuring out how to defeat enemy air forces and SAM systems.
The russian air force has the problem, that they have poorly trained personal, mostly inacurate air-to-ground weapons(which means they have to get close) and poor leadership.
Also they had very poor planning, which rendered the initial salvo almost a waste.
