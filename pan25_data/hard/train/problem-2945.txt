To be honest her party DID kill the complete solar cell industry in germany which lead to solar becoming such a minor player in germany's energy plans.
In tandem with the EU that ditched protective tarifs after other EU countries complained that only Germany was profiting (since they were the only EU country with a large domestic solar industry).
Or is Russia controlling Germany to be one of the few countries to impose even more oil sanctions than the EU could decide on (together with Poland)?
Maybe they are controlling Germany to take in a million Ukrainian refugees?
Or they are controllin Germany to be one of the top 5 countries giving Ukraine military aid?
Maybe they also controlled Germany to halt NS2 __two days before__ the invasion?
Or they controlled Germany to get rid of Russian gas imports in less than a year?
It is one thing to buy russian oil and gas and another to base your economy around it, like Germany did.
Especially since Germany was counting on that in order to transition from coal and nuclear energy to green energy.
It was a bad policy, for which Merkel is definitely responsible for.
I think Merkel was a good diplomat but a bad strategist.
And domestically she was not "great" either.
She never was as perfect as she was often painted and she isn\t all bad either.
