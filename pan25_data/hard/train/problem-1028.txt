There's a very large number of people whose arrests would give us signs that progress is being made.
But it's not enough to charge lower-level people with specific crimes they personally committed.
We need the higher-ups who ordered the crimes, which is hard to get without flipping many minions.
To complicate the juggling act, indicting a person starts the discovery process where prosecution must share evidence with the defense.
We all know much of that information will be shared higher up the ladder.
That's part of the reason DoJ subpoenas demand info on who's paying whose lawyers.
These are DOJ subpoenas, not Congressional ones.
Technically, neither can be ignored, but as we've seen, the Congressional ones don't seem to have much recourse when someone does ignore them.
> Prosecutorsâ€™ interest in the payments comes after former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified to the Jan. 6 committee that she was initially represented by a Trump-linked lawyer who would not tell her who was paying his fees and said she did not need a formal written retention agreement.
