Acid rain.
And the fact that you'd have to burn so many more fossil fuels just to produce and send up all that SO4 that it wouldn't be worth it anyway.
Just force a volcano to erupt if you really want to fill the atmosphere with aerosols to block sunlight.
Volcanos would be far too inefficient to do the job at the scale required, most of those sulphur aerosols don’t reach the upper atmosphere, but just rain out as acid rain.
It doesn’t work.
You need to get too much, too high, and short of generating in situ with salted nuclear bombs, there’s no way.
Which this wouldn't be unless they used a nuclear device for dispersal.
The technical term for this is albedo cooling, nuclear winter is a specific type of albedo cooling.
The time to cut our emissions and decide to avert disruptive climate change was 20-30 years ago, and we collectively decided to enjoy the short term benefits of ignoring the problem.
Now that we have decided to deal with the problem when it is already a catastrophe, deciding to reduce emissions is choosing to confront a catastrophe by doing the things that would have avoided it.
It is too little, too late.
I do think that we need to seriously consider options like this Baja idiot is proposing.
I just think that the idea has not been examined throughly enough before we start experimenting on our only patient.
