The biggest offshore windfarm in the world has just been built off the Yorkshire coast.
There is a huge project of further production and the plan is to be 100% renewable by the end of the decade.
Your poisonous hatred for the English doesn't change facts.
The UK as a whole is doing a great job transitioning to renewables and that should be celebrated.
This article was about 25% of the UK's energy coming from wind, which is a positive and reassuring stat.
Clearly we're away from the world leader of Denmark (with nearly 60% share), but the USA has such high demand and usage per capita that even with your impressive Texas stats, the wind share is down at 8% for the US.
Eh?
The UK has the 2nd highest offshore wind (the strategy we're going for) capacity with 16GW, only behind China.
We also have nearly 50GW in the build/planning stages.
Yes it's pretty insane.
It may not be achievable but the UK government have a pledge to increase offshore wind to 50GW by 2030 and there's more than that in the pipeline.
Another 10 projects are in various stages of planning/development that could see wind power over 40% of the UK by 2030.
