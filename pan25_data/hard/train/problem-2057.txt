But these protestors do not at all deserve death.
They are not commiting atrocities or genocide, they are just protesting for better rights and freedom.
Id say the circumstances there are vastly different.
Yes they botched some executions, but no one argues that those who were executed after the Nuremburg trials didnt deserve to die, they absolutely did.
To clarify, I think the people responsible for these atrocities should be subject to a fair trial for their crimes, but I would not be sad to see those found to be guilty of the most severe transgressions executed.
Right (and let me just clarify in my version of the law for the death penalty it would need to be damn near iron clad guilty, ie caught on camera, dna evidence and no doubt of guilt.
).
Prison should be for either violent offenders long term or non violent short term.
Those who do the worst crimes as above should be executed.
Given 2 appeals maximum just to give them a chance to prove their potential innocence first.
(Which would be unlikely given i would impose a strict minimum threshold for evidence needed before a death sentence would be given).
Child Rape, Child Murder, any non justifiable homicide (ie not manslaughter where its accidental or self defence), just straight up murder, rape….pretty much the worst crimes you can think of.
And its not a good argument you are as bad as a child rapist or murderer because you demand they pay the ultimate price for the worst crimes ever.
I don’t believe that and never will.
