You see, that’s the difference between you and I.
We believe in objective morals.
What’s right and wrong doesn’t change.
You all believe in nothing beyond your whims, so what’s right is just whatever the collective society decided.
If they decide race based slavery is right, then that’s what’s right.
If they decide the holocaust is right, like the German leaders did in the 1940s, then that’s what’s right.
This is why your morals are purely subjective and therefore worthless, it opens the door for human evils and biases to influence what’s right and what’s wrong.
Good thing our clergy don’t necessarily represent our religion, even if that was true.
Under Islamic sharia, rape is literally punishable by death.
Meanwhile in your countries, rapists get like 5 years of free housing in prisons?
Great morals and values you have there.
Muslim women are actually the most satisfied group relative to their men, moreso than nearly any other group of women on Earth.
Turkey, Lebanon (2/3rds Muslim so I'll say it counts as a Muslim nation) , Tunisia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Bangladesh are all pretty good for women.
Pakistani Punjab and Sindh are okay for women, or so I'm told (other parts of Pakistan, not so much).
