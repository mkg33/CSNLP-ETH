There is audacity on both sides, and I’m not interested in trying to rank them against each other.
My issue is with anyone trying to force their way of life on anyone as they just disregard another person’s.
I personally don’t have an issue burning a religious book, I don’t even have an issue that it makes some people feel so upset.
As much as I don't give a flying fuck about some stupid religion's holy books and think people should have a right to burn them if they want and make any political statement they want.
I can't help but think that what these groups really want is for governments to stop them from doing it.
I'm really starting to have a seriously deep aversion to any form of nationalism and religion.
Even though I understand rationally that nationalism and religion in moderation can be healthy and even beneficial to a society.
I can't help but have a truly deep, visceral hatred for both of them now.
It's irrational.
The only ways this could possibly go, is the extremists outside of the country using it as ammo, or the extremists inside the country using it as ammo.
Pick your poison.
