Yeah I don’t buy into all the hate towards Russia, part of why I ignore politics.
A lot of great things about the country but propaganda would have you believe it’s the worse place on earth.
Yeah the leaders could be better, but regardless of leadership I hope for the peoples sake their country turns around to avoid poverty in the nation.
As an American I haven’t voted since 2016 and don’t plan to again for a while.
I find politics as entertaining more than anything since my life has improved greatly over the past few years so I can understand why people don’t wanna waste time waiting in line for something that makes little difference.
2024 should be a funny one tho.
Yeah idk Russia might wipe them off the map with nukes if Ukraine does that.
With NATO support Ukraine is holding up well, but still needs to play it safe against a bigger enemy like Russia.
You mean the Ukrainian army that isn't allowed to strike targets in Russia with NATO supplied weapons according to NATO?
You do realize that this is the same army, which does not receive long-range weapons or anything which could be explicitly used for miltary offensive so that it doesn't attack Russia?
Regarding the military intelligence, yes, they were probably intentionally trying to give out statements that would paint Russia in as weak a light as possible.
We do have a clear side in this conflict, after all.
It's only logical to try to sway the public in support of your allies.
