The GOP can now reap what they’ve sown.
A radicalized base that is loyal to a would be fascist that makes them an unelectable political minority prone to violent outbursts and domestic terrorism.
It’s entirely the fault of decades of GOP strategy relying on fascist tactics to consolidate their base and radicalize them to the point where they won’t listen to any perspective that doesn’t agree with them.
The GOP radicalized their own base and primed them for someone like trump to come along and promise to make their ridiculous right wing fantasies come true.
trump is too popular with the far right base to remove from the GOP but is far too toxic to win another national election.
The only way to finally get rid of Trump might be for the Republican Party to clear the field of everyone but DeSantis.
Fortunately, not that many people read my Reddit comments, so I can rest assured that the Republicans will have to figure this out for themselves, whether I share this thought or not.
It's worth remembering how the Democrats dealt with their "Bernie Sanders problem."
Bernie could have won with a plurality of hardcore supporters.
(I voted for him every time he was presented as a choice.)
But the party got together and cleared the field of everyone but Biden.
