Well, talks weren’t gonna start anyway.
Russia is still occupying and trying to take more of Ukraine.
Russia realizes once the shooting starts again for Ukraine, they will take more swaths of land.
They also know that Ukraine might go after Crimea before they go after Melitopol.
Just return to the separatist area and ask for a ceasefire.
A few years later they can abandon the donbass and the Russian citizens won't care.
They will pretend this war never happened and go on with Putin as their hero.
There's not much Russia can do either, there running low on heavy armor.
Soon all they'll have are tanks older than T-72.
All those tanks and APC can be taken out with simple rocket launchers, nlaws, grenade launchers, etc.
NATO has sent enough of those that every Ukrainian soldier can carry 1.
Ironically by attacking Russia all but guaranteed Ukraine will be able to join NATO.
No NATO country wants to see Russian armies maraudering their way through a neighbor again.
But you can't join NATO while in your borders are in dispute, so it won't happen until the current situation is resolved.
They must have defense agreements that only kick in if NATO can s involved, and they’re losing so bad they’ll do anything for a hand, even if it means the end for them.
