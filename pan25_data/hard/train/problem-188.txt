It's exactly what I thought as well, in Iran Shia is the preferred brand of Islam that the government clings too.
Although even then I would argue that at the higher levels theyâ€™re religious more in the sense of the Saudi's.
I'm not pro Iran or Saudi, but to deny they're treated differently on the global political stage is naive.
Saudi Arabia pays people to shit on Iran online while boosting Saudi (and by extension, their brand of Sunni Islam).
It's the online front of the Islamic Civil War that's being going on for over a thousand years.
Shi'ites have spent the last 1400 years being persecuted by Sunni Muslims.
As such, they have a slightly different perspective to Sunni Muslims when it comes to things like minority rights - given Shi'ites have been a persecuted minority since the Islamic schism.
The irony is that we're wedded to Saudi Arabia geopolitically, and share with them a mutual enemy in Iran.
Thing is...Saudi Arabia has done far more damage to the world than Iran could ever dream of.
And Saudi hasn't meddled in other countries or killed it's own citizens?
Difference is the West will never shun Saudi whereas they're happy to do so with Iran.
They literally butchered an internationally renowned journalist in a foreign embassy and noone batted an eyelid.
