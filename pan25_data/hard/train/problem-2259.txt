That's basically saying that you should only find out if a president is a tax cheat AFTER it's too late to do anything about it.
I don't understand how you could think that presidents should have to release their tax records but candidates should not.
Only if you try to make it “disqualifying.” You could pass a law requiring the IRS to furnish the tax returns filed by the President to the public.
2) There is a significant difference between furnishing tax returns to Congress, vs making them public.
How can you tell states that they can't allow someone on the ballot, or that their electors can't cast a vote for their candidate, or that their votes won't count, without implicating federalism concerns?
5) There would be serious federalism concerns here too, because states are largely empowered to conduct their own elections.
On the federal level my understanding is the only thing that could impose it would be a constitutional amendment.
There are no federalism concerns at all, this has nothing to do with how states conduct elections.
It can’t be disqualifying because that would require an amendment.
It would also be a bad amendment because it is too open to change by Congress in the future.
At some point you have to empower the voters and then trust them.
