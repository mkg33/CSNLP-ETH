In the past 40 years, the Democrats have only had a few brief periods of full control, and in two of those the Republicans were doing everything they could to prevent anything at all from being accomplished.

I'm not going to tell you the Democrats are perfect by any means - but their flaws are ones that we can address and work around.
They are responsive to voters, even if only slowly and grudgingly.
The Republicans are anything but.
I think the reaction here among the electorate is what's lost in the current Republican and Democrat parties.
Many believe that the establishment parties are gaming the system to preserve the political class and they have become fed up.
