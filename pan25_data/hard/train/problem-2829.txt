They have to call them "objects" until they can confirm what they are because if they announce they blasted a balloon out of the sky and it turns out to not be a balloon it would be a massive scandal that would make the current administration and the military look bad.
The 2nd and 3rd objects have been upgraded to Balloon Status in the last day.
I imagine they are just restructuring their pilot's schedule to -1 target practice sortie, +1 Balloon Hunt.
Am I the only one imagining thag, after the first pilot shot that balloon, all the other pilots wanted to shoot one too.
Godspeed if they ever have to use their guns against an actual target if a near stationary balloon is too hard for them to line up.
Also, you don't need off bore axis and variable thrust to hit a balloon, that's for shooting down migs.
I feel like I read somewhere they end up throwing these things away after X numbers of years of use, so they are probably burning old stock that was due for replacement soon first, but this is just speculation on my part.
