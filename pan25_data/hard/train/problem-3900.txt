The GOP is based on being contrarians.
They have no position and only goals.
They offer no policies you can actually review, but spend all their time looking to attack the work of those they don't like.
These people think Putin would be their friends if they do him favors and still haven't figured out that people like Trump and Putin will just turn on them when it suits the moment.
I don’t understand their reluctance( other than being in cahoots with Putin) to support Ukraine.
Haven’t we spent the last sixty years building up our military to fight the Russians?
If Ukraine can defeat them for us why not support them .
Ukraine is taking them on.
Russia is making nuclear threats, and if Russia prevails then it will be emboldened, the next line will be NATO, and millions will die.
It won't even matter if a future GOP President pulls us out of NATO.
Russia's goals are to end the Western hegemony.
Republican citizens are getting upset about all the wrong things.
This is a politician DIRECTLY and OVERTLY acting against the interests of the US.
Not a case of, "we think that...", or "we have reason to believe that...", but overt direct fucking evidence.
