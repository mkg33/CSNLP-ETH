Doesn’t Disney own fox broadcasting network?
I wonder if it’s a money thing.
Fox is wanting to charge Fox News to do the interview or doesn’t want Fox News doing the interview.
Could it be more than black/white?
Sorry different article on same topic.
So if fox doesn’t own fox broadcasting anymore why would anyone assume it goes to Fox News?
Fox Soul is run by Fox Television Stations which is a separate entity from Fox News Media.
They scored the scoop interview as Biden pulled one over on Fox News.
This cancellation is Fox News throwing a tantrum and running crying to Rupert and getting the interview cancelled.
Looking forward to Fox News spinning this as Biden's fault for the next couple days.
It seems pretty obvious that the "Fox Soul" move is an attempt to stick to that tradition without opening up Biden to actual critique.
It is tradition that the President sit for an interview with the network that carries the Super Bowl.
For Democrat Presidents, the toughest interviews are when Fox hosts the Super Bowl because the questions come from Fox News hosts.
Before the SOTU, Fox was running with headlines like "Biden SILENT on whether he'll sit down for Fox News Super Bowl Interview."
As if it is some grand tradition that the President needs to give Fox an exclusive sit down interview during the Super Bowl.
WTF are they talking about?
