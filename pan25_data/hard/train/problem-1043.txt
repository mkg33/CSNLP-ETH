She's one of the safest people on the planet right now...
The Russians want her safety more than even the Americans do...
Expelling them is pretty much the only thing Russia can safely do.
If they attacked or harmed the embassy or staff in any way, the US could consider it an act of war.
The only way Russia can survive a war with the US right now, is if the US wants them to.
Most of those wouldn't be done by states or state-backed actors, but by lone wolf or insurgency groups that the US can't really 'declare war' on.
States killing diplomats is historically a famously bad move, and more than one state has even ceased to exist thanks to the other state taking revenge for their murdered diplomats.
The Mongol invasion of Persia is a great example of this, where the Khan sent diplomats to Persia to discuss a trade relationship, and the local governor arrested and murdered them.
When the Khan sent diplomats to the Persian Sultan demanding the governor be handed over for punishment, the Sultan had them killed too.
The Mongols then proceeded to spend decades wiping entire Persian cities off the face of the earth and slaughtering millions, causing damage that in some places still hasn't been repaired to this day.
