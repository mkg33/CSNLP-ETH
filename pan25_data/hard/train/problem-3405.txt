That's why you have to google each judge before voting.
Mail in ballots are nice because you can do your research and see what judge is a member of the federalist society and not vote for the nazi fuck.
If anyone hasn't voted and sent it back yet don't use the mail now, it might get held up.
You need to physically drive your ballot to the collection box now and drop it in.
Election is just days away.

They don't actually believe abortion is murder if they are good with the political stars in their cult getting and/or paying for abortions with no political consequences.
At this point I just assume that every Republican I know has received or paid for an abortion, and that every single one of them thinks that their situation was a special exception that others donâ€™t get to have.
And yet when proof comes out all these Republicans paid for abortion, WEIRDLY, it isnt treated the same as it would if they had really done murder.
Anti abortion laws don't make abortion illegal - they just make abortion illegal for poor people.
The rich will still get their abortions and, when they make contraception illegal for the poor, they'll be able to get that, too.
It's about controlling the sex life of the working class.
