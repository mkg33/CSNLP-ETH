Yeah, both made headlines for ethical violations that while they weren’t charged definitely looked scummy as hell (potentially insider trading using info about the start of the pandemic…).
I’d assume the werewolves could eat off the zombies but not the vampires as you stated….
Or rather, while the vampires could eat the zombies since they’re immune to diseases they wouldn’t get any benefit from doing so and the werewolves would be fine with cadaver meat (assuming they were in wolf form).
Serious question: could a werewolf eat zombies and be fine?
Or would we get werezombies?
I’m pretty sure vampires wouldn’t be able to feed on a zombie, but I’m not sure about werewolves.
Yeah, that’s kind of what I was thinking.
Vampires wouldn’t be harmed by zombies, they just wouldn’t wouldn’t have any nutritional benefits for them.
Wolves in the wild will eat rotting carcasses, so it stands to reason they could feed on a zombie.
However, if the werewolf in question has, say a cut in it’s mouth or gets some zombie juice in it’s eye (like 28 days later), I think you might get a werezombie.
So, I think werezombies are rare, but possible, just like a Democrat winning an election in Georgia.
