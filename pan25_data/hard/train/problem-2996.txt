It's because Republicans know that God himself is telling them to cheat on their spouses -- just like God told Trump to cheat on his spouses ... and his taxes ... and on people he owes money to ...
That’s true, all this proves is that republicans are more likely to make an account on a cheating website, it would be hard not to interpret that as meaning they cheat more.
There’s really no other way to measure cheating as most cheaters don’t admit to cheating.
The majority of married straight guys I’ve talked to on grindr (I ghost them when they say they’re married) are conservative Christians.
It’s spiritual hypocrisy as well, as they condemn LGBTQ+ people even if we’re in a committed marriage, and they use their “perfectly biblical” marriages as the correct version of a family.
For real though, when a conservative is truly caught with a gay prostitute or something, they can easily claim they were led astray by sin, sometimes that will even fool their wives….
It is absolutely a post about politics you just have to put this into perspective.
As a proudly and openly gay man I’m constantly told that I’m the antithesis of family values by conservatives.
Conservatives claim to be the authority on family values but they are entirely a party of hypocrites and need to stop using “the family” as an excuse for hate when they’re willing to risk destroying their own family and have extramarital affairs.
This is an important statement on the invalidity of their so called “concern” for family values which is their excuse not just for their hate towards the LGBTQ+ community but also liberals as a whole because they tend to support us, meaning they don’t care about family.
