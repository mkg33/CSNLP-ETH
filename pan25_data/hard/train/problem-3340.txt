So, Russia is rapidly ramping up jamming of GPS signals in case of attack in a war that doesn't exist?
A "special military operation" that is "going according to plan" would hardly justify such defensive operations.
Shhhh don't tell the Russians that some American missiles can probably fall back on GLONASS guidance (the Russian version of gps).
Don’t forget that the United States could install “lower hemisphere” GPS receivers on cruise missiles, and set them to home in on the transmitters.
Also, I’m sure the Americans have tech geeks who have figured out how to build GPS antennas that can only “see” the upper hemisphere.
The real GPS satellites are above the missile’s flight path, Russian jammers are either on the ground (ignored by an “upper hemisphere only” receiver), on high-flying drones (need a lot of fuel to keep some on station 24/7), or on satellites launched into orbits which an international agency has not assigned to Russia.
Since such satellites would also jam GPS over the United States and over international waters, the first launch would result in Russian launch sites being put out of commission.
