The exact opposite.
House members cannot be stopped from reaching the house floor, even if imprisoned.
It's a stopgap to help prevent rounding up opposition on bs charges in order to shove through an unpopular agenda.
I seriously bet he gets reelected in 2024.
He's a conman and a grifter and he's now flashing white supremacist signals on the House floor.
He's the posterboy for under 50 Republicans.
He is, quite literally, the embodiment of the GOP in 2022.
They'll probably run him for President in 2024 or 2028 once Trump's influence is gone.
What I do know is if she ever had hopes of National politics as in VP/President and/or leader of the party it's over.
Well, never know.
She's centrist for one, but if she sees NY going right, she may go for sticking to her position.
And i mean political job one, and not her own opinions.
Who knows.
We need to go back and re-elect Carter though.
Then we'd be dealing with a different US.
Had we gotten involved with Afghan, and chances were we would have since both parties have done proxy wars to deal with USSR; we probably would have thought a bit more about helping Afghan post the USSR war.
Then we wouldn't have September 11.
Which means we may not have Obama either (sighs), but we wouldn't have had Trump!
I'm still pissed at the Democrat, forgot her name that asked him to resign.
She wanted to do give and placate to the MeToo movement.
The guy did almost nothing.
He lost his career, and now we got GOP members lying about their whole history.
The thing is, Santos lied but the Trump lied all the time and no one from the Republican party seemed to care.
Let's be honest, what Santos has done is child's play compared to most GOP members.
Until he reveals information about orgies, coke parties, and sex trafficking no one in the party will care.
