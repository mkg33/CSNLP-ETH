This is a different case than I thought.
This is a group of doctors arguing they have third-party standing to sue on behalf of their patients who they claim have been harmed by the supposedly dangerous anti-abortion drug.
They're arguing they have third-party standing to sue on behalf of their patients (women allegedly harmed by the abortion drug), citing precedent from June Medical Services v. Russo in which abortion providers were allowed to sue to overturn Louisiana's abortion access law on behalf of their patients.
They're suing on behalf of their past and potential future patients (women who they allege have been harmed by side effects of taking the abortion drug).
Should courts really be determining what constitutes healthcare for women, or what a medication's legitimate uses are?
Other than a desire to prohibit abortion, I can't see the LEGAL rationale for a federal judge to ban this drug/override the FDA's authorization.
Because it may tend to undermine state abortion bans in SOME states, the federal courts could outlaw it in ALL state?
Kinda like amputating an arm to treat a hangnail.
