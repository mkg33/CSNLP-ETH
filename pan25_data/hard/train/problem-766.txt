Without the clarifying adverb, the term becomes a strawman capable of painting everything to the left of hunting the homeless for sport with one broad brush.
I suspect that for some small subset of the population, this is the point.
For a much larger subset of the population it becomes a lazy way of avoiding any discussion about even the most modest social issues.
That said, even if one wants to use the term "woke" as some descriptor of social issues, then one should appropriately caveat the term with some modifying adverb, e.g.
overly.
There are several issues I take with using "woke" as a pejorative, not the least of which is the irony of using an AAVE term coined in the 1940s as a watchword to be aware of racists/racism as a rhetorical tool to move conversations away from shining a light on racists.
To clarify, original "wokeness" was about being aware of social and systemic issues (especially in regards to black people having to navigate systemic racism).
Still, I suspect they wouldn't be as keen to vote (R) if they properly understood the sheer contempt their reps have for them.
So per the Conservative M.O., they co-opted a neutral/well-intended term and corrupted it for their own benefit.
And it's nothing short of ironic that the're trying to pervert the one word that defined awareness and being educated as a means to keep their base confused and ignorant.
The opposite of “woke” is actually “ignorant”.
Desantis’ lawyers defined woke as someone thinking there are systemic injustices in society that need to be addressed, the opposite of which is simply ignorance.
