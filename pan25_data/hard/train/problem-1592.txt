The problem is really the "if it is my side I am okay with it but if it is the other it is indefensible " mindset america is currently in.
Regardless of the party we need to hold people accountable.
If her constituents were sensible they would not have elected her in the first place.
I suspect the only reason she's taking this stand is because the tide is turning against Trump, even within his own voting base.
She thinks (or her staff) that she's becoming a bigger player in the Republican Congress.
She was a major part of brokering the deal with the Freedom Caucus and McCarthy's camp (which was like 90%+ of the GOP).
If you watched a lot of the shots of McCarthy's voting rounds, she was stationed next to McCarthy for a very long portion of that whole saga.
He was actually conversing with her.
She knows if she wants to aim for a Senate seat one day (which knowing how stupid she is ... she's probably day-dreaming about as it is), she needs the votes of moderate Republicans, and she's just putting herself in a position where its easer to gravitate towards power.
She's also trying to go more "main stream" for power...she is going to keep being the voice of the Republican party for years to come and you can see it how close she's been with McCarthy lately.
No doubt she'll be in control of him.
She's positioning herself for maybe Ossof's seat or maybe VP with Trump.
She's even said she wants to be President.
Scary shit.
