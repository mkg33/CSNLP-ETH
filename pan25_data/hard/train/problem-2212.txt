Their official stance is Ukraine belongs to Russia.
This is because if Russia conquers Ukraine (entirely unlikely at this point), then that gives them precedent to invade Taiwan.
They probably think that if Russia is allowed to keep part of Ukraine because it used to be part of USSR it makes their argument over Taiwan stronger.
In reality, it is in China's best interests that Ukraine affirm territorial integrity and then they could demand the same with regards to Taiwan.
They could claim Taiwan is sort of like Crimea.
However, the concept of "friends without limitations" is getting in the way of sane policy.
Very true.
Taiwan made the very stupid mistake of not giving up on its claim to be China.
At some point in its history, Taiwan should have declared independence and become a sovereign nation, member of the UN.
The West would have protected them and China was weak.
Yes, there are signs that China is much weaker than thought.
And what strenh they had was created with the willing assistance of the West which expected China to become a responsible stakeholder in the rules-base world order.
The West did not support the rise of China to create a powerful enemy, but to create a powerful partner.
Now that China has made it clear they do not want to partner with the West, but seek to replace it, the support has turned into downright obstacles.
China is unprepared for this, because they bought their own propaganda in how their wealth is self-created, not also a Western goal.
