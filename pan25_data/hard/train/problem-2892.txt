Reagan rarely said the quiet part out loud, and he was superior to Trump in some respects, but he was a TV personality who became President through pseudo-populism and appeals to Christian Nationalism.
The GOP has been a mess since Goldwater.
Goldwater is just as responsible for the mess.
He cozied up to and empowered The John Birchers who were all in on the conspiracy that Communist Jews were trying to undermine the USA in order to implement a one world government (sound familiar??
).
True.
But I think people used commercials as a time to get snacks.
Use the bathroom.
Etc.
These old spots weren't really brought to light until they hit YouTube.

Clinton was a real problem for them.

Completely untrue.
TV was limited, people didn't have cable.

Two channels and one was terrible because of bad reception.

We definitely didn't watch tv much.
It was a special treat.
Do you really believe the nonsense that everyone was glued to the tv?
Sheesh.
Maybe it was true on the completely fictional tv channels you watched lol.
I'm not saying that people watched a lot of TV.
I'm saying that people weren't as critical of television and commercials when they did watch.
When they watched, they watched.
