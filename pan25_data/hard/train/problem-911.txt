The reef is not done and probably never will be.
Media hysteria has hijacked this topic and blown it out of proportion.
The reef was here before us and it will be there after we are gone.
As the temperature of the world varies the coral responds.
The reef has probably 'died' thousands of times before, but when the conditions for its growth are met again, which they will be, it will always come back.
The GBR loses about 40-60% of its coral almost every 4 years (around about every el nino now), some of that comes back but it's never a full recovery.
Small sections of it will likely survive well into the 2100's but it won't be the great barrier reef.
It will just be a collection of slowly eroding algal reefs with the occasional sponge reef.
No, the reef hasn't died thousands of times before.
The great barrier reef exists because aa the world warmed during the last ice age, the Australian continent became partially submerged and the fringes of it became the coral reefs we see today on the eastern coast.
The way coral reefs work is they build reef by depositing substrate from their skeletal structures.
This means they actually build up reefs as they get eroded by storms, acidification, stupid boat captains and biotic action like parrotfish feeding.
If the reef had died, it would stay dead as it would gradually erode under constant storm and other disruptive forces.
Symbiotic relationships between similar organisms have occurred in the fossil record before, so when these are wiped out the earth will probably produce more as soon as we're extinct.
But that's millions of years into the future, I don't fancy speeding up our demise for a mix of reasons despite how poorly some people seem to have utilised their consciousness.
