Maybe a bit of a catch-22?
If out-of-state colleges just take the view Floridians are underprivileged, the same way they might for applicants from schools that lack the resources to offer AP courses, then there will not really be any penalty for this (in admissions, though there still would be in terms of lack of credits).
My brother suggested this was to drive out the more liberal and better educated families.
If you drive out the liberals, the residue will be more conservative.
That means Florida is more likely to go red in the 2024 election, for President, Congress, etc, and if it doesn't work out, it's nearly four years until the next gubernatorial election where voters would have an opportunity to punish DeSantis for this (Idk if Florida has term limits).
ETA: It might also help drive students out of public schools and into private schools, which is a backdoor way to defund public schools, helping with the GOP's long-term goal of destroying public education.
Then, children of the rich will still get educated, but children of the poor and middle class won't be able to afford it and will either be stuck with progressively worse public schools, or, eventually, no schools at all, once the GOP drives out enough students they can declare public schools a failure and say they're just ending public schools altogether.
Public education used to be controversial because people wanted to limit who had access to a quality education, but now it's controversial because people want to force a lower quality education onto everyone.
Derp.
