Craic or crack is a term for news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation, particularly prominent in Ireland.
It is often used with the definite article – the craic – as in the expression "What's the craic?
".
Yes.
There have been several instances.
The 2007 cluster in Pakistan was fairly substantial and said to have exhibited human to human.
The case study included asymptomatic cases as well.
There is no data about the 4 people currently symptomatic and their relationship to the girl or how they were infected.
EDIT 3: I researched this event more and found out the girl who died had no less than 22 chickens and 3 ducks that recently died at her home.
It doesn't confirm avian to human, but does make that very likely.
I don't think there has ever been human to human transmission of bird flu.
Human to human transmission of bird flu could be a far worse pandemic than Covid.
Sustained human to human transmission has never been observed with bird flu.
This case in Cambodia appears to all stem from contact with infected poultry.
You might see a case or two of transmission between people when these outbreaks occur, but it's rare, and it's always people in very close contact for sustained periods (and it's not always clear it actually was human to human).
Other smaller outbreaks have exhibited very limited human to human but almost always very close contacts such as sharing a dwelling if I recall.
