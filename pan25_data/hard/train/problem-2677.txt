What disgusts me too as this kind of fanatical, anti-science agenda causes so many horrors, like forcing people to deliver a “baby” that has no brain or which otherwise will die as soon as they leave the womb.

There were already worthwhile Roe era laws: viability, only exceptions around 1% or less and having to do mostly with maternal health and/or a late-discovered lethal condition in the infant.
