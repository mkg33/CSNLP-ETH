Our Constitution and our institutions are purpose-built to fight against attempted coups.
It was all written just after we came out of a military dictatorship.
We should have done what the Argentine people did after their dictatorship.
The military passed an amnesty law right as they were going out the door, and the civilian government that was taken over pretended that they were going to respect it; as soon as the new regime was consolidated, though, they immediately revoked the amnesty law and put every single one of the leading generals on trial.
AFAIK, virtually all of the officers involved in the crimes of the dictatoraship died in prison.
Plus, a lot of the buses left from the Center-West region of the country - a region completely dominated and ruled by what we call the Agro - the big rural/agricultural barons - a class which has been the staunchest base of support for Bolsonaro since the beginning of his term.
But, like I said before, the big financiers of this group as just as ravingly lunatic as the minions they boss around - so it's perfectly possible that, even while financed and coordinated from behind, the plan REALLY WAS that stupid.
