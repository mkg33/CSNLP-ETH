"Sure.
Make a fist but leave your index finger pointing straight out.
Stick your thumb straight up at 90°.
And don't forget to yell 'Bang!'
when running towards the Ukrainians.
".
Here’s the thing though.
Russia has about 100 million more people than Ukraine.
Russia/ Putin is willing to expend every single one of them.
If Ukraine doesn’t get the weapons they need then at some point they’ll be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of bodies Russia is willing to sacrifice.
Hopefully, they do get those weapons and the numbers of Russian casualties become too problematic for Putin.
It’s hard to find accurate numbers, but the most reputable estimates now put total Russian casualties at over 200,000.
Absolutely staggering numbers.
Russia only began this invasion with 220,000 troops.
I believe they would need 1-2 million to actually take all of Ukraine, and at this rate I don’t think they can train and equip that many.
Even if they take Ukraine with 2 million soldiers, which is already unlikely due to sheer difficulty of the logistics, they won't be able to hold it.
