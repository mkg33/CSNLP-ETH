Lots of dudes are getting left injured on the field.
Many are dying from injuries sustained, and that will speed up with the winter.
I wouldn't be surprised if they do indeed end up with a very lopsided killed:wounded casualty ratio.
I think it is plausible if we view it from the perspective of death versus wounded ratio being off.
Typically yes, there is an expected rafion between those that died which leads to casualties as a whole.
But that is predicated on the idea that many are being saved.
Russia has been shown to more often than not, leave their men behind.
So if the ratio between the two is closer from 1:4 to 1:3 or even 1:2, I think it makes it more plausible.
We also have the issue of russia keeping using mobile crematorium to reduce the number.
My guess based on jwhat I've seen is that there is a couple thousand difference between actual and estimated deaths.
But, once the 100k is reached, within a week at most two, the number would be reliable to make that suggestion (of reaching 100k).
At the end of the day, we will probably never know as whatever estimates they have will be hidden as staye secret.
