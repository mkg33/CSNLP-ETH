Seems like for anything to really change the laws and culture need to change in the countries that supply the coconuts which doesn't seem likely to happen.
Why is the coconut industry so different that its impossible to do farm to store supply chain custody?
I think it’s more like we broke the ecosystem so people in climates that would never support coconuts are demanding things produced from coconuts.
So there aren’t enough naturally occurring coconuts and environmental destruction has to take place to support the growing of more coconuts.
So, you have poverty stricken people working for peanuts to destroy their environment to create more coconuts to send across the ocean to people who can’t have coconuts locally, but still want the coconuts.
Our coconuts are the closest you can get to nature, the coconuts are sourced from the wild and heavily protected against over harvesting by human hands.
We believe in mother nature and her creations.
Have some coconut water, delivered to us fresh daily by some of her most intelligent children.
Support nature, support us, hello fresh!
