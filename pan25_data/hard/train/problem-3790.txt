I don't think invading Russia this time of year is wise.
But hitting military targets where they stage missile strikes that are killing civilians is more than justified.
Unless, of course, it's a false flag operation being conducted by Russia just to be able to excuse more, worse attacks on civilian targets.
We'd also encourage them to do whatever it takes to protect their own citizens from attacks that originate from outside Ukrainian borders, but we haven't specifically said that we encourage them to strike Russia.
We'd encourage them, sure, but not to strike Russia specifically; we'd encourage Ukraine to just defend themselves from within their own borders which they already do.
If Mr. Putin is, in fact, encouraging and inviting NATO to join with Ukraine against Russia, that's something we'd have to seriously consider.
Putin has and is trying to send the message both domestically and internationally that this is a war between Russia and NATO.
Now, Mr. Putin would certainly NOT want to imply that NATO is involved in fighting this war in any way.
