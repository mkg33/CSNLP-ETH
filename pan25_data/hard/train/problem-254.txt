The only thing they have going for them is they try not to be publicly dicks.
They manage to do much of that in private.
It's the same in the private sector.
Cisco went to China to make manufacturing cheaper.
What did China do?
Copy the code and put it in their own devices (down to the typos in the documentation).

Military and intelligence agencies might have probably issued tons of reports explaining the dangers.
But they are easy to overlook when greed and short term gains dictate policies.

They own 100% of the largest oil refinery in Texas, they own like 40% of Twitter.
TikTok owned by the Chinese.
I don't see how this stuff was allowed for national security reasons.
Sadly at the expensive of national security.
We can blame politicians for selling out but we also have to blame the military not warning us of this shit and speaking loudly about it being a national security crisis.
America has already been infiltrated.
These foreign dominated companies that pose a security risk to the U.S need to disappear like yesterday.
