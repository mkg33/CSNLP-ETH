The Internet was an "issue" during the 1996 election in that rural voters were concerned they were going to be left out of the revolution.
And today, while rural voters have access to Internet connections, they're typically saddled with lower speeds, putting them at a disadvantage in the digital economy.
This needs to be promoted as much as possible.
And we need to start providing more and more relief/support to rural areas in our farm bills.
And Democrats need to make it known they understand the climate change issues affecting rural areas.
I am concerned about the historical parallels here.
I don't think rural voters are unjustified to feel they may be left out as new industries take form -- as solutions may benefit larger population centers more than rural areas.
As someone who grew up in a very rural part of America, they (those living in the rural areas) just do not care about problems outside the bubble they live in.
Seriously.
They want to same job and life as their grandfather, which means they work in mining or industrial industries.
Where I grew up it was coal mining.
When you talk climate change, they do not see disaster, food crisis, water crisis, or even people being displaced.
They hear "coal bad" and then fight it because they think "coal good" because it what their family has always done.
