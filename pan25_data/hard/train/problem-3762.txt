>Last month, Odessa pulled down its monument to Catherine the Great and Kyivâ€™s Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced that 30 more road names would be changed.
Lomonosov had no connection to Ukraine.
And having the very personification of Russian culture as an in-your-face monument is obviously untenable at a time when the Russian Empire is warring on Ukraine to enslave it.
Understand that Russian nationalists do not believe Ukrainians exist and that, at best, Ukrainians are wayward and misguided Russians and, at worst, actively attempting to destroy Russian culture.
The Ukrainians/Ruthenians still existed as a people, and they were involved in extending Russian rule over them and providing the faulty intellectual framework for Russian imperialism.
If anything Ukraine is elevating Soviet/Russian history by stopping the history revisionism and negation that has been pushed by Soviet/Russia, and ensuring the true history (vs propaganda) is brought to the front.
If anything Ukraine has been elevating Soviet history per se, by combatting Russian / Soviet history revisionism and negation.
The increased global spotlight on the Holodomor is merely one example of that.
