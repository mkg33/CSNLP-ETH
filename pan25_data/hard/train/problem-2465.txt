Conspiracy time.
Putin was murdered years ago, his body double has been serving as a public face for a cabal of oligarchs.
Eventually he'll get thrown to the wolves, and a new public face will be appointed to serve the oligarchy.
(No I don't actually believe that, but it is funny to think about Putin being murdered, framed postmortem, and remembered in history as an even worse strategist than his role model Hitler).
And then he gets killed and they introduce Robo Putin, but they don't say whether or not it's the original Putin's consciousness in it or if it's an imitation.
You say you're making it up, but that really does look like someone made to look like Putin.
The dimensions of his head in profile look off, and the puffiness on his cheeks is a common after effect of plastic surgery.
Probably just need the height to be correct, outside of that I'd imagine it's mostly facial surgeries.
(somehow doubt they are paying the plastic surgeons to reverse the process to any degree, or open a retirement home full of Putins, especially with the current state of the Russian economy).
