There's a whole default process still with any federal loan.
But like in any lending situation, if one person defaults, it's their problem; when 30% of your lendees default, it's your problem.
Then the government has the competing interest of guiding the economy that banks and creditors do not have.
People compromise with their lenders on houses, cars, and credit cards all the time.
Should the Federal government not be allowed to compromise with lendees on loans it writes?
In this specific situation, the executive branch was given the power by congress the HEROES Act and every HEA that created a federal student loan program.
Overall, the ability to modify, waive, or compromise a debt is held by legal precedent and common law to be the right of the entity that holds the debt.
Will this remove the ability for the DoE to cancel debt for any circumstance in the future if they deny this?
We already know the DoE can and does cancel Student loan debt so how are they not able to cancel debt in this situation?
How is canceling debt for one scenario legal, but unconstitutional for another?
