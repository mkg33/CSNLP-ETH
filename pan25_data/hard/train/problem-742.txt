It's funny because I called this a couple days ago.
Shocked that they'd actually try to use this as an excuse.
And we all know while it may be true, that means he got them as "keepsakes" for others, too.
Maybe in exchange for some keepsake they have.
Now they're just 'cool keepsakes'?
Some of the most classified information of the United States is just 'cool keepsakes'?
It's a fucking national security threat, you fucking knob !
So he's admitting that he took and held onto things that he legally had no reason to, but conservatives are all outraged about the Biden document issue.....ðŸ™„.
It is a bit strange and coincidental that suddenly documents are just so happening to pop up years after Biden left office but only shortly after Trump got embroiled in this controversy.
If I had my tinfoil hat on, Iâ€™d say someone planted Bidenâ€™s documents to lower the heat on Trump and give them an excuse to investigate Biden and raid his home.
Thereâ€™s vast differences between the two scandals of course, by why let facts get in the way?
