The sanctions are not imposed on countries, but on logistics and insurance companies that are primarily based in Western countries.
You can buy the Russian oil as expensive as you want, but good luck to find a ship that will deliver your oil if it is above the price caps price.
It's about making the rest of the world pay much less for Russian oil than what it's worth.
There's a reason why it's seaborne oil, it's because the shipping insurance is owned by Western nations.
So if anyone else wants to buy oil from Russia overseas?
and what you are missing is that Putin will have plenty of buyers of russian oil & gas.
look at all the countries that have already publicly applied for membership into BRICS.
extremely na√Øve of you to think that a common "distaste for US global dominance" is a trivial unifying factor amongst the BRICS nations.
perhaps you didn't even read the article i linked above, nor the quote i pulled from that article that says "If accepted, the new proposed BRICS members would create an entity with a GDP 30% larger than the United States, over 50% of the global population and in control of 60% of global gas reserves."
that is far from trivial and I hardly believe these nations would announce their application into BRICS publicly if they thought it was doomed to fail.
also, despite escalating sanctions since the breakout of the war, Russia has been increasing its oil exports, both in terms of volume and $.
With this , I think, Russian crude shipments to India would increase a lot ( or maybe equal to Saudi and Iraqi crude shipments).
