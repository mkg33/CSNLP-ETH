I still remember that MSNBC interview that most people thought, including Abrams, was going to be Biden's announcement on picking her to be his running-mate.
Honestly, if Biden's intention was to pander to the minority voters, Stacy Abrams was a better choice.
Biden, Warnock and Ossoff wouldn't have won in Georgia in 2020 if it wasn't for Stacy Abrams' efforts.
Abrams deserved that VP spot and more.
That's an incredible thing to say when someone who hasn't been elected to any office won the presidency in the 2016 election.
I don't think a politician whose highest office held was minority leader of a state house would be a good choice to be the Vice President of the United States.
He didn’t need to win Georgia to win the presidency though.
And why would she have deserved the VP nomination for something that didn’t happen until after that?
Harris, imo, is trying to have it both ways: be VP, but don’t be attached to any one thing from the Biden presidency.
In other words, when it’s her time to run she can say she was part of anything successful Biden did, and not any of the controversial things (if any become issues later) because she was basically invisible.
It’s kind of what Gore did when he ran, and it’s a huge gamble.
You need to have great political chops to pull it off and I haven’t seen that here.
