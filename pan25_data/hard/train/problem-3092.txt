Does it matter, though?
No Democrat is going to challenge Biden, they'd only run if he says he won't run again.
I'd grant that.
Obama and Clinton would never have pulled out of Afghanistan, for a start.
Even trump was too chickenshit for that, and republicans are usually insulated from the soft-on-foreign-policy canard.
Still, i think the poll in the OP speaks for itself.
Nationally, dem voters aren't crazy about Biden right now, and democrats can only stand to hurt themselves by pretending they don't know that.
As someone who approves of the job Biden is doing but is worried about his reelection because of his age, I think him being cold is a bit misleading.
Do I think it would be best if Biden stepped aside?
I do I really appreciate what he's done it's hard to say that but he's done his part for the country.
Would I support a Democrat who ran against him if he didn't step aside?
Absolutely not, its his job if he wants it as far as I'm concerned.
I don't speak for everyone this is talking about obviously, but I'd bet some feel like me.
