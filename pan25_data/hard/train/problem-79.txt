But it was in the context of Russia’s intervention in Belarus’s affairs.
Why would anyone think that just because the guy was murdered while he was in Germany, that it must have been by the Germans?
That makes no sense, especially given the context that does in fact exist in this conversation.
The whole "false dichotomy" things makes no sense in the context of your post.
Are you mad someone is boiling a complex issue into a simple binary option (a.k.a.
a false dichotomy) or that you think the word "support" is far too kind and harmless to describe what the russians did (euphemism)?
Seems like it, and yet it would have been so much more concise to write '_Russians killed one protest leader abroad/in Germany_'.
Of course people will assume a person being killed in Germany was killed by Germans without further context.
Of course the immediate assumption if someone is killed in Germany is that he was killed by Germans.
They didn't mention Russia a single time in that sentence, but did feel the need to specifically call out Germany as the place were that person was allegedly assasinated.
