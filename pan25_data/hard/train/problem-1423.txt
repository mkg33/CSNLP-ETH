But i rather interpret from the new across the various sources that the 107000 circulating in various sources as the combined loss of lives, POWs and wounded.

That is already a huge number and means an average of 350+ per day from day 1.there were lots of phases with no to near no losses.
Having that high of an average on that scale of war sounds reasonably realistic even though high but considering russias incompetence.
I doo believe that is way too optimistic.
I would love to believe that, not for the general needles loss of that many lives but for the fact what it would mean how much russia hsd been weekend as the aggressor party in the war.
Not necessarily and i would be surprised to have fallen for russian talking points as i lean undoubtably in favor of ukraine.
Check my poat history if you don't believe me.
But realistically just take large incidents into account like the moskva sinking or the recent strike on that college.
What russia claimed was laughable i agree.
In both cases they said around 70 personnel was lost when other sources reported 500 to 700 depending on incident and time of reporting which are way more accurate.
But those number above that 350 average are very single event incidents.
And on the "regular daily basis" undoubtably pro ukrainian sources rarely reported combined death and wounded numbers above that 350 average per day.
Only for a month during kharkiv offensive in parts, the month of kherson and now all december.
Those are the only times where 500 to 800 per day were reported multiple days in a row.
All the other month had way smaller numbers per day.
Hey i hope i am wrong and this might be a conservativly low number but yet not totally unrealistic.
