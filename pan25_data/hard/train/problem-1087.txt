Because the 14 year old is queer and her father is one of the five most prominent Republicans in the US, the party supporting terrorism against queer people.
But even if she doesn’t, watching him spread hate and talk about LGBT people like they’re evil child molesters— that’s still dangerous talk coming from him.
Every time he says something bad about gay people or the LGBTQ community, that daughter hears it as an attack on her.
She must be hurting so much.
That’s terribly sad.
This is heartbreaking.
And also a major goal of the people who vote Republican, hence the attacks on libraries that stock books which show LGBTQ people as actually human.
In all seriousness though, Ted Cruz's dad is also a piece of shit.
Here's a bit from his Wikipedia page:
>At the New Beginnings Church in Irving, Texas, in August 2012, Cruz delivered a sermon where he described his son's senatorial campaign as taking place within a context where Christian "kings" were anointed to preside over an "end-time transfer of wealth" from wicked people to the righteous.
Cruz urged the congregation to "tithe mightily" to achieve that result.

The thing is.
I loath Ted as much as the next but honestly I think it’s more an indictment on being any politicians offspring.
They are used like props but told to stay silent.
Taken to political events to show family values.
It’s not healthy and we need to let the kids be kids.
All politicians do this.
