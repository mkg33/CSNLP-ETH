Edit: Maybe that's how we can bring about world cooperation and peace.
Organizing the people in every country to work together in the common goal of collectively shaming the GOP and these corporations in the most public way possible.
Imagine the entire world gathering together in creating Memes (the defacto go to for today's Republicans to get their daily dose of confirmation bias.)
and overwhelmingly counteract the disinformation and utter crap that's coming out of Russia and the like.
Typically I believe that you can't reason someone out of a point of view that they didn't use reason to get in to in the first place.
However, I have seen enough people question themselves as the GOP plummets further into batshit crazy that a bit of repeated truth could pull enough of them them back into reality to influence the voting outcomes.
And if the corporations see their influence waning on the world stage, thus their profits threatened, they might change their thinking to something a little more mainstream.
You might be right about how far gone the politicians are.
But the takeaway from my comment is that if enough republican voters see the GOP hypocrisy pointed out to them over and over and over again they might be influenced enough to speak out.
If I remember correctly, the Republicans went out and found a guy that has the same name as the Democratic challenger and put him on the ticket to siphon votes.
Wouldn't it be nice if our leaders were ever held accountable?
Santos ran an entirely fictitious campaign and will somehow get away with it because our leaders are amoral and feckless.
