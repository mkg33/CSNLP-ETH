Case in point, ask anyone who knows how to drive if they’ve ever read the driver’s manual to their car cover to cover.
You would be amazed how many people would turn out to have skimmed it at most and couldn’t accurately tell you how many pages their car’s manual has to the nearest 100 pages.
Pfft, I’ve assembled an IKEA wardrobe on my own, send me out with a supply of Madonna CDs, I’ve got this!
To be fair, the instructions genuinely ARE pretty well written and, if you have experience making models, it’s not that bad as long as you read ahead to make sure you’ve put stuff in the right way around and double check as you go (I used to play Warhammer, so most of that is pretty normal for me).
The problem for me is that I was having to assemble the wardrobe in a space barely bigger than the wardrobe itself and carry it into another room on top of that (as the room it was meant to be in was too small to build it in there), which naturally made things…interesting.
(I joke with that last bit, but I genuinely have had to assemble an IKEA wardrobe on my own.
0/10, do not recommend unless you have a spare football field.

Yup.
We've got one potential enemy and that's Russia, we're going to be safer with these guns blowing up Russian T72s and protecting Europe then we would be with them in storage here.
Presumably the really clever part (that doesn't make the news) is the system that tracks incoming shells, works out where they came from, and sends the coordinates to the gunners faster than the Russians can move their gun.
That's the bit I'd like to know about.
There's only one option when you want maximum range.
If you want several different flight times that all hit the same target you have to fire them either too high or too low, or with reduced charge - so none of them will go as far.
