What exactly is BS about this article?
It simply states Finland will not withdraw its NATO application in case Sweden isn't accepted the same time as Finland?
2. the process will prolong for a long period of time (years) Finland will not wait for Sweden to get approved.
You don't even need any news to come to this conclusion.
It is obviously the only rational position to take on this.
They clearly didn't read past the headline.
The headline is bullshit.
Article is alright.
It is states the same thing that has been said for the past month or so but clickbaits with the headline.
There is absolutely nothing new in the article.
As I said, don't base your position on headlines and clickbait.
If you actually read through the article you would have your answer.
Finland's position is to primarily go together with Sweden but if:
In reality, Finland's position is quite consistent: They want to join together with Sweden, as quickly as possible.
But if Hungary and Turkey ratify their accession protocol and not Sweden's, Finland will not withdraw it's application and say "screw NATO, we're not joining after all".
On topic, as a Swede, I support Finland being admitted to NATO as soon as they are accepted and waiting for Sweden to be admitted when the Turkish election is done.
Assuming that's what Erdogan is waiting for.
