If they win with less than 49% of the vote, they are said to not care about having a mandate…” - America the Book: A Citizens’ Guide to Democracy inaction.
It all comes down to the SC case before we can tell if they're going to attempt to disregard the votes of the citizens or not.
There is a real possibility of it happening from what I understand.
That's the likely scenario i see.
They may take the House by about 15 or 20 votes, but idt they'll get the senate.
I guess we'll see soon enough.
I def been wrong before, shocked by polls one way or another.
Obviously, polls aren't everything, but this is a rightward shift that I wasn't expecting.

Not to alarm everyone, but the chances of GOP Senate control just jumped accordino 538, and it's by a lot (by the standards of increases of one or none per day).
They're now placing the chances of GOP victory at 58%, compared to 55% yesterday, and this is in no small part due to Oz overtaking Fetterman in Pennsylvania in their model.
