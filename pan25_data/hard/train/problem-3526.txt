Not involving the Afghan government was an issue because they saw it as a big “Fuck you.
Figure it out as we’re leaving.” With that said, we had been there too long already and eventually they need to figure it out.
This understanding seems to be missed on so many people.
I went down a rabbit hole before the final folks were gone but Afghanistan started falling as soon as the ink was dry on the agreement with the Taliban.
And as predicted, the security forces threw down their arms as soon as they stopped getting paid and the Taliban waltzed in.
You'd think the administration which chose the date would have had flights lined up prior in order to evacuate everyone, or even aided in handoff of power so Biden could streamline the evacuation.
But then you realize the entire withdrawal was planned by the republicans a year in advanced to make Biden look as weak as possible, with safety of Americans an afterthought.
Naw, they just didnt expect to lose either house of congress in 2020; the play was to make the withdrawal untenable and then immediately impeach Biden.
