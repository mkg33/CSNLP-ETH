> Gaetz excluded the possibility of a deal between Republicans and Democrats to elect a moderate Republican as House leader, vowing to resign if one were chosen.
My biggest take away from this article was that Gaetz threatened to resign if democrats takes up with Republicans to select a moderate speaker.
So this bozo is now trying to blame Dems for not joining GOP to elect a ‘moderate’ Republican as speaker.
He nominated Trump.
The only thing moderate about DJT is his intelligence.
Let them actually nominate a moderate Republican and get 200 votes for them, then you would see some Dems join.
I'm sure a moderate republican could be found and voted for without consequence for the democrats.
McCarthy isn't a moderate.
He toes the Q line.
The speaker of the house is a a bit of a career ender for republicans.
McCarthy gets it it's very likely he'll never try for it again.
So it's not like you can 'punish' him by not electing him or trusting him again.
Which all rides on trusting McCarthy to keep his word which he's repeatedly shown not too.
And that's my point.
His own party doesn't trust him enough to elect him that he has to go to the DNC.
A group he's repeatedly lamblasted, disparaged, and slandered.
Why on earth would they trust him?
