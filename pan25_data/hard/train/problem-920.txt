I mean Spain has just two European neighbors and three in total.
From what I can gather Portugal seems to be a little worse but it's getting better and France looks to be better.
If you compare us to Portugal, we are well off, because Portugal is a shithole (I'm sorry to say, since Portugal is an awesome country).
But if you compare us to France, we are a third world country.
Edit: and those are the \rich\ European countries.
Just wait until you hear about living standards once you move east just a couple borders.
This is a really simple thing to do - find someone you can trust who makes what you think you could make in the area you are looking to move to.
Ask them about the things they have, and what they do for fun.
You will probably be somewhat surprised.
Living in Europe on $30k/yr (fine, make it $50k to be more realistic) might be less stressful than living in the US on that income, but you will -absolutely and it's not an argument- have a lower standard of living.
There is a reason folks from Europe still migrate here, and it's not because they want to live a lesser life.
Plenty of reasons I find the idea of living in Europe pleasing, but doing so for financial reasons is simply silly.
I'm interested in the cost of living in europe but don't straight up lie to spread some boomer myth about america.
