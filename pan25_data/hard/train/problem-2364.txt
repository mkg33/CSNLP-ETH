Once they start imprisoning or executing the family of protesters fir "enabling" them, the number of protesters will drop quick.
When death is the punishment for peaceful actions, you're gonna get violence from the protesters and their supporters instead.
What's the point of peacefully protesting when it has the same punishment as violent riots to overthrow a government.
Now that protesting is punishable by death sentence, protesting is now a fight to the death - thats as escalated as it gets.
If only protesting peacefully means you get the death sentence, at that point you might be inspired to escalate as it doesn't matter.
Its how all fascist nations develop partisans and resistance movements.
We're talking about the Iranian people rising up as the government is not giving them any other choice.

I'm just being realistic.
When an opressive state pushes its population past a breaking point it's a recipe for violence and revolt.
This has happened almost everywhere at some point in history.
