The american industrial military complex may be interested in selling weaponry but they didnt put Putin s army in Ukraine.
Ukraine is also a sovereign country and free to ally themselves with whoever they please.
If Mexico or Canada made an alliance with China we wouldnt start an invasion on them.
Yes, America WOULD go into Mexico and overthrow the sitting Mexican Government before it could make that deal with China.
I mean, how could you possibly deny that?
But if you dig deep enough, you can still find a pretty fair account of the situation from the anti-establishment left.
Look at Noam Chomsky interviews since the war began.
He thinks the American MIlitary Industrial Complex is corrupt as all hell, has a heavy influence on our media, and wants to keep this war going.
That is not to say that the Kremlin are the good guys or that the war is "just".
But it's a good place to start.
The Jacobin Magazine is pretty fair as well.
Actually, your Mexico example is something that Chomsky literally uses to make the opposite argument.
