Given they also have a fairly large supply of third generation Abrams tanks since 2012 (Source: they could be looking to modernize their military by phasing out older soviet equipment to equipment NATO uses.
Because the US and most NATO countries donâ€™t have 30+ year old Soviet tanks laying around, and training the Ukrainians on the Abrams tanks would be too expensive/take too long.
Giving the Ukrainians a random selection of tanks would make logistics way harder, plus probably concerns with sending their latest stuff to Ukraine for security reasons.
Yeah, but the logistics surrounding the abrams is so immense Ukraine can't overcome that in the middle of a war, the logistics for the leopard is a great deal simpler and thus within what they can manage, not ideal, but doable.
Eventuelly russian models will run out though and if the war still isn't over, Ukraine will need to switch to western tanks, then the leopard 2 is the better choice, it's not as problematic logistically and spare parts come from close by, they can train in Denmark (Denmark has already committed to assist in training).
Hopefully russia will have surrendered by then though.
They are transitioning, like they now use french caesar artillery for instance.
But transitioning to western tanks and planes are the hard ones, bigger logistics, much more training required.
