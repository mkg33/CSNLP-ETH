No, not really.
You’re 80 years old.
Retire already.
Stop putting a gun at my head and forcing me to vote for your antiquated boomer ass.
Fucking retire already.
I’m so sick of having a gun pointed at my head and being told to vote for Biden.
I'll vote for Biden's stupid ass if he ends up the nominee, but, no, I am not "with" him.
Stop nominating dinosaurs!
I am an old fucker, but political old fuckers are out of touch with working Americans.
I cannot forgive Biden for his treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearing.
Biden is a primary reason Thomas now sits on SCOTUS with his horrible wife who wants to overthrow a legitimate election whispering in his ear, or is she listening to her husband and then spreading his bullshit.
I am in my 70s and had to vote for the lesser of two evils all my life, EXCEPT when I voted for Jimmy Carter twice... "vote blue no matter who" is crap.
Honestly I voted for him because he wasn’t Trump.
But I now think he has done a pretty good job both as President and as the leader of the country.
I’d vote for him again unless a Mitt Romney type comes from the right but that’s highly unlikely with today’s GOP.
