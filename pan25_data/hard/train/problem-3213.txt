You must not know much about Lebanonâ€™s history.
Lebanon was occupied by Israel for decades until relatively recently, many families still have scars from the terror the Israelis inflicted on us.
Part of Lebanon (Shebaa farms) is still illegally occupied by Israel.
Their prisons were full of torture and execution, they routinely bombed civilian centers in Lebanon.
Even as recently as 2006, Israel reigned hell upon the people of Lebanon.
This thread is delusional if it thinks this sort of action by Israel would be okay.
Hezbollah is a symptom of the problem, as the Israelis have given the Lebanese people many many reasons to fear a southern invasion - with or without the Hezbollah excuse.
It is an unfortunate truth that the only force reasonably capable of defending Lebanon from Israeli aggression is Hezbollah.
And the facts on the ground is that Hezbollah is a terror organization that gets good will from the people by giving social services but that doesn't mean they don't dig terror tunnels across the Israeli border to prepare themselves for an invasion of Israel.
That doesn't mean they don't point anti-tank missiles at Israeli towns.
That doesn't mean they don't illegally cross the border themselves into Israel.
Greater Israel theory?
Then why did Israel give the Sinai back to Egypt?
Why did Israel disengage from Gaza?
Why did Israel agree to the Oslo accords?
Israel is less than a third the size it was in 1967.
And just look at the politicians, literally nobody has mentioned "greater Israel" like ever.
Stop feeding in to the Hezbollah bs.
