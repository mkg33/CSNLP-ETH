When they pull into port, ships have to provide the country of origin of their cargo â€” in the case of oil, where it is refined.
Figures on oil imports are compiled by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and HM Revenue & Customs.
HMRC registers the value of a shipment, the country from which it was dispatched and its country of origin.
However, maritime experts say the way the UK registers imports, as well as the increased use of ship-to-ship transfers, will make it difficult for the UK to sanction Russian oil.
Still buying oil that's indirectly sourced from Russia looks kinda bad and makes for great clickbait, but people that think this small drop of their total oil import somehow is a big problem have a rather childish perception of the real world.
As for these sanctions, they're literally just buying a small amount of oil from European countries, who happened to have bought it from Russia previously.
yea but they bought the russian oil from germany, the sanctions are for buying oil from russia, rather than buying russian oil.
