Im not so sure about your first point the Russians could have bought access to a tank from dozens of countries, its a 40 year old platform, and we'd be sending stuff that isn't new, we have thousands of these just sitting around all over the world.
What Ukraine really wants is the Leopard 2, Germany's tank.
The maintenance and cost to run an Abrams is high, the mechanic knowledge on them in Ukraine is basically zero.
The Leopards are easier to learn, maintain and use.
Germany has been wary of giving theirs to Ukraine.
I think it's because, like you said, air superiority first.
Russia won't be sending Armatas but they have sent t-90s their second best tank and of the two, the one they have more than a handful of, Ukraine captured one in September.
I touched on this in another comment, but if the US government, who is willing to empty its stockpiles of some weapons to support Ukraine, doesn't send tanks to Ukraine, it probably has a good reason.
I'll be dead honest, just reading the headline, seeing that he's a Republican and how in bed with Trump he is, I had to pause and wonder if he meant sent tanks INTO (against) Ukraine.
Russia may have talked about sending their most advanced tanks to the front, but I doubt they'll see actual combat for the same reason.
Ukraine has enough air presence to severely threaten those tanks.
