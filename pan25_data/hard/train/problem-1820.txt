Likely thermal optics, modern fire control, maybe fully stabilized guns, and encrypted radios that work with all of the stuff we've been sending them.
Nothing against the Czechs and Poles, they did the best they could with the budgets they had, but the tanks they're sending still need some upgrades to get them up to the caliber of a B3M.
A stabilized gun shouldn't need any training.
it should "just work" as part of the fire control system.
Put the sights on the target, and the computer should keep the gun on the target regardless of how the tank is moving.
I wonder what studies have been done to diff relative effectiveness between the 1:1 tank to target on the move with a squad of tanks firing into a box on the move.
There’s a pickup bed drop in frame for a sensor tower and multi tube missile launcher supposedly being given to Ukraine.
I assume there’s a bunch of compact thermal imagining device manufacturers with a massive hard on to field test their units.
Just drop augmented hand grenades on the regular.
I was thinking they had to be trained out of the legacy Soviet doctrine to a more mobile and data enriched environment.
