While what they say is true, that's a big reason why there has been such a push by the GOP to gerrymander aggressively, restrict voting access, and blockade the changes attempted pre-midterm to address the voting issues revealed by 2020.
Yeah, I have a pretty large group like that where I work also.
A lot of them just don't vote ironically enough.
They have the typical young voter apathy where they share FB memes and whatnot, but don't actually go and vote.
We lucked out and got our home about an hour south of the nearest major city, in a nice new suburb.
We even managed to close before the rates went nuts.
But you're right, now the houses in our neighborhood that are new or still being built are nearly 20-30% more than we paid, and we aren't even in a major city.
And sure, city center is more expensive than the edge of the city but they are both cheaper than a house in suburbia (not many apartments thereâ€¦).
(Also the city center is far more expensive here than most of the suburbs and I'd imagine most cities are like this.
).
It can last forever until government policy changes to discourage institutional landlords.
(Hint: It won't.
).
PS.
And by the way just reading some of these post from the younger set here is making a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes ).
