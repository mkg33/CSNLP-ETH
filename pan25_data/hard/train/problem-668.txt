When people were bashing Macron for saying the exact same thing, I thought it was typical French bashing.
I couldn't imagine that it was not intentional how they were twisting his words and acting like they didn't understand what's it's all about.
Anyway, here leaving a diplomatic door opened simply means that when Russia accept it's defeat, give back to Ukraine their initial territory, and is ready to move forward then the other countries will sit around the table in a good faith.
Russia has signaled it's not willing to back off so talks between Russia and Ukraine are fairly unproductive - one side is unable to offer terms, the other side isn't willing to agree to terms that are acceptable to anyone else.
This isn't the US just bypassing Ukraine, this is the US making it impossible for Russia to whine that they tried to negotiate but nobody would be reasonable so they have to keep the war going.
Making impossible demands to even come to the table and then blaming the other side for rejecting negotiations is standard Russian operating procedure.
This short circuits that.
