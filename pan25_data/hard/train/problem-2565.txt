Exactly.
Losing tax exempt status wouldn’t impact most churches, because they don’t have a surplus at the end of the year.
If the church lost $12,000 this year, they’re not going to pay taxes.
However, as others mention, most churches would pass the test for having a mission that doesn’t just benefit its members.
My church is fully affirming.
We provide meals to students.
We have a support group for families with Alzheimer’s/dementia so there is a safe space for both people.
We run day programs for prisoners.
We find a soup kitchen at a partner church down the road.
Etc, etc, and most of the people in these programs don’t participate in church worship.
We report transparently on what part of the budget is going to worship activities (about 25%) and what goes to social justice causes (75%).
Most Lutheran parishes I’ve been involved with even go as far as to post their budgets publicly online, which I would think counts as extreme transparency.
If I’m not mistaken, TEC and PCUSA have similar policies as well.
The article you linked doesn’t really mention mainline churches refusing to open their books, so I’m curious what you’re basing that assertion on.
I discount the claim about mainline protest churches because they refuse to open their books as standard practice.
Some certainly do, but that is definitely not the norm.
They should be forced to have open books as all normal charities do.
