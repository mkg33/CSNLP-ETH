I’ve never seen this usage before in my nearly 50 years.
Personally it looks weird and I’m with your parent poster.
Yes I can figure it out.
That doesn’t make it “everyone knows”.
And I’ll reiterate: I don’t really care about the number that much.
I hope it’s much lower than the Russians.
We are curious because we are human.
It’s in our nature to wonder.
I haven’t seen a number from Ukraine.
Do you have an official source of one?
And we were talking about the count of Ukrainian casualties here, not Russian, so maybe you were mixed up with that?
Allegedly, both sides will use propaganda, we probably won't know true death counts for Ukraine and Russia until long after the war.
Fair to say Russia ironically getting their shit pushed in though.
Russia's figures are off by a factor of ten from everyone else.
Everyone else is Ukraine's numbers +/-10%.
As for Ukraine, they don't even share everything.
This has been a low key point of contention between Kyiv and Washinon, particularly early on.
America's response to death is less about the quantity and more about the audacity underlying the cause.
Virus that could be stopped with a few minor inconveniences?
I sleep.
Assholes blowing up our landmarks?
Real shit.
