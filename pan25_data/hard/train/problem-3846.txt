If it was an S300, then it can only have come from Ukraine.
As you said, things misfire and fail all the time.
It could be that the missile just went the wrong way.
If i had to guess, i think it probably either was a UA S300 having some sort of launch malfunction or a Russian Cruise Missile.
It wasnt fired by Russia because it is an S300 missile fired by AA defense that accidentally fell in Poland because self-destruct failsafe did not work.
Was there a Russian missile flying towards a Ukrainian target, a Ukrainian operator trying to shoot it down with a counter-missile, and missing?
If so, did the Russian missile hit its mark?
In other words, was the counter-missile warranted and shouldn't have had its flight terminated - it just missed?
If so, why did it miss?
If not, was the counter-missile launched without a valid target to defend from?
Was it an 'extra', a 'backup', was the operator misguided and launched a counter-missile into the air while there was no Russian missile at all?
I don't know specifics and am far from an armchair general, but since you seem to know a thing or two, where does this info stand with Russia using S-300s for their ground attacks?
Again, I don't know shit, just I remember S-300 in regards to Russia AA conversion, and now I'm seeing them mentioned in this incident.
