Are you forgetting his efforts in overthrowing the election?
Just because Dan Quayle talked him out of Trump's last attempt, doesn't make him a patriot.
If he wants to be a Patriot, he would have came forward with evidence after a coup attacked our Capitol and an attempt to hang him.
But he still protects those people.
He was protecting himself, not the country when he did not go along with it.
His cooperation now is the same thing.
Self-preservation.
The fuck he did.
He knew it crossed the line into criminality, that is why he did not go along.
Treason can be punished by the death penalty.
Had he gone along with this, he would have been arrested the same day.
There would be no denying it was a banana republic style coup had he gone with it.
Pence is a piece of shit right wing radio host that wanted to hurt this country as much as possible, but his personal plans got fucked up by trump.
At best he holds a grudge against trump, he isn't motivated to come clean to help america, only himself.
