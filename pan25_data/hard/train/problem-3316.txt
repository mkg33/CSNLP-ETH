exactly.
and until i see that happen every fucking cop is the same in my eyes as the ones doing the dirt.
and maybe even worse, since they create an environment that allows these types of abuse to happen.
i'd go further and say that current cop culture where they call themselves warriors and are constantly told they are in a war/under constant threat is the biggest part of the problem.
a few years ago i was visiting my family in Houston.
My idiot step brother had a travel mug the HPD was selling, it was the first time i saw the punisher logo with the blue line.
it really freaked me the fuck out that these guys are leaning into the shit.
when cops openly embrace lawlessness and vigilantism we're all fucked.
Here in Portland most of our cops live across the river in WA.
it's essentially an occupying army, they have no stake in the community, no connection to the city and nothing but contempt for the people that live here.
i've know a fair number of Marines over the years, as well as Navy and a few Army guys.
to say the military is rotten to the core is only possible if you don't know actual members of the military.
there are shitbirds everywhere, a few hundred of them stormed the capitol.
and unlike the cops that participated, active duty military are facing the consequences of being part of a coup.
i've yet to hear of a single cop fired for taking part in 1/6.
If he really did reach for a cop's gun, that may be seen as a justification.
But did that happen?
I've not heard it.
That's what I mean when I say I want the other side of the story.
The defendants have made no statements that I've heard.
