It was such a banger they raided the BBC offices of India for a completely "unrelated" reason and banned the documentary!
A lot of the "talks" that happen at the G20 also happen when it's not in session as well.
All the Indian government will achieve in doing is not being at the big boy table when leaders meet for "lunches" and quietly discuss the biggest issue on the table.
Oh, do you mean that little BBC documentary THE MODI QUESTION that was banned in India and the Indian government raided the BBC offices in India for a "totally separate" reason?
?
nah.
they're going to play the same game China is.
In the past it was a strategic decision to purchase weapons of war from the soviets, and then the russians, and now they know they have to find new suppliers, but can game the sanctions by buying russian oil at a discount and selling the refined products to the west.
Much of the weaponry being sent to Ukraine has been old soviet tech (with the promise of replacement by NATO standardized weaponry) from former USSR or USSR aligned countries.
India is bordered by two relatively hostile nations, one of which the US supports (ish) and the other it opposes (ish).
India's situation is unique, and they could set the stage for how the world politics moves forward in that region if they choose to.
We will have to see what happens... we have an expression in my language "Everyone is a General... AFTER the war".
You're right, India still uses much of the same old soviet technology and is reliant on them.
I wonder how much of each of our societies opinions and what "side" we are on is dictated by who our leaders buy their weapons from (and not just the current ones, but the ammunition that works with the current weaponry).
Even if India wanted to end their relation with Russian weaponry (which they have been slowly) the current weaponry they have use 39 mm (standardized by the Warsaw Pact) as opposed to the NATO standardized 59 mm (I may be wrong, I'm not military buff).
