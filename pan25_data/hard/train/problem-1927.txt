I'm gonna be honest: I couldn't give less of a shit about the politics of it.
Do the right thing.
That's what gets people wanting to support the party.
But it's clear the party still has along way to go in gutting its corporate hacks.
If this corporate support over workers rights continues, Dems are liable to hand full control back to the Republicans in '24.

".
Yeah.
Want to know what the response should be?
Hatred towards the GOP, not hatred towards the Dems who are at least managing to get things passed despite GOP intransigence.
The fact that you're taking this and somehow framing the Dems as the evil ones here is just....clich√©.
Except that we expect Republicans to do evil shit.
Not much we can do about that just yet.
We equally expect Dems not to side with them on this sort of bill.
Or at least, I sure as hell hope we're holding them to a higher standard than the would-be-fascist/theocracy party.
