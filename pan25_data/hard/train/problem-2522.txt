Originally left and right was a question of Democracy vs Monarchy in France.
It had nothing to do with capitalism.
Throughout history the left has been used to describe liberalism and since the Democratic party is a liberal party, the term is appropriate.
After the growth of movements such as Marxism and anarchism, the term "left" became more commonly used to describe people of those philosophies with the original "left" liberals and other left-leaning capitalists being rebranded as center-left (which I am perfectly fine with.)
But to be perfectly clear, center-left is still left and no mainstream definition of the term puts social liberals or the Democratic party on the right.
The only way the Democratic platform could be considered right-wing is if you subscribe to the idea that "all capitalists are on the right," hence my comment.
Also, you participate in capitalism so you’re fucking right wing?
What the fuck kind of shit take is that?
He didn’t block it.
It’s against the law.
They had to change the law to allow a strike or try to force what the workers wanted on the railroads.
That’s what they tried and it failed because of an actual center-right dem and a bunch of fucking traitorous republicans.
If Democrats had ANY spine, they'd FORCE the Republicans to vote no on all of it together, but they didn't.
Neither party cares about the working class when it comes to this sort of thing.
I'm done voting for either party.
When you guys are done being brainwashed as much as the Trump cult is, maybe this country will improve before I finally get the fuck out of here to a better country.
