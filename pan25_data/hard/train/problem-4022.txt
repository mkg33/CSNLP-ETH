If it’s fired by Russia from Belarus Lukashenko would see it as a massive betrayal and Russia losses one of a few sympathisers she’s got.
If it’s Belarus from Belarus you risk nato involvement for this strike?
Unless your testing the nato response this is an insane first strike.
It needs to hurt bad enough to be just a little scary and remove any doubt as to the unified response of nato.
The future of humanity may very well depend on it.
Well, if it was a Ukrainian air defense missile then I guess NATO has no choice but to destroy Ukraine!
(/s).
The minimum response required to ensure that no more missiles can go into NATO airspace, since Russia apparently can’t ensure that on their own.
One stray missile landing a couple of kilometres inside Poland, assuming it was even fired by the Russians, is nowhere near the threat level posed by the Cuban missiles.
If Russia decided they wanted to attack Poland it would be like day 1 of the Ukraine war, a load of missiles launched near simultaneously with the aim of destroying polish infrastructure and response capability.
Like you noted, a Soviet tactical missile battery within spitting distance of the Eastern seaboard (and crucially DC) was terrifying because it would mean they could now launch a surprise attack against a precise target (the WH or the Pentagon, for example) without warning and without much collateral damage, as a prelude to full scale invasion.
