> Now, Mexico has agreed to pay for a number of projects through a joint multiyear effort along the countries’ borders, including “modernizing” ports of entry and enhancing screening processes of immigrants trying to cross from Mexico to the U.S.
The exact details of the new projects are still being worked out, but, the official said, the new agreement will not result in the building of any kind of wall or border barrier.
Even if you were just trying to change the topic to Mexico paying for USA's wall, your article does not support this:
I guess the US is unique in that it’s the only one that needs a “wall” that isn’t going to do shit against a cartel state they helped create.
The wall isn't being built to stop troops from invading, it's to prevent immigrants from crossing the border.
Wall isn't meant to repel invaders merely to make it harder for people to enter the country in a clandestine way.
Spies, saboteurs, but also remember when Belarus tried to send a bunch of migrants through to Poland in an attempt to disrupt them?
Stuff like that could be very dangerous and costly for Finland.
