In my state, if you get assigned a judge that you do not think is fair, you can affidavit them and get reassigned without question.
It is like a preemptory challenge for a juror.
It seems strange to me that does not seem to exist in Federal Court.
Please correct me if I am wrong.
I never practice in Federal Court.
It seems the only way to disqualify a judge is if there is some actual bias, ie judge personally knows litigants and/or facts, or implied bias, ie where impartiality might be reasonably questioned.
I am glad the DOJ is fighting this.
At least they don't have to fear filing the disqualification motion as it can't get any worse for them if they are still stuck with the same Judge.
You don't always get to choose and Judge's still largely follow precedent but if you were involved in a case and found a Judge that perhaps set the precedent you want... well you'll want that Judge to take the case.
Go look at divorce cases, anything prolific will have a shopped judge who leans more heavily one way or the other.
When I practiced family law last century, there were five judges who heard divorce cases.
Cases were assigned on a rotating basis.
All you had to do to forum shop was ask the clerk who was up next, and then wait until enough other cases were filed to make the judge you wanted be the next one.
Then you filed yours.
Some judges were better if you were trying to get a father custody of his kid, others were better at alimony awards, etc.
