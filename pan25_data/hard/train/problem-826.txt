It seems that way because it is that way.
There's no real sense to what constitutes a state.
From a historical context it basically boils down to slavery and railroad tycoons.
ON TOP OF THAT, we also capped the total amount in the House of Representatives 100 years ago.
Why?
Because we wanted to make sure that small rural areas had power and ya gotta draw a line somewhere right?
But wait!
Didn't we already fucking compromise on that?
Isn't that the reason we have the bicameral legislature in the first place?
Why yes it is.
Yeah I agree.
I don’t know what the solution would be tho :/ because rural ppl shouldn’t get more say per vote but the problem is politicians would pander to city people and potentially screw over rural folks if they knew their policies would be more popular in cities.
An example would be if they decide to ban gas powered cars nation wide because people in the city want to go EV and the rural folk wouldn’t be heard where charging stations are nonexistent.
Not to mention, even though it’s a flawed system, without it, rural folks would never have a say in the way they are treated.
It’s different living in a metropolis vs rurally and they require different governing.
Chill dude.
Idk why all the anger towards someone who’s just thinking out loud.
For the record I’m not a Republican (in case that’s the reason for animosity).
