It’s pre conditioning to vote R no matter the situation.
They will legit contradict their own position while talking.
There was a recent clip of a guy who believed abortion is murder and then next sentence excused Herschel Walker because sometimes people sin.
It’s bananas.
And it’s a cult.
It’s very similar to religion.
That’s why I think you see a lot of religious (I.e.
evangelicals) folks who can’t even bring themselves to vote D. These people are just too susceptible to propaganda and it’s now engrained in “who they are” even if they vote against it.
There is a portion of the Democrats who refuse to see, recognize, or act against the capricious voters that the Republicans have attracted.
If a democrat complains when a republican does things to fuck with the election, if anyone suggests that this makes it a both sides issue - that democrats routinely deny the validity of elections - they are to be laughed out of the room.
It's so farcically one sided that conservatives use the fact that people complain about their innumerable electoral misdeeds as evidence that they should be allowed to throw fake doubt onto an election.
The Democratic side has no equivalent to this, not on real issues, and certainly not on invented issues, so people either fall into the conservative narrative (see the ) or just generally stop paying attention.
Those aren't mutually exclusive, because "their own interests" are whatever culture war issue Faux News is telling them to care about.
