You are right that 3:1 gives a higher number of overall casualities but for the russians 2:1 is far worse because it means they have much more dead soldiers than „normal“.
Both sides losing same number of people is also false, Russian loses are about 3.1 to 1 Ukrainian and that taking into account large Ukrainian losses at the start of the war.
This has been corroborated by many parties not just Ukrainians.
There is no way Russia wins this war, Ukraine is guaranteed 100% to win it.
At a huge cost, sure, but Ukraine will win.
Simple economics, Putin’s age( anger and dissatisfaction within Russia are just a few reasons.
I talk to Russians living all over Russia every day, who work on various sectors of the economy, some of whom are high ranking military, there is absolutely zero chance Russia wins this war and they all know it.
There is nothing they can do about it other than let it ride out.
Longer it goes the worse things get for Russia.
I suggest you listen to Russian economy perspectives that was presented at Davos yesterday.
It’s grim.
Russia is fucked and at this point it can’t do anything about it.
Ukraine has been at war for 9 years, another year or two won’t change much, Russia has been at war for 11 month and has lost more men, equipment, resources than any other war it has been a part of other than ww1/2.
More lost per month than in 10 years in Afghanistan.
I know exactly where your “parity of losses” statement comes from, it’s the misquoted, misunderstood and picked up by Russian propaganda quote from Milley from 4 months ago.
And you fell for it.
He said he was guessing, he wasn’t reporting on numbers, he included civilian deaths into the number (which is over 20k just in Mariupol and over all more than 50k), he was pleading for more support for Ukraine and more pressure against Russia so he was trying to paint Ukraine as someone who needs help.
So stop spreading Russian propaganda.
My point is that people need to stop underestimating Russia.
If you're painting a picture of one where Russia is on the verge of losing because they are running out of munitions then all you're doing is regurgitating propaganda that's not true.
Both sides have lost the same number of troops, but one side has 3 times the population of the other and for all of Ukraine' advances in the North and South, Russia has done nothing but slowly push back Ukranian forces in the East since November.
They have also done nothing in the South besides building strong fortifications with the intention of defending Crimea to the death.
