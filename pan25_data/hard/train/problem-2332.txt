France is leveraging its historic ties there to shape many things that would be considered 'expanding influence' and sometimes bordering on 'predatory' or 'colonialist in attitude'.
So why is this ok then but Russia challenging this is automatically bad?
The European nebulous and ambivalent position towards African vaccine production and licensing due to profit considerations during the first rollout of the Covid vaccine has also not been forgotten by many African states.
While France has been very vocal about 'vaccine disparity' in public, privately the deadlock is still strong because the details are hard to figure out.
I'm pretty sure French commentary on what is considered 'good' and 'bad' influence in many parts of West Africa is met with a mixture of indifference, mockery and distrust.
To me it read that Macron is saying that anti-French attitudes in west Africa aren't for genuine reasons but rather manipulation by propaganda.
Macron has never denied French colonialism, that is true, but it's the fact that it's coming from the President of France that will make people roll their eyes.
I lived in francophone Africa for many years, there was plenty of suspicion and distrust of the French government there long before the Russians were present.
Of course I also doubt you'd find a lot of people there that believe that the Russians have pure intentions.
I certainly don't think so.
Of course it isn't.
Everyone knows Putin's involvement in foreign countries is moved by a deep love of humankind.
Ask the Syrians Ask the Ukrainians.
I don' t think the vast majority of commentors here are real people trying to have a real conversation.
Too many comments pointing at the same sources to underline France's past crimes.
