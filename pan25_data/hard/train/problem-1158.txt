The AIPAC should be registered as a Foreign Agent, and many congressmen and people in government have tried to push for them to register as a foreign agent over the decades.
The AIPAC is a PAC That pushes the agenda of Israel.
They also have 12 billion behind them and they will try to unseat Congressman Democrat or Republican who do not go along with their agenda.
Because if you criticize Israel in any way whatsoever they come back and say you're anti-semite which is wrong.
They used to conflate criticism of Israel with hatred of Jews and call both anti-Semitism.
Now they've taken the next step: criticism of Israel is called anti-Semitism, while hatred of Jews is not.
It's kinda wild how the GOP turned "anti-Semitism" from a phrase that mean 'anti-Jewish" into one that means "Doesn't blindly support the Israeli apartheid state.
".
Hmm.
That sounds pretty familiar.
Wonder if they're taking cues from countries that literally surround them and do the same thing.
Is a theocracy only bad when Jews do it?
In all fairness, I'm against a theocracy embracing any religion.
