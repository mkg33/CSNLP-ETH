Many high-skilled jobs simply either don't exist here, or pay low-skilled wages (which are extremely low for a Western European country).
The result is that people in certain fields (physics, chemistry, compsci, biology, etc) can't find a job in these areas, and instead look for jobs elsewhere in Western Europe.
The only reason (imo) this youth exodus isn't higher is because Spain has certain positive traits that are hard to give up, at least for someone who has been raised here.
Spain also has a lack of jobs especially entry level jobs but it's easier to say the teenagers have no employable skills than actually looking at the real problem.
Spain has no education system that qualifies you for work beside a university or just learning on the job.
When ever I was in Spain for work I noticed that especially the younger people rarely spoke English or understood English at all.
I don't know when or where you were in Spain, but I'd say that anyone older 40 has had English lessons for at least 8 years.
Younger people certainly have, at the very least, a basic understanding of the language.
