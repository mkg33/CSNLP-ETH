Read a Fox opinion piece today with someone suggesting those documents in Trumps personal office could have just gotten there by mistake.
What did trump do with his misplaced confidential documents?
First they didn’t exist, then they just weren’t classified anymore(no the President can’t blanket declassify everything), and when they did exist they tried to not return them to the archives - legit to the point the FBI had to go seize them.
Uh.
No.
It’s not different for democrats.
Did you miss where there’s a special counsel already and that individual will look into the details.
Presently, Biden’s team contacted the national archives to report the misplacement of the documents and has returned them.
Biden's lawyers noticed a mistake, self-reported, returned the documents to the archive (who didn't even know they were missing) immediately, with no adverse effects for anyone.
Trump's authority to declassify is completely irrelevant.
They knowingly took things he wasn't allowed to have, ignored multiple requests to return them, and repeatedly lied to investigators about what they had and what they returned.
Investigators and archivists bent over backwards to accommodate Trump and his lawyers, and they still managed to completely avoid doing the right thing.
