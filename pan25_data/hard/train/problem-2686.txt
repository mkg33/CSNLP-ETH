The original ruling was flawed and was destined to be overturned.
Even RBG acknowledged it was a weak ruling with very little to stand on.
Plus why would one of the conservative judges leak one of their own opinions?
That accusation makes no sense in itself.
You're presuming he had a clear-headed reason for doing it, and that may not be the case.
He may have just been excited to tell someone.
He leaked the Hobby Lobby case to some dinner guests.
Alito .
Why would the investigation not talk to the one person we have credible reason to believe has done something like this before?
Could it be because Roberts isn't actually a moderate?
What's really scary is that when Roberts retires or dies people will be calling Kavanaugh a "moderate".
The fact that Roberts is seen as a moderate is proof of how fucking far to the extreme right the court now sits.
I think Roberts probably is more “center” but he is probably so fucking embarrassed to have his name on this court.
This farce cannot be what he expected when he was nominated to the bench.
Roberts has lost control of the court and it’s a terrible look for him.
He knows this is his legacy now and I’m sure regrets it but what can he do?
