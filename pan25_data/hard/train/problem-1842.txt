What I was trying to say is you can condemn homosexual behavior, which is a choice, without saying homosexuality (as in, being attracted to the same gender, and not the other) is acquired, and therefore the fault of the individual.
That would simply mean you expect of people not to follow their natural desires, and in the extreme case, live celibatory.
Instead of the alternative of blaming them for having these desires in the first place, and promoting the idea of conversion therapy.

Which one of the 40.000 ones?
Also "Homosexual behavior bad" is different than "Homosexuality is acquired", and I don't think every church teaching the former will also agree to the latter.
Please, "homosexuality is acquired" is the false pretext used to justify almost all discrimination against gay people.
It's a conspiracy theory based in hate and bigotry, much like the "jews are controlling the worlds finances" conspiracy is the pretext for justifying anti-semitism.
