$100k represents one one hundredth of one percent (0.0001) of a company worth a billion dollars.
Truly “rounding error” level money for a global real estate development corporation.
Any one of Trump’s golf trips during his presidency likely cost taxpayers more than that.
This fine sounds more like an incentive than a deterrent.
It’s a cost savings if you can cook the books to hide more than that each year.
And that’s if you get caught and convicted and your company receives the maximum sentence.
If you stay under the radar (by not running for president and throwing your chief “fixer” under the bus, who subsequently spills his guts on national TV), it all becomes profit!
I’d like to know how much $$$ the treasury was actually shorted by the Trump Organization’s tax fraud over the years.
I expect that it was well beyond $1.6 million.
The company was charged $1.61 million.
That's like being required to clean the dust off your neighbor's ceiling fan after stealing a tractor trailer full of baby formula.
Just the cost of doing business.
So here's the thing.
I'm lightspeed stupid.
I shouldn't even have political opinions.
Yet, here we are.
That stupidity infects every aspect of my life.
Analogies included, because, well, analogies fall under the category of "every.

Oh well.
Just make sure each count will net you more than a quarter million plus legal fees, and your books will still be in the black.
