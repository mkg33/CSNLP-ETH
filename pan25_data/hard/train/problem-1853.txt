It's true, but sometimes I order something, and it takes 4 days to ship.
I expect my statements to be reflective of activities as they are happening, not as amazon decides to ship.
I've waited 3 or 4 weeks for an item to become in stock again before being charged, thusly placing that charge on another statement as opposed to one I expect it to be on (when the purchase was made).
Other sites don't do this.
They either allow you to order and charge you for a back ordered item immediately, or they don't let you order at all.
It's a problem, and amazon should stop it.
Yeah, Amazon sucks.
We've had prime for years, but ever since COVID our orders take like 7 to 10 days to get here.
The products are prime, they ship from Amazon warehouses, and while technically it is "2 day shipping" they don't actually ship for 5 days or more.
We just cancelled prime and our stuff still gets here in the same amount of time and the shipping is free....so like, why even have prime.
Yeah if you use it for that it might be worth it.
I was annoyed because we were using it for PBS kids which is the regular Amazon subscription price plus another 4.99 a month and once you cancel prime you can't do the PBS kids stuff..like you can't just pay 4.99 and forget the rest of the prime content.
Kind of a bummer but I found a script that scrapes the content off the free PBS kids website and I just collect that and keep it on a media server now.
