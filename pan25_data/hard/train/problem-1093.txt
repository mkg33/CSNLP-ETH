And it was a jet not "jets" shot down and they didn't know of the nationality of the two jets flying over the boarder but either way what is it your trying to imply?
I could say the same thing, Russia doesn't fuck about, they conducted airstrikes on a Turkish army convoy in Operation Dawn of Idlib 2 resulting in the deaths of between 50-100 Turkish Soldiers.
The point i guess is that Turkey wasn't afraid of Russia, they knew Russia was operating there, they shot down the russian fighter not because they didn't know it was russian, they shot it down because they don't give a fuck if is russian or syrian or whatever.
Just because you know the position of a whole range of defensive guns doesn't mean you can just take them out, even if you didn't mind declaring war on turkey and NATO while losing a war against another small independent nation.
Any force large enough to simultaneously taken out all the guns before passing, ignoring anti ship missile launchers, would be very noticeable as an invasion force, and would cause turkey to send their fleet there as well as requesting NATO navy support.
NATO weapons and airpower are certainly impressive, no doubt, but short of leveling a 20 mile strip through the center of the nation, it's not going to be enough to knock out every small AShM emplacement, portable ATGM and small arm that can shred the topside of the ship when given that much time and proximity.
Anything above a .50cal is a legit anti-shipping weapon if someone tried to force the straits.
You might not sink it, but it wouldn't be mission-capable when it got to the other side.
