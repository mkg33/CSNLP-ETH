Zionism is the belief that Israel should exist.
You're contradicting yourself.
My temple is Beth Israel.
I can condemn the actions of the Israeli government, but the right of Israel to exist is part of my religion.
The clubs' rules are anti-Semitic because they aren't just protesting against the government's actions.
They're protesting against the right of the homeland to exist.
The lawyer from Miami said that condemning isn't enough if the school refuses to take action.
Jews are a protected class under the law.
Let's give a hypothetical example where a majority of campus clubs at a public college make a rule that says you can't join if you believe in gay marriage.
This would exclude most gays from being able to attend.
If the Dean condems the rule, but takes no action, do you think the clubs should still be allowed to keep the rule?
The question the court must answer is if the actions of the clubs represent the actions of the school despite the Dean's words.
Are the clubs practicing their free speech or are these actions targeting a protected class to prevent them from attending the college?
A student group said they wouldn't invite any speakers who hold theses beliefs and the school condemned that position...
But then a lawyer from Miami who is also CEO of a business in Israel decided to file a lawsuit against the school.
