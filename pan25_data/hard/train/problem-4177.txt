>Laws imposing Afrikaans played a role in the oppression of black citizens during the apartheid era, and the language remains controversial in some sectors of society today.
Afrikaans remains controversial for this reason.
If there was no enslavement or colonization, there would be no Afrikaans language.
With Afrikaans, to my understanding, it was divisive on racial AND class lines.
In the past, the ruling class spoke Afrikaans, but not all whites were in the ruling class.
In a country with such a diverse population, I'm sure it is very common for people to speak two or more languages.
There are plenty of people who speak the same language who grow in different cultures and have different experiences.
A native Spanish speaker in Argentina experiences a vastly different culture than a Mexican or a Spaniard.
I think this is the opposite of true.
Having a common language opens up tons of cultural options that are otherwise unavailable - everything from books to movies to music - without someone else doing the considerable work of doing the translation for you.
