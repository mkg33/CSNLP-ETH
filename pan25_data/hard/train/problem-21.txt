go join the jihad squad and try to prevent defensive funding for iron dome, thats right , DEFENSIVE.
Ilhan and rashida would love you to join them since they are indocrinated to hate israel and support the jihad.
They have reporters that are, but not the whole organization.
They often have sensationationalist titled editorials that say" palestinians are killed by IDF" but omit that they were involved in attacking israelis.
Its quite common for them to do this.
The boys were being pricks damaging vandalising stuff, and the guy being an immigrant had nothing to do with why they beat him, it was because he interfered with what they were doing.
The people commenting here are all literally neo nazis because they are just coming here to call all israelis bad because they are all technically the real neonazis.
You totally missed my point: I was referring to the comments like "yeah Israelis are nazis", while I argue that this particular case is about typical youth violence that has nothing to do with ideology.
It seems like many here didn't read the article: the most wild thing about this case was that said immigrant was a Ukrainian Jew named Abraham, who was talking too these bastards in Hebrew - so they perfectly well knew his ethnicity.
Of course it’s a rhetorical question because the obvious narrative mindless idiots are trying to push without reading the article is that Israelis attacked a Ukrainian man because he’s Ukrainian.
