Who in the hell, as a politician, can get away with saying they think you shouldn't have citizenship if you think other countries are better?
That's some actual 1984 shit, and this ass got close enough to being elected that they have to try again.
It's especially egregious considering that if you look at the numbers, there are better counties that do exist, and they are empirically doing a better job.
I wouldn't be surprised if he was in favor of pretending those countries don't exist, or making it a crime to point out that other countries do things better.
That's "you better think America is the best or we'll prevent you from even being considered a citizen".
"And I'm saying, and I'm not being tough, I'm saying if you know a place better, you go there but you lose your citizenship here in the United States of America,".

"And then when you come back, you gotta come back legally, like we should be defending the border.
".
It's a tell.
They're mentally incompetent, unable to view the world as anything other than a zero-sum battlefield.
It's really funny, there literally no provisions for revoking citizenship for anything other than high treason, and I don't know if I should be alarmed or just laugh that Republicans even say stuff like this out loud.
The definition of sociopathy is not "extra hate" it's just the lack of the core elements of empathy and altruism that foster social cooperation.
Republicans are sociopaths.
