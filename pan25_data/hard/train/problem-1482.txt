Go look at Virginia, where Glenn Youngkin won.
Are they really better off for having a less obvious sort who's still a MAGA ally as their Governor?
So tell me - who was smarter, VA Democrats, or PA Democrats?
Because I know which one I'd say was the smarter of the two by a long shot.
People also seem aghast like this is somehow promoting extremism in the Republican party.
No, Republicans did that - and the fact that Democrats can buy ads that say things like "Doug Mastriano has super extreme positions!"
and that makes Republican primary voters more likely to support him - that is 100% on the Republicans.
Hey, it's not my favorite strategy but if helps get more dems elected instead of obstructive republicans then I'll support it.
It's not like those funds can be used outside of campaign finance anyway.
Do you understand how campaign finances work?
I wouldn't actually consider that "funding terrorists" It's a strategy that dems use under certain circumstances in efforts to win the election and it regularly works in their favor.
