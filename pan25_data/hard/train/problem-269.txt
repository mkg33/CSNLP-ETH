Can you link me to said documented facts that their wives are telling them to do it?
Since you know, that’s what they’re talking about.
Why would I apologize for asking for proof of something?
The burden of proof is in you, not me here.
Still waiting… (I see one person linked one nypost video of one person’s conversation, which is a start I suppose).
That said I wouldn’t be surprised if there were a few bug job couples in Russia that get off in that kind of thing.
The claim that a great number of wives are into their husbands raping women, well color me dubious.
Do we really believe the wives are encouraging their husbands to rape women?
I know they want to demonize the Russians on the world stage but the Russians are doing a fine job of demonizing themselves.
I do wonder what kind of propaganda they are getting in Russia to hate fellow human beings this badly.
This sounds terrible, but we should probably keep in mind the likelihood this is Ukrainian propaganda.
There is propaganda on both sides, and Ukraine happens to be the underdog so we are more likely to believe them.
