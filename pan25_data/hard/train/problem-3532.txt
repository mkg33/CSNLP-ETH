Assuming causalities are even significant on either side.
A failed invasion could just be China being turned around, after seeing how serious the US is about Taiwan.
A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be incredibly difficult because it is an Island.
Only a few times in modern warfare have amphibious invasions worked, primarily the allied invasion of Italy in WWII which was incredibly costly and possibly a huge mistake.
(Normandy was into occupied territory, not a sovereign nation).
Chinese losses would be catastrophic and the necessary occupying force would face severe logistics issues and an entrenched, skilled, and motivated insurgency at the very least supplied by the US.
I don't know if China will or won't invade but the invasion would certainly be a drawn out and bloody - I don't know if China could endure years of international condemnation as the videos and images roll out.
I don't think the scenario is highly likely, but I could see it at least being heavily considered if China decides to go all in with the invasion.
This is one of the many reasons I don't think it is likely.
If China believes we will defend Taiwan from the bases though, they could view those countries as involved making them legitimate targets in their view, or could believe they may not retaliate if only US assets are hit, limiting the US' ability to support them.
I believe we have a similar type situation with Taiwan now - but for congress to declare war to assist with a "friendly" nation that would get invaded via China.
We'd more than likely only declare war tobassist with the defense, not sure we'd declare total war unless we were attacked at a base or of course home land.
