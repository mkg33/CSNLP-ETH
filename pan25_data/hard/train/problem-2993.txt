You dont get it, do you…?
Big money is behind both sides.
The intrest is to have a war for as long as possible to be able to make money off of it for as long as possible.
Those big corpos dont give two shits about either side.
You think all the weaponry the US and EU is pouring into Ukraine is donated?
My sweet summer child.
The news that wont ”accidentally leak” are which US miltech companies are supplying Russia while at the same time government figures publicly state how the war should end….
Im failing to analyze the fact that the US sends military equipment to Ukraine almost every other week?
And the EU has supplied god knows how much..
Including tanks that are now due to be supplied.
Im creating my own reality?
=D.
Edit : Thank for dv.
But after dv, you should look for NYT and imminient need for US's strategic goals in history.
Sometimes, they do personal i.e cele thing but most of their stuff is about US's goal i.e CIA.
Also, US already won when Russia stop sending Missiles on Cuba.
They were going for all win with minimal risks by sending assassins and plot to fuck Cuba.
