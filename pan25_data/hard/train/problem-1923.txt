Although interestingly enough, Xi Jinping was also the first Chinese leader to meet with a sitting ROC president since the Civil War.
Yeah, I’m sitting in Taoyuan night now with my FIL who has decided that Xi is really a great man and what a “strong leader” looks like and that the US is the world’s bully and is causing cross-strait tensions because of some vast conspiracy.
I guess there are two points.
First, the propaganda towards older KMT supporters in Taiwan is as toxic as Fox News wishes it is and things here are way different from what a lot of Americans think.
Also, there is less concern about an actual conflict by Taiwanese people in Taiwan than the average American who for some reason seems to think that this conflict is only about computer chips and who controls TSMC.
While I understand that while other people like to say stuff like "China doesn't deserve it because they've been threatening to invade Taiwan," I think when Taiwan is doing this it is sending a powerful message to the world and especially to the Chinese people.
It will make Taiwan gain a higher moral ground and make everyone further realize how Taiwan has always been on the more reasonable side during this conflict.
Taiwan is doing it because it is a liberal democracy that cares about human rights, similar to how South Korea is offering to help North Korea during humanitarian crises.
I admire Taiwan for being a good sport and this kind of humanitarianism is going to have a meaningful symbolism.
I think it's a very good decision that Taiwan's president is offering to help China and I definitely support this even as someone who is pro-Taiwan.
It's a similar thing back then when South Korea's president offered to help North Korea with its Covid surge.
(But obviously Taiwan-China relations are different from N.-S. Korean relations.
).
what a mess.
good luck, though.
that should create a few interesting variants that then sweep the globe.
