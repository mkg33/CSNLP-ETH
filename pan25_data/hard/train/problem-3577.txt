Look at the comments under the video, the ones in russian...
Sometimes, I almost pity them.
Then I look at what "common people" are saying and get the reminder, that's not just putin's or kremlin war.
That what's most off putting of Putin sympathizers IMO.
They want us to take Russia's security concerns seriously when they're scared of their own shadow.
And it is not only a security risk towards Moldova, it is a threat to Ukraine as well (and thus the offer).
One could even say it is the responsibility of Moldova to resolve the situation, having Russian troops in their territory threatening Ukraine is not really ok.
So Russia doesn't really have anything to lose by annexing Moldova (again - that already happened in 1940).
They will need to allocate some (relatively small) amount of troops to hold the territory, but that's about it.
I am not sure Russia has anything to gain though since I don't think there is much point to this for them.
The problem is that Moldova is about 15 times smaller by population compared to Ukraine and is much poorer - it is one of the poorest countries in Europe.
Ukraine was able to resist and it was still touch and go - Moldova will not be able to do so for any significant period of time.
It is obvious that European countries are not going to be using their own troops in the country, and Russia is already sanctioned like crazy.
