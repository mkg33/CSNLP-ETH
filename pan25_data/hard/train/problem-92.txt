Interesting, but not very thorough article, at least for someone who didn't follow the links.
I think there could be some real merit to not telling abusive parents where their runaway children are.
Of course, the question that should be considered is how this good intent could go horribly wrong with incorrect enforcement.
I certainly don't have the answer to that.
I don't go around claiming to be a woman.
I'm pretty guarded about my gender and never make mention of myself in gendered terms.
I don't try to dictate to others how to gender me.
I let others decide based on my appearance and most people think I'm a woman.
So much so that today when I was in the men's locker room down to my undies and a tank top, an old man got upset, and reported me to the staff for a woman being in the men's locker room.
Damned if you do, damned if you don't, eh?
Lol.
It's cool.
I didn't even know I was intersex until I was in my 20s, although I certainly felt and looked different enough.
I've never interacted with an intersex person before.
If I may ask, and please feel free to refuse if you are uncomfortable, I have a few questions.
