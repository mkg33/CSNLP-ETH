As someone who works for a Jewish organization that fights antisemitism and generally supports Israel - here is my personal take.
Yes - israel is an apartheid state - in that many Palestinians have fewer rights than Israelis based on their ethnicity.
I am not saying that Palestinians don't have a right to live peacefully, but that isn't going to happen while they are under their own self-made terrorist rule.
Hamas is a group of religious fanatics, they aren't interested in peace.
Because apparently the younger you die in war, the more glory you get.
You don't get the cry about how many children you've lost in a war, if you are literally using them as a shield...
You don't get to say Israel is targeting children, when the other side is literally sending children to fight their holy war.
I'm sorry that they aren't laying down, and letting 7-year-olds blow themselves up and shoot them.
Again, the average age of military enlistment is 13, not 18, and some of them are as young as 7.
The people you should be mad at, is the religious extremist organization Hamas.
I don’t like Hamas but I’ve had this argument enough times and done enough research to know that Israelis started the conflict.
I’m not just talking about forcibly taking land, I’m talking about terroristic attacks.
Since when is fighting back against an attacker and oppressor “terrorism”?
There are plenty of incidents where Jewish people rightfully fought the Germans before and during WWII.
Does that make the Jewish people terrorists or heroes?
I say heroes.
