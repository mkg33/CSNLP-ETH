In no way do I think he should not face criminal consequences, in fact I said "yet" from the very start.
The republican party is realizing that he is as cancerous to their cause as we realize he is to the nation.
After the runoff, we have 2 years to the next election (1.5ish until primaries).
Before, I wondered why he wasn't charged before these midterms.
Now, I think it worked out well.
So, while the gears turn towards his indictments, let him damage those who enabled him, until they are begging for the justified indictments to come.
In fact, then the ironic part will be that they are the ones seeking an indictment for political reasons.
But let's not look a gift horse in the mouth.
While I am frustrated that he has not faced criminal consequences yet, am I the only one who feels less of a sense of urgency now that the midterms made so clear that he is a political loser, a has-been, a dead-weight that will encumber the Republican party for the foreseeable future?
reminds me of some guy who loses an election and instead of conceding he makes up a bunch of bullshit about fraud and then leads a bunch of ill informed lunatics on a deadly, unsuccessful, insurrection of the US capitol on the day the election is being certified.
