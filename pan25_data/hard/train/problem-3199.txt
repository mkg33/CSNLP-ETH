After spending years doing everything he could to piss off other major foreign powers with blatantly public shows of disregard for international relations.
Can't say it's all that surprising that so many governments jumped at the chance to supply Ukraine, and that their decisions to do so have been met with generally positive feedback from their citizens.
In a situation like this, were things are so dependent on everybody's willingness to put themselves on the line for the good of all, Ukraine was pretty damn lucky that the guy they had in power turned out to be a natural leader.
True leaders make others want to do something, not be forced to do it (by money, by a sense of duty, due to social pressures and so on) and as I said, in a life and death situation the former is vastly superior to the latter.
I don't think you can be a "leader" in the genuine "inspiring others" sense of the word if your first action in a crisis is to save yourself whilst leaving others in danger.
By your logic being closer to other leaders isn’t important since “with modern communication there is no value in being near [ally leaders]”.
I understand that logically being safe and phoning in orders seems like it could work tactically, but humans aren’t NPCs in an RTS following orders.
They are people.
