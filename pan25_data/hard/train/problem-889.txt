Yes I agree there was some abuse with the program; however, that doesn't mean the whole program was corrupt or just a wealth transfer to the wealthy.
Millions of people had their jobs saved by PPP so it benefited Americans and the economy.
Oh and most banks actually paid back borrowed TARP funds, .
I agree on feeding kids, but the student debt forgiveness would cost more than just "a fraction" of the budget.
It's got estimates costs anywhere from $400 billion (for just the direct forgiveness) to $1 trillion (including the IBRP changes).

I will be the first to agree with you that the system is not perfect, there is abuse by some, and we can do better for sure.
Thank you for making this a civil discussion, it's been nice compared to some other recent ones where people have resorted to personal attacks for me merely disagreeing with them.
I agree, I enjoyed our discussion even though we may still disagree and may not have found a middle ground.
I know we may disagree but I appreciate the thought out responses and opinions.
Having a argument about how to help people is a good thing.
You make some good points and it nice to have civil conversations on Reddit.
