ugh, you couldn't be more wrong.
Lukashenko has been overpromising Putin and underdelivering for 20 years.
French media refers to him as the most shrewd politician in east europe for a good reason.
What's with Redditors thinking Lukashenko is some kind of idiot when he's Europe's longest-serving ruler, before Putin was in power.
You're assuming that Lukashenko actually cares about Belarusians more than he does enjoying the millions (probably billions of dollars) and accolades he receives from Vlad.
That poll figure looks rather believable, and already gave a result that slightly favors Lukashenko's plans, so why bother faking it at that point (yet)?
At a quick search I found a Belarussian poll from 1999 in which roughly 35% of belarusians opposed a union state while 47% supported it.
I also have doubts about Lukashenko currently wanting any of this in fear of losing power or his life, now that oligarchs have been falling out of windows lately.
His own personal state keeps a nice buffer between him and any loose windows.
