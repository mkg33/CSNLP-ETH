Not really an excuse...more of a justifiable concern.
It's not so simple; if not properly maintained and supplied, they will quickly become liabilities.
Not that Ukraine is not capable of effectively fielding Abrams tanks, of course, but it does require a lot of new maintenance and an added layer of logistics to an already embattled Ukrainian armed forces that has no experience with Abrams tanks.
Assuming Ukrainian incompetence on logistics isn't a valid argument against tanks for Ukraine.
Leopard 2 isn't free of this risk either.
But like any military, you'd make the decisions at that time, for which systems are most needed and allot logistics to them.
You can't just assume that high commands of the west just haven't thought about this only you.
Of course it's challenge.
It's an issue for any Western MBT.
Leo 2 or Leclerc or M1 or Challenger.
But people pushing bad faith arguments against the logistics of operating vehicles when actual experts and the country itself are pushing for them to be sent are the real peak Reddit armchair generals.
Why does Reddit always think they’re smarter than the top military strategists/logistic experts?
Yes, I’m sure the government realizes that there must be maintenance training/logistics to accompany the vehicles.
If you thought of it, they did too.
