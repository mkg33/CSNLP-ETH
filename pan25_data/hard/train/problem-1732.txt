The situation is particularly acute for artillery munitions.
At the height of the battles across the front lines last summer, Ukraine’s army was firing an estimated 7,000 shells a day, a fortnight’s worth of maximum US production.
Ukraine has only a few friendly central European suppliers for its 152mm Soviet standard shells.
The continuing shift to NATO standard artillery and 155mm shells will only increase the burden on western suppliers.
They really need long range weapons to interrupt Russia's supply lines behind the front lines and not waste manpower and munitions concentrating solely on the front lines themselves, thus saving ammo while slowing down the enemy.
To drastically reduce the Russian army's key weapon - the artillery they use today on the front lines - they need missiles that will destroy their depots (the Crimean Peninsula alone has more than 100 artillery warehouses).
Boeing’s proposed system, - Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) would be ideal or indeed any cheap, small precision bombs fitted onto abundantly available rockets would be great.
NATO's reluctance is because they fear they would be used to strike within Russia's own borders thus escalating the war to a new level.
If NATO ever went to war with Russia it wouldnt be expending thousands of rounds of 155mm ammo per day like the Ukranians are doing.
NATO wasnt prepared for a grinding artillery battle because thats not the way NATO conducts warfare typically.
The West does conventional peer to peer wars by obliterating the enemy with overwhelming airpower, abusing its edge in fighter and stealth technology.
