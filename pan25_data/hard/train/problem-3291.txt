It’s so odd because his personal use, and other squandering, of donor money has been common knowledge for many years now but these rubes continue to give him their cash by the truckload.
It almost seems like masochism or something.
I wonder if his “donors” realize that he’s just enriching himself off them and they support that, or if they actually thought he was going to use the money to support them in some way and just are just too brainwashed or uninformed to have seen what he’s actually been doing with it.
Maybe I've just gone off the deep end, but at this point I'm rooting them on, since we're pretty sure that most of this money is just going to subsidize his business and lifestyle and should he actually get the nomination he'll make it a point to use the GOP's money.
For the time being though, it seems to me this results in two effects:
1.
Depleting the GOP base of political capital to spend on politicians and conservative causes more likely to win.
Republican megadonors know the politicians keep the money to spend on themselves.
Megadonors in turn get sweet tax breaks for their businesses that in turn increase the money they spend on the business themselves.
