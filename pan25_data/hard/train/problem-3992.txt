We are not talking about what caused demand, or what caused addiction, we are talking about fault for overdoses specifically.
The fault here lies with the crackdown on prescription opioids without addressing the reason for the demand they only created a demand for fentanyl, a much more inconsistent and dangerous drug.
Fentanyl overdoses happen because in the black market, there is no quality control or consistency, allowing for the adulteration of fentanyl into the opioid supply in the first place.
If we are talking in the purest most basic sense, when we are talking about why specifically these fentanyl overdoses are happening, it is because the state created a black market.
I've heard from many harm reduction groups that dealers started using fentanyl to make up for the limited supply of heroin due to burning of poppy fields which the US was pretty insistent on.
The opioid "epidemic" began with people being able to get FDA approved prescription drugs in excess either from their doctors or from dealers.
The vast majority of people who were taking prescription opioids were overprescribed and tons of those folks were diverting their prescriptions to others.
The problem started with the blatant misrepresentation of the risks and benefits of the prescription drugs by the pharmaceutical industry.
