>In American politics, the Southern strategy was a Republican Party electoral strategy to increase political support among white voters in the South by appealing to racism against African Americans.^[1][2][3] As the civil rights movement and dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s visibly deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern United States, Republican politicians such as presidential candidate Richard Nixon and Senator Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party.
It also helped to push the Republican Party much more to the right relative to the 1950s.^[4].
The Republican party currently has the platform which WOULD HAVE sought the support of southern slave owners back in the 19th century.
So today, we have a Republican (slave owner supporting, racism promoting legacy of the population of people who tried to secede in the civil war) banning Democrats (rights and equality promoting legacy of the union which fought to end slavery).
On the basis that the Democrats supported the other group at some point in the past.
You can't make this shit up.
The parties are entities which espouse a political platform seeking the support of constituents, in order to win the seat of government and execute that platform.
And I don't balk at saying "racism promoting" - these are the people who segregate black areas to strip them of the vote.
Gerrymandering is real and it is, in part, racially motivated.
The democrats have had a platform, since the civil rights movement, which supports rights for minorities.
Since then previously Democrat areas in the south have flipped to Republican.
Because that's who they are - they never left, it's only been 60 years.
