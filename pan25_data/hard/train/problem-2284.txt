I believe they could also change the rule for electing a speaker to say move to a plurality, but that would be very risky for the Republicans since Jeffries has the plurality right now and I would not be surprised if the 20 decide to call the McCarthy backers bluff since they could likely remove Jeffries later and restart the whole fight.
Funny thing is, while it becomes mathematically impossible for McCarthy to win, it only takes 6 Republican defections to the Democrats for Jeffries to win, or 10 Republican present votes for Jeffries to win.
I know it'll never happen, but just imagine if at some point some of the Republicans bow out of voting altogether but the Democrats stick around, you could end up with Jeffries actually getting the full majority of present voters needed to make him Speaker since he's consistently getting the plurality of the votes.
(He's only not speaker now because it requires majority, not plurality.
).
That is what this is really all about.
Malignant narcissist Trump and his MAGAs cannot except that Bidenâ€™s son has more junk in his trunk than the old shriveled orange one!
