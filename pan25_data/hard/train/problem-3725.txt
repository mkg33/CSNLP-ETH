While it may be best to allow voters to decide on whoever they want to represent them in Congress, if fraud was involved on the part of the candidate voters should also be free to seek whatever remedy the law sees fit to impose on someone guilty of lying about skills or experience.someone who got a Red Cross First Aid Merit badge in Boy Scouts should not be able to get a job as a doctor by lying that he had in fact gone to medical school.
Someone who has not taken the Bar cannot practice law legally.
There may not be a specific test or license required to run for Congress, but if lying about everything from work history to race and ethnicity aren’t already an automatic disqualifier it ought to be.
Fucking Republicans are wasting legislative time by forcing lawmakers to codify everything into law.
The old days of assuming a certain degree of seriousness by candidates is over.
Trump made it painfully clear (as have subsequent Trumpian wanna-bes) that they will take whatever is not nailed down.
It’s depressing as fuck that we need a law with stiff penalties to ensure that candidates are serious.
People need to start demanding more from their political candidates than just what letter they have next to their damn name.
This is the voters' fault.
