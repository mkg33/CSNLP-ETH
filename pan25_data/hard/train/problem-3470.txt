It’s hilarious.
I think they have spent a couple of generations drinking their own kook-aid now and have lost sight of the fact that the party pulled on the evangelicals to be an incremental that could get them elected despite the Republicans’ wildly unpopular positions.
But that all hung on teasing the evangelicals endlessly.
Their positions on issues are minority positions.
Endlessly teasing them is the way to maintain power.
The dog’s caught the car now and doesn’t know what to do.
Whoops.
Ha ha.
It’s not like this is even an issue with low motivation.
Evangelicals want policies that actively threaten the lives of women.
People will get their ass to the polls over this.
I heard they lost with a 30 percent gap with single women.
No surprise there.
This isn’t going away for them.
They don't actually want to stop what they're doing.
They want the nation to stop being mad about it and accept that they're taking away abortion... and later same sex marriage, trans children, and birth control.
Push abortion, healthcare and taxing the rich... And for the love of god just drop gun control...
It can be addressed later, but it's like half the reason why the two parties are so close in voters.
If I had to guess, gun owners are probably the single biggest single issue group out there.
Stop saying you are going to take their guns away, stop demonizing gun owners, just leave it alone.
