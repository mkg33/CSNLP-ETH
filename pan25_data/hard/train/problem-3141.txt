PRC: We murdered our intellectuals when we took power and then our policies, including the Cultural Revolution and GLF, killed tens of millions of our own people.

Remember, it isn’t reunification.
The PRC never held the island.
They want forceful unification against an island that eventually developed into a rich first world democracy.
Their treatment of Hong Kong, once inarguably one of the world’s greatest and wealthiest cities, was such an all time airball of authoritarian incompetence that it permanently killed any chance for peaceful unification of Taiwan.
When they cracked down on democracy in Hong Kong they probably destroyed their chance of taking over Taiwan peacefully.
That’s not how it works, the whole reason they gave Hong Kong back in the first place was because China would have without a doubt taken it by force anyway, the UK had no power to stop it.
Even during negotiations for the handover China basically rejected everything UK tried to negotiate and the UK did nothing but accept it.
