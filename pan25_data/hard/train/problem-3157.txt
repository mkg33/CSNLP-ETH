It may not matter, though--I think DeSantis (and Trump, and anyone like the two of them) are types that the American public is REALLY sick of.
That doesn't mean they won't win--the GOP will mess with voting rights all they can--but I think the majority of people don't want someone like that again.
The question is whether it'll be enough for them.
If you look at the comments section on any Fox News article about Trump, a lot of them really have moved on from him, and like DeSantis.
I don't know if the people in those comments represents the majority of Trump supporters, but obviously it represents a lot of them.
That said, DeSantis \does\ have the cruelty that the GOP craves (whereas Jeb did not--he really was just about another soulless milquetoast GOP suit).
DeSantis's "cruelty as political theatre" goes a looooooooooooooong way with the GOP faithful.
It's disgusting--and I think whereas Trump was "just" a narcissist, DeSantis is an actual psychopath--but that's what Republicans want.
“Yeah, Trump’s a crooked asshole who’s caused unimaginable damage to the US political system, but you should know….the GOP really hates him.
Really, guys!
GOP wants to get rid of him too, but the voters love him.
What can they do?
They’ve got to go along with what voters want.
But boy howdy, they can’t wait til the old fucker dies, heh heh.”.
