Nah.
In my opinion, the human abstraction rises and falls depending on the topic and is maybe sometimes as such because emotions or needs are involved with /or/ You need the propper prism to look through to make sense of this.
i.e.
an explanation what it is really about and maybe workthrough by beginning with the priorities.
Imagine You could be then the rescuing hero and show them Your way of doing things propperly and Your stats and e.g.
fiscal numbers and culture are witnessing it.
There was a Terror attack in Istanbul and he wanted to retaliate this and now it seems to be a good idea anyway to invade Syria?
This latest action couldn't possibly have been in response to a recent terror attack in Istanbul, right?
Nope, couldn't be.
Also, Turkey literally has close relationship with the KRG, and literally arms and trains the Peshmerga, the Kurdish group that led the fight against ISIS in Iraq.
With Russia pinned down in Ukraine and outflanked by Turkiye, The Scandanavian countries who usually support the kurds are trying to join Nato and have had to abandon their advocacy else the turks would block their application, and the fact Iran is embroiled in civil unrest, well Turkiye would be damned foolish to not try and strike a blow at Kurds living in syria.
Seriously they are the big winners in the Ukranian war.
The fighting in Ukraine is nothing near the fighting in WWII.
You could plausibly argue that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is akin to the Spanish Civil War, where both eventual combatants heavily supported and supplied the two side in what was a prelude of the technology/tactics of WWII.
But a civil war is pretty different from an invasion.
