Let's be honest, Jesus works however a person wants him to and death bed confessionals are not only a real thing but an official thing, especially among the many sects that say all you have to do to be saved is accept Jesus as your savior.
No one can change where they were born.
But they can recognize their culture has a cancer.
My American culture has a cancer.
I don't defend that cancer, or say I'll never reject it.
I reject it right now.
If I had somewhere better to go I'd go there and learn their culture.
But there's nothing wrong in taking pride in your culture, but if you support what you're culture is right now then there's no saving you that you deserve.
Hopefully you have the moral sense to recognize your culture has cancer.
Too bad they're trying to use that term with the rest of the world, who actually knows about the Nazis.
Like maybe that shit flies in Russia but surely Putin knows Europeans actually know what the Nazis were about.
They know what the Nazis were about just as much as anyone else does.
The point is that when they use the term Nazi in a derogatory way they're just using it to say you're against Russia.
They don't care about the racism part.
