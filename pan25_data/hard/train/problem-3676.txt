Because Mastodon does not replicate the primary use case of Twitter, nor does it particularly try to.
People were saying that Mastodon was a Twitter clone that we could all just transition to.
All it took was a single look at the site to know that that was not true.
I’m sure someone is trying to create a real Twitter clone as we speak, but Mastodon is not it.
There is no viable alternative to Twitter at the moment.
The whole core value of that a site is it’s the best “breaking news” platform where you can jump into conversations on the latest in hard news or pop culture.
You can have a loose community that you follow but at the same time stay connected to trends in the wider world.
NOTHING else does this as efficiently.
And that’s what is saving Twitter right now, because I think a lot of folks would be out if something else was around.
My only thing pulling me back to twitter are the local twitter minicelebs which were fun to follow.
The 10k or 5k follower accounts which just had local updates and memes.
Cant get that elsewere for now.
What is hard to replace are the local celebrities and even local twitter minicelebs which were fun to follow and keep up with.
