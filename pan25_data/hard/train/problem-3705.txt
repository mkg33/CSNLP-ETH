The largest non-tsunami earthquake fatalities of the last 20 years were over 150,000 in Haiti in 2010.
Even in Japan, the 2011 quake killed near 20 thousand people, yet 90% of deaths were caused by the ensuing tsunami.
Simply because their buildings didn't collapse en masse either.
It's really the thing that matters the most out of every single factor.
Other reasons include poor weather conditions (extreme cold, snow) that make surviving under the rubble more difficult, lack of a proper response by the government, denial of help for non-government aligned cities, refusal of aid (Cyprus), etc... but rubbish buildings are always going to be at the top.
Why?
Because buildings don't fall down.
In turkey they all collapsed, there's entire streets, cities of nothing but rubble.
Given that it happened at night, most people were in their homes when they collapsed as well.
The cold, but many buildings collapsed with people sleeping in them.
Everyone was home during the quakes as it was 4am local time.
Way more buildings fell down than might be expected because of the lack of construction standards for many multistory buildings.
It's one of the worst countries that could get hit by major quakes.
Syria is a war zone so they've got a lot of damaged buildings even before the quakes.
