The longer the Repugnicans can’t govern (and I am using this loosely since they don’t as it is) the better it will be for this nation.
It’s one thing for them to have their bluster and play hardball on the debt ceiling vote when they are in charge.
It’s wholly another to not even have it because they literally couldn’t vote for who should be in charge.
It would be a bloodbath with independent voters come next election who hung their hat on a GQP who did nothing because they couldn’t even vote for speaker and prove they have the no ability to govern at all.
On the one hand—poetic justice for the anti-governing party that can’t even get their shit together long enough to form a governing coalition to elect a Speaker.
On the other, there’s always the possibility McCarthy has to swear to do some batshit damaging stunt in order to secure the votes he needs, like defaulting on the debt or something.
The lunatics are in charge of the asylum, and have been since at least the days of John Boehner.
The Republicans simply cannot keep a lid on their crazy anymore.
