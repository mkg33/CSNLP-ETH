Ahh yesâ€¦ Freedom of speech = denying the holocaust, an extremely well documented and tragic event that stripped millions of people from families, lives, and the world altogether.
Freedom of speech does not equal hate speech, they are two very VERY different things.
It's a slippery slope when you let a government decide what defines hate speech and is therefore not within the "boundaries" of freedom of speech.
Sure you might trust your current elected representatives to judge with perfect integrity and without bias what shouldn't be allowed to be expressed by someone, but what if let's say someone like Trump, Boris Johnson, Orban or Meloni got into power and was able to judge what speech is illigal.
I think it's a dangerous precedent.
There's also the danger of becoming the very thing you're trying to combat.
If by trying to uphold and defend civil liberties for all, you slowly start eroding civil liberties for some, fascists will keep finding ways to circumvent such legalities.
Sooner or later you'll have no choice but to keep implementing new "hatespeech" laws and thereby becoming an evermore authoritarian system not unlike fascism itself.
Some governments are even using retoric similar to yours and their censorship laws to combat legitimate political movements under the guise of fighting fascism.
Look at how China brands the Hong Kong protestors as fascist.
Or the way Putin justifies his invasion of Ukraine to "fight the facsists.
".
......
But now, you do see how that's kind of missing my point, yeah?
I mean, not really the debate I was looking to have?
