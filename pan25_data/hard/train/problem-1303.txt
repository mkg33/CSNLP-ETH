They successfully fucked with us for 20 years until we gave up and ran away.
They have more men, money, land, and political legitimacy now than they did before 2001.
The invasion was a joke.
The Iranian drones are effective because they're disposable and cheaper to send out for one way trips than they are to shoot down.
The IRGC has developed even cheaper drones to overwhelm AA defenses and allow the more important aerial assets to get through.
It is a test of who will have more here.
It is a propaganda effort to encourage one side and solidify themselves as a strong opponent(To which they are), Russia and Ukraine both do the same and have done it before.
The sources are Ukrainian so they would have propaganda.
The majority of these drones probably did get shot down but that is kind of the point as to why they are so cheap.
So yeah, a swarm of basic drones against a bunch of soft targets in a low tech country… not that surprising that it’s ‘effective’.
Cheap drones are at their best in urban environments- see some of the awful things ISIS did with DJIs and small explosive packets.
In an open area where advanced AA can pick them off cleanly, they make a lot less sense.
It's kind of impossible to undersell how much of an issue they can be in a tightly restricted environment, however.
