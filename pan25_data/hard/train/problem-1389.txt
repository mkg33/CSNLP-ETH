Everyone who is interested in finding a kernel of truth in the news today should always choose two news sources reporting the same situation, one that is critical and one that is encouraging.
"Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) is an American website founded in 2015 by editor Dave M. Van Zandt.
[1] It uses a 0â€“10 scale to rate sites on two areas: bias and factual accuracy.
It has been criticised for its methodology and accuracy.
".
"According to Daniel Funke and Alexios Mantzarlis of the Poynter Institute, "Media Bias/Fact Check is a widely cited source for news stories and even studies about misinformation, despite the fact that its method is in no way scientific.

There isn't one, everyone have their biases but expecting a US site to criticize a state media service like Voice of America is like expecting the BBC to provide non biased news from China.
Would you trust a Chinese media bias/fact check site that says aChinese-state funded media outlet is the "least-biased"?
If I wasn't American nor was my country friendly with the West, why would I trust an American fact check site about an American media outlet?
