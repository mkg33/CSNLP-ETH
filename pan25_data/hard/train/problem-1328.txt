There's no reason for the dems to stop laughing at the ineptitude.
If reasonable moderate republicans exist and are tired of looking like a joke, they can come crawling to the democrats.
No reason for the democrats to come in and save republicans for themselves.
This isn't the Democrats problem, this is Republicans and they have to own it.
Democrats have bailed them out for years, they absolutely should not give an inch.
Republicans wouldn't for them and at some point Karma needs to catch up to them.
That's impossible with the GOP.
They are absolutely incapable of keeping their word on anything and operate in bad faith.
Their entire platform is "Democrats are evil", they have no plan to govern, the hold-outs are literally trolling for social media clicks.
Why the fuck would democrats ever throw a life line to the enemy, the bulk of whom questioned, if not outright denied the election results, many of whom actively supported a coup.
And if that's not enough, the Republicans used every procedural approach ever to fuck the Democrats since Obama (cough Garland cough)...Republicans made their bed and now have to lie in their filth.
And when the Republicans go hog wild with their bullshit, inevitably having it blow up in their face, the NYT and WP editorial boards are always dropping "Why aren't the Democrats putting a stop to this?"
bullshit on us, ensuring that the onus is never on Republicans, at all, ever.
