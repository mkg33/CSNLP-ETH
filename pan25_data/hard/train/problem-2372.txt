Well it depend what kind of migrants, the problematics we have with a part of them since 20/30 years don't really help the French people to accept more of them.
The thing is, when you declare yourself "on strike" your company send it to the government, and at the end you have the total number of people "on strike", and the bigger the number his the better it to prove the government that the population is against this or that law.
Or the part that the companies send the numbers of strikers to the gov and that's how they measure the strenh of the industrial action?
Because i want to support the global strike, numbers are important not only in the streets but also the number of strikers in each company.
The strike is national wide so i give one day to the mouvement but still want to work because it please me.
Third french people are not fancy and they dont want huges amounts of money to live.
Most people are not killing their asses to pay for big cars, 250m2 houses ect.
We prefer to pay taxes and to have clean streets, good public schools, good public services, very good quality of food, good environnemental laws...
