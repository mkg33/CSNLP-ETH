Right now, Boebert has a slim lead.
If enough Democrats fix their ballots, it can trigger a recount.
Every single vote matters.
To the people from Boebert's district in Colorado, you have until tomorrow to "cure" or fix your ballot.
If your ballot has not been counted because of some technicality, you can fix it and the ballot will be counted.
Typically what is going on at this stage is verification of mail-in votes.
When they receive a mail-in ballot, they compare the signature on the ballot to the one on file.
If they don’t feel it matches, they set that ballot aside and don’t count it.
That ballot then goes to some group who starts reaching out to verify that the ballot is valid.
Once they verify that, the ballot can be counted.
What is different about the vote count during a recount?
Are the votes just put into the same tabulation machines and then they go with the second count?
Or is a recount done by hand?
Basically I’m just wondering why it’s right to recount a difference of 20 votes but not a difference of one vote.
Proof that every vote can make the difference.
I know so many people that don’t vote because they believe that only swing states matter.
Dems need to get people motivated.
This movement towards fascism is long from dead and a minority movement can take over if we let them and others are complicit because they vote by party only.
I know so many people who only voted Trump because he is the nominee with an R next to his name.
