The US has never really lost a war per say.
They don't really get defeated, the enemy just hides and draws things out until it becomes politically unpopular to continue.
But with your same definition of "draws things out until it becomes politically unpopular to continue" I guess my people (the British) didn't lose any independence wars in the last 200 years.
Or indeed the US War of Independence.
It's incredibly helpful though, a supply of boiling hot water, in a vehicle that you cannot safely leave for hours or days at a time.
Depends on the logistics environment no?
Like the supply chain for parts (and the expertise etc) would be much easier for the Ukrainians if modern Eastern Bloc style tanks were an option surely.
I wouldn't totally rule out that Russia would supply some personnel with more up-to-date equipment to defeat western tanks, should we see these tanks end up in Ukraine.
We know they have better stuff than what they're fielding, but, somebody in Russia clearly doesn't see the point in bringing out what few new toys they have yet.
It's similar to saying that the Type 10 or K-2 is the best tank in the world because none have been lost in combat, while ignoring the fact that they haven't seen combat.
That means that if it receives a penetrating hit in the right location, you get a British entry into the turret toss.
The truth is that Challenger appears to be tougher than everyone else's tanks because it's been involved in far less conflict, and the fact that these are the only two incidents that anyone seems to be able to provide when it's survivability is questioned is proof enough of that.
These 2 claimed incidents were also 20 years ago, a lot has changed in regards to anti-tank capabilities since then.
