Well, due to helping Russia so much Hungary has been rewarded by having their main oil pipeline destroyed today in the bombardments (it's in Ukraine).
Since I really heavily doubt Ukraine will send anyone to repair it anytime soon (and odds of Russia doing so are even lower) - the whole country is going to be utterly screwed within next month or two.
To be completely fair - until 2008 and more so 2014 it was mostly older generations that really had reasons to be wary/hateful of Russia.
I know there is no love between them which is why I made that comment, I can't imagine I would want anything else besides the destruction of Russia as a polish citizen.
That's why their definition of "rational" would be different than mine no doubt.
I think it is only rational to consider this a possibility if however small.
I'm sure Poland, the US, and the rest of NATO realize that possibility as well.
What analysts are saying on French TV is that Russia never wanted to hit Poland otherwise they'd get owned by Nato and they know it.
They've been very careful not to do it since the start.
Apparently the charge wasn't big and is what you find on a Iranian drone.
They probably used those drones to shell Ukraine.
As we know they sent lots of missiles today.
They probably lost control of one of those shitty Iranian drones that can' t be deviated mid air and it happened to go to Poland.
If an accidental missile strike in Poland doesn't get more than a few stern words they could start trying to see how far they can keep "accidently" poking Nato countries.
