There’s actually been bipartisan support and funding for border walls near more populated areas where they are more effective.
The walls between cities like Tijuana and San Diego or Juarez and El Paso make sense and work because there is sufficient personnel to patrol and quickly respond to climbers or wall breaches.
Walls provide enough of a delay that manpower and electronic surveillance can have enough time to be effective.
In the vast majority of the areas that a wall that runs the entire lenh of the border would cover, delaying someone by 10 to 20 minutes is irrelevant.
It may take hours for the nearest border patrol agents to reach the point where the crossing occurred.
Any breach in the walls may go unnoticed for a very long time because of how remote much of then wall would be.
There are plenty of reasons to oppose a massive border wall even if you are in favor of stricter border and immigration enforcement.
Serious question from a non-America… why is it so bad to just build a continuous wall to help enforce the border?
Would it not help at all?
How much would it really cost?
Politically, couldn’t agreeing to build a wall help reach a political consensus that includes an improved immigration policy?
Ironically, that was exactly the year President Bush and Democrats in Congress reached a grand bargain for comprehensive immigration reform, including amnesty, temp worker program, and expanding the border wall.
