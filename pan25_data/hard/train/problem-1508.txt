And the fact that people can’t fucking read the goddamn directions and enter the date in a bright highlighted space pisses me off.
I don’t care what’s right and wrong.
I care about reality.
Reality is that the enemy is going to latch onto any mistake and exploit it.
Maybe put the date in the bright yellow highlighted space right under your name that says “if you don’t enter the date, this ballot won’t be counted”.
So yeah... if you don't think about it sure that totally makes sense to invalidate votes based on a date that's not necessary as they have already been provided before the date.
I think the law should require that rules relating to counting ballots need to be resolved (or challenged if necessary) by 6 months before the midterm or Presidential elections.
Perhaps they earnestly believe all votes that met the timeline requirements deserve to be counted for the best administration of a free and fair election?
Yeah dates that are trying to be used to disqualify under the requirement they be received before end of election day.
If they are already turned in, obviously they arrived before election day.
