He is a clown.
If he thinks that Patriots should really be deployed in Ukraine (leaving aside the problem of NATO troops being there), Poland could easily send their own Patriot systems to Ukraine.
So when some news agencies report that Poland "took delivery" of patriot system, it was in fact delivery of certain components than then have to be assembled into a system.
Once it is done actual training can be started but it is not going to happen for at least few more months.
I think it is scheduled for mid 2023.
Poland bought 2 batteries of Patriot system but they are integrated now, not even in military hands yet.
Another 6 batteries will follow.
This is codenamed Wis≈Ça system.
Additionally Narew system using CAMM missile and iLanucher palletized launcher system was bought recently and delivered few months ago.
In future CAMM and CAMM-ER will be used by both land forces and navy.
No, PGZ is working on integration, IBCS so battle command system was delivered to US government in July so Q3 of 2022.
First systems should be delivered soon but system is not ready or delivered yet.
Poland bought patriot that will include number of locally manufactured parts, what you've seen was launchers that were indeed delivered and integration work have started but it is not ready system, right now PGZ is working on assembly and integration of all components into full system.
IBCS which is command component was delivered to US Army (FMS) but as far as i know wasn't transferred to Poland yet.
Can not remember if radars arrived already.
