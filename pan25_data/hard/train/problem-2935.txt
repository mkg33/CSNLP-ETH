I think when two nations have nuclear weapons the most likely scenario by far is still neither fires any.
You're not really going to fire nukes until your major cities are about to fall when you know you get way more major cities lost to the nukes and are left with a much less powerful nations vs your competitors/surrounding nations.
If China and India nuke each other than all their other top competitors become the winners vs maybe losing a major city and negotiating.
There just isn't any good way to use a nuclear weapons for defense or offense unless maybe the other country doesn't have them, but even then you massively devalue your nation and other countries exploit all your losses.
Hey yes “handling” nuclear power is dangerous but since the said “power” is actively bullying other countries it will be checked and either it will come to heel or the entire world will be destroyed.
That is because the entire world will be destroyed anyway if said nuclear power is to take it over - just look at current Russia.
If you think any other nation will choose to submit like Russians do under Putin you been watching too much Russian tv friend!
So yea offense is the best defense and you can bet no one is backing down to let Russia (or China) do whatever.
If Russia does manage to continue or increase its trade with China, you can bet it won't be Russia calling the shots.
Interesting how Putin has gone from saying he won’t sell oil to the G7 to saying he will try to make up the sales with China.
He is starting to sound desperate.
