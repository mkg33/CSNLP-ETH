Yes, but very much under the hood.
And Zelenskyy knows it has to appear that Israel is not supportive of Ukraine, that is why he is making these critical statements.
Israel was historically in the same situation as Ukraine, and won their wars for self determination.
Israel has supported Ukraine-in largely symbolic ways.
This is part the course fit Israel, who have a track record if opportunism in international affairs.
But also Israel can’t put their full weight behind Ukraine without compromising themselves vis a vis the Palestinians; it would be quite awkward to demand a full Russian withdrawal from Ukraine as a precondition to peace talks when that has been the long held position of the Palestinians about the West Bank.
Worth noting: the Palestinians have long demanded full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank as a precondition for a peace settlement.
It would be rather awkward for Israel to throw their full and open support behind the Ukrainian demand for a full Russian withdrawal as a precondition for such talks as well, wouldn’t it?
Israel is in a seriously hard position as russia is giving them support in the middle east, hard decision to make lose support to keep your country safe or have russia assisting your dangerous enemies in the region.
Saying that russia is looking like they are going to collapse completely there economy and military and the fact that there could be a civil war thereby losing that help from russia in the middle east.
