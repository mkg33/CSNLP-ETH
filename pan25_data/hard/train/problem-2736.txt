I take it you're making a snide remark about how the prevailing opinion on Reddit has been that the Chinese peace plan was not to be taken serious, and that this news seems to disprove that.
I'm not fully convinced that they will, but the American intelligence has been on point this conflict and they are reporting that the Chinese are seriously considering it, so I think we have to take it as a very real possibility.
We additionally have seen the Chinese send their top diplomat to Moscow during the 1 year anniversary of the war, come out with a peace plan that favours Russia (as it would draw a cease fire around current battle lines) and Xi is slated to visit Moscow for a meeting with Putin soon.
So clearly, they seem to become more involved - to what degree remains to be seen.
Fact is, China does not need a 12 point peace plan.
They could end the war tomorrow by joining the economic sanctions on Russia.
Without China, Russia cannot stay afloat under the current conditions.
China simply does what is in their interest, nothing more, nothing less.
And right now it is in their interest that Russia ends the Ukrainian conflict on favorable terms to them, which we see reflected in the peace plan.
All but one of the points favours Ukraine, and the one for Russia is a tacked on placation point about sanctions because they have to include Russia somehow.
