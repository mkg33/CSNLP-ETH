I saw a guest on MSNBC yesterday saying no way he didn't know, no way the Secret Service would let someone meet with the ex-president unexpectedly.
Seems to me cheeto has his SS people wrapped around his finger and breaks those rules, too, like all the other rules.
I wonder what the truth is, there.
That’s not it though.
From what I’ve read, it’s more the fact that Kanye had the lunacy to ask trump to be his running mate why Trump is throwing him under the bus.
Trump sabotaged himself by claiming in openly that the Fuentes ‘gets’ him.
If you think Kanye is cunning enough to orchestrate the second part, you give him way too much credit.
I hear you.
The whole thing is just a comedy worthy of popcorn.
And i’ll admit I haven’t read the details about the exact context of the situation… like were they all sitting down to dinner or was fuentes paraded on stage and showcased?
idk.
Oh.
So saying “fuck” someone is a call to violence?
Every time?
Like if they put a flag on their truck or a sign on the yard saying fuck Pelosi or Biden, that’s a call to violence?
What would the appropriate response to such a call to violence be?
