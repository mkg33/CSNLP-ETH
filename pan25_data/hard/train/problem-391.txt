If you read the article, their Bill of Rights states anyone 16 and over is free from age discrimination.
"The Supreme Court found that the current voting age of 18 was inconsistent with the country's Bill of Rights, which gives people a right to be free from age discrimination when they have reached 16.
".
Reminds me of a great episode of The West Wing where a children's right to vote group had an in depth discussion/argument with Toby Zeigler.
He was basically convinced, and he suggested they start at the local level and work at lowering it in increments.
It has a lot of merit when you're talking about things like high school students being allowed to vote in school board elections.
You're getting downvotes, but as someone who supports the decision to let those 16 year olds vote, I think you're right to an extent.
I really hope this goes well, but it really depends on how the state media and education board handle facilitating this change.
Hopefully they do it properly enough to prepare young voters to vote with deliberate intention.
Young people are more informed than ever about politics and they have a right to decide on their futures as soon as possible.
Even if a low amount will go out at that age, I Beleive it will increase the percentage of 18yr voters.
