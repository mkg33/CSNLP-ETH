On the other hand, if you want to make a deterrent against Putin trying anything, put the US president in Kyiv by surprise before Putin can whine about it, and dare him to have a go.
Putin’s struggling to handle NATO hand-me-downs handed to Ukraine, he’s in no position to start a war with NATO proper by risking blowing up a US president.
It's bold, it's risky, but if Putin does nothing it shows he is still very very afraid of the US and solidifies the US's strenh.
Biden going into Kyiv is a pretty big thing; it not only demonstrates that Kyiv is safe enough for a US presidential visit but him being there literally will create an operational wall that Russia won't exactly want to engage in for fear Biden might get injured or killed.
Biden visiting is bigger I think, because the US is not only showing solidarity but swinging its diplomatic weight around knowing Russia can't or won't do anything about it.
In fact, I can totally see Russia temporarily stops any attack around where Biden is just to make sure they don't accidentally end up being in a total war with the U.S.
U.S. intelligence services (maybe even with the help of the Chinese since their incentives are now aligned) goes into overdrive to explore any possibility to remove Putin and install a temporary government.
Nobody wants a madman's hands on thousands of nukes.
The rest of the world watches on in horror and pray whatever fallout (pun intended) from this nightmare scenario doesn't catastrophically impact them.
Edit: Some users reported of air raid siren in Kyiv right after.
Hopefully it's false alarm, or maybe it was a coincidence.
It would be cosmic level stupidity for the Russian military to try to attack the POTUS.
Edit 2: Some people have asked what would happen if Putin went full batshit insane and the unimaginable happens.
The following assumes that Russia intentionally assassinates Biden.
