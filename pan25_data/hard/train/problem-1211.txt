Suddenly and for eight years "economic anxiety", and then magically that anxiety dissipated when a conman took the helm in 2017 to derail everything.
On the GOP side of things, the voters are imbeciles and the politicians are grifters.
At least the Dems have the courtesy to be dignified elitists.
I'll take NIMBYs over evangelicals any day.
Except Obama wasn't president in 2008, that was the year of the election.
Anything that happened (which the executive could affect) in 2008 falls squarely on the Bush Administration.
I'm old enough to know it was 2008, it was always 2008, the GOP didn't rebrand it from 2007.
The market collapse was in twenty-oh-eight.
Their lie is that Obama was somehow president then, because idiots think "elected in 2008" means "president in 2008".
Trump was not president in 2016, nor was Biden in 2020.
Joe Biden has been a better President than we even deserve.
A lot of the criticism against him doesn't hold up under actual scrutiny.
I hope come 2024 more Republicans are up for debating because faced with actual facts they'll get destroyed.
