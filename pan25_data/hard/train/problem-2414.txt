This is the part that a lot of the "peace at any cost" folks fail to realize... if we enable Putin now, we aren't only giving Putin the greenlight to make more aggressive actions in the future...we've giving DOZENS of authoritarian lunatics the greenlight to use land-grabs and nuclear threats to gain an upper hand in negotiations or simply invade territory...
Stopping Russia here, and showing these despots that the world will not tolerate their power games is the best bet for a lasting peace.
Well yes, these are not great things to happen, but the point is that the influence of Russia is a major force that is controlling the behavior of these groups.
This war is killing Russian influence.
Less and less people are listening to Russia because of how embarrassing the war is going for them.
Bad for business for authoritarian regimes seeking to get things done.
It emboldens and empowers smaller states to act how they would like.
Might make Vietnam and the Philippines resist China's territorial claims a bit more.
