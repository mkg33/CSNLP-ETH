The decision on beer sales was confirmed on Friday morning by a World Cup official familiar with the change in plans.
The official asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the news media, and because Qatar was still preparing its official announcement on Friday morning.
But it also suggested that FIFA, which has faced years of blistering criticism for its decision to bring its showpiece championship to Qatar, may no longer be in full control of major decisions related to its event.
The organization’s official fan guide notes that “ticket holders will have access to Budweiser, Budweiser Zero, and Coca-Cola products within the stadium perimeter” for at least three hours before games, and for one hour afterward.
The ban on alcohol sales to fans at stadiums — beer will still be available in luxury suites reserved for FIFA officials and other wealthy guests — comes a week after an earlier edict that dozens of red beer tents bearing Budweiser’s branding be moved to more discrete locations at the World Cup’s eight stadiums, away from where most of the crowds attending games would pass.
In an abrupt about-face, Qatari officials have decided that the only drinks that will be on sale to fans at stadiums during the monthlong World Cup will be nonalcoholic.
Na the ultra rich are kind, considerate and fair which is why none of them will consume any alcahol in solidarity with the fans and in protest over qatars actions.
Edit : I am in no way a supporter of qatar and a lot of their policies, but this is a non issue that is triggering many westerners...
If this was for anything other thing that is Qatari…then yeah.
In Rome do as the romans do.
But don’t steal our tournament and then ruin it for people.
