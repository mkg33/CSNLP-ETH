I don't remember him being demonized for being a warmonger.
I remember him for siding with people we shouldn't be friendly with.
Making peace with your enemies by selling your ideals is not my idea of right.
It matters why we would be going to war.
Neither does letting Russia get away with whatever they want.
Their interference with our elections was likely because of Ukraine.
If you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything.
And yes we are actually avoiding direct conflict with Russia but it doesn't mean we can't help Ukraine.
You can be strongly against Russia’s (government) actions, and still prioritize a peaceful end to the war.
Avoiding WW3 should be any rational persons goal, outside of any political ideology.
Of course they don’t.
They don’t understand what war means.
People like this have no connection with reality.. We should be trying to avoid a direct conflict with Russian at all costs.
Perpetual war in Ukraine DOES NOT help the Ukrainian people.
But Ukraine has also been fighting in those separatist regions for those four years.
Blood has been spilt.
One could reasonably say that they have been at war since 2016.
