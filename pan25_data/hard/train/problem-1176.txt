I do think the suggestion of a possible virtuous cycle may be a bit misleading and optimistic, especially where money is concerned.
The half a billion people or so responsible for the vast majority of emissions will have to suffer what some would consider a life-style downgrade because they will have to make and spend less money.
However, if people could get behind the idea that maybe more free time to spend with family, friends, and doing good in the world is what really makes us happy, then there's a chance.
As I said, population growth is certainly an ecological problem but only in aggregate do the world's poor have much of a carbon footprint and even then it's not that big.
Telling the 90% they cannot have what the 10% has will always be a nonstarter for tackling the climate crisis.
Like I know critical thinking skills are in short supply in people who pretend climate change isn’t real, but it’s even sadder than they can’t count either.
Sorry but this method of thinking induces climate panic and doesn't help anyone, it's not called global warming for a reason.
Storms and weather patterns will get more unpredictable, your logic is the same logic trump uses when he says he it's cold in the summer so shit must be fake right?
