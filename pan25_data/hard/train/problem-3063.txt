They need a functional Gen5 aircraft, at a minimum.
Something that can not get shot down before it's anywhere near Taiwan.
Look at Taiwan on a map.
Now, imagine China is at war with a foreign superpower.
Do you see how important the control of Taiwan becomes in that war?
It's would China invade Taiwan.
Obviously the Chinese military is no where near the US military capability and effectiveness.
If China wants to eventually become a global military power, they would have to either charm Taiwan into a military alliance (away from USA influence), or take it.
Until they do, China's ambitions are restricted to a regional basis.
In such a case, China would recalculate its likelihood of success and act accordingly.
I would caution people against thinking the Chinese leadership is anything like Russia's.
The China of today is much more clever and patient than the China of the 80s.
Xi is authoritarian and power-hungry but does not YOLO his way into an invasion.
China did not brazenly gamble a Georgia or Crimea (before you point at Hong Kong or Xinjiang, please keep in mind literally everyone recognizes those as part of China long before they came up).
China doesn't have delusions of inherent superiority, not after the Opium Wars.
They calculate from the perspective of an underdog and will not begin an invasion until they are sure they will win.
