Buying a car means more job/career options which leads to more income which leads to that income going back into the larger economy which leads to more businesses making a profit and that profit creates lower prices which leads to more purchases from that family who is able to pay down their debt.
Hardline Conservatives think debt automatically equals irresponsibility.
They also believe China could just say pay the debts you owe us right now and if that leads to war with the US against their own interest so be it.
Hagrid beamed with pride, "Kevin McCarthy not a eunuch...you are going to be a speaker of the House just like Boehner and Ryan.
I can see the weakness in your eyes.
".
That's the thing though.
They won't cut it.
They'll demand the democrats and Biden cut it or they will "refuse to raise the debt ceiling", then they'll point and say "SEE THE LIBERAL COMMUNIST DEMS ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE, AND THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO BECAUSE BIDEN IS PRESIDENT".
This is such an easy playbook.
And they are all rich, and will never be ousted by their party, so they couldn't give two shits if the economy tanks until the dems inevitably give because they'll have to in order not to create an economic meltdown.
They should have raised the debt ceiling before the new House.
I have no earthly idea why they didn't.
My only hope is, someone far smarter than me in politics has a game plan that I don't understand that will let this turn out some other way.
I really hope so.
I hope while I can see one or two chess moves, they see 10 steps ahead and know how to make it work.
