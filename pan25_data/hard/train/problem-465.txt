I don't think so.
If one think is clear after the last few months, it's that Russia still believes in great power politics and spheres of influence.
If Ukraine is not in Russia's sphere of influence anymore, it must be in the US's sphere of influence now.
Therefore, they should be listening to their orders.
I think the fact that Ukraine is acting as it's own, sovereign nation, is incomprehensible to him.
For a long time now Russian leadership has been saying that Ukraine is just a vassal of NATO.
That Zelensky it's just a puppet of the US.
I think people are missing the point of their frustrations that Ukraine is not listening to Western advisors.
From this point on Russia knows that they're not allowed to suggest that Ukraine is just a puppet of NATO and the United states.
So they have to come up with another new lie.
For them to continue the old lie would be completely foolish with Ukraine acting alone.
So the Russia is offended that Ukrainians are not aligned closely enough to the West now?
But the whole reason the Russia needed to take Kyiv was to prevent Western alignment...wasn't it?
So "mission accomplished" Lapdog i guess you can go home now smh.
