No.
The world is facing a fundamental issue symptomatic of people living longer.
Retired people impose huge pressures on society as their demographic grows from living longer while becoming economically inactive for longer.
Most of this strain is imposed upon working age people.
And the effects are so macroeconomic and far reaching that there are too many to condense into a single comment.
The bottom line is that when you retire, you start to cost society more than you contribute.
And many countries now have ageing populations.
And again, that’s not to speak ill of anyone who is retired or insist that increasing the retirement age is a good thing or the best course.
It’s just a difficult situation.
This is also why immigrants are very good for a country, they buff the working age population, and help alleviate these stresses.
If you don't want massive immigration (which I understand the French don't), this is the only other way to have a working age population.
Life expectancy has gone up 20-30 years and the retirement age has barely budged.
I guess the other solution would be to just completely slash old age benefits and seniors health care, but I don't think that would be popular either.
Raising the retirement age is more unpopular than increasing taxes because it's a benefit cut for anyone who isn't healthy enough to work for that long.
Sure a pensioner today gets a lot more for their pension than pensioners decades ago, but the expectations also go up, so that doesn't really help.
Additionally, poor people are more likely to retire younger due to poorer health as they age.
Which is the inverse of what you implied.
To be clear, this isn’t their “fault”.
And I hate the idea of making elderly individuals work for longer, especially in manual and industrial jobs.
But I’m just trying to set the record so people can have a more informed discussion about the issue instead of brigading what looks on the surface like a simple social injustice.
