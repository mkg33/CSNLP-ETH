Yes, but you've told us that what you hear directly from voters is far more informative than "current polling"!
The bottom line for me as a journalist has always been that polls can be a tool to keep in the back of your mind, but go talk to voters and listen to what they are telling you.
Also, given that this race could give Democrats an edge in the Senate, GOP Georgia voters may be more energized about making sure that doesn’t happen and that’s a big driver too.
On one hand, some Georgia GOP voters have said they like Walker because they know him from his football days, they think he’d be a fresh face in the Senate.
People often like political outsiders who don't have conventional experience.
But - there is indication that republicans in Georgia don’t want to see another seat go to dems and that is likely a significant part of his support base too.
I think with many of the more vocal election deniers losing their races earlier this month, republicans might not want to make that a central theme in this runoff.
But, of course, that narrative is still out there.
