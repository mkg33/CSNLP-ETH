No one but redditors, eh?
Who else are ya asking?
There wasn’t Reddit when it occurred, but people called it a coup.
Was that an actual coup?
No one but redditors seem to call it that.
I tried to find any news at the time call it that.
It’s before my political watching life so I don’t know the details.
I’m not defending it, I’m sure some shady shit happened, I just don’t believe it was ever referred to as a coup.
It really depends on what side you want to believe there.
It’s before my time so I don’t have personal context.
I’ll explain what I know based off what I’ve read.
Democrats wanted to recount 61,000 “undervotes “which if I read correctly means that they were unmarked in a particular race, what is believed to be a “protest vote” where they submit a ballot but choose not to vote for the candidate options.
Again, it was before my time so I did a search and didn’t find anyone referring to it in the news that way.
And I’ve only seen it called that on reddit(obviously it was not around then.
Many people were still on AOL then if I recall correctly) so I stand behind what I said.
I’m not saying it’s gospel I’m just giving my experience.
Scalia was concerned that the Democrats were attempting a coup in the recount where they would mark ballots that were empty.
He believed the recount process in FL had been illegitimized.
He framed it as not wanting to recount because it would take away from the legitimacy of the office and elections.
