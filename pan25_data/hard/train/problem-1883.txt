2 term limit for governor, so fortunately Kemp will be gone.
Still can't believe he's now considered a moderate because he did the bare minimum during a presidential election.
Let's say you have a bumbling idiot for a candidate, he's marginally corrupt, won't get anything done, is just totally incompetent.
Whoops!
It turns out that the latter candidate said that he would bring religion into the schools, he would pass laws that say that women can't work in certain professions, that black people need to be subservient to white people, that the tax rate will be inverted so that poor people pay much more than rich people, etc.
I live in a city that used to have a two-year term for mayor.
About 10 years ago, we changed it to four years, on the same point, "it takes you two years to learn how to be mayor!
".
I will say another thing.
If I were a thinking "normal" Republican (not a Trump MAGA extremist) I would be realizing the huge danger my party is in right now.
I would be thinking what is the only way to resolve this problem.
Next general election vote Democrat.
Even if you are a life long Rep and your daddy and his daddy before voted Rep. Vote the cancer out of my party.
Burn it down and start rebuilding it again.
