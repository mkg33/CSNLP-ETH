In all other countries with lower health care costs, all medical professionals earn less, but they also don't have the education debt, nor do they have the ridiculous liability insurance costs.
Medical professionals makes way more in the us than anywhere else in the world.
If medical care was affordable people wouldn't need insurance, if people didn't need insurance, insurance companies wouldn't be making so much money.
Your analysis is HIGHLY biased in favor of insurance companies, because virtually every penny of cost they incur that isn't a payment directly to point of care services is largely useless.
When you calculate the profit number of the insurance company, that does not properly count the cost of all the employees of the insurance company that leech money from the system without improving patient outcomes.
Noteworthy here is that insurance company executive compensation do not count as profits, i.e, the salary that the CEO and execs pay themselves come from "pre-profit" revenue.
This is highly misleading, because the administrative overhead of insurance companies counts against profits.
