Funny how Republicans turn into thrifty spenders the second it can hurt a Democratic President and tank an economy in anticipation for elections in 2 years.
If you want to absolve all leadership of economic fluctuations we can have that conversation, but anyway you slice it, since around the end of the 4th Party System, when the economy goes real rotten it’s usually because Republicans were letting it sour on their watch.
They really do.
The economy has performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican ones by almost any metric.
Also the whole Great Depression and Great Recession things are good examples of Democrats having to clean up messes left by Republicans.
Republicans held both houses of Congress and the presidency for about 5 years prior to the Great Recession.
Democrats took over Congress less than a year before that broke out.
Well, Republicans held both houses of Congress and presidency for the ten years prior to the Great Depression.
Also, how did republicans cause the great depression and recession?
I hope you’re not just looking at president again.
