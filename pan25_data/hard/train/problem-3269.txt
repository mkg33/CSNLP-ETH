The IAF wants 114 more Rafales [MRFA] - Essentially they want more rafales, but depending on the competition, cost and proposition, others may get a chance.
The ministry has not been committal so far.
Potential contenders include the F15EX, F16/21, F18 E/F, Typhoon, and rafale with Gripen and Mig35 not being taken seriously.
The navy is planning for 26 interim fighters for the carrier, and has evaluated the Rafale naval and the F18 E/F and a report is awaited for the case for approval.
Depends on the number.
100+ minimum is what Dassault has stated for an assembly line in India.
No one is talking what %age can actually be indigenized.
While the IAF is asking for 114, there are also chatterati who have 57 36 or 72.
Most probably numbers would be 114.
Safran recently signed an MoU with HAL (probably) to manufacture M88 engines.
HAL also builds AL 31 engines ground up.
And HAL getting these MoUs have proved to be useful they are now developing HTFE 25 and HTFE 40.
French are amazing to deal with.
They transfer everything for the right price.
If you talk about Fighter, most probably this is the last purchase.
We will be going Indigenous.
Maybe still buy tankers and transports but fighters are pretty much done.
