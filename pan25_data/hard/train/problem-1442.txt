This is NYT reportage, not Fox New Entertainment.
It's not their job to insert their opinon on any part of this.
They are reporting a fact: authorities are investigating the case.
And part of investigating is finding a suspect's motivation and admissible evidence to win their case.
This is how things start.
"It's obviously politically motivated" isn't a legal concept, and there is no precedent-setting Ducks v Quacks.
It's so odd that when any Democrat does something wrong, they immediately speculate that "it appears to be politically motivated".
Put the shoe on the other foot and you get nothing but delays, destruction of evidence, and white washing.
I found this bit really fucking rich.
So they're STILL trying to confirm if there's a pattern since December, and they kept the shootings a secret because they weren't sure if there was a pattern?
Okay so NOW that they have told us about the shootings, have they confirmed whether or not there is a pattern yet?
No??
So what was the point of hiding it until now?
If I had to guess, I would say that they were probably working to locate all the information they could to destroy it before the public found out.
