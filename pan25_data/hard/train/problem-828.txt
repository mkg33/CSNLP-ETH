That’s how I know people are brain dead from throating Fox News, thinking that by giving Ukraine money and weapons, they themselves are somehow personally affected and are against sending aid.
Don’t know who ‘we’ is in this case but sending billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Ukraine to beat back the Russians seems like a great option and is indeed being done.
Oh, oh, I know, we could go in and make the Russians stop and leave Ukrainian soil, and get everyone involved in war crimes to a tribunal.
And we should help the Ukrainians to use force if the Russians won't do any of that willingly and they're fighting back.
Russia won't admit defeat and even if they get kicked out of Ukraine, Putin will find a silly way to spin the result as a victory of some sort.
Russia should pay for their crimes in Ukraine and for starting an unprovoked invasions.
Nothing less than the total destruction of the Russian economy and dissolution of the federation, on top of making their war casualties as devastating as possible, will be enough.
But no one cares what Russia thinks or says, as long as we arm Ukraine to let them inflict as much damage on Russia as possible, and then follow that up by harder sanctions and complete isolation, the result will almost inevitably be the collapse of the Russian federation.
