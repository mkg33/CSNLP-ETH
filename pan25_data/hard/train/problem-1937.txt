That’s horrible 38k is a 1980s salary.
For the amount of education a teacher has to get, in order to be licensed is ridiculous Might as well drive the school bus.
And even often times the bus drivers are heavily ignored over teachers.
When people don’t realize the bus drivers are just as important as the teachers for a school system.
Well, school bus drivers are having to work over 11 hours in my area due to shortage.
We need more bus drivers for real.
Starting salary for teachers in Indiana is $38,000.
Teachers can't even afford to live in housing and have to go out of pocket to buy supplies as schools have no money to buy it.
Teachers make below poverty lines, and they have to teach using outdated textbooks too often.
However, Republicans who slander teachers and constantly call on teachers to be fined if they teach things like evolution and gravitational theory are telling teachers to carry guns in school and put their lives on the line daily.
I think they are realizing they are about to experience the biggest teacher exodus in the next few years thanks to their hate, and now, they are trying to undo the damage they are doing.
It's too little, too late.
Teachers are quitting all over the place, and no college graduates are going to teaching.
This teacher shortage crisis is what Republicans have wrought.
