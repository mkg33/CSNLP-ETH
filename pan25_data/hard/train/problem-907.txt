This gets overlooked a lot.
The American revolution was led by intelligent people, many of whom had extensive government experience.
It was as much a revolution, as it was a civil war between two internal governments, since America had its own because of how far it was from the King.
I guess my point is that it’s unsurprising to me that the learned gentry are vital for turning a revolution into new statehood.
Part of why the American revolution was as successful as it was came down to the proponents really giving very intense thought into how a constitutional government should run.
This requires a high degree of education, familiarity with how governments can (or should) function, a high degree of managerial capability, a large social network, and liquid assets to pay for state workers….
And, even then, the original articles of confederation failed miserably.
America’s first draft was a mistake.
It took another round of thought and wrangling to produce a working constitution… and even that was seriously flawed.
