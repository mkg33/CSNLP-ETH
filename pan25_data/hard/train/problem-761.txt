I would read that as they are wanting to ban all semi-automatic firearms.
Which would cover most firearms including hunting rifles, handguns, and so called "assault" weapons.
What's the definition of "assault weapons"?
The last time there was a federal assault weapons ban it was just a gun cosmetics ban.
Plus, banning ARs is just nonsensical if you are not also banning all mag fed semi automatic rifles.
I could go out and by a Mini 14, and have a 30 round detachable magazine for a gun that fires 5.56, which to my knowledge would be totally legal in the case of an assault weapons ban.
The same goes for buying a mag fed SKS, or even a .22 with a drum or 30 round mag.
Also, are we just not going to acknowledge that handguns are used in the majority of gun homicides in the US, but we don’t see anyone trying to ban those.
Not to mention “assault weapons” are already a class of firearm and not used in mass shootings as far as the government is concerned.
This ban would have to walk a fine line of what semi-automatic weapon is bad and which is ok.
This is incredibly hard to clarify.
