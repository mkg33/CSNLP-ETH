Something is happening in the republican party and I'm not entirely sure what it is.
It might be the complete take over by the far right MAGA groups.
They may have learned they dont' actually have control of their base, and are afraid of what they will do to them if the wrong people say the wrong thing.
From what I've seen her remarks have been about Israel, not Jewish people.
There is a huge difference, and even the right acknowledge this because they are ok with Jewish people being talked about in horrible ways but not Israel.
To call decisions, policies, and/or practices of the State of Israel into question is not de facto anti-semitism, in my humble opinion.
There is no state in the world that is above being called to account, whether by its own citizens or the citizens of another country.
Anti-semitism moves beyond mere questioning and calling to account, and is motivated by baseless hatred.
It doesnâ€™t matter AIPAC will always make sure that criticism of the Israeli government = antisemitism that is literally their job.
Especially when we're talking about the racist right wing government of "Bibi" Netanyahu and his oppression of the Palestinians.
Who was Rep Omar talking about with her criticism?
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.
What's not in that name?
The term Jewish.
They're a front group funded by hardcore right wing American Jews to buy off politicians to help support "Bibi" Netanyahu and the right wing Israeli government.
