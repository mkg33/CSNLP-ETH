There is no socialist tribe precisely because there are no rich socialist.
Capitalist use their money to advertise for capitalist tribes and like the consumers they are, voters buy a tribe based on the ads they see and how the ads make them feel about the product.
Money buys ads which help fuel the tribalism instinct.
The money in and of itself isn't an end but the influence it buys is incredibly powerful.
The process is often multi-directional, however.
The House may pass a bill and send it to the Senate.
Then the Senate may make changes or alterations.
At that point it goes back to the House to reconcile the differences before going to the President.
The Senate can draft bills but they still have to get passed by the House before they can be given an up or down vote in the Senate.
House and Senate are both needed to even get bills to have the potential to become law.
The House can originate bills more easily (that's its job), but that doesn't mean the Senate has to officially vote on what the House sends them.
The wealth gap and the power of dark money in politics means that the super rich can buy the politicians and outcomes they want.
The Railroad Barons were corrupt as hell and bribery was pretty much EXPECTED in politics in the Gilded Age.
