The US is dismantling a major world power without risking American lives; that's a pretty big win for them.
I'm sure US contractors will also have their pick of projects when it comes to rebuilding Ukraine.
There's lots of ways for America to get it's money's worth out of this.
to add to that, it also saves the US money.
All this stuff, that they wouldn't even use themselves, but still keep around for situations like these (I guess?
), still needs to be maintained.
I don't want to downplay the service the US is doing to Ukraine (especially comparing it to what European countries delivered in comparison), but it is in fact a win-win, even before you factor the geopolitical benefits.
as stated most, if not all of the stuff US delivers, is outdated for several generations.
I am not sure why the US would want to replace this, beside MAYBE for situations like these.
The US has plenty of more modern material, which it would supply to its troops if needed.
The US Army is going through some pretty major modernizations that eats up a lot of the available budget allotted to them.
The Abrams and Bradley are being replaced, the Light Tank is being reintroduced, rifles and MGs are being replaced, new scout drones, et cetera.
Keep in mind the Javelin missile was first developed before the Soviet Union fell and was based on an earlier missile, the M47 Dragon, from the 70s.
Also the base TOW is pretty old at this point itself and isn't that different from the Soviet era Metis missile.
