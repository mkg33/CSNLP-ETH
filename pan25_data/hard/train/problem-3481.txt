one man made decision.
Millions followed.
This nazi shit is so easy to get support for.
Some people buy it because they're miserable and they're longing for some pride.
Some are lonely and imagining all the masses who're united behind the cause is a warming feeling for them.
Some, who have not bought this shit previosly, are starting to follow it now.
Because they're afraid, because rockets are exploding on russian own turf now, because russia could be beaten, and there's real possibility of civil war afterwards and decades of misery.
And maybe if russia would win they won't have to pay for others mistakes, and who cares about those pesking ukrainians when Motherland is in Danger.
Russia is also spending a lot of effort on combat against the Ukrainian army… I'd say it's fair to say most of their effort is going that way.
American military cooperation with Ukraine is more of a threat to Russia than Saddam Hussein was for the US, that's for sure.
I'm saying that Russia, Ukraine, the US, and NATO all participate in pushing propaganda.
Unlike you though, I'm open-minded enough to admit it.
