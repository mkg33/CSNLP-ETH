But I am still wondering why the administration didn't reverse the deregulation of the GOP since they've had control since January of 2021?
Seems the OP was correct, the administration is being outflanked by the right there too, and all I'm seeing is excuses from the government for these innocent people having their hometown turn into a potential superfund site.

The usdot does not feel it has authority to bring it back unless congress undoes that legislation.
