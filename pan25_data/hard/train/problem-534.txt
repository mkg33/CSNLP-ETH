Hmm I wonder why so many steal, do drugs, commit violence etc, could it perhaps be because the US healthcare system is straight up garbage and mental health issues is not something many can afford to treat.
A significant portion of the homeless population have substance abuse problems or mental health issues along with lacking the income to manage a property.
You seize someone elses property and start filling it will homeless what do you think is going to happen?
Crime will increase.
You address the issue of homelessness by prevention.
Reducing cost of living in cities, which no one is willing to do.
Helping people who are at risk of becoming homeless.
Once someone is Homeless getting them back on their feet is next to impossible.
The best thing for a city is to clear out homeless camps, crack down on property crime and drug use, and disincentivize homeless from traveling to their city.
Filling vacant buildings - part of this can be solved by just giving empty houses to the homeless, it's proven to be more cost effective than any other ways of "dealing with the homeless" this also circles back to the first point.
I know right XD if they're just sitting there rotting in disrepair that's much better, remind me to put spikes down in any areas where they might seek shelter.
infrastructure reform - more pedestrian friendly places, better lighting, public transportation/car alternatives, green spaces (studies have shown decrease in crime and mental health issues by including green spaces near residential areas).
Providing a government incentive to go into the mental health field - cover the costs of individuals becoming mental health professionals, social workers, etc.
