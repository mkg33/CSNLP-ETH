I don't know the situation but from the same article, locals living near the park are getting caught in the effort.
I would imagine not everyone is aware of the defined borders of the park and people may be getting shot for simply being in the wrong area.
Not as simple as that, the article goes into detail how the borders of the park aren't clearly defined and innocent people have been shot/killed, including a 7 y.o kid and another kid with mental disabilities.
This is also besides the fact that a lot of the people who've been killed have never been identified (or had any forensics work done) so dubious if they were poachers in the first place.
Poachers and their motivations are not monolithic, but the nature and scope of the crime/society they're operating in has led to being shot on sight by those tasked with stopping them.
Plenty of rangers, caretakers and park workers (armed and unarmed) have been killed stumbling upon poaching camps, poaching hunts in progress or by simply being in the area.
If you are illegally capturing or killing an animal, you are poaching, regardless of what your reason for doing so is.
Illegally hunting for sport is poaching.
