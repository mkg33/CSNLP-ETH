Sorry.
Haven’t had any coffee yet this morning.
Memories of German dithering and Macron spending all that time trying to get the diplomatic limelight got me a little salty.
I’m also a little frustrated at the ability of one or two nations in the NATO block so blatantly putting the leaders’ domestic political self interest ahead of the collective whole.
As an American, I totally recognize how laughable that makes me sound.
It’s just difficult to see leaders like the Estonian PM roaring like lions while other, larger states’ dither, prevaricate and worry about “giving Putin and off-ramp.”.
It's difficult to see the leader of Estonia score free political points by demanding other nations do stuff that Estonia can't do itself?
Like, if Latvia, Estonia and Poland were in a separate alliance from the rest of Nato, do you think they would be equally loud?
Germany has been annoying, but I haven't seen any announcements that Estonia is giving tanks to ukraine yet, probably because they don't even have any.
