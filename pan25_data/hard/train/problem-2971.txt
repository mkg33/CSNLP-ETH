Edit: also what do you mean soft spot?
My gf from Nagpur complains about the British about once a day.
I have no horse in this race, I’m just saying I’ve noticed a lot of brainwashing from over there and it’s been hard to make my gf realize it.
For example, she would talk about how she thinks it’s normal for her friends parents to discriminate against their Christian fiancé until I pointed out how much she complains about people discriminating against her for being brown.
She complains about how people in White Lotus are treated until I point out how she said in India she never got her own water because her servants would always bring them to her.
And to her that’s okay because they “wouldn’t have a job otherwise” but also to her human trafficking is evil.
My point is, ask yourself if your enemy is really the British, or if that’s just a distraction.
Yeah what next, British speaking about how bad imperialism is?
Or how it’s bad to build societies out of stolen wealth, or Americans pointing out how savages the native were?
Lol the hypocrisy.
