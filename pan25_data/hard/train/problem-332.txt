Same as people wearing seatbelts when they drive.
Being prepared doesn't mean you are perpetually afraid of being in a car accident.
See?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
There are plenty of reasons a person might carry a gun, but you refuse to believe that.
The are entire subreddits and youtube channels showing people defending themselves and their families with a gun.
Just because you don't understand the reasons, doesn't mean there aren't any.
Those aren't reasons.
That's just what you think.
Why don't you go ask someone why they carry a gun instead of making insulting assumptions about why they do it?
Guns are far, far too casually treated, and far too many gun owners are devoid of sense and/or think control of a firearm stops when they leave the range.
From a moral point of view though I’d argue that leaving a gun and ammunition unsupervised in the range of children is a careless thing to do.
Keeping a loaded gun next to you on a desk can be ok to do, but leaving that gun and not noticing quickly that it is litteraly not there anymore just shouldn’t happen.
It defies the home defense purpose as well imo.
