Are you willing to turn off your power?
Would you rather the world financially support regimes like in Russia and Iran?
Should millions die from exposure so that we can shut off all fossil fuels tomorrow?
The reality is that we should have been phasing out oil decades ago.
We didn’t.
You can’t just set up green energy overnight.
Until we have a replacement, we have to use what we have.
This has nothing to do with American discomfort.
In fact, it has nothing to do with discomfort at all, people WILL die without heating and cooling.
That’s the world we live in, like it or not.
None of your grievances change the fact that this is a necessary step to limit the power that Russia and OPEC wield through oil (which was going to be used regardless, now it’s just US oil instead of theirs).
If the oil is going to be used in India it will be bought one way or another, the US has much more environmentally friendly means of oil extraction than say Russia does.
So increasing the demand that’s fulfilled by a country who will damage the environment less than sending them to a competitor that will provide the gas regardless of environmental cost…….
Don’t you want the oil drilled here?
If oil drilled will hurt the environment more from Russia through more archaic practices and the resource HAS to be produced anyways….
Isn’t better it come from the US?
