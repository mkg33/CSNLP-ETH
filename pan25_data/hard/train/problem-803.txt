We in Sweden maybe should see us as most effected.
Haven't seen this "news" at all here.
And I am rather certain that the view here had been "the defense minister only takes 2 months of parental leave" with the follow up "why can't he be take as much parental leave as usual - the turks will continue to make problems no matter what".
Actually more than "second in command", the temp defence minister is THE defence minister for the time, when he is on paternity leave he basically just a member of parliament on a leave, nothing more.
Also, another quirk here is that he must formally resign as defense minister, but not as MP, as the law doesnÂ´t recognize ministerial leave as such.
He will be reappointed to the position by his party, although this is by convention and not required.
Minister Kaikkonen is using his maximum allowed paternity leave, as his child was born before september 2022.
For anyone wondering, fathers in finland are for children born before september 2022, entitled to 54 days of paid paternity leave, with maximum of 18 days at the same time as the mother.
Mothers were entitled to 105 days of maternity leave, which could start 30 days before the due date.
This was followed by 154 days of care leave, which could be used by either father or mother, to be used before the child is 2.
Starting for children born from September 2022 onwards, there is 30 days of pregnancy leave, followed by paid parenting leave for both parents of 160 days.
Either parent can shift 63 of those days to the other parent.
