Supposedly he did research that paved the way to develop covid as part of the conspiracy to make God-fearing Americans bend the knee to big government.
He was also initially worried that people would panic buy masks (which they did) which would leave a deficiency for health care workers on the front line (which was the case for a while).
And lets consider for a second, the people panic buying mask WEREN'T the "science denying murderers" that wouldn't mask up or get vaccinated...
Sort of a funny irony, they certainly ignored Fauci WRT dont wear a mask...Yet when he changed to buy a mask they decided he was correct then... while the skeptical people always saw the mask as pointless.
First off, the virus can travel on very fine aerosols, which 99.9 percent of the mask people were wearing DO NOT STOP.
Yea sure, why wouldnt blocking the largest /heaviest droplets that stay airborne for a much shorter time than the lighter aerosols drop the transmission rate "significantly" /s.
Yeah but if you block all the bigger aerosols with something like a mask, and only the very fine aerosols get through, chance of infection/spread drops significantly.
