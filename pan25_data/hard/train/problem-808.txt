I'm not saying there is no racism in Argentina but acting like Argentina is Apartheid South Africa is stupid.
Because Argentina is a very racist country where the president recently bragged that Argentina's forefathers came from Europe while Brazilians came from Africa?
Though I suppose that strays from the original point, which is that there has been some amount on institutional racism in Argentina based around white European ancestry which this 19th-century guy Alberdi seemed excessively proud of.
Can't figure it out.
The (a kind of intellectual rebel group involved in the establishment of a democratic republic) seemed very much to be saying "we're defined as Argentinians, regardless of where we came from before that".
But then Juan B. Alberdi (who was in that group) sponsored that article of the constitution.
His mother died in childbirth and his Spanish father (Basque, in fact) died when he was 12 (apparently from disgust at having to sign something to grant extraordinary powers to the dictator-governor at the time).
So at a guess, it's because that guy idolized his daddy.
