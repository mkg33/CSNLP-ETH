The Republicans hold a majority in the House of Representatives.
Unless several of them are willing to join the Democrats, there is limited ability to make the House do anything sensible.
For a Democrat to become speaker, they'd need to get votes from Republicans.
I don't see AOC getting to dictate who becomes speaker; it's more likely to be somebody like Valadao or Newhouse.
Yes, he could if a few moderate Republicans voted for him.
You'd probably end up with somebody well to his right in order to get those Republican votes though.
Either one of the moderate Republicans or one of the most conservative Democrats.
There are no moderate Republicans.
Or at least, no moderate Republican voting block.
Any Republican who cooperates with the Dems would be instantly primaried in any district in the country.
Any single Republican who ever voted with the Dems in such a high profile way would be instantly removed from the party, pilloried, and primaried at the next opportunity.
It would be political suicide.
