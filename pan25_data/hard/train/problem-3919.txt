Yeah but why would we?
Last I checked we are sitting at 1 million refugees and like 400 tanks sent to Ukraine.
Feel free to deliver an aircraft carrier filled to brim with strategic bombers if you think it can pass through our borders and can help in beating Russia.
Absolutely nobody would oppose the idea and you probably could even do it without anyone finding out until it's already in use (Polish forums specifically tell people NOT TO share any pics/videos of anything military related that goes to Ukraine).
If EU decides to actually take action against a non vital landlocked country with mere 10 million population and for instance embargoes them - this would be an instant collapse of a whole region as 70+% GDP would disappear into the void.
It's not like Russia even has any deals that it can offer in response, it won't even give you preferential treatment on their gas/oil prices (since pipelines pass through other countries).
You get everyone sane to leave and make a new pact that says "NATOv2".
Now Hungary is all alone in NATO since it didn't get an invite.
in other words, Hungary was going to get territory but wasn't going to participate inthe "force" aprt.
Fortunately for Europe, and unlike Hungary, Poland didn't forget that Russia can never be trusted, and they didn't spread their cheeks for Rosneft and Gazprom money like Budapest did.
Hungary isn't Turkey, it's not a strategically relevant nation, Orban either has some friends in high places in EU or trusts Putin way too much for him to behave like that.
If Hungary has signed a gas agreement with Russia, Hungary Leaders will be motivated to slow NATO and quietly help Russia.
When Russia does the upcoming swarm attack, Ukraine's border with Hungary could be at risk of invasion forces.
Kick putin!
