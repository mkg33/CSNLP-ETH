The problem for Russia in its retoric is that admiting it and giving an apology will make them look both incompetent and coward to their own people.
They can't also admit it and say "we did it, so what?"
because they fear an overwhelming response from NATO.
So the only card they have left is to deny it and blame it to "provocations from the West" as they have been doing with everything so far.
I don't have any doubt that, if the investigation shows that the origin of the explosions was in fact Russian missiles, they will start claiming false flag attack in no time.
Wait, Russia hit another country with missiles and the act of that country simply saying that Russia hit their country with missiles is the provocation?
btw- I'm assuming that you mean "missile defense that could reach Moscow" as ironically as Putin telling Poland that reporting the missiles is a provocation.
Instead, there will likely be discussions about providing Ukraine and Poland with more/advanced military aid, specifically those that can detect and counter Russian missiles.
Poland would do better by giving all of it's military equipment to Ukraine and just buying updated stuff with the frozen Russian assets in EU banks.
And the EU should be funding Poland's aid to Ukraine by giving them money from Russia's frozen assets to buy new, updated weapons systems.
Double burn.
