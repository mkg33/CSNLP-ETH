Casual reminder that six months after leaving the White House, Jared Kushner secured a $2 billion investment from a fund led by the Saudi crown prince.
Actually, you’re absurdly wrong to such a degree, I apologise for your countries education system failing you so abysmally-.
The $620 billion fund’s advisory panel was reportedly concerned that Kushner’s newly created firm, Affinity Partners, didn’t have much experience; that the firms operations were “unsatisfactory in all aspects”; and that Kushner posed a “public relations risk” because of his work in the Trump administration.
The fund’s advisers discussed these issues during a meeting last June 30, days after which bin Salman overruled them and green-lit the payment.
Normally, presidents who want something declassified direct subordinates overseeing the department or agency with primary responsibility for the information to review the matter with an eye to making more of it public.
But on rare occasions, presidents declassify something directly.
Unfortunately the sitting president can share classified information with whomever they want.
That’s the scary part about all of this.
As a civilian he no longer has that authority, but you know he’s gonna keep on doing it….
