He sees himself a lion leading a pride, and to him there's only a few "real prides".
For him that's Russia, USA and China.
All other countries are just small confused wussies, that should be consolidated.
But that's the thing.
Every interview I ever watched, whether it be former presidential advisors, or experts on Putin say this:
I think he's actually very honest and sincere in his thoughts, that Ukraine belongs to him.
He sees Ukrainians as confused Russians, that will truly appreciate he invaded them, once Russia fully indoctrinates them "back to their Russian ways".
Actually, the language and culture of Ukraine extends north and east of the border of Ukraine so, if anything, Ukraine should be pushing into Russia under this argument.
Parts of modern Ukraine and parts of modern Russia have been within the same border before under various names, because borders wiggle around all over the place throughout European history, but it was never a part of Russia.
It's very popular saying in Ukraine and russia "Киев - мать городов русских" (Kyiv is the mother of russian cities) and since putin saying they are fighting for "motherland" shouldn't control over all territory be in hands of Kyiv then instead of Moscow?
