He has hated Zelensky ever since his father held up aid to Ukraine (which Congress had previously approved) in an effort to pressure Zelensky into falsely claiming that Ukraine had initiated an investigation into Hunter Biden.
Zelensky, while needing the aid, nonetheless had the integrity to stand up to Trump and refuse to lie.
Zelensky didn't merely stand up to Russia, he is without a doubt a fucking war hero.
Noone in the US or European military can compare to his military successes, or have the balls to confront Putin even after his spectacular defeats.
Let alone the current crop of cowardly politicians.
I think MTG, Boebert, and Gosar are dumb people that got elected.
They believe their bullshit and say/do dumb shit that their communicating people step in to do clean up.
The worst of the hierarchy have to manage them.
The worst are the McConnell, Cruz, Hawley, DeSantis types.
They know exactly what they're doing.
They just play dumb because their base eats it all up.
These guys are pretty well-connected and use that to recruit those from the second tier & support those from the bottom at arm's lenh.
Some are just smart enough and connected enough to see that there are people to grift.
I'd put people like Tuberville in this category.
I would say anyone in this group is recruited by the worst of the GOP with the prospect of a cushy government job.
They're told how to vote by McConnell.
