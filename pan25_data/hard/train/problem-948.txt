We're going to get to these moments where we need compromise, Republicans will refuse to do it, and Republican voters will have that surprisepikachuface.jpeg.
The reason Republicans don’t want to do this through the ordinary budgeting process is precisely because doing so would require some kind of compromise.
They’d have to propose and justify the cuts they want, and build support within their party for those cuts.
That’s just too hard for Kevin.
What they want is what they got from Obama in 2011, which was a flat, across-the-board sequester of federal spending that undercut good governance and reflected no particular policy agenda.
(Ideally, if we’re going to cut federal spending, we make that decision not based on dollars spent but on our national policy priorities.
).
Right now, the negotiation positions are: Republicans want to hold up a debt ceiling hike unless they can push through an unspecified amount of cuts (with no tax hikes) to an unspecified number of programs.
Democrats have signaled, in response, that these negotiated cuts should be handled as part of the ordinary budgeting process, after the debt ceiling has been raised to avoid the immediate, economy-killing issue.
Never mind that all of these discussions are framed in such a way as to take tax increases off the table.
Trump’s tax cuts were deeply inequitable and should be revisited, and doing so would help us achieve deficit and debt reduction.
But not even the reporting seems to contemplate this as part of the reality.
Interestingly, only a small majority of Republicans believe that the parties should compromise.
Democrats and Independents are much more in favor.
