They appear to be a failed state already.
Take away the rocket, and now ICBM attacks and I’m just not sure it’s anything other than shoddy or unbelievable saber rattling.
IMO that's because our doctrine no longer relies on artillery; we simply bomb that shit to oblivion from the air.
I don't know of a single country that can match the US in air power, not even close.
The in the world based on TrueValueRating (not just number of aircraft) are, in order:
IMO, the US doesn't need to change tactics because its doctrine is already far superior to that of countries like Russia, who still rely on infantry and artillery.
I can't imagine any conflict the US would get into in which we would even need a huge ground assault force, because we have so many other options before we even get to that point.
In a full scale conflict “just call an F-16” can’t be the solution to all tactical problems, there won’t be enough to go around.
I suspect that the direction in which training will flow will reverse quite soon.
I’ve definitely seen some memes about Ukrainian tankers with a dozen confirmed kills being taught by American tankers who’ve never fired a shot in anger or worked with a drone.
So you have this massive emphasis on small unit infantry stuff, because that’s what you use in a counterinsurgency fight.
