Well Iran supply’s the people lobbing rockets at Israel every other day so I guess it’s tit for tat, but my feeling is this may escalate more because of the Iran nuke stuff.
Iran is funding multiple terrorist orgs by Israel's borders, but they themsevles don't want an open war with Israel because it would escelate into a larger conflict very quickly.
Iran already supports the ongoing war against Israel by supplying Palestinian terrorists with weapons, but engaging in open war would bring the US into the conflict directly, which Iran doesn’t want.
Nobody else will get involved because (1) western countries tacitly support Israel here because they are neutralizing an enemy’s weapon supply, and (2) Iran’s allies won’t risk a broader conflict over something minor like this.
Most of the Middle East won’t get involved because they hate Israel and Iran, but view Iran as the greater threat.
I don’t see how Iran could not retaliate tbh, would be a huge loss of face to allow such an attack without retaliation.
And not just like funding hamas more level of retaliation, I can see a direct attack back of some sort.
This could easily spiral out of control into a full blown war.
They shot missiles at a US military base in Iraq over killing that general.
Granted, it was largely ineffective, but still not “nothing”.
Both the US and Iran wanted to avoid a war and left it at that.
Israel and Iran hate each other far worse though and may not have the same level of restraint at some point.
