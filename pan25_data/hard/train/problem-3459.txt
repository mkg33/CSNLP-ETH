With the ACA, it wouldn’t have mattered.
The GOP had already had more than half a decade to come up with a replacement.
They’ve been unable to do so.
It wouldn’t have happened during Trump’s presidency, irrespective of the amount of time.
Notice how the GOP doesn’t say much about repealing it anymore?
It’s because they now have realized that a repeal without a viable replacement will fuck them at the polls, and they have nothing to offer in the way of a viable replacement.
They never wanted to replace it, just repeal the ACA and then kick the can down the road for decades while American voters die or go broke from simple medical issues.
The ACA opponents conveniently forget about the ridiculous insurance price increases and coverage cutting that paved the way fore the ACA to be passed in the first place.
I'm sure they've heard the theories, they just don't have the votes after their flaccid "red wave" rolled in.
There are enough GQP reps from purple and Biden-won states that would doom their future careers if they did.
They adopted their 2016 platform for 2020 so it basically boiled down to "The last president sucked and we'll do whatever Trump wants."
Hard to say if they'll stick with that message.
