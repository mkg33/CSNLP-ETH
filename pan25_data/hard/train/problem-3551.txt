That is part of the point.
Many of the deals that were made were set up for the countries to fail.
The result of the failure is that China would then take full ownership.
China would not have been able to build a Chinese port in the continent, but they would happily be allowed to build a “Somalian port”, which would eventually/legally later become a Chinese port.
It is pretty messed up.
Many of those countries could just say fuck off and tell China to do something about it.
We will believe China’s power after they send in troops to protect their interests.
Why would China sabotage the stability of their neighbor who could be an ally given a hard pivot to containment by the US?
If China speeds up Russia's defeat, they are speeding up their own containment by the US.
Considering China’s non-observance of Russian-claimed territories, if this plan in its current version were to happen right now, they’d withdraw even past Crimea.
"China does not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and recognizes Crimea as a part of Ukraine.
".
Yea.
China’s looking out for itself.
No shit.
Interests aren’t always mutually exclusive.
China and Ukraine can have the same interest in ending the war.
Anyway I hope Ukraine and China work together during this conflict and after.
Whatever the solution may be.
