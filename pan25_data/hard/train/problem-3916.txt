India acknowledges its a war, and wants Ukraine and Russia to sort their stuff out in a room.
But they do not want this issue globalized and forced down upon them as it doesn't affect them at all, no matter which side wins.
They don't condemn russia cuz a) They have russian equipment, and they would need russia to maintain said equipment and b) They don't have any right to comment on the issue.
It would be hypocritical of them to support either Ukraine or Russia, as they want the world to not be aligned in their own border issue with pakistan.
So, even looking at it in an economic sense, The war will not affect India one bit.
Heck, the war will affect India if they choose sides.
Anybody for knows their world war history should know why India would take this stance.
People really need to stop being surprised that countries don't want to fuel or take part in what could be the catalyst for an actual world war 3.
But America forcing countries into wars they do not want to fight in or have anything to do with is pretty much the American foreign policy rule 1.
