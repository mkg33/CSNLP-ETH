Doesn't make a lot of sense to do that now that the GOP has the House.
Plus, Democrats have to defend 20 Senate seats in 2 years---not a great time to kill the filibuster.
But with two years under his belt as Senate majority leader and a strenhened majority heading into the next two years, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is showing that he’s playing the long game for confirming Democratic-appointed judges, too.
For years, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been crafting his legacy as the Senate leader who played the long game to stack the nation’s federal courts with conservatives.
Schumer has been helping President Joe Biden outpace past presidents with his judicial confirmations.
The Senate has confirmed 96 of Biden’s lifetime federal judges as of Tuesday.
That’s more than Donald Trump (85) and Barack Obama (62) had confirmed by this point in their presidencies.
If the Senate tops 100 confirmations by the end of the year, which is Schumer’s goal, Biden will surpass former President George W. Bush, too.
The Senate majority leader told HuffPost his goal is to “achieve balance” on every appeals court in the next two years with Biden’s judicial picks.
