I went to college in Utah and was part of this big sister type program specifically for abandoned neglected kids.
The girl I got matched with informed me her dad had been a pastor or whatever the right word is for the church, when I asked where he was she goes “oh he’s in jail with my brother.” Apparently the dad and the brother were using her nightly for there benefit….
And as I learned in that program, incest is huuuuuuge in Utah as are pedophiles.
So not only are Mormons very toxic in how they brain wash women to be treated and how men are raised to abuse, sadly a lot of little girls are being permanently traumatized by what they’re enduring from it too.
Treating women horribly, physically or mentally, causes so many problems for both boys and girls in the next generation.
But even with these guys, they only ever molested the women with less respect than others in their community.
They are not going to rape the wife of a powerful man, no matter how she’s dressed.
So women are these sirens that the mere glance of a bit of skin can drive a man crazy, to the point of raping her.
