I hope the US defaults.
I need some excitement in my life.
The shockwave it would cause through financial markets would give me as a researcher so much material to study and publish.
3) US Government cannot only not borrow more, it will need to borrow less than now as interest on new treasuries fly through the roof and must reduce spending everywhere.
5) Returning to your old spending pattern with new interest rates would probably have you hit the next debt ceiling immediately or perhaps even send you over the next 4-5 ones.
4) At some point republican congress raises the debt ceiling but your bonds have already been downgraded so interest payments are so high now.
Republicans blame Democrats for the debt ceilings highest ever, thats such BS!
The debt was made when trump was in 2 years ago , Biden inherited trumps diaster as Obama did Bush jr.
Mess.
Republicans and there supporters expect Democrats to clean up there mess asap, the train derailment in Ohio would not have happen if trump didn't take off what Obama put in place to avoid this disaster.
IF HE WAS BEING HELD ACCOUTABLE FOR ALL HE'S DONE HE WOULD NEVER SEE A BLUE SKY.
