How can those evil sub-human foreigners even think about moving to the best location for an opportunity of a good paying job!
They should stop right at the border of the first country they cross and never ever move again, just like the good british people who would never even think about moving elsewhere to get better job/life.
Now we have a limit on migrants, do you think it's fair that someone who is just migrating to the UK for economic oppurtunity gets in and uses one of those limited spots as opposed to someone fleeing Perseucution, Death or War?
So if you agree that 15 million is too many but the UK should let some people in then it's merely an exercise in deciding the number we should allow in.
Just because you want a better life doesn't mean you deserve it or it's feasible for you to have it.
I'd argue that we shouldn't let any more economic migrants in as it stands.
We're currently having to put the majority of migrants in Hotels because we don't have the housing for them, we also have a housing crisis where we can't even house our young population.
