Propaganda works often by starting small and rolling people in through repeating then excluding and demonizing others to the point the only ones that can be trusted is the source.
That source ramps up the propaganda and piles on until people have shut down critical thinking.
The problem is that these people are conditioned to believe that all of those other data points are wrong, fake news, or a combination there of.
Again, you can argue that having faith in something contrary to the facts is crazy, but here we are.
This isn’t surprising because you want your delegates to be the most devoted individuals from your party.

This was a republican, who got caught.
The only thing this shows is that our election integrity is fine as is since we’re catching voter fraud when it does happen.
The right fails to mention that most of the voter fraud have been republicans thinking they could get away with it since President Cheeto keeps saying it’s so rampant and easy to do to his base.
For the last 2 election cycles the vast majority of voter fraud has been small numbers of republican individuals thinking it’s easy to cheat because they hear so much about democrats cheating.
