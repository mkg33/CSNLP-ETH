If you are a Christian, a TRUE Christian rather than a person who says they are for attention, then you are told over and over in the New Testament that good works will not take you to Heaven.
It is faith in salvation through Christ that takes you to Heaven.
Good works are the result of loving all people of all races and faiths and helping as much as you can.
Above all, Christians do not have the right to judge others.
They, like everyone, have the responsibility to stop those who hurt others.
Being a Christian does not make someone exempt from doing something wrong or hurtful.
"Christians" argue that (the Christian) God and the bible to stops them from raping and murdering others.
"I don't need God to keep me from raping and murdering people.
I rape and murder exactly as many people as I want to, and that number is zero.
".
Yup.
There is a huge hypocrisy standard all around.
I recall when the Debra Lafave case happened way back along with the Mary Kay Letourneau case, and all I remember hearing from people like Bill Maher and so many others (mostly men) was that it what they did wasn't rape because the victims in the case must have obviously wanted it, due to them being pretty, I guess.
We don't.
We just point out the hypocrisy of Republicans, who claim anything LGBTQIA+ people do as wicked and evil, yet won't say anything about actual abuse.
The Qanon bullshit actually hurt victims of sex abuse and sex trafficking, and despite being shown the evidence of it, they refuse to stop with their bigoted hate.
It's ridiculous.
I think they're already past that.
They're at mass violence against LGBTQIA+ people.
With the likes of Christopher Rufo, Matt Walsh, and Chaya Raichik, they want extermination and eliminationism.
