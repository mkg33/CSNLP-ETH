"He doesn't really mean the whole constitution Just the parts that don't let him immediately be reinstated as President by the GOP That's not bad And if you think it is, then you're the problem and you must hate America" /S.
I saw a quote on another sub which showed a transcript of his speech & he actually said he felt the constitution had been overturned because he lost unfairly, not he intended to overturn the constitution.
I went to the single thread about this on the conservative sub earlier to see their take and while some said it was unacceptable at least half the sentiments were about how the media always twists his words and that he didn’t say the Constitution should be terminated, he said that since the election was stolen it already has been terminated, which just baffles me because don’t they see that’s worse?
Lol it’s just more evidence that they are actually incapable of thinking about things objectively, it’s just so clear that the actual topic at hand is not even being considered.
