In New Mexico once you have completed your prison sentence (including any subsequent probationary period) you get your voting rights restored I believe.
The judge who ruled on this candidates' eligibility said that he believed the State Constitution does not allow to impose a DIFFERENT penalty for felons in terms of being eligible to run for office than being able to vote.
It would allow lawmakers to enact new laws as felonies that target their opponents and whittle down their opposition's ability to participate in the democratic process.
Also, as much as many may dislike the idea, it can be a threat to democracy to to disenfranchise folks permanently in such a wide covering manner.
Because rejecting the rules of democracy itself, like not accepting a lost election and threatening violence against your political opponents is a straight way into fascism.
At first it was just a few "tea party" weirdos, but since Trump and the storm on the Capitol there seems to be a lot of fascist tendencies in the republican party.
Most of them have commented to throw the dude under the jail, that sun is so dead now itâ€™s actually only real conservatives left, and they seem eager to throw off the blanket of crazy Trump laid over the party.
