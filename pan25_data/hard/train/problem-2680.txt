Lithuania shares a border with russia and guess what, it's safe and secure because it's in NATO.
Unlike ukraine, which also shares a border with russia but instead of being in NATO it only got security guarantees from russia for giving up its nukes.
Now millions of ukrainians are either displaced, kidnapped or killed.
If ukraine had joined NATO in 2008, there would be no war.
If ukraine does not join NATO now, russia will invade again in 5-6 years as it did before in chechnya and ukraine.
Once more, if ukraine had been a NATO member in 2022, there would be no war.
If ukraine isn't a NATO after it has expunged russia from its territory, Putin will invade again.
After the soviet union fell, Russian took possession of all of Ukraine's nuclear weapons with the promise they would protect their sovereignty.
If Western intelligence thought Russia's arsenal was in disarray, there would be NATO troops in Ukraine already.
Instead they have been very careful and methodical about how much aid to send so as not to accidentally push Russia into nuclear escalation.
The threat is real.
