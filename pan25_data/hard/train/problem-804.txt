These same "let her rip, my kid is getting behind in school" people also failed to recognize the impacts of long COVID on children as well as _themselves_.
Not to mention the emotional impact of watching gram gram dying on a vent because of an avoidable disease.
Personally, a bit of nudity (well, silicone prosthetic in this case) is not as big of a deal as the massive quantity of violence kids are exposed to daily.
Much better to expose a child to something that has very small chance of killing it than letting the child see a live sexual performance, which is what drag queens always do, without fail.
Because the state has a vested interest in making sure children aren’t being sexually exploited, and it’s very much arguable that exposure to in-person performances of a sexual nature does that very thing?
There’s plenty of research into actual child sex abuse being problematic for the development of kids, and it is generally accepted (as it should be) in society that children cannot consent to participation in sexual acts.
I can link to studies and data about that and about more general exposure to sexual content and the effect on children, but not particularly the effects of Drag in isolation.
What “authoritative facts and figures” could I possibly cite on drag show effects on children, if the very hypothesis that they are harmful to kids would present an ethical dilemma in studying it?
Of course I’m going to refer to authoritative facts and figures to debunk a claim when I can.
