Russia can end the war anytime they want.
I really don't see how there could be any diplomatic solution that doesn't fuck Ukraine over and reward Russia.
And at a time Republicans won't be funding our own country, let alone Ukraine, Diplomacy is going to matter now more than ever.
So I think that's why talk may be turning to trying to give it some kind of "off ramp" again, even without everything Ukraine wants and, frankly, deserves.
Under any deal with any chance of happening, Russia will end up looking like giant loser and its invasion a massive mistake in the eyes of the rest of the world.
I don't think anyone now thinks the war has made Russia better off in any sense.
Thanks mostly to the great courage and resolve of the Ukrainians, it is severely weakened and will continue to grow weaker the longer the thing continues.
The most important thing to avoid was creating the reality or the impression that Russia came out better off, in any way, for its behavior.
This would incentive both Russia and other thuggish regimes to act in similar ways in the future.
