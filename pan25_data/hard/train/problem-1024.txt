Thanks for that.
Very interesting history.
I visited Estonia back in '97 or so.
Flew to Finland and then took a Soviet-era turbo prop from Finland to Tallinn.
I was impressed by how far they had come.
They were modernizing very quickly.
I was told, Finland helped Estonia a lot at the time because of a shared heritage, similar languages, etc.
Estonians also looked towards Finland as the country to emulate.
Northern Estonia was able to see Finnish TV, so Finnish way of life and western TV shows like Dallas were a small ray of hope and idealism to strive towards back when communism seemed to be ever-lasting.
Finnish TV and visits to Finland were also how Estonians knew that actually, Soviet Union was in decline because the TV showed how life was and people then saw the same in their society and in Finnish stores (unlike what was shown on Soviet TV and news and what they saw in real life).
I’m not sure, to be honest.
I know that the reason why so many refugees wanted to move forward from Sweden was due to the closeness of USSR for one, and the fear that Sweden would force them back to USSR for the second.
I had two relatives of my own in Sweden - unfortunately, they’re both dead now and their kids and grandkids were not either interested in keeping contact or don’t even know that they have relatives here, relatively close relatives too.
