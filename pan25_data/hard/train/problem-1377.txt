If the amendment specified that it did apply to the sitting president, then it's legal.
Nothing surpasses the Constitution and it's amendments.
I have mixed feelings about the proposed bill only working for newly elected senators.
It'll be easier to pass if we allow an exception, but then we'll have a situation for the next couple decades where we have VERY senior senators.
I'm pretty sure his terribly written bill accidentally limits Senators to three terms instead of two anyway.
A second term Senator will not have served two terms by election day and should therefore be eligible to be elected a third time.
I still think some term limits would be great (maybe 3 terms for senate and 4 or 5 terms terms for houseâ€”that would give someone enough time to gain experience, create their own laws, etc.
26 or 28 years is a long enough time to spend serving the public.
Several people bring up the fact that lobbyists would be come even more powerful in that situation since you would have constant turn over of Congress.
Those who represent the public would need help getting their office going, writing laws, and learning the ins and outs of working in Congress in general.
If the turn over is too fast due to term limits, then the lobbyists would be relied upon even more so than they are today.
Also.. if you have term limits, you have no reason not to accept lobbying money.
If you know you're getting fired no matter what you do, you're gonna start stealing office supplies.
It actually makes it worse, because corporations can just write a few big checks to fund their candidate, where a candidate representing people's interests needs time to build trust and gather lots of small donations.
It's stupid to throw out all that built trust because of some misconception about incumbency or thinking that a new candidate starts out uncorrupted.
