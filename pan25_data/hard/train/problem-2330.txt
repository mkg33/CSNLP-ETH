That's true and all but in Russia most people dont feel this way, so repeating this over and over is meaningless.
If you don't understand that Russia sees a Western-aligned Ukraine as an existential threat than you will never realize that this war isn't going to end well for anyone until it's too late.
As far as I understand, if Russia lose a conventional war (in the next 6 months or 6 year, it might feel it has no other option than to go nuclear.
If NATO supply Ukraine weapons sooner rather than later, that it uses on Russian Territory (thereby crossing Putin’s red lines), Russia has said it will go nuclear.
The time will also give Ukraine an opportunity to join NATO and install the best of defences/deterrents.
For anyone thinking “we better not help ukraine defend themselves because Russia might be annoyed that they can’t invade and steal stuff”.
I’m saying I don’t really believe the Russian leadership’s claims that the Ukraine war is primarily about security (even if most of the Russian populace does think that).
It looks like a naked grab for land and glory to me—that and putting the Ukrainians in their place for daring to want to chart a different course from Russia.
