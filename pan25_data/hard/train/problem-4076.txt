He had the backing of the congress and the people so he could comfortably make that threat to the SCOTUS.
dont get me wrong i think we are long overdue having more justices given how many court circuits we have, but i honestly dont have much confidence in it happening.
There are compelling legal arguments that have been made that judges appointed to the Supreme Court can be rotated back to the circuit courts, and don't have to sit on the high court forever.
Can't force them to resign as federal judges without a constitutional amendments, BUT I have heard various experts float the idea of simply rotating them back down to a lower court.
Plus, term limits and maybe even restricting supreme court nominations to people already appointed a federal position.
Don't even need to double it.
Bump it up to the same number of district courts, 13, and lock it to that number so if in the future we further sub-divide districts we automatically get more supreme court seats - makes sense we have a larger pool to represent the larger population and prevents a repetitive game of one-upsmanship as one side keeps adding more to get the results they want.
