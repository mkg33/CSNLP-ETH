Bro, he's talking about Apples decision to move production is not about workers' rights.
Apple wants stability in their supply chain.
Obviously, the workers' rights (and draconian covid policies) are causing the supply chain issues, but that's not what Apple is worried about because the issues have persisted for some time.
It's no secret that Apple has been facing increasing pressure to move its production out of China for a variety of reasons, including rising labor costs and the ongoing trade war between the United States and China.
However, the recent reports of violent worker protests at Apple's factories in China may be the final straw that prompts the company to make a major shift in its production strategy.
Some are speculating that this move could be part of a larger conspiracy by Apple to distance itself from China and its controversial labor practices.
It's no secret that Apple has been criticized in the past for its reliance on cheap labor in Chinese factories, and moving its production to another country could be a way for the company to avoid further scrutiny and criticism.
It's also possible that Apple is looking to capitalize on the growing trend of companies moving their production out of China in search of cheaper labor and more favorable conditions.
Many companies are looking to countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and India as alternatives to China, and Apple could be looking to do the same.
