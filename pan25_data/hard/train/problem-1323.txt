And the current supreme court is very right-leaning, so even centrist rulings are getting (successfully) appealed en masse.
I'm starting to wonder if you're arguing in good faith here...
That's... not how appellate courts work.
It shouldn't surprise anyone to hear that cases coming out of the west coast courts have a more progressive bent, but you don't just get to choose the appellate court your case goes to.
I guess you weren't around since 2017 when Blue states frequently filed and won cases in the Left-leaning Ninth Circuit, but were later frequently overturned by the SC.
Yes you do, by filing the cases in a state under the jurisdiction of a specific appellate court.
Which is why many lawsuits were launched by California and ended up in the Ninth Circuit which has a left-leaning majority.
Disagreeing with you doesn't mean people are arguing in bad faith.
Please stop trying to stifle discussion.
Yes it is.
Or explain why California was the one who filed most lawsuits again the Trunk admin to get them in a friendly circuit.
