For various reasons it's a HUGE liability for Canada with 0 benefits.
It'd be like asking Iceland and Greenland/Denmark to take full responsibility of everyone travelling across the north Atlantic.
I agree our military is criminally underfunded, but unfortunately that's a side effect of current politics.
Most supporters of military funding are on the right, and lately they have gone off the deep end so no one would vote them in (I define myself as a conservative but there's no chance in hell I'd vote for them).
Meanwhile people on the left seem to have taken the attitude that Canada can do the bare minimum because we have the US to back us up if we ever need protection.
It's going to be awhile for that to change.
This is a big part of my thoughts on it.
Comparing it to the Bosphorus is a joke.
You got like 30 countries nearby to aid support if any issues were to occur over that very short passage.
Meanwhile the Northwest Passage is 1,450 kilometers long (900 miles) long and it's really only Canada there to handle anything that may happen.
IF they are in the right spot the US may be able to send aid from Alaska.
As far as the US is concerned, Canada may as well be Minnesota or Alaska.
If shit hits the fan, Canada is going to be defended as if it was domestic territory.
It would be a cold day in hell before the US allows Russia or China a foothold on the North American continent.
