But I want to point out it was simply extremely fucked up when Trump allowed Turkey to massacre the Kurdish cities in Syria.
Its just that after an unfortunate thing like the terrorist attack in Istanbul, Turks just switch on their all Kurds= terrorists vision and go on a rampage.
The Turks have a history of genocides and mass killings, I just wished they’d actually target PKK instead of Kurds in general.
But hey, what am I going to do about when America and Israel don’t even bother trying to help Kurds establish a state, when they called them their allies so many times.
If those 2 nations can’t help the Kurds create a state, I believe no one can.
Kurds want borders that are split between 4 nation states AND are currently living in a NATO members borders.
Kurds on the other hand are foghting for their independence, want peace and want their own country.
But the other sides are not willing to negotiate.
It's tribal warfare similar to what was/is in Afghanistan, Libya or even some central African countries.
