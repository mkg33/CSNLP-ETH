People on Reddit and in the West complain about racism against China.
Meanwhile, every country around China is unhappy and engaged in territorial disputes with them as China tries to increase their sphere of influence/power.
General public does not like China though there are Duterte fanatics that hyperbolize the issue making the Philippines weak and subservient to China fearing war.
All it does is make us look weak.
Duterte maybe out but his policys still linger under Marcos.
Harry Roque, former Philippine spokes man and Dutertes cult friends SMNI has a huge influence in Dutertes mind.
Enrile, and gloria arroyo.
You are right about duterte he will continue to suk up to china, as for Sara she is very much like his father.
I doubt she will stray far from his foreign policy, even if she could the people around her will pressure her to stick with China.

Every act of territorial aggression is just reclaiming what was wrongfully taken from China and every act of diplomatic belligerence is just finally "being tough" and "standing up for itself".
As a result, even minor slights are treated as grave insults to their integrity, and they are incapable of understanding how in today's geopolitical landscape they've become a belligerent power and a diplomatic snowflake.
