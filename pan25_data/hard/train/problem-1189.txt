I doubt this would work; they wouldn't have standing, and the Constitution says that "Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members" -- I'm not sure the courts would want to get involved.
If the Speaker decides they want to seat Santos anyways and the party in power in the House supports that decision, there's no political recourse until the next election.
A lawsuit against the elections board that certified the election/candidates qualifications may get the election results thrown out, though.
So New York State's elections board is the one lying in this article, even though they claim it's "not their problem."
I suppose a GOP Speaker (once they elect one) could simply ignore that there's no proof as refusing to seat Santos is the only enforcement mechanism available.
No one has a reasonable belief that Santos is not legally allowed in Congress, but his prolific lying about his past did raise some questions as to who is supposed to fact-check his background to make sure.
Especially after he completely lied about his mother and where he was raised.
There was a potential hypothetical that he had lied about how long he had been a US citizen.
