Yes, bail has something to do with that, but the system is made up of individuals making decisions.
There are innumerable examples of the rich being treated far better than the ooor in the justice system (see affluence boy, see DuPont getting no jail time after raping his child daughter).
If you genuinely believe individual jusges and DAs don’t show the wealthy and powerful special treatment then I have a bridge to sell you.
As Carlin said, “It's a big club, and you ain’t in it.”.
That bias is both due to how the system is structured (e.g., being able to afford bail or high-powered lawyers) as well as implicit (e.g., subconscious preferential treatment towards the wealthy at all levels of the justice system).
Edit: this provides an good read on how implicit biases impact the justice system (albeit centered around race rather than wealth).
This was another good read on socioeconomic bias that agrees with you that it tends to be more implicit:
I would argue that more explicit wealth bias exists in the system, but that is hard to prove from implici bias.
Is that due to a bias towards the wealthy, or the fact the wealthy have more resources than the poor to oppose those steps at every turn and cultivate their appearance to the court room?
I would guess the latter, more often than not.
