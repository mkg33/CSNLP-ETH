Ngl, that's a huge motivator for me.
Critics attacked all the wrong points.
The dude looks like he's straight up from Hollywood, but he's kept CA fiscally dominant, while still promoting future advancements.
It's going to be a huge endeavor for CA to start producing it's own affordable insulin, but that means more jobs for people of all backgrounds and educations: scientists, medical professionals, drivers, retailers, warehouse workers, etc.
Jobs and less of an expenses on tax payers for Medicare funding.
It's supply and demand.
Everyone wants to live here, but not enough houses are being built.
Homeless people choose to live here.
The social programs in CA allow homeless people the opportunity to have light (and unfortunately insufficient) tools that help them carry a day-to-day life.
In comparison to most other states, the homeless have access to generous welfare/food stamps, Medicare, and even a simple phone.
These are things many people in other states don't have nor do they get access to.
Granted, many of our homeless still suffer from non-financial ailments, and many times these support programs are mismanaged, but there's a reason the homelessness is as severe as it is here: it's a safer place to be homeless.
I cant imagine a homeless person anywhere in the US has a higher quality of life than someone housed anywhere else in the US.
Well..... A homeless person in California probably has a much better chance of having access to clean drinkable water than some that are housed in other state.....
