The strategic importance of Crimea is so significant, attempts to take it will lead to a major military escalation.
I don't think jingoism is appropriate in this analysis.
I don't think "disingenuous" is the appropriate word here.
Did Allied forces in the East include non-Russians?
Yes.
It doesn't change the fact most of those forces were Russian.
What's funny is while there were Ukrainian Nazi collaborators, most Ukrainians fought for the USSR as brothers with Russians.
Ideally, the ultimate resolution would be the status quo of 1991.
Ukrainian disarmament, a renewed guarantee of no NATO membership, the return of Crimea and all occupied regions, but a renewed guarantee for access to the Black Sea Fleet, and a reasonable war indemnity by Russia.
For a reasonable agreement, I'd say a ceasefire, returning the occupied regions, some indemnity (but none for war crimes), and maybe Black Sea access at Sevastopol (though only if Russia agrees prior to Ukraine actually going into Crimea), maybe with some time limits on allying with NATO .
Russia is both losing and is the agressor in an unjust war for expansion, thus I don't see why they would be granted a return to the pre-2014 invasion status quo, or why Ukraine should leave themselves defenseless.
Otherwise, the Russian strategy is to push the frontlines away from Donetsk city, while waiting for the war exhaustion to force the end of fighting.
I have no clue why the Russian military is taking it's cues from the First World War when you consider how said war ended for Russia.
