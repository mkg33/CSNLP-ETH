But to suggest that Congress needs to reauthorize every law every 5 years... Yeah there can't be anything bad that will come of a massive omnibus approval bill to pre-authorize literally every federal law there is.
/s/s/s/s.
It would be like a smaller version of reauthorizing or writing the constitution every 20 years as was proposed I think by Madison or someone else.
The opportunity for bad actors to insert themselves and create chaos in that process is just too great to justify any benefit.
Plus with Congress, you'd have periods where depending on who had control over the legislature, our rules and laws could just change wholesale overnight every 5+ years.
It doesn't make any sense, much like most republican proposals.
Madness for a number of reasons.
What I would support is laws that are struck down either by state supreme court or SCOTUS to be essentially removed from the books.
In that case the Dobbs ruling wouldn't have had such an asinine impact on a few states like Arizona and Wisconsin.
(Former has a pre-state, territory law against it and the latter has a pre civil war era rule against it.
).
Ah, of course.
Pretty much without exception everything they want to cut falls into the category of things that help the poor and middle class in one way or another.
No mention of our insane military budget or oil and coal subsidies or repealing tax cuts on the wealthy and corporations.
Nope, just tighten the belts of the most vulnerable.
