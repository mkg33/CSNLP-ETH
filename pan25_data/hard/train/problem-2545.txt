The irony is getting a little warmer might make Russia a bit more liveable.
Putin will not live to see it.
It was reasonable to expect Ukraine to fight back, and we kinda knew Russia wasn’t at NATO level, but what we’ve seen has been next level.
Again, not inciting violence in the middle of a genocidal attack by Russia, just want Ukraine to be able to defend itself.
You know, seeing how Russia is once again terrorizes Ukraine with missiles, and bombing our cities, i feel that i need to reporst this once again because they launched another missile attack on our cities.
If these missiles today, deliberately taking advantage of the gaps in air defence, came from Belarus, is Ukraine now in a strong enough position to return fire on Belarusian military installations?
At this point, the Belarusian army joining the war is not a threat to Ukraine and would massively increase instability within the country.
A deposed Lukashenko and a Belarusian civil war would give Russia an incredibly difficult choice as to where it directs its trained troops - at Ukraine or to prop up Belarus.
Obviously Russia used Belarus as a staging ground all the way through this war but at what point does Belarus become an official belligerent?
