Yes, her father “sold” his company to her and her husband 20 years ago.
As far as I can tell the only employment she has ever had before congress was working in the family business and running a CrossFit gym for a couple of years.
There is almost no evidence of MTG having any operational role in the business beyond taking a salary.
One of MTG’s great hypocrisies is that her company has made millions of dollars building the kind of government subsidized low income housing she would happily legislate out of existence.
And while Greene has railed against big government, the AJC found that the family’s North Fulton construction business profited for years from work on taxpayer-subsidized low-income housing.
".
" From 2007 until 2011, Greene was listed as CFO of the family construction company, Taylor Commercial, Inc. in corporate registration records filed with the Georgia Secretary of State.
Yet for several years during the time she was presumably helping her husband run their construction company, she spent her days at a gym pursuing her passion for CrossFit training and traveling to participate in national competitions.
She claimed to be involved/running the huge construction business her father started and that was sold/gifted to her and her husband, but she apparently was not actually involved in the company.
Her father owned a construction company which he eventually sold to her and her husband.
She also used to own one of the most successful CrossFit gyms in the country before selling it.
