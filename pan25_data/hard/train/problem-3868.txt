I can't find data for Romania, Hungary, Poland, China etc.
Most data comes from at best 1950 so that probably says something for how bad things got.
2) Factories of the time period were relatively simple, and could be rebuilt or just moved somewhere else.
1) WW2 bombers were notoriously inaccurate, it required hundreds of bombers to take out one factory.
Not as bad as it sounds.
That GDP loss isn't from cities being leveled it's from people fleeing the country / the front lines.
After the war ends a lot of those people will return and the GDP will bounce back.
Factories can be rebuilt, raw resources are still in the ground etc.
Add in the likely western marshal plan to rebuild and Ukraine could come back stronger than ever.
If the EU and NATO are worth their salt, the rebuilding of Ukraine needs to be incredible.
They need to show the value in being an ally if they want to keep their members and alliances strong.
It one thing to sanction and condemn Russia, providing weapons is great, but if ultimately Ukraine comes out of this worse, then what good do those alliances truly offer?
