All these victories during summer now made people soft and completely overrestimating of Ukraine power.
You're right, but whats your conclusion?
They having a little bit more tanks than they previously started with means they can easily overthrow Russia?
You are aware that there are literal battalions just waiting doing nothing in Ukraine (them being just infantry is worthless), because there aren't enough tanks and other military vehicles, right?
I wrote this elsewhere but I honestly cannot comprehend the amount of fear Russian tankers and infantry will have defending against a spring offensive composed of combined-arms NATO-equipped troops.
First hitting with precision artillery like HIMARs and excaliburs, then barrages of traditional artillery.
Backed by western intelligence...
Led by Challengers, Leopards, Abrams tanks that dwarf their tin cans, supported by Bradleys, strykers, etc.
and infantry... With heavy air-defense on the back line.
All with a strong moral imperative to defend and take back their land and protect their own families.
