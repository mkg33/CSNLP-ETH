Let’s step out of fantasy land for a but and remember that this is a civil lawsuit.
If you want things to change, spend less time fantasizing about consequences for people you don’t like and more time figuring out how to get involved with local elections.
If you plan on waiting for a bunch of rich schmucks to care about anything but themselves and others in their economic bracket, you’ll be waiting until you’re dead.
The only reason FOX is even in hot water right now is because they made other rich people loose money.
Plus, just because something is corrupt and morally objectionable doesn’t mean that there are criminal penalties for it.
Again, this is a civil case - as in somebody suing for monetary compensation.
Nobody in the government is coming to save us from these people, and there’s nothing they could do even if they wanted that.
If we all want this bs fixed, we need to put down the lofty fantasies and sacrifice some of our comfort to put our time into solutions that actually work.
That’s quite an interesting bill.
Just to clarify, I’m not under the impression that legislators can’t fix anything - in fact, electing people who put forward such things is exactly what I’d recommend as a pragmatic solution.
My statement was more about the idea of prosecutors jailing oligarchs for being liars and such.
Fantasy that people who spread lies that lead to violence and sedition ( not just at Fox but also politicians) should go to jail ?
It will happen.
Just how long will it take before Georgia, Arizona, the DOJ and others actually puts charges and how many will they charge.
I think more than the company needs to be sued and charged.
Money is money and when you are this rich you just shrug it off.
People need to go to jail for this , people in power.
