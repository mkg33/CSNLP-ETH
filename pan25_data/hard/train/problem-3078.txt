This is Russia in an nutshell for over a century.
It is always the bully with the glass jaw.
It's only strenh is its numbers and even then its phyrric with them either burning their capital or wasting 1/3 of their youths and hoping the opposite end runs out of bullets.
We truly gave them a chance, we appeased maybe a little too much, but we cut the devil before it turned into Hitler 2.0.
True, at the cost of Ukrainian blood, but that's also on Europe.
I was told Poland was going to invade Ukraine like it did 100 years ago, and Russia is here to save Ukraine from Poland.
Notice how he makes claims that Nazi ideology is widespread in Ukraine.
They are "allowing criticism" in order to control the narrative.
The answers to his scripted questions won't be that Russia should give up and go home but rather to escalate the conflict.
I don't think it will be as big as HIMARS as those are a serious game changer that Russia still hasn't been able to really answer.
The Bradleys will see actual combat and be at risk, but they'll certainly help Ukranian pushes.
And the Challengers, well the odds of those being destroyed ain't high... they won't last forever but they're pretty badass.
If those are combined with another wave of freshly trained Ukranian troops then that will do a lot and I don't think either way that Russia will be able to make much of a push anywhere.
Ukraine will benefit greatly if they are able to regain the offensive momentum that leaves Russia unable to push anywhere because they are too busy scrambling to defend and retreat.
