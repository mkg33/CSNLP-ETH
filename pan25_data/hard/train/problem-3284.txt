desantis saying he will have any federal election monitors arrested if they went near any polling places in Florida doesn't really help his case much.
Not wanting any federal oversight into your heavily gerrymandered elections combined trump claiming to have used the FBI to win you an election 4 years ago definitely puts a big fat red flag on your state.
He's almost certainly lying because he believes that using the FBI to install governors in red states would increase his support.
Unfortunately for desantis, his idiotic strongman act threatening to arrest any federal election monitors in Florida combined with trumps dumbass claim makes the state's elections sound pretty bad.
Doesn't help much that Florida has a history of shady election bullshit that never really gets looked into.
I mean even though it was obvious bullshit we did investigate the claims of voter fraud and election stolen last election too.
That election also reminds everyone what a POS Scott (not DeSantis) was implying - as the sitting Governor of that state - there was voter fraud with zero evidence.
Scott, the sitting Governor and POS, was the one who made allegations of voter fraud, not DeSantis.
There was a court order to appease Scott's public 'stop the steal' shit and they installed watchers in Broward during their count.
That's it.
That is called a ghost candidate.
Yes the man who paid the guy got busted for it.
But the trail doesn't stop there - the guy didn't just have 600k in his pockets for this...
