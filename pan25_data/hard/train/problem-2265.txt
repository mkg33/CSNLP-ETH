Great, I will celebrate when I see literally anything done about it.
But as it stands this motherfucker was impeached TWICE, has now been found as the central cause of the 1/6 riot, and is still planning his 2024 run.
That they were antifa rioters who were trying to delay Biden from getting into office because they wanted four more years of Trump?
We all know Trump and his supporters launched a insurrection to overthrow our democracy and keep Trump in power by refusing to certify Biden.
Trump eventually would have been removed one way or another if he succeeded in remaining in power.
Many top military brass and the joint chiefs of staff wrote an open letter saying Biden won and the election was over.
All former defense secretaries also made a joint statement saying Biden won.
The military and much of the American political establishment was certainly not on Trump's side.
You know it happened we all do.
It's just getting pathetic people down playing it or throw conspiracies around.
There was reports that military and intelligence agencies were.coordinating on plans of what to do if Trump doesn't step down.
Like they were ready to refuse orders.
