Correct- though R voters are over 90% white, those getting abortions are about 66% non white.
They’d ironically be increasing the non white population.
In addition to being anti abortion/birth control, they’re also anti gay and pro Christian Nationalist.
And, just to reiterate, I think what Republicans are doing about abortion is abhorrent.
I just think we need to have honest debates about it instead of the unproductive mudslinging that dominates the discussion today.
So I'm all for reproductive rights, but in the minds of these people this type of argument is like saying "If you don't like assaulting homeless people, just don't do it.
Don't interfere with other people's freedom to assault homeless people.
".
Again, not my position on the issue but this type of argument ignores the fact that they believe there's another person involved.
That's something we can debate but there isn't consensus around when "personhood" begins.
The anti-abortion crowd says it starts at conception, or when the heartbeat (really just the pacemaker) can be detected.
Other people say it starts at some point late in pregnancy, or at birth itself, or first breath, or whatever.
