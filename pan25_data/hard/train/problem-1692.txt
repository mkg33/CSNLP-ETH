I am well aware of bear proofing trashcans so pay up to whoever you made that bet to.
There is significant overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest humans.
Yes, bears are a problem in rural areas.
But where the most litter issues are there ain't no fucking bears, just poor waste infrastructure.
Becuase people should stop littering.
And also I know big companies bad but how is mcdonald's responsible for their customers throwing rubbish on the floor?
Because it litterally is not McDonals littering but the customer?
All that is being asked is that you take your trash and put it into the trash bin.
Regardless of where it came from?
McDonalds packaging, Starbucks cups, zigarette buds, etc.
You bought it, you dispose of it.
Stop crying about the corporations when it is clearly the customers being at fault here.
It's always blame the customer.
Why not make a law that the company who makes stuff is responsible for everything they sell?
It has McDonalds written on it?
McDonalds is the responsible litterer.
