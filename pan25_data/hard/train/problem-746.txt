It's a relatively new tech company building cars and selling them at luxury prices, what exactly did people expect?
Build quality issues on a new model or new process in a factory take a while to iron out, even for established brands.
These jabronis had no hope.
The problem is that all of this was excusable when they were the only game in town.
5 years ago if you wanted a luxury EV, it was Tesla or nothing.
Today you have options from almost every single luxury car manufacturer at basically every price-point Tesla sells cars at.
IMHO you have to be insane to consider the Tesla over a more established brand that will deliver an actual luxury car.
I still love driving the car but yeah, quality is crap and having the CEO go full fascist MAGA means the next EV isn't going to be a Tesla.
Mine had paint missing and a lot of gaps that took weeks to somewhat fix before I took delivery.
Since then I've had the glove box break, the charge port cover stopped closing correctly, the AC actuators break, the AC system vibrate so badly it was setting off the alarm when cabin overheat was enabled, the driver side mirror panel start to separate from the frame causing a whistle, and other issues including a unknown rattle in the dash.
Musk's love affair with MAGA morons is going to fuck him over.
He's not going to be able to afford apartheid Twitter by pissing of his Tesla customer base and I don't see MAGA conservative buying his cybertruck and Tesla branded truck nuts anytime soon.
He needs to return the public money he took from government handouts but other than that he can keep whatever is left after the collapse of Tesla (and the inevitable fall of everything else that the Ponzi is propping up) and then he can fuck off.
Given that his narcissism exceeds his intelligence he is a target for manipulation - the consequences of which may be catastrophic.
