6 months later, in the basement of some government building, a worker is seen pushing a button once every minute on the minute.
Coincidentally, once a minute, every minute, a missile has been hitting Putins last known location.
I'm pretty sure if a Russian missile landed near Biden's hotel, B-2 bombers will be flying all over Moscow the next day.
Yeah, but all it takes is one drunk Russian missile operator launching something to Kyiv while he's half-asleep.
I bet Russian communication lines were busy with "ya'll motherfuckers get your hands off the goddamned launch button right now!
".
Right.
It would not be an 80's era vision of total global destruction.
But a few of Russia's ICBMs would launch and a few of those would deliver working payloads to the US and probably some other places.
That would probably destroy a few cities and kill hundreds of thousands or millions of Americans.
It would probably be back to stonage for humanity.
I do not see them going down without fighting.there is a good reason why everyone was so pissed off on Zelensky when he tried to claim that Russian missiles hit Poland while it were Ukrainians.
No one here or Russia wants direct war.
Both knows the risk of it going nuclear.
