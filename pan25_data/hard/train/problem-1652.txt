Kinda like Ticketmaster doesn’t maintain a monopoly on tickets, they just bought all the largest venues and exclusively sell the tickets of said venues.
In this case, video games are exclusive IP and a consolidation leads to monopoly pricing and less competition in the market.
I’m guessing the only reason you don’t care is you don’t purchase many video games.
I know it is easy to hate on Microsoft, but aim that hate toward Sony if you want things to get better for all gamers.
To me, Sony has been working for decades to keep games (and gamers) from other consoles.
The fact that they are now mad that Microsoft is buying up game developers to counteract this long standing model of Sony exclusivity is almost laughable, and I hope it doesn't ruin Microsoft's purchase of Activision.
I will bet Microsoft won't be as heavy handed with exclusive titles as Sony has been since the 1990s.
Sony is the one acting in bad faith here, and they have already made more gamers "lose out" than this Microsoft/Activision deal ever could.
Exclusives are bad for gamers, just because other companies are doing bad things doesn't mean we should cheer on Microsoft attempting to set up the same bullshit for itself.
