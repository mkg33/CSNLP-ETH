Yep, at this point you can make damn near anything a credible threat as long as it has a 120mm+ gun and you can figure out how to cram a modern stabilizer/fcs/optics into it.
Aside from slapping ERA onto it, though, there's not a ton you can do to increase survivability though... That's the point where things like the Challenger 2 or the Abrams shine...
All of the crispy fresh western tanks are in addition to that constant drip feed of upgraded Soviet armor.
They tend to have effective ranges that outclass Russian made tanks, allowing them to suppress enemy armor.
They have better, more complex armor allowing them to survive infantry carried anti-tank weaponry far better (still a huge vulnerability however that is going to be a challenge due to the terrain).
The biggest thing is that they can fire on the move with pinpoint accuracy, which no russian made tank can do effectively.
Thereâ€™s a large gap in the capabilities, armour and what not of the tanks Russia uses compared to the ones Ukraine is getting.
Ukraine would be sending very advanced tanks against Russia, after Russia has already been depleted of their best tanks and tank crews.
That makes a significant difference.
