It isn't registered, but in Oregon all alcohol sales have to though a liquor store that is owned by the state.
If you want to buy out of state liquor you need to have it shipped to a liquor store where you can pick it up.
You can't buy liquor at a certain ABV at all in Oregon outside of liquor stores.
So nothing but beer and wine in grocery stores, costco etc.
I'm with the land doesn't vote crowd, but it is also a bad law.
I like guns and shooting, but unfortunately we have been proven time and time again we can't be trusted without some form of gun control.
We need good well thought out gun control and this isn't it.
This law is pick and choose who gets to own firearms by the will of police departments, or even individual officers.
If we can't limit guns we do need to have full registration with background checks.
We should fold Firearms control into the current "Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission" and limit private sales and treat gun sales like alcohol sales.
To buy even out of state alcohol you need to go through a liquor store in Oregon.
To buy a gun you should have to go through a gun dealer who can register and perform a background check.
I'm not talking out of state firearm sales (though I know I used that alcohol example) but private sales in general.
Firearm crime with cheap stolen pistols isn't the issue, It's the legally bought firearms used for mass shootings and other crimes which are happening more and more.
Firearm crime isn't from private transfers or legal owners, it's from stolen cheap pistols that end up in criminal rings.
Out of state private firearm sales is already federally illegal.
And to force private sales to go through FFLs mean that a registry would have to be made, which has shown to be usless.
