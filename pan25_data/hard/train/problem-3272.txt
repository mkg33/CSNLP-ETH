Trust between Russia and the West will never come close to even how it was back in 1990 within our lifetimes.
People don't understand that Russia is completely dysfunctional and the only way they function is that someone like Putin comes along and leverages that dysfunction around them.
“People think Putin ruined Russia, I think Russia was ruined before Putin was born and why he doesn't consider their losses to be significant.
Because he along with most Russians don't truly believe in the country.”.
It's an interesting proposition, I've heard that before: russians don't exist.
Most celebrated accomplishments are borrowed from USSR (ww2, capable army, space race, industrialization), but Russia itself exists only as fake picture on tv.
So most people have to deal with a given propaganda of accomplished nation vs trashy factual reality of their lives.
That fucks you up, it warps your perception and makes you jaded to most bullshit crazy stuff that might happen daily.
