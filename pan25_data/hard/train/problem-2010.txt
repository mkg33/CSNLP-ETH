Popular vote can be tyranny on either side.
For smokers the flavor ban is extremely unpopular and just makes their enjoyment worse while not impacting consumption.
You cant burn and smoke something without major health impacts long term.
Yes 200 cigs a day is worse then a joint once a night, and no they dont really normalize for that outside of self reporting.
Cannabis smoking has most of the same carinogens, you just dont have the wide spread study group as you did when nearly every adult pounded only tobacoo for an entire generation and every indoor space was filled with smoke.
First major paper on harm scale cites that a probable key factor on the data is the average tobacoo smoker smokes 20 times a day compared to a cannabis smoker who roughly smokes 2-3 times a week.
Just wondering as I've never smoked either but many people smoke a pack or more a day while how many do the average weed smoker smoke a day?
Probably not many but I've been addicted to cigarettes and never exceeded 4 a day.
Now I'm solidly at 1-2/ week when out with friends and that's an acceptable risk for me.
