Having spent time in Poland and hearing the most hideous opinions on ethnic minorities and feminists from the locals, which were offered to me completely uninvited, I'll shit talk all I like.
I’ve had people boast about how they respect homosexuals and women in Poland, and in the same breath insist Jews are out to take Poland’s money for Israel and Hollywood.
I had a good time when I visited Poland, but they gotta figure out what they want to be in the 21st century.
Poland is definetly not progressive, I really wonder where you have been hearing this.
Poland is strongly religious, and thats cancer no matter where you go.
Nobody but Poles like Poland.
Nobody forces Poland and Hungary to be members of the EU.
They can leave if they want to.
They don't though, because they're among the nations that benefit the most from membership.
Don't you think that it's problematic, in general, that 26 nations could want something but one nation doesn't and has the power to block the whole thing?
I think the purpose is that the eu isn’t a nation and that smaller members don’t want to be forced into adopting laws by the bigger nations?
