Trump took hundreds of documents when leaving office, then obstructed investigations and didn't return them when asked.
The huge concern is Trump refusing to cooperate and obstructing justice in multiple ways, and continuing to refuse to cooperate even though the archives can identify documents that Trump removed but that have not yet been returned.
That, for someone like Trump who was cozy with so many dictators, is deeply troubling.

I also didn't read that report until the end of the whole saga, and while there was no deliberate mishandling of classified material, classified material was mishandled and put at risk.

Important context missing from your comment: Biden did not have the authority to declassify documents when these would have made their way to his house.
By any definition they were stolen, and we do not know who had access to them.
