They have a proud history of rushing technology for the propaganda points.
Not properly testing the technology.
And it spectacularly failing.
(But scapegoating the failures 'cos propaganda).
Russia always spread propaganda about their greatness and often overstretched themselves to failure.
It's like there are cycles in Russia about bullshitting other countries into thinking they are all powerful until they believe it themselves and they try to invade a neighbor and then get their asses handed to them and they have to start over again.
Also, those events usually coincide with revolution/regime change.
Had Tsar Alexander and the war with Japan and the Soviets and their war in Afghanistan.
That would never happen in modern Russia, and it never happened in the USSR.
It also doesn't happen in China.
Authoritarian governments don't allow for that kind of open criticism of their mistakes.
Their willingness to endure undue risk is also what has led the USSR and now Russia down a lot of technological dead ends.
They have a serious problem with "rocket works good enough, why change?
".
Yes.
They don't have the funds to give weapons to all their infantry CURRNTLY ENGAGED IN CONFLICT.
They're a whole year behind their original invasion plan, and they aren't even arming the soldiers they send.
They haven't maintained their national army at all, and the army is arguably more essential for national defense than working nukes.
Nukes are only functional as a threat, they can't be used without ending every life in Russia.
The army is being used NOW, they've been preparing for this invasion for at least a decade, and it's a complete and utter shitshow.
A loss in Ukraine IS the end of their world.
It can't happen.
Losing to a much smaller nation, on the world stage, would be just as bad to Putin.
