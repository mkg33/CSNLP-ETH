I should think the maximum at stake here is whatever profits the audiobook made.
My bet: Trump gets paid off.
Not with the claimed $49m but with enough to justify the fuss.
But unlike most of DT's other lawsuits, this one doesn't seem nuts.
The person asserting a right in copyright has the burden of proving it.
And an explicit consent to use the tapes to write a book does not cover the very different product of selling the tapes themselves as an independent audiobook (isn't that what happened?)
.
Woodward might be liable for copyright damages.
So what else?
\-- The analysis is in the details.
What exactly did the contract with Trump say?
Did Woodward have a reason to believe (based, for example, on some statement in the tapes themselves) that Trump consented to his actions?
Yes, trump called Woodward to inform Woodward of information about COVID that trump had been told by government officials.
In those early days of 2020 when COVID was just starting, trump called Woodward and told Woodward that COVID was more deadly "than the most severe flu" and incredibly contagious because it was "airborne".
