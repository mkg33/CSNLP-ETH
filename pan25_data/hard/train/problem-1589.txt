For Crimea Russia used to issue passports with "issuer: Krasnodarsky Krai" (a neigbouring Russian region) instead of "issuer: Republic of Crimea", that's how EU can't distinguish passports from legitimate Russian ones.
This is what the EU is saying: The "new Russian territories" are Ukrainian land, so Russian authorities doing anything "official" there don't have any more authority, in the eyes of the EU, than a random dude claiming his house is a country.
A passport expedited by Russia in Kherson, according to the EU, hasn't been expedited by a competent authority of the city, so for all they care it's a forged one.
This isn't Russia being clever and avoiding restrictions, this only screws over the people that have passports issued in those regions.
Here the passport is deemed illegitimate because the country issuing them (Russia) is giving them to people who aren't Russian.
It's what I understood anyway.
You could get a passport in your embassy without any troubles.
No matter where in the world, so long your country have an embassy there.
It's not Canada who would be issuing you the passport, but the USA.
Canada would then grant you rights associated with that passport, according to the policies of both countries.
