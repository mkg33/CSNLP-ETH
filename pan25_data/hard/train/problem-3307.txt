⚡️The government of Estonia has approved the provision of a new package of military aid to Ukraine, which will include drones, winter uniforms and personal protective equipment for the Armed Forces Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said this at a press conference in Tallinn.
putin made several statements that Russia seeks to end the war as soon as possible while simultaneously noting that Russia will not increase the pace of ”special military operation” because that would lead to ”unjustified losses.”.
I feel like Ukraine should, after the war ends and they get into NATO, get an Aegis Ashore installation, especially since there's plenty of space in the country + it would be closer to russia for detection.
One theory is that the US wants Ukraine to have sufficient anti-air capabilities before sending any attack aircraft.
They're too juicy targets for Russian missiles otherwise.
This would put Russia's bomber fleet at risk; in terms of the remote air launched cruise missiles they're using to run their terror campaign against Ukraine.
Ukraine could theoretically shoot down the bombers, instead of the cruise missiles.
.
I mean, yeah.
Why bother with Cold War-era planes when there are newer and more capable ones?
Especially with the amount and types of air defense russia has.
