We massively stripped our policeâ€™s budget in the city I live in, only for our city council to quietly give them their largest budget ever 2 years later after they knew the George Floyd â€˜hypeâ€™ had died down ðŸ™ƒ.
A lot of our cops donâ€™t even live in the county they police.
They are not members of our community, they just come here to ticket and harass homeless ppl.
Most non voters in the US are far from â€˜privilegedâ€™.
They are ppl on the fringes of society who are struggling to survive and cobbling together the time and resources required to vote likely isnâ€™t even on their radar.
It doesnâ€™t help that Dems run mostly dog shit candidates who arenâ€™t actually talking to them about the one thing that would resonate: Class.
Young voters have been told gerrymandering is so bad their votes don't count but the people telling them their votes won't matter don't break down the nuance of how and when gerrymandering screws with voting power.
So they don't understand that gerrymandering only really affects non-statewide elections, that leads young voters to not vote at all.
The people trying to engrain this belief in people are doing it because if all the youth did vote, their(the people telling you your vote doesn't matter) party would never win.
What's infuriating about this shit is screaming/begging for this generation to understand why their vote matters, and they only realize when they're in their late 20s/early 30s that their vote actually did matter.
But by then, they've fallen victim to the system, or many of them have at least.
