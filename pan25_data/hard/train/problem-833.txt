Always remember that Nazis believe that having multiple enemies is confusing to people, so they have to link everything back to a single enemy - the Jews.
Hitler himself said this explicitly.
One of the first things the Nazis did in power was burn all the books in the Institute for Sexual Science, an early pro-gay / pro-trans research center in Germany.
the first ceremonial burning Nazis did was of the revolutionary trans research library and the hospital that conducted the research.
Anti-trans action is a gateway to Nazi style culture as it's a small enough minority that is disliked by enough people, and many people either don't know, or don't know they know a trans person.
So, it becomes an easy first step to get people to take into accepting or participating in actions they would otherwise find abhorrent.
Get them to accept this, then it's an easy second step to all gay people, then to antisemitism and racism etc.
And they call leftists the “violent ones.” We’ve honestly taken the high road with anti-LGBTQ far-righters and people who firmly agree with their opinions.
True, but the GOP ever since at least the 1980s has had something in common with Stalin.
Stalin didn’t need friends, Stalin needed enemies.
One can say some the same about the GOP ever since the 1980s.
