Where are those people who thought it would be a good idea to have a deal with Iran?
Do you think that none of this would have happened if the US wouldn't have pulled out of that shit?
Maybe Iran would be a US ally against Russia and just quit all its bullshit in the middle east?
Edit: the Ayatollah wasn't your sweetheart.
Unrequited love is tough.
I get it, but you have to move on.
I get it.
You're probably one of those dipshits that likes to say "Herp derp, we're a republic, not a democracy!"
while conveniently ignoring that a republic is just any form of government without a hereditary monarchy, and the US is a constitutional federal democratic republic.
And it's usually because you're poorly educated, but occasionally just because you're a liar.

It really amazes me how little people understand about international diplomacy.
Being allowed to do something doesn't make it the correct or beneficial thing to do.
You agreeing with some dipshit arguing no "treaties" were violated doesn't make the first comment a lie.
it may just make them misinformed.
But siding with dipshits on semantics just makes you stupid too.
It's ironic to call someone stupid for trying to stick with the facts.
You've also straw-manned the hell out of this discussion so I guess it was a waste of time anyway.
