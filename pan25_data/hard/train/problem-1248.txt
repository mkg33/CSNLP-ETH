One thing these Funds are doing now is buying up trailer parks and then they jack up the lot fees because they know most of the owners won't be able to move the place.
So it ends up becoming a situation where a retiree is now basically paying rent again and blowing through what little retirement they had.
Yep, they buy up a ton of them to park their cash and then coincidentally gain a decent amount of control over the rental market.
The more houses these.investors buy up, the less supply that is available to others to buy, so more people have to rent for longer.
The rich buying housing as an investment seems to be a worldwide problem.
One town in Canada has 90% investor ownership of condos with the province it's in having a 46% investor ownership of condos.
That would be London, Ontario, with 86.4% of all condos currently owned by investors.
I went to a sales office to look into buying a new condo there in 2019.
While I was there, some asshole in a G550 AMG rolled in and bought 40 of them all at once.
He was an agent for an investment hedge.
He asked me if I was putting down a deposit.
I said I just had and he offered me $25,000 plus my deposit back to sign it over to him.
Some investor-owners are just one person looking to buy a second property to rent out.
But many others are these funds with so much fucking cash that they can do shit like this agent I saw was doing, and itâ€™s just another Tuesday for them.
