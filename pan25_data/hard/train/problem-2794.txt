Trump has proven, time and again, that he's a fucking moron and is far from logical.
Did he hide documents in the casket?
Conventional wisdom would say "no, that's stupid."
However, because it's stupid it's within the realm of possibility of what Trump would do.
But this is also Trump, who's already done/said so many outrageously idiotic and astonishingly stupid things, so I won't be suprised in the slightest if it turns out to be true.
People have thought for years now, the Donald Trump political fiasco couldn't get any dumber and yet every few months we seem to find a new level of idiocy.
He has promoted dumb conspiracies, he's embraced dumb conspiracies, he's come up with a few dumb conspiracies.
I'm not saying that I think there are documents in the casket.
But what I'm saying is I'm not going to be incredibly astounded if they find documents in the casket.
We have not hit bottom yet.
It will inevitably get worse.
In that continued sink, looking back at the last years of insanity, whether it be pizzagate, porn star payoffs, pee pee tapes, or poop smeared Pelosi podiums, does digging up his ex-wife's casket full of classified info really seem that implausible?
