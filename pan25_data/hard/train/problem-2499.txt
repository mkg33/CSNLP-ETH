The Russian leader said, without citing evidence, that some people in Washinon were thinking about resuming nuclear testing.
Russia's defence ministry and nuclear corporation should therefore be ready to test Russian nuclear weapons if necessary, he said.
MOSCOW, Feb 21 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday delivered a nuclear warning to the West over Ukraine, suspending a bilateral nuclear arms control treaty, announcing new strategic systems had been put on combat duty and warning that Moscow could resume nuclear tests.
Russian President Putin has suspended Russia's participation in the New START Treaty, a nuclear arms control treaty with the US, citing concerns that the US might resume nuclear testing.
Cautioning the United States that it was stoking the war into a global conflict, Putin said that Russia was suspending participation in the New START Treaty, the last major arms control treaty between Moscow and Washinon.
"I am forced to announce today that Russia is suspending its participation in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty," Putin told his country's political and military elite.
