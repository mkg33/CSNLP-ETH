Why does it have to be attributed to malice?
Using the United States as my point of reference, I wouldn't expect people to be all that familiar with the details of our rather checkered history.
Most people probably don't know much about what we've done in Iraq and Afghanistan let alone the specifics of older conflicts.
Older folks would remember the Gulf War but Millenials/GenZ probably know next to nothing about it; I'd expect our young people to vaguely know that Vietnam was "bad" because it was a deeply unpopular major war, but I wouldn't expect them to know much in the way of specifics.
Asking random people on the street why Latin America has deep-seated resentment towards the United States is probably going to get most people either making up and saying nonsense or asking "Latin America doesn't like us?

Japanese guy claims government chooses what materials are in the textbook, therefore they know little.
Same video at 7:37: Japanese government rejects mentioning of their wrongdoings even in 2000s.
You're wrong.
How come so many young Japanese people, including the ones I've met, know pretty much nothing about their bad parts of history?
If they aren't erased like you claim.
Just read all the comments in these videos written by not only those who interacted with Japanese people, but also Japanese people themselves.
Did all these Japanese people go to those 1% of the schools that tried to rewrite history?
it's not some complicated math formula you force yourself to memorize and forget it the next day.
i don't see what speaking english got anything to do with knowing ww2.
their country was literally involved in it, and they just dont know...?
My home country was not involved in ww2 yet it's taught in schools and young people know about it.
so many young japanese people are just ignorant and their education system is a big part of the reason.
