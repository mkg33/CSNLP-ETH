That's not to say not anyone can create journalism by recording/reporting etc., but someone with verifiable credentials should be held to a higher standard.
At the moment, the media do (getting a Press Card is evaluated by various higher ups in several big media orgs).
It is in their interest to protect who defines themselves as press because they can demand members follow a code of conduct and outwardly say - these people have agreed to always behave like this (not just at a given moment), please give them special rights/access, here's how you know who one of our members are.
Being "press" (which has no formal documentation in the UK) has no specific rights associated with it with regards to arrest, charging, conviction or detainment.
What's yours?
Because he shot an award-winning documentary then he can't ever be arrested, even in the heat of the moment or when he's being obstructive, not following police orders and not formally identifiable as a member of the press (because the UK has no such identification, so I could claim it and then what would/should the police do about that)?
The chilling effect for me is every dickhead turning up to every incident with a camera, claiming to be press, getting in the way, and police being unable to do anything about it and then being accused of being too "woke" or whatever other nonsense is doing the rounds by then.
As you point out he wasn't charged with anything.
Because they determined that there was no reasonable chance of conviction.
But that doesn't mean the arrest was unlawful or even vaguely incorrect.
BUT - having a press pass doesn't mean that they should be treated any different to members of the public when it comes to arrest.
Accredited journalists in the UK have what's known as a "press card" to avoid that scenario.
The arrested man offered to show his to the officer but was rebuffed.
