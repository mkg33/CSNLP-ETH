The sad thing is that tmz does more actual original investigative reporting than the vast majority of outlets these days.
The reason you believe it is because you see dozens of news articles that are all substantially lacking facts and honesty.
This same article about Iran beating its soccer players has been printed for at least the last three World cups that I remember.
Each time nothing happened, people still believe it and remember it like it did.
The evidence for that was about as thin as the evidence for this.
There was no legitimate source for that story, but like this headline, it's clickbait and got a lot of attention.
One unnamed source saying something does not make it real.
Funny you bring that up, considering the claims that they were going to execute 15,000 people were also false.
This is what we mean by clickbait headlines.
This kind of stuff is just clickbait.
You just say "a source familiar with the team claims this" and you can print whatever you want.
The source of information in this article is Mike Baker, ex CIA agent whose claim to fame is appearing on The Joe Rogan podcast a dozen times.
These kinds of people just peddle in shocking headlines, not truths.
