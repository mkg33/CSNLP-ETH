Russia does not have a point.
They would love to convince as many people as possible that they do, but they don't.
I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and just assume you're naive.
Please don't spread russian propaganda and talking points regarding their murder of 298 innocent civilians.
This is precisely why your insinuation that the judge would be biased and just blame it on russia is so misguided.
After MH17 we wanted the truth.
To insinuate that because russia is our geopolitical enemy now we could nicely pin this on them, is incredibly disrespectful.
If you genuinely believe the downing of MH17 would be used as a political tool you really don't understand the effect it had on the Netherlands.
edit: Now that when you say the Netherlands isn't impartial, you're right.
But the parties are the people who died and the people who killed them.
Not Russia and Ukraine.
Not like you'd expect a different response from Russia.
We should just cut all diplomatic ties with Russia.
It's not our responsibility to keep lines open to navigate the war.
We're too easy to provoke because of MH17 and Russia deserves nothing but our complete disdain.
Even if Russia would go even more bananas and doom itself by attacking NATO, attacking The Netherlands would be one of the least strategic places to strike.
