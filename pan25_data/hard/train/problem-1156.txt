It's a good tactics of you know that your officers are shite, allows for success with army they have, it also allows for lower casualties on strategic level despite that individual attacks can suffer horrendous ones.
While it is true from military point of view, war is in the end about achieving political goals, places like Bakhamut have not much military value anymore, however they are significant from political point of view.
If we go back to Bakhamut example, if Ukraine inflicts disproportional casualties in this battle, it is worth holding, but also denying political win for Russia might increase infighting and affect coordination between competing Russian armies.
On the otherside, its advantageous to expose russia's losses whenever and wherever possible, to weaken russia and again, assist Ukraine.
Why wouldn't the countries supporting Ukraine, not sending top technical arms per person, night vision, computer sat, location and the marksmen take out the Russian enfentry like ducks o and a pond.
1500, 2000, 2500 meter sniper shots, all kills no wasted rounds.
Supported with barrage fire form cannons tanks etc..
