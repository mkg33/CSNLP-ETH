If this was about religion they wouldn't be raping women.
It's about backwards authoritarian regimes abusing their power and using "religion" to dupe people into supporting them and falsely target their opponents/"witches".
Many of the people dying to stop this madness are Muslim but people still miss this obvious detail and alienate potential allies against human oppression.
Every religion in the wrong hands can be twisted to something ugly.
This very thread started with a critique of Christians burning witches.
The only common thread between them is the evil people that twist religion for their own purposes.
Ban religion and some other tool will take it's place: nationalism, racism, fascism.
Sure, get rid of barbaric religions and some people will still be horrible people even without them.
It is extremely likely that less people will be awful if otherwise good people weren't encouraging to aim so despicable low.
When you aim low and miss you hit really low sometimes.
When you teach people that women are second-class citizens and are at least partially responsible for a man's sin because men have such weak willpower that God is angry at WOMEN for the man sinning, and you tell this to people throughout their whole life, starting when they are children, and you keep telling them that men can't control themselves - that is aiming so disgustingly horribly low.
That is the issue.
