They have conditioned themselves to believe that religion has a place in politics.
The connection to religion is the reason a lot of people choose to support the crazies against their own best interest.
The people who vote for Trump, Boebert, MTG are the same people who attend fire and brimstone churches, they want a candidate who reminds them of their preachers screaming at the pulpit.
They want to see people who disagree with them suffer, even if that suffering is also felt by them as well; bc they see that suffering as the will of god, not the will of the people elected into office.
Now it’s too late and they are stuck having to support people like Ted Cruz, Trump, DeSantis, MTG, and the like, bc those are the candidates who are attractive to a large portion of their voters.
Fortunately the US is moving past Trump, but De Santis is a younger, fresher, less hated Republican candidate who could very well attract votes from moderates (something Trump could never do).
De Santis really is a good candidate for the Republican party, and is objectively better for the country than Trump (anyone is at this point).
I think Trump and Roe v Wade are the reason why Republicans failed to win large in this election.
Get De Santis for presidential candidate, and Dems may lose the White House in 2024.
And dems are going to have to deliver to those voters for the next decade or political involvement will decline.
the midterms were not won by moderates who were “turned off” by Republicans, they were won by enraged Millenials/Gen Z who turned out in droves for Dems.
does anyone really think Biden wouldn’t have gotten killed in the midterms had SCOTUS not taken away people’s bodily autonomy?
