This also implies that taking steps to keep your nose warm little help protect you from respiratory illness during the winter.
I thought it was because of the cold and bad air (pollution), but I currently live somewhere that gets way colder in the winters.
Also living in low air humidity isn't good for you either.
Your skin is dry, your lips get cracked, breathing through your nose becomes uncomfortable, etc.
Having higher air humidity raises the perceived room temperature, which is a plus if you're trying to save energy.
And in your office, you most definitely CAN do something about humidity.
Small desktop humidifiers work quite well on the immediate surroundings.
Completely wrong.
For one, forced air most definitely dries out the air inside, to the point of chapped lips,bloody noses, and wood shrinkage.
The more your furnace recirculates and heats, the drier the air gets.
I've read that viruses die 40+% faster in humidity of at least 50-55% than in dry air.
It's actually written in the paperwork on my humidifier, which I initially bought to also help keep us safer from viruses.
I don't understand why humidifier vouchers or something similar weren't ever even mentioned or suggested.
It's really a no brainer.
Second, it's COMPLETE NONSENSE that disease transmissions don't happen in your house.
That's the most asinine thing I've ever heard.
Disease transmission happens wherever there are ppl together and happens far more inside than out.
