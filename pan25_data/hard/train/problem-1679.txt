I hope so.
And then what, if Trump is still around four years later it’s gonna be a nightmare if they try again.
I want someone further left, and I’m hoping it’s not Biden and it’s not Trump but someone else we’re not talking about!
Idk who though.
I guess.
But in the US, the Trump signs are often in front of a shack or run down house.
Do you think those people know who Nikki Haley is?
Or have any affinity for Pence?
Trump told everyone Pence is disloyal.
That doesn’t bother a lot of blue collar white people.
A large part of the US is like a third world country.
Low education rates, blue collar workforce.
That kind of population responds to a guy like Trump.
Trump is very much like a leader from a third world country.
Lots of bluster.
No good ideas.
The current candidates who have declared or are likely to are too weak to coalesce.
Nikki?
No way.
Pence?
Total lightweight.
DeSantis?
Won’t join with anyone else.
Him showing up in Ohio to commiserate with the people who live in the town where the train wreck occurred was from the 2016 playbook.
It works.
He’s one of them (sort of.
).
This.
If they don't run Biden, they better run a good looking white Christian man in a hard hat, who served in Gulf War One, and likes to hunt..
