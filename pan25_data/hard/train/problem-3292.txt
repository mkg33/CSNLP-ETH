I believe people are just as upset about the planet, but where do you direct that anger?
It’s literally every corporation doing it.
People bitch about this because it’s a specific news story.
It’s dumb and misguided.
What a dumb comparison.
These kids are not destroying art to hide it or deny it’s existence.
The crime here is more akin to taking hostages in a desperate attempt to get the word out about a global government conspiracy that will result in billions of deaths.

Yes Great idea Let’s just ignore them and watch them die of starvation… that won’t create a spectacle or prove their point at all.
Let’s just ignore them just like ppl are ignoring climate change.
the reason "climate activism" gets dismissed/ignored so hard is because it's presented like we're 'killing the planet'.
lmao.
the planet will kill us LONG before we kill the planet.
the reality is that we may be making it harder to live our lives like we do now, and sure, that's worth resolving/working on, but at least be honest about it.
