I call out time and again that the fact so many cops respond together has to increase the likelihood of these kinds of outcomes because of groupthink.
As soon as it's 2-on-1 it becomes an "us versus them" situation, and the more cops involved the worse it'll get.
The situations escalate many times due to the interplay between the cops without the civilian even doing anything.
True, but there is an incredibly clear problem with American police culture of militarism, power tripping, and the whole "at war with the street" mentality.
Obviously there is also a huge institutional racism problem, but ignoring the former to group it with the latter makes it more easily ignored and harder to deal with.
And then obviously you add serous institutional racism, militarization, lack of oversight, terrible recruiting and training standards etc etc on top of it to create this crap show.
But a lot of those problems can't be fixed until the first one is.
Like why on Earth do the police need to be wearing forest camo?
However else you handwave away the equipment arguments around de militarization, its just ludicrous they're wearing camo for any reason other than fantasy.
And that whole "dress for the job you want" saying is a lot more serious when its cops dressing like they're at war.
And if they know who the bad cops are and have taken no action - they have no place on the job either.
This is a painful reminder that cops are not here to protect and serve.
Most are power-hungry psychopaths that became cops because they want to control and terrorize people.
