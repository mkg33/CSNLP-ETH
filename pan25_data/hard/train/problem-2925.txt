Have we learned nothing from Covid?
That also seemed to have a much higher fatality rate in the beginning from the data from China, but it ended up much lower, especially for young people.
I'm not saying we shouldn't take it seriously, but 56% is really exaggerated.
It's like people want the rate to be very high because it is exciting.
On Wikipedia it says "The reported mortality rate of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a human is high; WHO data indicate 60% of cases classified as H5N1 resulted in death.
However, there is some evidence the actual mortality rate of avian flu could be much lower, as there may be many people with milder symptoms who do not seek treatment and are not counted.
".
Yeah.
COVID just had too varied of an experience for the experience to 'reeducate ' these people on how serious it was.
If we get a pandemic of h5n1, maybe they'll be set straight for the next pandemic with what... 50% death rate, the original Spanish flu killed 10% that caught it, which is 50 million dead... 33% of the global population caught it which was around 1.5 billion people.
So 50 mil 5 times higher 5.33 times higher HIGHLY networked current population = 1,333,000,000 dead of H5N1.
