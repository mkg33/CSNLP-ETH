Americans in the comments going on about "NiCE gUn LaWS LoL" The reason this is such big news here is because this never really ever happens unlike the 700+ mass shootings in America in 2022 alone!
For other fellow Americans who made the ridiculous comments, we shouldn’t be saying shit considering we average around 100 moderate to major shootings annually.
Conspiracy theorists are wild man.
No one needs an assault rifle except police and military.
I’m not anti gun.
If u want to defend ur self or hunt, or ur just an avid collector, that’s ok.
Being able to buy semi automatic rifles as a normal citizen isn’t right.
So why is it that most of shootings are done with legally purchased weapons in hands of people with un-diagnosed mental illness?
That's why screening ALL gun owners would help.
Yet shootings and accidents keep happening.
Instead of your guarantees, why don’t we create a system where people are screened and assessed as “safe” gun owners?
Our gun control laws are strict in that you need a valid reason to have a weapon that can kill something, and "my own protection" isn't a valid reason.
Nah not all they're just heavily regulated now but it's not impossible to get a gun you just have to prove you have a reason to need one and self defense is not acceptable.
Gotta be like a farmer or a professional shooter/athlete for the gun events at olympics and shit.
