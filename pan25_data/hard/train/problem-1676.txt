I can’t even imagine what it would be like to have to constantly correct your speech for years.
Tbh, I’m glad we have a president who shows it’s ok to sometimes struggle with things.
It makes him more endearing and relatable.
I wasn’t necessarily talking about his speaking abilities when I said he was getting older, I meant more so some of the memory related things or the tripping.
I’d never make fun of him for having an actual speech disorder or impediment.
I will always say this, as someone who had a grandfather with dementia, trump reminds me of my grandfather.
Biden just reminds me of someone who is getting older.
Joe Biden himself could literally walk up to these people who claim he's senile and say the following:
That stated, there's presently no reason to seriously doubt Joe Biden will be able to serve another four year term.
There’s about a 0% chance that Harris runs in 2024 if Biden is running.
Unless something changes the political landscape drastically, 2024 will be all about stability in the WH, expanding the senate majority and regaining the majority in the house.
Which means Harris is lining up for 4 more years as VP.
She probably has a better chance to become President if Biden dies than by winning the Democratic primary.
The only two things I could really see pushing Dems to replace Biden is (obviously) his death or a failure to prosecute Trump.
