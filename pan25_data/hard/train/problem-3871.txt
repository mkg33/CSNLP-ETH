We already have open primaries (no need to register with a party) so either keep it that way or move to top 2/top 3 primary win system similar to California.
I wish California would adopt Alaska's approach rather than it's 1st in the nation, so head well up its collective butt open primary top-2 system.
Louisiana's approach may make more sense than California's, but I consider Alaska's approach to be the best any state has developed so far.
OTOH, you may mean that if Virginia Republicans had held a primary rather than a convention, Chase would have won.
Maybe, probably, but the state Republican Party stacked the deck against her.
FPTP or RCV doesn't matter when a state party is prepared to screw one candidate left, right and sideways.
Yes, it is a truism that if people still vote in a RCV election like it's FPTP, it'll end up with the same results of a FPTP election.
But what makes an RCV majority win any different than a plurality win in FPTP?
Somebody's 5th choice somehow pushed a candidate to 51%?
That person would probably be just only slightly more satisfied compared to losing in 34/33/32 FPTP plurality vote.
