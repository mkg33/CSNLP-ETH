Zelenesky is also way younger.
Putin is 70 and zelenesky is 44.
I've never heard of those two age groups fighting and the older one winning unless he's heavily engaged in fitness already, which vlad absolutely is not.
It's more like a geriatric with a little judo background and military training vs a middle aged man who is in good shape, Poutine would be done in seconds.
It'd be like watching a fitness instructor beat the shit out of a crabby old cancer patient, which in this instance, I would pay $200 to see.
It wouldn't even be fair, Zelensky not only is in way better shape than Poutine but he's like 20 years younger.
Yeah well a 70 year old Poutine being "well documented" as a success in anything over there doesn't hold up well considering noone in their right mind would dare put up a fight against someone who will kill their whole family over a hit to his ego.
We're also not talking about 3 skinny teenagers who have never been in a fight before either Zelenksy is a full grown man.
Granted he was an entertainer, calling Puotine a Judo expert is a bit silly.
The only person who’s beaten me in a fight is my jiu jitsu teacher who’s a 4th-dan black belt and only slightly shorter than me.
