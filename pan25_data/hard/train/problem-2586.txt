Crimea is an important military staging area for Russia's invasion into Southern and South Eastern Ukraine.
Russian military infrastructure in Crimea are legitimate targets even if you're Elon Musk and thinks Crimea belongs to Russia.
I'm pretty sure that Russian civilians will be civilly allowed to leave through the Ukrainian roads, if they are stupid enough not to do so once it becomes apparent that Ukraine inches closer to Crimea.
If UKR does push into Crimea, I wonder how much "score-settling" is going to take place, or if the international community is going to give much of a shit about dead Russian civilians.
I am sure that Russia will offer to hold another referendum if the situation at the front becomes dangerous in order to find out the "opinion" of Crimeans, who will soon be less than half in Crimea and show the whole world that Crimeans love Russia.
In 2014, there was a period when 3 currencies were used: the Ukrainian hryvnia, the Russian ruble and (unofficially) the dollar, it was an extremely unusual feeling, but it seems like the transition to the ruble went smoothly.
There is a lot to describe what happened in Crimea, but I will say one thing - the massive degradation of the entire economy and life due to sanctions, the local population as second-rate serves visiting Russians.
On the positive side, the infrastructure and roads have been repaired, but what's the point if the population is poor and scared.
