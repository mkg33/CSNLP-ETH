- Cuba takes the money in return gives Beijing a bunch of empty promises like many African countries.
Seriously, what’s China going to do?
Invade a country that’s right next to the US?
All China can really threaten is to stop providing money.
Is anyone even loaning to Cuba except China?
Don’t think they will lose much.
In the end, whether they can get loans is up to the lender.
The only thing they risk losing from defaulting and refusing to do China “favours” is China refusing to lend them more money.
But if the debtor countries refuse to give up the land and just declare bankruptcy, there is little China can do - and they suffer no real consequences because no one else was willing to lend them anyway.
Not to mention, there is no stopping another country from doing what China is doing, loan them money in hopes of influence ignoring the high risk of default.
China, which gets $Billions in ultra low interest loans by running a "Developing Nation" scam, turns around and loans the money to struggling nations, with nasty Gotcha terms hidden in the fine print.
