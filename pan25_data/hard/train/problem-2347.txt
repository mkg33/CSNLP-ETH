article said he was paid a daily rate.
you show up you're paid for the day.
you show up 5 days you're paid 5 days.
4 , 4 ect.
True salary would mean you're paid the rate regardless of the number of days worked.
The employee was not paid hourly, he was paid a set day rate.
Let’s use $100/day for simplicity.
The employee would be paid $100/day for each day that he worked, regardless of total hour amount unless stated differently in the contract.
A standard “day” in O&G is 10 hours.
Day rate pay means he would be paid the same on a per hour basis if he worked 10 or 70 hrs a week.
Over the last 10 years or so, the day rate pay system has been under scrutiny and class action law suites concerning overtime are ongoing.
Typically, day rate pay is for consultants and inspectors.
When I was a day rate employee, I was guaranteed 5 day/week pay and if I worked the weekends I would be compensated as per the rate.
Day rate means you only get paid for the days you work.
That's not how salary works.
That's what made the Court rule in his favor.
Finally, a ruling that makes sense.
How much a person makes is irrelevant.
Overtime is overtime unless another agreement was made.
Good for this worker!
