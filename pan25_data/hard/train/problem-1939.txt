I mean, your main candidate is running on a platform of "I'm the greatest man to ever live, and if you don't think so I'll fucking take everything from you."
that twice lost the popular vote - allowed him to 'pick' candidates that spewed the same message.
Defended racism, terrorism, and murder.
Undermined our own intelligence community, disparaged veterans, lied repeatedly - was caught lying - then doubled down until the next insane news cycle came around.
While the rest of the GOP makes it harder to vote, attacks everyone that isn't a rich white evangelical, outright says they're going to eliminate basic human rights after saying it should be a state issue, were very vocal about being pro-child rape and forced birth.
They're banning books and trying to further demarginalize groups that are contrary to their beliefs despite making up such a small portion of the population - while the party itself is jammed full of pedophiles and criminals, are they demonized by the party?
FUCK NO, they're celebrated.
Not to mention supporting some of the stupidest, openly racist, homophobic, and anti democracy candidates I think we have ever seen in the last 60 years.
Considering how close many of these races were I would hardly call it a rejection of Republicans more as a barely able to hold back fascists and Democrats had better not rest on their fucking laurels again.
Holy shit, it only took Trump massively flopping for r/conservative to actually be introspective for once, they have finally realized that their party doesn't appeal to anyone and only tries to make it harder to vote.
But now that they’ve seen all the maga candidates lose, the media outlets that control the opinions of the gop voters are going to feed those people anti trump sentiment for months and months, and so you’ll see a huge shift in opinion.
They have to, they wasted so much money on those candidates and they lost, so they need to shift their zombies opinions to a more viable candidate.
