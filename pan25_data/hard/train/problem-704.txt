They were partially conscripted, but, most importantly- they were officially watched over by the Ukrainian National Commitee, which in turn was created by OUN-M- which is directly celebrated in modern day Ukraine.
Today OUN-M is a legally existing organization in Ukraine, but it's been that way since 1993.
This last part isn't very relevant because it obviously isn't what it was anymore, but still worth sharing I think.
It's generally my point.
Modern Ukrainians aren't nazi in any meaning of the word, neither in ideology nor in values, but there seems to be a wide problem there with lack of knowledge regarding their own history and celebrating people and organizations that don't deserve being celebrated.
Once Ukraine is free from external threats it will most certainly go the way of western countries, of dealing with its past, but I think this has to be talked about for it to happen.
This is just a name, when it comes to SS Galizien- was on one of the bloodiest Nazi armies, yet it's receiving plenty of praise in Ukraine itself because it's goal was Ukraine's independence.
I'm a little confused since the 14th Grenadier Division (Galicia SS) was part of the Waffen SS that was founded by Nazi Germany and Ukrainian collaborators.
That was the badge used by people who fought for fascists.
Maybe they are not who they used to be now but the correct move would be to adopt a new symbol.
