Hunter Biden is the son of the President, making him a "celebrity".
There are people out there who will want to buy one of his paintings just because of the "celebrity" factor.
So long as Hunter Biden pays taxes on the sales, what is the problem?
The children of politicians will always benefit from their parent's connections.
So unless we are willing to pay the children of politicians a salary for doing nothing, that is what we have to live with in today's America.
Hunter Biden's paintings isn't going to worth as much once Daddy is out of office.
So this is the best time for him to cash in.
You cannot blame someone for rational behavior.
Which brings me back to my point.
Unless Hunter Biden cheat on his taxes on his paintings, then it is no different from how every other politician's kid makes money.
The problem is Hunter being a greedy shit and providing the Republican's with just the kind of thing that any child knows that they will happily exploit in order to go after the Biden administration.
If he had any sense at all he might have at least waited until after his dad was out of office to exploit his celebrity status.
