Since the Syrian refugee crisis began, there's been a large amount of social tension and unrest in Sweden.
Arab and North African migrants have been failing to integrate successfully into Swedish culture, instead forming ethno enclaves and parallel society.
He's doing this because as a free Swede, it's his right free speech, including burning the Koran.
He's trying to agitate and prove that Islam and it's intolerant followers have no place in modern Sweden/Western Europe.
Unfortunately, the violent backlash from the Swedish Muslim community is proving him right.
There is however a limit to how much contempt you can express against swedes, muslims and turks before it's considering inciting hatred against that group.
The distinction is drawn between the population group and the entity which is associated with them.
For example, it's legal to say whatever you want about Sweden and Turkey and to burn their respective flags.
Likewise, it's legal to insult any religion and burn their symbols.
Likewise, finding that someone burning a book is disrespectful...is your problem.
I should be able to freely burn any book I want.
I dont need to ask your permission, you do not have to watch me burn it either.
Nah.
If you are fragile enough to infringe on someone else's right and liberty then there's no argument.
The people burning the books are not forcing you to look at them or even think of them.
What if I find your religion offensive?
Should I, too, demand not to be provoked or disrespected?
Should I demand you to stop worshipping your God?
No.
That's how stupid you sound.
