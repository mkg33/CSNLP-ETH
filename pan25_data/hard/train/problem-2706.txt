True, but oil and gas have a uniquely direct connection to climate change.
They’re also hugely disconnected from consumers, so even if every citizen said “we’re not using your products anymore” they would just laugh because it would make no difference - for the most part, you have no choice.
Anyone who thinks oil and gas companies will voluntarily do anything beyond lip service for preventing climate change is an idiot.
Anyone who thinks oil and gas companies the ruling class will voluntarily do anything beyond lip service for preventing climate change maximizing profit is an idiot.
And no group of politicians in DC will ever get a large enough backing on any bills or laws that will force Oil Corporations to operate accordingly to climate crisis and prevent any further ecological damages….
The demons that profit from these companies fear green/alternative energy tech displacing their bottomline, but if anyone has the proper climate modeling, infrastructure, logistics and capital to really get green tech going, it's them.
