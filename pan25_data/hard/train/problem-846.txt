Also keep in mind that conservatives on the Supreme Court ruled that gerrymandering isn't a problem for the federal courts, and they might rule this summer that no court can hear re-districting issues.
I feel like the "correct" way to do it is a complete restructuring of the Supreme court, which doesn't require an amendment.
Very little of the structure of the court is set up in the constitution, most of it is given to congress to decide.
So they could, for example, combine the federal courts and the supreme court, and make any "supreme court" case simply be heard by a random panel of federal judges.
Technically it's still lifetime appointments, but it dilutes the power of any individual justice to the point where it doesn't really matter.
Or they could come at it from the other direction and strip the court of power.
The constitution gives the supreme court actually a very narrow range of cases they must be allowed to rule on.
And then continues:
Obviously neither option is going to be taken by the current congress.
And even the previous one, it would have required the agreement of every Democrat in the senate, and several Democrats (and every single Republican) like what the supreme court is doing and so are not going to act to fix it.
