The name Taliban translates to Student, because the founders all attended these radical schools in Afghanistan.
Yup, the Saudis literally export Wahhabism across the ME as one way to have cultural and political control of their neighbors.
I think he meant Saudis as a Saudi Arabian government, Osama has supporters in Saudi family (which has A LOT of members) but not exactly among most important ones, that hold most of the power.
While official Saudi government money did not fund Al Qaeda, much of the funding for that organization did come from the Saudi Kingdom and an overwhelming majority of the hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi subjects/citizens.
To say that Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with it was wrong too.
Osama bin Laden himself was from Saudi Arabia and his personal fortune came from Saudi oil too.
Saudi Arabia makes hundreds of billions off oil a year; the windfall from the spike in oil prices caused by the war already netted them far more than they're giving here.
(Norway OTOH ).
Anyway, with Saudi's enemy Iran firmly on Russia's side here, and Ukraine being in the position both to deal them a blow, and supply Saudi Arabia with useful information about Iranian drones that might end up in Houthi hands soon enough, they have plenty to offer in exchange.
