The point is that a lot of right wingers who support Putin are playing concerned centrists who claim that supporting Ukraine instead of letting Russia get a win, only serves to kill more people on both sides.
The Ukrainians are doing it with their lives to take down Putin, so the least that rich Western nations could do is throw a few Euros/dollars their way to support the war effort.
Even Obama went for a "reset" with Russia, Germany has been notoriously more keen to trading with Russia than caring about Ukraine or Eastern Europe.
Yes, Putin wants all of Europe, that's why he waited until his puppet was out of office and the West propped up Ukraine for 8 years, instead of invading in 2014.
Fantastic logic, based on this extremely intelligent comparison to Hitler.
But hey, warmongers never bothered with reality or seeing someone else's side, and now that the West is for the first time forced to look at a conflict instead of being the invading force, all of them are shitting the bed.
Quite hilarious to watch to be honest, what happens when the bully becomes so helpless.
