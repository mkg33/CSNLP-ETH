I do not like trump but it’s not a bad idea.
It’s a 100% effective method if you’re going to have the death penalty.
Electrocution and lethal injections both have terrible failure rates that result in needlessly cruel executions.
Electrocution and lethal injection are two methods that have the prisoner restrained.
Escape, dodging, etc are much harder to do.
How is it 100% effective?
A firing squad has 5 men with rifles, shooting at the prisoner.
Typically not all rifles are loaded.
And they are not standing at point blank range.
A miss is very plausible and a miss that is not immediately lethal is going to be massively painful.
Say they shoot and the guy is hit slightly off of the mark and his shoulder is now blown out.
He's writhing on the ground in pain.
What now?
Do you shoot him again?
Bandage him up and try again?
Let him bleed out?
No method of execution is 100% free of failures.
No method is 100% effective when accounting for human error.
Bullets miss, ropes snap, blades are too dull, etc.
Given how the firing squad is typically set up, it is much more terrifying for someone than lethal injection.
All you get with that method is a visceral thrill for the watchers.
It's not for anyone's benefit but the people who enjoy watching people get shot.
