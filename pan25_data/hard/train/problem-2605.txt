The thing is it was never their land in the first place.
There’s never been a sovereign Palestinian state that’s controlled the land that Israel uses for settlements (it was previously occupied by Jordan).
But I was addressing claim that in building them Israel displaced Palestinians or built on land that was previously inhabited by Palestinians.
The reason the settlements are so contentious is because they're seen (rightly for the most part), as a means for Israel to press eventual claims for land and extend whatever border they might eventually negotiate.
Some settlements are built by the religious right and are basically just there to cause trouble and antagonize Palestinians, but other are normal cities like any other in Israel, because that area does belong to Israel.
Some settlements are also located in places where there were Jewish communities before 1948.
Here is an example of one settlement: Jewish neighbourhoods of Hebron.
Jews lived in Hebron for over 3000 years.
After massacres of Palestinian Jews by Palestinian Arabs in 1920 and 1929, most Jews fled Hebron.
Last Jew left Hebron in face on invading Jordan forces in 1948.
Once Jordan was kicked out in 1967, Jews started returning to the buildings that they never sold and remained in Jewish ownership all along.
Neighbourhoods of such Jews in Hebron are called settlements.
A settlement is any Israeli city, town, or any other place where Israelis live outside of "the green line".
The green line is the armistice line between Israel and Jordan in the 1948 war.
Jordan invaded that area, and tried to invade the rest of Israel, but was stopped.
There were Jewish communities there who were expelled by Jordan and moved to Israel.
In 1967 Jordan attacked Israel again, and Israel won and took the west bank from Jordan.
Then Israelis started moving there.
