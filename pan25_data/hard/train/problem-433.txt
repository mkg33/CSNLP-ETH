It’s quite likely that if it turns out the lab leak theory is true that Trump will share some of the blame for reversing Obama’s ban on gain of function research due to the clear dangers it presents.
I personally believe the lab leak theory has far more evidence and if it’s proven to be true I hope everyone involved is held accountable, including Trump, Fauci, Peter Daszak and anyone else involved in suppressing the theory and coordinating in the cover-up.
This isn’t meant to be confrontational, I’m legitimately interested to see what evidence is so compelling that so many people are willing to completely dismiss all of the evidence pointing to a lab leak.
You’re absolutely right that an investigation needs to take place, and I am absolutely right that there is a lack of evidence to suggest that the burden of proof lies solely on the theory that it came from the lab.
Why would anyone wait for the results of a scientific investigation if you're claiming the fact is that it was from a lab?
So then why are you dismissing the lab leak evidence?
There’s been no evidence to disprove it, simply a blanket dismissal of claims for no apparent reason.
The scientific community doesn’t want the lab leak to be true because it’s a huge black eye on science if it is.
Not to mention all the powerful people and institutions that would be implicated if the lab leak gets proven to be true.
By claiming it is from a lab before any results are universally agreed upon, you have no actual interest in finding out the truth.
