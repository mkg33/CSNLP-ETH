You make it sound like the Russian invasion of Ukraine is the only thing saving India's economy from imminent collapse.
You're fucking up ties with both Russia and the West by trading with Russia, but continue saying it's an "Indian need" to do so.
India owes nothing to Ukraine, its duty is to its citizens first and foremost, and it's hypocritical when all those countries buy a lot more from Russian than India does.
Duly noted that India's needs include doing, as you said, doing a diplomatic favor to a in Russia buy starting to buy its oil in huge amounts, thus perpetuating the war it wages, destruction, and endless Russian and Ukrainian deaths.
Thank you for acknowledging that India buying Russian oil is simply doing the terrorist state a diplomatic favor, and not some sort of dire need that we've been led to believe.
In any case, I have yet to see one comment from someone who says they are from India who, in no unclear terms, condemns the war, and says that India should transition away from Russian oil.
