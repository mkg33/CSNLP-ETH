China has said they would come to North Korea’s defense in the event that it is attacked by foreign entities.
HOWEVER…they said they would not come to North Korea’s aid should North Korea attack another country first and be absolutely destroyed in the process of being invaded.
There would be no retaliation militarily if North Korea hit Japan by accident, only if North Korea was actively bombing them or invading South Korea would there be any intervention.
Act I: In the midst of increasing tension between North Korea and the rest of the world over Russia's assistance in bolstering their military capabilities, North Korea unexpectedly launches a missile.
Act IV: The Chinese government is faced with a difficult decision: should they respond with military force, potentially exposing their own military strenh in the process?
Or should they try to deescalate the situation and avoid further conflict?
Act II: As the missile flies through the air, various characters express their thoughts and fears about its potential target.
Some hope it will hit Japan, while others speculate that China might be the intended target.
Act V: As the dust settles and the full extent of the damage becomes clear, the Chinese government decides to respond with a measured response, avoiding an all-out invasion but still making it clear to North Korea that such actions will not be tolerated.
The fate of the North Korean regime hangs in the balance as the international community watches closely to see how the situation will be resolved.
