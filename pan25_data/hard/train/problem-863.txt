In the last Biden-Xi meeting in November, it sounded like things were calming down.
But since then we've gotten the Dutch and Japanese on board with tech bans and gotten access to more bases in the Philippines.
I don't see what the Chinese are getting out of these meetings.
I can't see at all why China would be enthused by Blinken's visit or why Xi wants to show "sincerity" or "good will".
Xi Meeting Blinken would be very much out of the norm and there has to be a purpose to showing "sincerity" and "good will".
I can't imagine anything coming out of a hypothetical Xi-Blinken meeting that would tempt the Chinese.
Nothing of substance came out of any of the Biden-Xi meetings then nothing is going to come out of a Xi-Blinken meeting.
Has any of the proposed US-China committees from the 1st (or was it the 2nd) Biden-Xi meeting done anything yet?
Your argument is that the Chinese wanted this meeting because this meeting was scheduled.
Your argument is that the Chinese wanted this meeting so bad that Xi was going to meet with Blinken outside of diplomatic norm.
I've read quite the opposite, that China didn't really want the Blinken meeting and that Xi was not planning to meet him personally.
It's the Americans that really wanted this trip and that China prefers to deal with Yellen of all people as an intermediary for economic issues.
