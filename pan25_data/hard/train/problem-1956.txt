I can't even take the rest of your post seriously after reading your last point.
Like seriously, did you not hear about \) or how about the \).

2) Supporting the war by spreading tons of misinformation online and propaganda towards groups that seek to undermine the West.
Also, this whole narrative about draft dodgers supporting the war is just propaganda bs.

You are projecting western colonial stereotypes onto Russia.
Usually colonies exist to benefit metropole.
In USSR and modern Russia state uses tensions between different nationalities to keep them all in check.
So sometimes minorities even get privileged position to give them leverage to suppress Slavic majority.
Chechens in army is a good example.
It's sorta like a reverse colony.
Destroying culture and language goes against this tactic.
Soviets rarely did this.
