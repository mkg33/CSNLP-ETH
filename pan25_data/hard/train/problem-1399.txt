No doubt the MAGA faithful give him a bad rating on a survey, but they are never going to vote for someone with a (D) by their name on the ballot, so don't put too much weight on these survey results.
Yah so you didn't read any of my comments because you're taking forever to arrive at the point I did in my first one: election results go to show how much approval ratings matter.
Because you’re using approval/disapproval numbers to talk about how those 4 shouldn’t have won re-election when it’s the general election polling that’s most relevant to that.
So election polling captures voting intention, even in their approval rating question.
Polls like what Morning Consult does are much more accurate in capturing approval.
But you can see how much that matters when looking at election results.
It's very different from these kinds of polls, which just ask whether they support a Senator.
When this is done in election polling, they ask "are you going to vote for candidate A, candidate B, candidate C, etc."
And then later, or sometimes right after, they'll ask how you feel about these candidates.
Well naturally, the two will get conflated, rendering the approval question meaningless.
That's why you see the difference between election polling and solely approval rating polling like from Morning Consult.
Oh I see, you don't understand how the approval ratings polls are conducted in election polling.
You think there's a meaningful difference between approval ratings like this and approval ratings in election polls.
There is, but just in how the question is polled.
