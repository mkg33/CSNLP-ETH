It used to be imported here and sold cheaply but now since thereâ€™s no ammo imports allowed from Russia anymore prices have risen but people still shoot the ammo and stockpile the ammo all the time.
You joke, but around half of the ammo Russia produces is exported to the USA.
US gun owners are the largest single consumer or Russian produced ammo, far greater than the Russian armed forces.
With the US not able to import Russian ammo/everything else going on with global politics, its been a very long time since that has been the case.
Based on the surplus Russian ammo that you used to be able to buy by the crate, they used to be packaged in such a way that would ensure long-term viability.
However, the fact that we bought all that shit makes me wonder what they actually have left.
Back in the 90s my local shop had 55 gallon drums on the floor loaded with Russian and Chinese SKS rifles, they were $55 a piece or 3 for $130.
I bought a Russian Makarov with 5 or so boxes of Russian made 9x18 (with little red bands around the case mouth to weather seal them) and got change from a hundred dollar bill.
