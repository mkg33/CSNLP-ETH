Think of the wall like a mask if you will.
It's not there to be 100% effective, just 50-99% effective.
I meant it as they don't, ""work.""
I meant "political reasons," people don't want them to work because reasons.
Not 100%?
Totally broken, infective, and impeachable offense1!
Never mind more security infrastructure (ie walls and cameras) along the border was built during the Obama administration.
Walls don't work in America for political reasons, but everywhere else their purpose is to prevent and slow rates of crossing.
Nobody refers to the berlin Wall as an ineffective impromptu art piece.
It caused crossings to fall from 2.5million in 10 years to only 5000 in 25 years.
Obviously they do work, if the goal is to slow the rate of human trafficking and catch human traffickers, which I believe that to be the goal.
I have alot of beef with the current and previous administration, and a massive, single, border wall is largely unnecessary.
But a more strategic approach to border security, I think is something necessary.
Long term once there's peace and it's more about preventing/catching illegal border crossing, it could have a purpose.
