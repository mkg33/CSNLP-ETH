Not just a hotel - while he was President Trump used it as a second White House - holding official meetings and meeting government and foreign officials along with lobbyists and tones of other people that are supposed to be logged.
Biden’s house was - wait for it - his house.
It appears in this regard that Joe Biden is O-for-2.
Do you think it’s a potential National Security risk if persons who were not Logged visited Joe Biden’s residence and potentially viewed classified materials and were never recorded?
It’s really that simple.
Claiming that your company has standards to protect its infrastructure and that said infrastructure is as critical as anything directly relevant to National Security is asinine on its face.
Your argument is quite possibly one of the stupidest things I’ve ever heard anyone try to defend.
What a stupid thing to say.
You don’t have to have ever worked on any sort of classified project or have any level of clearance to understand that classified information is supposed to be limited to those with clearance.
With no Log of who came and went where those records are stored it’s quite clear we don’t know who has access to those records.
Whether you can understand that or not it is a significant risk to the security of whatever classified information is in those records, that’s so clear anyone can understand it.
