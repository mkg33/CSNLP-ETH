I can tell you, I went to Normandie 5 years ago and when they heard my french canadian accent some people stopped me in the street and at random places like supermarkets and the bank to tell me how grateful they still are towards Canada.
And not just old folks... younger ones in their 30s too.
''My grandpa told me about you, canadians.''
It was very moving.
From what I understand they've put the biggest $ donors.
The top 10 until this week was USA, UK, Canada and a bunch of EU countries.
Japan offered their 5.5 B$ 3 days ago; a new bill takes months to be designed.
Note how they are also thanking those who have been supporting them from the start by putting their flags along the Ukraine one.
Proud to see Canada alongside the USA, UK and EU on this very important piece of history.
Well in comparison Canada did alot more than most other countries.
Still not enough, but in relation to others it was quite stark.
But yes, it's not over and until then I hope everyone keeps the support up and the motivation.
Talking negatively about Ukraine's chances only works to hurt that support.
I think the prevailing attitude is that as long as the war continues going on this way Ukraine will win.
Russia gets weaker and more desperate as each day passes and as long as the west keeps up its support Ukraine will win.
Russia could send their entire population to Ukraine, but they don't have the weapons or equipment to do so, which means they'd just be sending people to a firing line as long as the west keeps Ukraine armed.
As a Canadian I wish we were doing more.
I feel like we have become apathetic when it comes to taking on bigger roles on the international stage.
Were capable of it, but the people in charge just don't seem interested in pursuing it.
Probably better if you got a job and fed yourself.
Do you have any idea how costly it would be to get food delivered from Ukraine?
And it would probably be cold by the time it arrives.
