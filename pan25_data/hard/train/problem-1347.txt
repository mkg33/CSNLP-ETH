I would call them a target drone, not a suicide drone.
The have a very low chance of reach the target and will just be used as anti-air missile targets.
But a 5th-gen fighter has a finite number of long-range missiles.
Once you’re done with them (and if you’re outnumbered 10 to 1, that’s gonna happen sooner or later), you’re left with a couple of shorter-range options, or guns.
Even though, if I were a North Korean pilot, after seeing my flight decimated by AMRAAMS coming out of nowhere, I’d rather turn 180 degrees and land ASAP.
Sure, but the kill-to-loss ratio would then be in the order of 15-20 to 1, IF their older planes are even able to lock on a modern, semi-stealth fighter and keep up with it in a dogfight.
Do it with 5th gen networked fighters like F-22s and you could swat them all out of the sky in a single coordinated volley, without them even noticing you were there.
A tactic I've read about is using the 5th gen fighters as eyes, and loading up 4th gen fighters with long range missiles.
5th gen fighters get relatively close and can somehow guide/ support the 4th gen fighters that just sling missiles from standoff range.
I think they might have even considered loading something like a B52 with tons of air to air missiles to play that role.
