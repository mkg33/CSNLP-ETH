You just have an issue with it now because the demographics are changing towards blue.
(tho if the republicans actually ran normal, sane candidates you would have swept the state.
Instead you chose crazies and lost).
Anything run by humans will have a margin for error.
Anything.
So when its close enough to be considered within the margin we check again.
I think in such close votes it's appropriate for a second count just to make sure.
My goal would not to overturn but assure the process played out what the voters intended.
Actually not every vote should be counted.
Not everyone should be able to vote, only good, Society contributing land owning folks.
This is the problem with the modern American republic, too many of these useless government leeching anti work types are getting to vote while the good honest contributing people fall behind.
According to the UN, 65% of democracies do not represent the core interests of the population and are actually corrupt.
This is why reform the votes and stop focusing on these corrupted arizona elections.
