In other words, when republican leadership is faced with the decision of cutting ties with Trump (and losing the Trump-aligned voters), or continuing to prop he and his MAGA-candidates up (thus losing the same voters they lost in this mid-term), they’re still better off, from an election-performance standpoint, if they support Trump and MAGA candidates.
If I’m correct, then the Republican Party falls back in line behind trump and we have continued normalization of this extremism.
I’m not naive enough to think it stops if trump is marginalized by the party, but putting an end to this cult of personality would undeniably benefit the country.
All Trump has to do is remind republican leadership of this, and they’ll fall in line again.
And then quickly get to work for 2024, jerrymandering / electioneering their way out of the close losses they had in 2022.
The first installment payback was 2020 presidential election, the next was 2022 midterms and the one on the horizon is the 2024 presidential elections.
I mean now that that overt racism and misogyny and nihilism is aimed directly at all the younger POS in the party like DeSantis.
