TLDR; The logic provided in the article is that runoffs are harder on those with fewer resources than those with the means to readily participate.
I.e., having to vote twice in as many months is hard on those in a lower socio-economic status.

That makes sense although they could just as accurately had said it dilutes the vote of poor people.
Yea I get that it's intent is to suppress the votes from poor black voters but it seems like it's an opportunity to change it to something good by pointing out this simple truth.
However, and this is a BIG asterisk, to this day Georgia's runoff election is designed to suppress the vote.
It's a runoff because they expect black voters to be less likely to vote a second time in a single race.
They intentionally restricted voting days and the timeline for this election, knowing it would result in crazy multiple hour waiting times to vote mostly in high population areas where there are more Democrats and more black voters.
So the runoff format is better, but don't let that fool you into denying that runoffs are still rigged to help Republicans.
