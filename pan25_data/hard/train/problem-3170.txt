Between 1936-1938, when the Soviet Union was not at war, Stalin had about a million of his citizens executed, including almost all of his top military leaders.
Russian dictators are very good at killing their own people, and their people are very experienced at watching it happen to them.
I can see Putin taking to live TV right now telling his people Ukraine is killing all their children for defending Russia.
Yeah, I 100% believe that Russia is evil and stupid enough to use their precision missiles to inflict suffering on Ukraine's civilian population.
Also iirc the Ghost of Kyiv wasn't something started or really even propogated by the Ukrainian government, and the only thing untrue about Snake Island was that the troops stationed there died.
Either way they both served their purpose as propaganda tools, to give people hope and endear Ukraine to the West in a time where those things were desperately needed.
And that's kinda the funny thing - Ukrainian propaganda is astronomically better than Russia's.
Looking at all the convicts that Wagner is sending basically unsupported across open terrain to hopefully reveal Ukrainian positions before they die?
I can't imagine it's too much of an exaggeration.
Those guys are literally just disposable human lives to Russia, it's sickening.
Is Ukraine also taking heavy losses?
I'm sure they are, yeah.
They're paying a heavy price for the defense of their freedom and sovereignty.
Just not to the degree that Russia is trying to take those things from them.
And I don't trust any government or media blindly, but I'll trust D.C. or Kyiv over Moscow every time.
So you think Ukraine's suffering 55,000 soldiers KIA per week?
Over a million KIA since the start of the war?
Even for a Russian bot that's exceptionally divorced from reality.
