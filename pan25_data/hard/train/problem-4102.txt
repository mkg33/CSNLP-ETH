Poland won't transfer the tanks without German approval.
It would not be wise to get on the bad side of Germany and their defense industry.
I predict Germany will approve the transfer since they don't have to give up any tanks.
And yes, I agree Germany will probably approve.
Lot of pressure to approve by NATO, German tank industry has the new KF51 with its 130mm cannon to sell to backfill allied tank stockpiles, and designs akin to the leopard have proven devastatingly effective against soviet Era steel-ERA hulled tanks like the ones Russia is fielding.
There isn't many reasons left not to release the tanks.
But there are so many spare parts for older models and Poland has been moving away from German tanks to American and south Korean models that they might not care if they lose support for their older models and are willing to risk it to get the ball moving twords europe supplying more heavy armor for their neighbor.
Kinda.
Nothing prevents you from physically moving em, but you do lose upkeep support from the manufacture.
Kinda.
But Poland has been moving hard away from Germany for awhile now.
Designed their own rifle (only ar18 derivative that can operate conventional and bullpup formats, it's interesting to say the least) and buying vast quantities of artillery such as HIMARS from the US (400 or so), so I really think Poland does not really care about getting on Germany naughty list like the rest of Europe.
Whether that's a good idea or not is another debate, but their actions speak "we don't care about stepping on toes, we find other suppliers".
