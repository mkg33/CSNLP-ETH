The right mentality, no one gives a shit about another 100k dead russian soldiers, not even the Russians.
We want to protect a bunch of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians from being killed.
The war is happening in Ukraine, not Russia.
Russia doesn't give a fuck if 1 million men are sent into the grinder.
Ukraine pays the price.
Don't get complacent on Ukraine.
Ukraine is taking heavy losses and the latest news is the tanks the west is sending won't be there until the summer at the earliest and there are MAJOR issues with the Europeans holding up their end of the deal.
Can they afford to?
Absolutely yes.
That is what people don't understand, that Russia can afford to lose 500-1000 men a day FOR YEARS and seem perfectly willing to torture their population with this war.
But is this because 'we' hate Russia or because you generally think soldiers taking part in an unjustified war are generally criminals and their deaths are deserved?
They wouldn't care about killing that many but how would an anti-ballistic missile defense weapon be used against ground troops invading Moscow?
Your comment doesn't make much sense.
It sounds like you're suggesting they would nuke Moscow to save Moscow.
Yes, but the missile system they linked to would be useless for that, unless that plan is to destroy Moscow.
Even Russia isn't going to nuke their own capital city to stop a popular uprising.
They didn't do it in the 90s and they won't do it now.
