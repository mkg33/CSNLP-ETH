I wish there was a way I could impress upon people just how effective Joe Biden has been as President; the United States' economy recovered from COVID much more quickly than the rest of the world, we got back to full employment sooner, heck, we even hit record low unemployment rates and uninsured (healthcare) rates just this year!
And it's not for nothing, President Biden pushed through an audacious recovery package, direct cash stimulus, and a moratorium on rent, and a moratorium on student loan payments, and the Child Tax Credit, and the result of all that government investment was that the average American had cash in their pocket before most of the rest of the world did.
I know Biden took over a fucking train wreck left behind by the previous administration and continues to work with a wholly uncooperative GOP, and even has gained some impressive accomplishments despite the facts, but I don't particularly see a reason to actually celebrate this news, but rather give more of a negligible sigh of relief, at least until better economic conditions emerge for consumers.
I don’t hate Biden, but I’m so fucking tired of every administration lying about how good the economy is just for good approval ratings.
There are homeless people freezing in the streets and a ton more folks being evicted.
People having to skip meals because they can’t afford to eat, choosing between gas and food.
This economy isn’t good, and it hasn’t been good since Covid hit.
The entire world is feeling it.
