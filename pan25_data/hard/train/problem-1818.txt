That would never get off the ground.
Government monitors online shit and any attempt at an organized general strike will be snuffed out.
It’s very illegal sadly and the unions can be busted for attempting it.
One of the only legal ways unions can be busted in America.
INSTEAD, now the bill that makes striking illegal has passed (knee-capping the workers from fighting back, and not risk losing their jobs).
Cool, then they would legally be allowed to strike instead of defanging a union when the workers are being egregiously mistreated by their ownersemployers.
“Refusing to cross a lawfully established picket line is protected by the National Labor Relations Act.
You have the legal right not to cross a picket line in solidarity with your own union, out of sympathy for workers from another union, or just to avoid confrontation.
By refusing to cross a picket line while on duty you are essentially engaging in a strike in sympathy with the picketing workers.
Refusing to cross a picket line is a legally protected act.”.
