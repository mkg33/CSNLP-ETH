Let's take it from our most famous executioner in the UK, hangman Albert Pierrepoint, who worked right up until capital punishment was abolished.
So the question becomes, how many innocent lives are you willing to spend to “upgrade” a murderer from lifetime incarceration to the death penalty?
In the USA, death penalty prisoners end up being MORE expensive than life sentences AND EVEN THEN they still end up with far far too many innocent people who can't overturn their sentence in the time death row gives them.
If you limit the death penalty to only those cases or stricter, there's no reason any halfway competent justice system can't deliver justice without spending more than would be spent keeping them in prison for 60 years.
People NEED to understand that their idea of "super-duper guilty" being a qualifier for capital punishment DOES NOT EXIST in the justice system.
Even IF that money got the error rate close enough to 0 it'd be acceptable (it's not, not even close)... Why should the state be paying extra for the privilege of getting to kill someone?
