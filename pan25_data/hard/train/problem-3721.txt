The way I see it, America doesn’t need to intervene here.
We just need to wait and Iran’s current regime will fall to a popular revolution by the end of the decade.
Intervening now will just give all of Iran an enemy to rally against.
The best thing we can do is keep protesting globally, sharing social media from Iran of what is happening on the ground there.
It doesn't hurt to call on any of your reps to publicly denounce the mass murders of protesters.
The best thing to do is anything you can.
Inaction/thoughts/prayers only help the oppressor.
Sharing what's going on in Iran, and sharing the social media of protesters, are all good ways to help from overseas.
I can also direct you to the Iranian activists and accounts to follow if you want to stay informed.
Instagram and social media is how we are primarily spreading information.
People to follow are Tara Grammy, Nazanin Nour, Nazanin Boniadi, and Masih Alinejad.
Accounts to follow are @middleeastmatters , @iraniandiasporacollective, and @from_iran .
But what many people seem to not realize is that this government does not rule from a place of law and order.
They are a shoot first and if you ask questions shoot you too type of regime.
Listen to Iranian voices.
Listen to the activists on the ground, listen to the people who managed to escape this regime.
Who are survivors of the torture houses they call prisons.
Not a single one of them is reacting with anything but abject fear and alarm after the Islamic Republic's announcement last week.
