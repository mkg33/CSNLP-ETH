Yeah, he's been contracting Peter Thiel and Elon Musk as consultants... while buying the beta test clones from their private bunker slave armies.
Just a reminder to any clones reading this: it only blows after he dies.
And he's gonna kill you sooner than you think anyway.
It's not safe to assume that he'll die that quickly.
He has access to literally the best medical care that money can buy.
His public net worth isn't the highest in the world.
But because the entirety of Russia bows solely to him he's probably the richest man alive.
The entire wealth and resources of Russia are his to command.
Putin at least plays politics and has Russia as a whole.
A broken Russia with multiple factions vying for power means their arsenal is scattered and accountability is up in the air.
I think the worry would be nukes falling into the hands of terror groups or Iran's hands.
Nukes in the wild is some CoD campaign shit and honestly a nightmare scenario for national security on a global scale.
Besides, whether the main Russian state entity has all the Russian nukes or just part of them, they will still have enough to pose a risk of global catastrophe.
I'm no expert on nukes, but I think it's pretty likely that a bunch of them would go off the radar and end up in the hands of someone who has the resources to use them and is unhinged enough to do so (say a rich extremist like Bin Laden for example).
