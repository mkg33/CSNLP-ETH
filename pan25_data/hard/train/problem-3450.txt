Apprently that class of ship was designed for 'pack tactics', paired with the flagship of their entire navy, the _Admiral Kuznetsov_.
Which just makes you wonder why the hell they thought sending one on its own was a bright idea.
Not that I'm complaining of course, I'm just explaining that it sucked at its job so hard because they seemingly willingly put it into a role it's shit at.
Which would almost beggar belief, but then you remember it's the Russian Navy we're talking about here, so.
That might well be true, but remember that Crimea was a part of Russia until the 60’s.
Even if that poll was representative (and as I say, I really doubt if), you can’t assume that the same feeling applies when Ukraine is invaded and Russian troops are going in to a meat grinder.
No doubt that Russians are dying en masse, but I'm doubtful about the accuracy of any precise figures supplied by any side, and this goes for any war.
I mean if we are taking into account civilian casualties since that was the main focus of most of their attacks, Ukraine's losses are likely much higher of course.
