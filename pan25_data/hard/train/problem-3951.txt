No, diplomacy don't work like that.
However, China does things smarter than India, acquiring knowledge to beat the west through technology transfer agreements, and indeed even building the very Boeings they buy on Chinese soil, whose workers and ideas are being used to build rockets and Chinese jetliners of their own.
If you think for a second that China's having Boeing build its Aircraft in China has not directly benefitted its production of and improvements to its Military aircraft, then you are officially smoking crack.
During 2020 the Boeing 737MAX fleet was grounded because the planes had a fatal flaw, so the older planes were being flown not because the airlines were poor, but because Boeing sells unsafe aircraft with single redundancy flaws that kill passengers to save money in manufacturing costs.
Yes the Max's have crashed (the Airbus not so much) but with improved technology and the minimal increased costs to operate a larger aircraft, it makes sense for most folks to take on the extra seats due to the increased revenue.
