This is my concern too.
Without the Democrats asserting their considerable leverage in all of this, then the "compromise" Speaker will undoubtedly be much farther to the right of McCarthy.
Democrats could positively prevent that, and get major concessions from McCarthy for doing so.
Why aren't they?
They need to brush up on parlimentary strategy.
Particularly if they could get some concessions from him.
McCarthy was willing to allow the Speaker to be recalled if any 5 House members vote to do so.
If he were Speaker, and beholden to Democratic votes to put (and keep) him in that role, that could be a serious win for Democrats.
I think the Democrats should agree to vote for someone like Fred Upton for speaker, if they can get an agreement that the only bills that will go to the floor will be the budget and debt ceiling bills, uncontroversial bills, and bills with strong bipartisan support.
McCarthy, or someone else who could reasonably claim to represent a coalition of Republicans, would need to come to the Democrats with an offer and enough goodwill that the Dems would actually believe them.
If the outcome genuinely starts to look inevitably like the Speakership will go to some MAGA moron who's far to the right of McCarthy, then why wouldn't the Democrats want to help put McCarthy into that leadership role instead?
Am I missing something?
Why wouldn't Democrats want to use their considerable leverage in such a way?
