You understand that the Americans are pushing heavily to shift away from oil right?
Why would they do that if it would hurt their currency?
They can threaten it, but there really isn’t any other currency that makes sense.
Perhaps selling to China directly in Yuan does but that doesn’t really hurt the US.
No one outside China trusts trusts the Yuan more than the dollar, especially given the delay in releasing financial reports last year.
Everyone else depends on a currency with enough liquidity, so the only other reasonable choice is the Euro.
Considering how strong the dollar is and will likely remain for the next few years, I’m not sure why the Euro would be preferable.
If the Euro or Yuan don’t make sense, I don’t see how any other currency other than the dollar makes sense.

The Euro hasn’t faired really well either.
It’s really a different world in 2023.
The dollar is strong and the US now has regular LNG deliveries to Europe, so there is even more incentive to trade in dollars.

I think the US and Venezuela are in a dance at the moment.
I am hoping that relationship is moving in a more positive direction.
