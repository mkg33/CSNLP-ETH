It’s really weird and somewhat disturbing to say but it’s amazing how successful the assassination of Abe has been in terms of what the guy was hoping to accomplish.
Completely brought to light just how much the government was in bed with the Unification Church which I think most Japanese people knew very little about.
Following the assassination the ties between the LDP and the unification church have been all over the Japanese media.
The public has been outraged and the government has since severed ties with the church so by as far as assassinations go it’s been remarkably successful.
This was something no one thought much of until after the assassination where surprisingly they are finding a lot of ties between the government and the church.
A person who felt their mother had been scammed out of all of her money by the Unification Church decided to take revenge by assassinating Abe (former prime minister) because he had given speeches and accepted donations from the Unification Church.
Abe was assassinated by a man whose life had been ruined because his mother gave basically all of the family money to the unification church.
He chose to kill Abe because of the LDP’s (the ruling party in Japan that Abe belonged to) long-standing ties to the church.
Abe’s grandfather had been instrumental in bringing the church to Japan.
So the assassin (Tetsuya Yamagami) chose to kill Abe because he (understandably) had a grudge against the church.
