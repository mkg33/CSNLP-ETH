What about the non white people who voted for trump, especially those in Florida?
Or are "white" people the only ones who can now be criminalized for their color?
African Americans have become more "conservative" in their voting.
Muslim folk from religious authoritarian countries, conservative Chinese folks, and on & on.
It's not just "old white people" voting for idiots, it's LOTS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS who also buy into the repub lies, disinformation, & the superstitious religious folks who are willingly turning this country into a repub dictatorship.
Am now done here.
Thanks for all the responses.
Thanks.
I guess I'm just hung up on the "newsworthy" justification that Fox wants to use to defend itself in court.
Airing Trump on Jan 6th would be newsworthy.
Can someone explain Fox's reasoning to me?
Airing "news" non-stop about the election being stolen was newsworthy because it was the President saying it.
However, it would be irresponsible to allow the President to speak for himself on live TV.
Please ELI5 how tf this makes sense.
