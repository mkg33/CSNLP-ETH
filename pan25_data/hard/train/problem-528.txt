It depends on the particular flavor of white supremacy.
Some might say he’s white if he has more Spanish than indigenous heritage, some of them don’t consider Jews white but are okay with Japanese people, some of them consider themselves to be “western chauvinists” meaning they believe western culture is superior but that non-white people can also participate in it, some don’t consider themselves white-supremacists at all their actions are ruled by unexamined and unconscious racism.
For example, Benjamin Franklin didn’t consider Germans white, the US as a whole didn’t accept Italians as white until well into the 20th, the “one-drop rule” only impacts whiteness not blackness in the eyes of those in power (Barack Obama), etc.
It’s also why white supremacists and Nazis target Jewish people, even though their skin is the same color — because whiteness is not defined strictly by color of skin.
I hope this basic explanation is enough for you to understand why a Latino with light skin aligns with neo-Nazism and white supremacy, as well as potentially prompt you to learn more.
Acting like he’s less of a white supremacist because you think something is ironic is just the exact complacency white supremacists crave.
White supremacy, like anti-semitism, is socialism for fools.
Alignment of hate and anger towards minority and target groups supersedes optics — which is why Kanye is hanging with a neo-Nazi.
Whiteness, and race as a whole, is a made up concept to create exclusivity and maintain power dynamics.
This is why the definition of ‘white’ is flexible and has changed throughout the years.
