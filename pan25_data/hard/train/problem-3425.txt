If it was a right it would be easily abused by Russia to colonize the Baltic States, Poland and Finland by flooding them with Russians.
Within 20 years they would all be conquered by this fifth column.
All those Russians who are escaping to other countries still support conquering Ukraine, they just want other people to do the fighting and dying part.
The russians seeing Ukraine as a "nazi state" fall squarely into the same category.
Again, I am in no way excusing their actions!
What I mean is that shattering that mentality would be insanely difficult with very small success rate.
If only it was easy as "getting people to stop lying"...
Once you apply that conversion in your head, all the talk of "denazification" and "jewish nazis" will start making sense.
People in Kremlin and on the street both legitimately believe that opposing actions of the russia makes you a nazi.
Understand this: for people inside the russia the ONLY meaning of the word "nazi" is "those who oppose russian interests".
I never said I agree with the Russian definition, just that in every thread where it is obvious that Russians are being actual Nazis people think Putin cared about the Jews when he was trying to "Denazify Ukraine".
Instead of facing the reality that Putin is to blame for ALL of thisâ€¦many Russians will be more than happy to use the continued existence of Russian Jews in Russia as their new ridiculous excuse for why their country is so fucked up.
