We are not closing farms to 'comply with EU rules'.
This is just framing.
We are cloaing farms because the biodiversity in our nature reserves is getting destroyed by NOx.
Which will be fine because the problem is that the nox gas production is very close to protected nature areas.
If the ‘gap’ gets filled in by others and therefore produced not right next to these nature areas then all is good.
This is the whole problem the netherlands has and it is the only solution to it.
Nice explanation unfortunately complete horseshit.
If you don’t know about a situation don’t act like you do.
The netherlands has a huge amount of ‘extra’ food that is exported since the government decided that we needed to be less reliant and therefore boosted food production.
So no there wont be any production pushed out of the country and ?transport costs?
also won’t increase and in fact emissions will heavily go down, as is the entire intention of closing the farms.
Don’t talk about things you have no clue of.
You don’t know a single thing about this issues and have no idea what the solution is.
And then you reply with the most basic, not thought through answer.
Do you expect me to take that serious?
