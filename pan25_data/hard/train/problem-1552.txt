This tactic of claiming Christian moral superiority has successfully worked for many, many generations.
And to an extent, it’s still working with the Baby Boomers.
However, it has significantly lost its appeal within the past 10-15 years.
Especially since the 1 reason why Americans (especially younger Americans) don’t go to church is because of the church’s negative attitudes and treatment against LGBTQ+ and women (especially reproductive rights).
Other that abortion and being anti-LGBT, which are not truly Christian values, name A SINGLE Republican policy or stance which is pro-Christian or AT ALL reflects Jesus’ teachings?
I’ll wait.
The topic of “abortion” and whether it is morally reprehensible is not specifically discussed in the Bible.
In fact, the church did not adopt the “life begins at conception” ideology until the 1970s.
Prior to that the teaching was that life begins at “first breath” ie birth.
Also, the Bible did not “condemn homosexuality” until an Old Testament verse was intentionally mistranslated in the 1950s during the right wing nuclear family movement of the time.
Even taking the verse at its modern face value, it’s Leviticus, which contains many teachings which are not congruent with Jesus’ New Testament teachings.
Why should Christian teaching be in public schools?
Schools funded by tax dollars should not teach or indoctrinate any religion.
Democrats are taking Christian teaching out of schools period.
Apparently our kids should learn how to change their gender instead of how our lord created our world and cares for us.
