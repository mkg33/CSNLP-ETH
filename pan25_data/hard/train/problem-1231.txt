Yep.
It's not as good as ranked choice voting, but it does allow for more moderation in areas that are heavily blue or red.
It does have problems though, particularly if a lot of candidates run from one side but not the other - you can conceivably have only two candidates from the non-majority party if there's too many majority party candidates splitting the vote.
Primaries where candidates from any party are on the ballot together and the top primary vote getters (sometimes top 2, sometimes more) make it onto the general election ballot.
Makes it possible for an election to be between candidates of the same party if they were more popular in the primaries.
If you did this you’d get a lot of national attention and might help bring the party back down to the ground.
I think there’s room for a Republican Party that likes to screw the people financially but at least isn’t socially conservative and also is pro voting rights and democracy.
The problem is that I suspect that a growing number of political figures are the right aren't interested in a functioning government.
And at its core, that's the gig.
Keep the lights on and the trains running.
We are in uncharted political waters.
And neither of us know the tolerance for the GOP but Trump feels like a paper tiger and someone is going to take his weak election performance and pounce.
I can see the crazy wing put someone up and a couple of Republicans decide stable Nancy is better than cooky MTG.
