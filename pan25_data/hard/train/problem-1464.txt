Fuckin hell, imagine running to the other side of the world to escape the Holocaust and the Nazi's end up fleeing to the same place...
"In 1938, the family fled Germany, traveling through the Netherlands, France and Switzerland before permanently settling in Argentina, the suit states.
".
Oh right.
Because the descendants are just chasing money they don't own.
100,000,000 dollars will do that to a person.
Their family sold it to a friendly entity, and never bothered to get it back.
This is entirely different from a normal seizure case, and the fact that you pretend you are on the side of the facts when you either omit, deny, or hide them is fantastically ironic.
You claim to be on the side of the facts, but have no fucking clue what the facts even are here.
They bought the painting a few decades earlier, and then sold it back to the same people they bought it from.
They survived the war, and they continued to have artistic dealings with the same person they sold the painting to for another 10-20 years, and the family continued to have a relationship beyond that.
If they felt they got screwed out of it, why didn't they ask to buy it back from their friend after the war?
Much of the art value of Picasso came after his death.
He was still alive, and it was sold during a ton of upheaval.
If the painting was confiscated then I see the argument, but it was sold at a low value.
I'm sure he didn't want to sell it either, so by this lawsuits logic, Picasso's heirs should recieve it...
Like, people all over the world today are forced to sell things below market value because they need to sell it fast.
