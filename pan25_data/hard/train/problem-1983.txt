Facism is the dictatorial rule of a central figure, using the forcible suppression of opposition and individual interests for the perceived good of the ruling group.
No, this would be fascism as the conservative government is utilizing the power of the state to punish a company for not following the dictates of the conservative party.
That is fascism not communism.
I ALSO said that there were cases of fascism masquerading as communism.
Which is what you are describing.
They lied about their beliefs and goals to gain the support of the people.
Else wise, they'd have actually done the things they claimed to support rather than amassing power and subjugating the proletariat.
I said that was my personal theory, and it is based on the decades of anti-socialist propaganda that has been rammed down the throats of the American populace.
Doesn't mean I'm right.
I don't even think communism is a good system, but misrepresenting what it actually is does no one any favors beyond the power brokers who see left wing policy as dangerous to their wealth and control.
Communism doesn't work because the theory relies on "If a person who's better than you comes up, its your responsibility as a communist to step down and let the better person led" which never fuckin happens.
While Fascism works great in theory because its "How the fuck did you let someone better than you get anywhere close to overtaking you?
".
