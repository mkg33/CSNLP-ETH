edit: sorry for an emotional outburst in other comments.
I'm straight up not having a good time right now.
"Pacification" campaigns, though, were conducted multiple times before WWII under various circumstances, in response to several Ukrainian uprisings.
It's not like Ukrainians always loved the Polish rule before OUN.
Also wanted to note that I love Ukraine and its people.
I literally fell in love in Lviv.
If I'm ever in your town, I'd probably buy you a couple of drinks, friend.
I'd probably share those couple of drinks with you.
I'm happy to see the friendship between modern Poles and Ukrainians hardened by the war.
I get it why some Ukrainians see him as their savior, after all he fought against the Soviets.
At that time he was the hope Ukrainians needed, a figure that would create independent Ukraine.
Unfortunately we know how it ended, their fight was in vain, and instead of an independent state all they got was a genocide and an opportunity to create a puppet state (which fortunately was rejected).
