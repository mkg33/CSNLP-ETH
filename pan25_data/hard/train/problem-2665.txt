Exactly man.
Exactly.
And on top of that, Russia, Ukraine and Hungary are top three of the world’s potash producers if i remember correctly.
Russia and Ukraine together also supplies close to 60% of the world’s grains.
If Russia gets Ukraine, Russia gets to control world food supply.
They can simply starve the world to death.
And Trump wants to stop giving Ukraine weapons.
FFS.
Trump is increasingly sus now.
Everyone knows that Russia and China are trying to become the new world order.
Russia wants Europe and China wants entire Asia.
But he wants to stop giving Ukraine weapons when Ukraine is clearly the reason why American soldiers aren’t deployed in Ukraine to fight against Russia.
It would end the conflict part, but the bloody part would go on with Russia imprisoning and killing Ukrainians that were just trying to defend their country.
It will "end" because Putin will quickly slaughter the defenseless Ukrainians, which tRump supports because the Ukraine leaders wouldn't give him dirt on Biden.
Take away Ukraine’s weapons, allow Russia to take Kiev and kill anyone who resists… problem solved.
Trump is such a stable genius.
