This is not true.
It’s not specifically about the oil, it has more to do with the hegemony and the involvement of the US government in the global switch to paper based currency after ww2.
In the late 60s the US was the country with the highest gold reserves and was owned a huge amount of gold by basically every major country on earth.
It also helped that the US dollar had replaced the British pound as the global currency.
The world stopped using gold as its reserve currency back during the Nixon Administration, so now all world currencies are backed by the US dollar.
Since the US dollar is the only dollar you can buy oil in, and our current capitalist economy basically runs on oil, the US dollar, and therefore all world currencies, are technically backed by the ability to purchase oil.
Now, a few times in the past, countries have tried to either sell oil for gold, make a new currency backed by gold, or sell oil for a non us dollar backed currency.
They are both commodities with shifting value, the agreed upon exchange will be denoted in dollars (or Euros maybe), not gold.
Ghana is not a big enough factor in the world economy for this to make any real impact.
The gold standard is undesirable for a number of reasons, not least of which is because the supply of gold increases by necessity much more slowly than the need for currency.
Also, the US still controls a massive amount of the world’s gold, so I’m not sure why people are speculating about this somehow hurting the dollar.
