Well you can see your lifetime contributions on the myssa website.
But your retirement checks will exhaust your contributions at some point even if you count returns or gains on contributions made, so youâ€™re using tax payer dollars to fund the rest of your old age.
Less flippantly, the way it's set up is that your money goes to pay for current retirees, and future workers' money will pay for your retirement.
The obvious way to avoid the future reduction of benefits is to increase payroll taxes (either overall or focusing on the rich) to bring the program into balance.
Congress could do this at any point before the fund runs out to prevent any interruption in benefits, or it could do it after the fund runs out to restore full benefits.
When the fund runs out, if Congress takes no action, then SS benefits will automatically be reduced so that the program is no longer running a deficit.
The last projection I saw was that the fund will run out around 2035, and benefits will be automatically reduced by about 23%.
This is a bad thing that would severely affect many seniors who planned their retirement around the full benefits.
But the reduced benefits will still be paid.
It's not as though when the fund runs out, the program will stop altogether.
