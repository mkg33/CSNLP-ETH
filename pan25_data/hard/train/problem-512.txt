Of course not.
But China also has no intentions of detaching themselves from Russia either.
In previous years the power could be seen as a little more balanced.
These days, its increasingly looking like China is the senior partner here, and Russia increasingly relying on China.
My comparison to China was moreso about raising a rival and not an ally.
Certainly, they're Democratic and I get frustrations from the past where the US aligned w/ Pakistan during the Cold War or the US having strong relations w/ the British who colonized India.....but that's precisely why I don't see it working out.
If anything, once the US withdrew from Afghanistan (a place that viewed India favorably and was anti-Pakistan) and let it collapse, there is no longer any reason for the US to care about this part of the world.
So long as Pakistan or India don't launch nukes or Pakistan doesn't sponsor some terror group that assists in a 9/11 type attack, it makes more sense to just let these nations be themselves and have no further relationship to the US.
The US should try to foster relations but, talking to Indians, they view it more like India is doing the US a favor lol and how they'll just use the US to become a superpower themselves.
Indian people admire US for science and technology, but has a pretty negative view of the US when it comes to politics/military.
NATO countries are seen as British Raj 2.0 in that regard.
So no administration will want to get too close to the US.
It will also hurt the strongman image of any Prime Minister, especially Modi.
Edit: A majority of Indians understand basic English words like Car, Bus stop, Hospital, School etc.
but not the language.
