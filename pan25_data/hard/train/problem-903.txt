There is very clear goal and end point.
Goal is to get Russia out of Ukraine and it will end once that is achieved.
Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan USA is not attacking.
They are helping Ukraine to defend.
Is the U.S. motive really to help the Ukrainian people though?
I think that may be how we perceive it as citizens, but I don't think that's why we're funding the war.
The U.S. has lately been more open about urging Ukraine and Russia to come to the negotiating table.
Some in the government and military are saying now is the time to do that, others are saying not yet because Ukraine has momentum.
Additionally, if this is truly seen as a complete failure to the Russians, Putin will likely be moved out of power.
The last I heard, Russia is not really known for their progressive movement, so his successor may be even more hawkish and threatening to the world than Pitin himself.
Well, Russia turned out to be everything people were worried about, Fascist, Imperialist and openly Hostile.
And Ukraine is doing the fighting and dying against that Russia in it's delusions of grandeur on the world stage.
Through this war they have effectively ruined Russia as a world power.
That counts for a lot for America.
