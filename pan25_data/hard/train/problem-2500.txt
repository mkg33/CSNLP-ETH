Wonder if the referees would have gone against FIFA, sure would have been interesting to see if refs from western countries ignored their instructions even if FIFA told them to give a yellow card.
Shame, honestly if all of them had stuck to it I think FIFA would have been hard pressed to punish them severely, they threatened to, but 6 teams getting yellow cards each game would have caused uproar.
I wish somebody had the cajones to challenge FIFA's rule, because honestly they shouldn't be able to just make rules changes that impact action on the pitch the weekend before games are played.
I feel like it is more of a case of them thinking that fifa is nice way to get publicity but they didn't think through what all will happen with fifa event so they are running around trying to force visitors to follow the same laws as citizens.
But you arrest a player and it immediately becomes a deplomatic issue and considering how UK government is getting treated they will try to farm it for all popularity boost they can get.
