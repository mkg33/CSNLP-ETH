The Democratic Party in general has seen a massive morale boost under him, and we're seeing more falling in line behind Biden's agenda, which is progressive as possible under current conditions.
Especially after the State of the Union, we are seeing Dems following in his footsteps and using the talking points he outlines to attack Republicans.
It is also why Democrats are so bitterly battered by Republicans so often: Republicans are blatantly a racist platform, and so get the greatest share of older, whiter voters.
Democrats MUST rely on non-rich non-white voters in order to win...
We are the social majority by a large margin, its just that voting majorities for both parties are predominantly old white supremacists.
And that is by simple dint that voting consistency falls mostly along socioeconomic lines, with SilentGen and Boomers owning over 80% of the money that runs through the economy, despite being less than 30% of the population collectively.
As long as Democrats continue to drag their heels about said progressive policies, fewer non-rich non-white voters will vote democrat, which more or less guarantees an inevitable loss against Republican fascism in the upcoming years.
The fact is, when the Democrats DO support progressive policies and candidates, they win.
But the DNC is more interested in hamstringing those few that made it through the rat race, than they are in expanding political influence over Red counties.
If they did they'd be blackballed by all the campaign staffers and PACs and elected Democratic officials they'd need to win any other race in the future.
As much as I'd like there to be more competition in primaries when there's an incumbent, it has historically hurt the party rather than helped.
It happened to Jimmy Carter when Ted Kennedy did it.
Pressure builds to differentiate yourself and become more aggressive with negative advertising which just helps the other party in the general election.
