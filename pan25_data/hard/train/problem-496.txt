Hyper power isnâ€™t an accepted term in geopolitics.
It was defined by a few academics to describe the post-Cold War situation of having a sole Superpower (especially one as dominant as the US was in the late 80s/early 90s) in a globalized world.
to your point, back in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Russia was considered a superpower, even though it was getting its ass kicked in every modern conflict at the time, and was really really REALLY ass backwards behind the times lmao.
Now since the war began we've all had a lot of people outside telling us that they know Russia better than we do, despite some of us being here since the 90s.
It's not impossible that the Kremlin will go bonkers and start conscription foreigners, but I've seen nothing to suggest that except rumors and click bait intended for western audiences.
Sure I wouldn't recommend anyone to visit if they can avoid it, but about foreigners getting conscripted?
Unless they are dual citizens, I'll believe it when I see it.
I'm a Kiwi living in Petersburg and there is a pretty big expat community here of people from all over the world.
We all have reasons for staying, some are just dumb like the Maga guys who are here because they like the politics, some are just totally nonchalant, and others like me have families that can't just pack up and move.
I mean, conscription has barely touched the big urban cities yet.
If you didn't read the news you'd never even know a war is taking place.
The nightclubs are packed, the cinemas are full, most of the western shops are still open actually and products available, prices still normal.
It's not like it's already some apocalyptic hellhole with army ripping any male off the street that they can see.
Like, hell, it's winter now and I still come across occasional tourists from Europe.
