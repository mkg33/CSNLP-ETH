The best part about this is the Insurrection Caucus members are totally seeing through this blatant vote-buying from McCarthy with a healthy dose of skepticism.
'Oh really?
You're able to give all of us ALL the committee assignments we all want?
You'll understand if we don't believe you, so we're going to need some insurance that allows us to tie up business if you end up trying to fuck us over.
'.
True.
But I really don't know who else in the republican party, that is actually qualified, would really want the job right now given how in disarray the party is.
It seems like a good way to end one's political career come the next election.
I'm not even sure if McCarthy could have managed it if there had been a red wave, but he's wanted the position for a long while now, so I guess he felt this was his chance, with no consideration of if he could do the job.
When he started his campaign bid for the position, it was looking like there would be a pretty decent republican majority.
Chances are, if that happened, he wouldn't be struggling for the position.
Since that didn't happen, he is struggling, and he put him into a position where he couldn't back out without saving face, so he went to work trying to promise anything he could to whoever wanted it, as well as try and drum up public support before hand by saying he was going to be all hard ass and do all these investigations the republican party apparently thinks everyone wants.
