Just a reminder that most of the red states get more from the federal government than they give in via taxes.
Also, most of the blue states give in more than they receive.
But a union made up of blue + purple states is going to produce mostly blue results.
And a red + purple union is going to mostly produce red results.
the "mechanism" you speak of is merely voting.
it would be super unlikely for a union of, say, blue + purple states to elect someone like trump.
A red + purple union is unlikely to elect someone like obama.
E.g.
a Cali, Oregon, WA, + Nevada union isn't going to produce the same results as a texas, lousiana, florida, + georgia union.
it is extremely likely that the two would look very different bc:
I don't think they'll attack us bc they are us.
Almost all of us have friends and relatives in other states.
Also, they'd draw massive global condemnation.
Lastly, again, they need the funds for the army and red states are poor.
Just imagine they institute a 10% flat tax, for instance.
They'd be struggling to get anything done, let alone maintain a powerful army.
At the same time, as much as I have serious qualms with it, robotic warfare is gaining ground and blue states tend to have the tech people.
but again, I don't even think it'll come down to warfare.
