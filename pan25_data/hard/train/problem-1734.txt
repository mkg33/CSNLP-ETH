They don't really even dislike homosexuality as long as they're also committing pedophilia at the same time... god knows the evils of two consenting adults are punishable by death, but apparently cool with raped children...
The fact that you don't seem to know where your politics end and your religion begins is literally what makes religion so dangerous to tiny child brains.
Just because the basics of religion were an outgrowth of human lack of understanding doesn't mean we have to keep them.
People don’t choose religion out of logic, and science/atheism/agnosticism is basically becoming the norm.
Empathy and caring for the suffering others, simply is something religion values highly, that atheism just doesn’t care for.
Nothing else we have is able to suffice, atheism and irreligious at its core can only turn people against each other because it’s all animalistic beliefs, it’s very nihilistic.
Atheism has nothing to offer as a pillar of support, nor any other irreligious faction.
Simply telling people to grow up is akin to saying “fix the gun laws in the USA”.
