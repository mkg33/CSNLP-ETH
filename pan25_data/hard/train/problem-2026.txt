Except for the one time he pushes back on the whole Biden presidential certification.
You have to give him, even if just a little, credit for that because Trump was really pushing him.
Unlike Ted Cruz who basically campaign that Trump was a piece and shit and Trump told him his wife was ugly and then all of a sudden, even now Teddy is still defending Trump lol.
Don't get me wrong, Pence is still in love with Trump, but he disobeyed that one time.
If there is one thing that will make Trump double down on something, itâ€™s Pence telling him to renounce it.
I think that, no matter what you think of his politics, Pence might be a savvier political operator than we suspected.
Note that Pence very well may not be aware of this dynamic, and probably still believes that God will pave the way for his presidency.
But that is almost certainly how the GOP is continuing to use him yet again: as a useful idiot.
Get used to this.
I strongly suspect that Pence's presence in the race is going to be used by the GOP only as a distraction against Trump's campaign.
Pence has absolutely no chance of winning, and Trump's followers already distrust him, so Pence can put himself out there to spar with Trump and drag Trump further into the mud while DeSantis gets to keep his hands clean.
Mike Pence twice had the opportunity to whip the votes in the Senate and get rid of Trump, politically, forever.
Pence chose not to.
Pence chose party over country.
Fuck Mike Pence.
