"Democratic Representative Dan Goldman said he wrote on Sunday to McCarthy, Representative Elise Stefanik, the Republican conference chairwoman, and Dan Conston, head of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a House Republican fundraising group, about a New York Times report that they were aware of Santos' fabrications before the November election.

Yes, it is.
That's the exact reason that there is a fucking process for the removal of a congressperson.
>Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.

Comer can express his own opinion all he wants, but it requires two-thirds of the House to remove a Member.
That's 292 votes.
I assume all Democrats would vote to expel him, which means 80 Republicans have to agree.
The article says McCarthy wants to leave the decision up to "the Ethics Committee and the voters."
The second part of that sentence tells me McCarthy doesn't want to use the House's power to expel a Member and will instead claim the only "democratic" way to remove him is for the voters to express their will (leaving aside the fact that the Constitution expressly permits each house of Congress to remove their own members with a two-thirds vote, regardless of what voters think).
