I suspect they’d do just the opposite and rule states have the power to provide universal healthcare—but any limits on the ability for residents of other states to take advantage of the program are an unconstitutional violation of the privileges and immunities clause.
Also, if in-state insurance companies try to claim harm from a state expansion of of Medicaid, all a state would have to do is cite existing expansion plans available, and simply say that there's a healthy and guarenteed market for them to access, if they want it.
Easiest way around SCOTUS fuckery would be to expand Medicaid to cover everyone.
Right now, the only federal requirements are that you have to be a citizen and reside in the state that you're claiming benefits in.
As far as income and other limits, those are purely up to the states, and with Medicaid, insurance companies are free to provide Medicaid plus expansion plans for extra coverage, if people want it.
This is why all Oregon should do is expand Medicaid and keep the coverage basic, until the country becomes friendlier.
Push the onus on the bitching insurance companies and the assholes by forcing them to offer Medicaid plus plans that would force them to take the brunt of it.
Well the health insurance companies oppose it so that's a sign it will work and be good for everyone.
