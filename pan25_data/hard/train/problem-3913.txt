I doesn't make sense that Russia did this on purpose (if they even did it in the first place).
You don't risk a war with NATO over something like this... Of course, the possibility exists, but it just doesn't make sense.
Doesn't really matter if it's Russian or Ukrainian stray tbh.
What matters is that it is a stray and not an attack on Poland, it's Russia's fault anyways since they attacked Ukraine.
Could have been fired by Russia towards Ukraine but due to a technical difficulty in the rocket / middle hit Poland instead.
If Russia is firing cruise missiles close enough to the border to even accidentally cause deaths in Poland, they're on the hook for the consequences.
Even if it's a Ukrainian air defense missile or the combined wreckage, it's still because Russia is firing cruise missiles near the border.
Not any different than stray Ukrainian air defense missiles killing people in Ukraine.
Ukraine won't hold it against Poland and will happily accept the extra security, no doubt Poland would be shooting down Russian missiles that would probably land in Ukraine but are too close for Poland's comfort.
Poland has warned Russia multiple times that it would not tolerate any stray munitions landing in Poland.
It would absolutely have mattered if it was a Russian stray.
Perhaps not enough to Article 5, but a step in that direction along with heightened air defense along the Polish border.
There can be political pressure for sure, but it's up to Poland to involve NATO articles, not the US, in this case.
