Yes, it was a requirement when I was in middle school and an elective in high school.
I think now they just want a completely dumbed down population.

.
While his 2021 salary was about $1M, he got $4.5M his rookie season because of the signing bonus system, and his salary this season is $1.38M.
Plus whatever sponsorships adds on.
I'll even surrender that his networth could now be $2M given that info about NIL, but in that case the page's "net worth history" would not be a progression from the $1.5M/$1.6M he has listed in 2018 and 2019 (when he was a highschooler), to the $1.7M he has listed for 2020 pre-NIL, to only $1.8M in 2021 - the spike there would have been a lot more dramatic.
Edit: It could be possible he has a $2M net worth acquired after merchandising deals were allowed to certain players after July 2021, that would render a completely different income history than the one listed.
And the page doesn't even talk about merchandising deals, claiming "the primary source of his income comes from playing football at various championships and other matches.
He is also a recipient of several awards that have helped him earn money in the form of prize money".
I cannot find college football bowls that pay out directly to players, or prizes that carry a cash award.
