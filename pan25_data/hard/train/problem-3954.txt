Propaganda is a hell of a drug.
People are suggesting Ukraine give up so that no more territory is taken.
They can't even remember what happened eight years ago, let alone would happen 70 years ago.
Unfortunate that any promise made by the current leader of Russia is worthless.
He lied the first time and attacked again.
There's no reason to trust that he would not attack a third time in another 8 years.
The only terms that are acceptable would be if Russia were to cede back all of the territory, then have talks about what sanctions on them should stay and for how long.
That's just the baseline, the negotiations should really be about what sanctions stay on Russia and for how long.
If Russia wants to negotiate, they can negotiate that.
If the baseline can't even be accomplished, you can't trust Russia to not invade a third time and any deal would be worth less than the paper it's printed on.
I agree with you Russia isn't going to win this war, but if you think all THAT is going to happen...
I don't really know what to tell you.
I would be incredibly surprised if when peace talks actually pick up Crimea even really comes up in discussions, let alone any reparations at all.
Both countries are hurting pretty badly, and their grand ambitions (for Russia, capturing Kiev, and for Ukraine, retaking Crimea) are just laughably unfeasible right now.
