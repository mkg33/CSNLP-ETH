A lot of big business is tied up in Iran for the Russian Jewish diaspora (and to some extent even Israel).
Iran is the largest portal to Russia for commerce in the middle east.
A stable Persian Jewish diaspora makes sense in Iran, and I think the business with Russia is the largest motivator to stay.
Of course, it's their home too.
Business/money.
Both above-board, and below.
Some grey too.
Energy is one big venture.
Another is Import/Export (of all sorts of things).
Jews (and Christian minorities) have a direct edict of protection from Khomeini that still stands (with sharia law compliance, as everyone else).
There are even represented in government, as there is always a dedicated Jewish representative in the Iranian parliament.
If anything, it's quite astonishing that in this heavy political climate, the people of Iran can clearly distinguish between the Israeli government and Jewish people (ethic and/or religious).
This does reflect on the people/culture of Iran, however neutrally.
That said, for the most part Iran treats most of its minorities (except the Bahai) relatively the same as the general population.
They enjoy pretty much the same standard of living as Muslims, but face discrimination in government positions (minority religions cannot be minsters, for example).
I don't doubt they rather live in a free society where they're not prosecuted and treated as second class citizens but there some things worse than living under the Mullahs, and that's not existing as a community.
I doubt they would survive an actual revolution.
