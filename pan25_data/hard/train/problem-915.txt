Well, because the pain of separating themselves from the nutbags now, which will be total electoral irrelevance for years is more painful in the short term than being totally irrelevant at some relatively distant point in the future when their base has died and no one is replacing them.
Their only hope is to just rip the bandaid off and moderate in a substantial way and be a fractured and ineffective party for a generation, because they are just going to keep shedding old voters and they have so turned off younger voters with their insanity that they will likely never get them back.....I for one would never vote for a GOP candidate, I don't trust them at all, and anyone willing to put that (R) next to their name on a ballot, with all the crazy batshit baggage attached to it is suspect from the jump.
The scary thing is that they have to keep getting crazier and crazier to hang on by their fingernails as long as possible before the fall off the cliff.
They should've listened to Steele and shifted in 2008, but instead they chose to do the exact opposite and get on the Crazy Train.
They should be terrified of the future, they should be pivoting HARD back to reason and moderation, because they should have swept up this past midterm with the economy and inflation and a dozen other issues working against Democrats, but they didn't.
