Because it’s not a 401k.
It’s a safety net for all Americans.
We are not going to let the fools that opt out and then go broke just starve and die.
So no everybody pays.
That's just you, and you think your smarter than average.
Everybody thinks they are smarter than average, half of them aren't.
So you might win, and you might have friends that can bail you out if you fail, but just as many will make that bet and fail, and those people will be a drain on you and me and everyone else that exceeds any benefit.
Social Security is the single greatest government program ever invented in this country.
It's been so good for so long that you have no idea of the poverty that it prevents.
Conservatives and their ilk have been demonizing it and trying to kill it for as long as it has been a thing.
It needs to be expanded, the caps need to be bumped up.
It's great.
It doesn't have to be instead, and in most cases it isn't.
Pensions are much more like 401Ks than Social Security.
You really are ignoring the whole social safety net aspect of the thing here aren't you...
Ignoring the safety net aspect?
No.
I don't want it.
I'm planning my retirement as if Social Security will not be available to me at all.
If I could opt out and invest my SS privately in addition to my current contribution, I'd have a substantial nest egg and a strong safety net at 59 1/2.
I don't want to retire at 70 and be terrorized by politicians every 2-4 years while they use my money as reelection fodder.
It's really not that much different than my current situation.
I've paid into welfare, housing, food stamps, etc.
for 24 years.
If I run out of money and can't pay for food or pay my mortgage, those programs aren't going to help me.
I'd be so much better off if I could have kept that money and invested it.
