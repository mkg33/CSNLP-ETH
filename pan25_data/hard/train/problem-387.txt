Technically, yeah.
The West is largely responsible for total, historical CO2 emissions (by virtue of being richest and first to have the new technology).
So, technically yes.
That's true.
By that point it's just "fucking cold as shit" and that's that.
I hate going inside afterwards because my glasses fog up.
And breathing in the warm air seems like it's burning the inside of your nose for a few minutes.
Fun fact: Their coldest recorded temp was -71 C, back in 1924.
Ok, maybe not a fun fact for them.
I don't want to even imagine what that felt like.
I've been in -35 C and that was unpleasant enough.
Jet streams (which do shift, they've not static), warm or cold fronts in other areas.
Warm and cold fronts push each other around.
And it can depend on if the cold/warm air is wet or dry.
Wind is still the most important factor when it comes to perceived coldness I think.
2째C are more bearable than 6째C if the wind isn't there @ 2째C while it is @ 6째C !
No, but also no one would say a 100F/38C day is only 10% warmer than a 50F/10C day.
It may be scientifically correct, but too unintuitive for normal conversation.
Similar in the other direction with these heat domes, with high pressure areas basically trapped by a squiggly polar vortex.
The BC/WA 45C heatwave, West-Europe's 40C heatwaves or the extremely warm NYE.
Personally I'd pick 71F/22C as a baseline for everyday speech as that is a temperature you don't feel as warm or cold generally.
100F is feels 3 times hotter than 80F, and 0F is feels 5 times colder than 55F.
