For all we know, all of this stuff was packed up and sent to these locations when his VP office was being cleaned out to get the office ready for Pence.
I don’t think there’s any evidence so far that Biden knew that he was in possession of theses documents or had anything to do with packing and moving them.
I do see people pointing out the false equivalencies being made between this and the Trump document issue.
Outside of a few kooks on social media, where are all the mainstream Democrats screaming that this is a witch-hunt and that Biden is being targeted by deep state agents in the DOJ?
Do you honestly think the Democratically held Senate would remove Biden from office over a disingenuous right wing taking point?
It's not going to happen.
I got a better one: Biden knows he's innocent and has laid a trap for right wing media ahead of announcing his shoe in reelection campaign.
Blunting any potential criticism 2 years ahead of time to clear the air and inoculate himself from crazy conspiracies here on out!
