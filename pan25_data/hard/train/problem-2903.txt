The Soviet Union sympathised with the East Pakistanis, and supported the Indian Army and East Pakistan's incursion against Pakistan during the war.
The Indian Prime MinisterÂ on 27 March 1971 expressed full support of her government for the independence struggle of the people of East Pakistan, and concluded that instead of taking in millions of refugees, it was economical to go to war against Pakistan.
The Soviet Union gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the United States or China developed, it would take counter-measures.
Russia is increasingly wary of Chinese influence in the region and uses India to counter that influence while maintaining a good trade relationship with both.
If there is conflict with China, Russia will be on the other side and this is the fundamental problem for India, not relations with the US.
Regardless a war between China and India, both nuclear powers, would be mutually destructive on most likely a global scale.
Therefore it's unlikely it'll ever break out.
