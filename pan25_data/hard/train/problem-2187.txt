Trump has outright refused to abide by the courts and when subpoenaed to get questioned, outright refused to go to the courts and is still walking free.
Like he SHOULD do it, but when the courts don't hold him accountable and don't arrest him for going against the courts, there's literally nothing they will do to him.
i don't see any way former guy doesn't get indicted for theft of top secret documents and lying to the DOJ about them.
it's a slam dunk case, and the facts are much more worse than many cases that have ended in a lot of jail time.
that's true for you and me but he's an ex prez and they have privileges that don't extend to the rest of us.
the problem with congressional subpoenas is there's not a lot of teeth to them.
not much is going to or can happened if they're ignored.
i'm less certain about an indictment for J6 itself, unless it can be shown that former guy was in on a plan to storm the Capital and stop the senate from confirming the election results.
yeah, i know, he said "stop the steal" and all that but he's like a mobster, he's good at signaling his intent while stopping short of saying specific action ("fat eddie's a problem for me, we gotta take care of the problem somehow, capiche?
").
Thatâ€™s not how it was said.
They announced they will not pay them if he announced period.
According to the RNC, they would not pay the legal fees anyone who announced a run.
