I'm not disagreeing with you but it bothers me that Dred Scott gets cited as often as it does because the 13th and 14th amendments invalidated the Dred Scott ruling.
No part of Dred Scott should be used as an argument for anything.
Just because Dred Scott had clearly bad outcomes doesn’t mean it was wrongly decided.
Unless you can explain how it was wrongly decided.
Well I’ll pretty much just echo what Taney said.
The constitution seems to have recognized a class of American (Slaves) outside of citizens were guaranteed rights.
These people and their descendants would not be citizens and thus would not have standing to sue.
Though I think he may have overreached when he extended this to all African Americans as at the founding several states had African American freemen, who were eligible to vote and hold office, so the case probably shouldn’t have effected them and their descendants.
Breaking state's rights was the requirement for a national majority to break open the petty tyrannies that the racists built - so the conservative faction has spent the intervening time installing their own judiciary to favor state's rights - and they have been rewarded for it with Shelby v Holder, which allowed the recent wave of voting restrictions targeting Democrats.
Dred Scott is still very relevant because it demonstrated that the Supreme Court was willing to enter the political arena, destroy hard fought compromises, and structure its rulings to deliver a win to one side.
None of that was undone with any amendments - judicial review still exists, and there have been no major legislative compromise packages after that case.
It wouldn't - both the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts require that the national tier of government impose restrictions on the state tier of government specifically to guarantee rights (political participation, housing, employment, marriage, etc) for groups of individual people whom the state tier does not not want to have such rights.
