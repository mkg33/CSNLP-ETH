What is the point of your comment and further more she actually addressed the issue of the Republicans being racist towards her and Omar in the press release that Rep Tlaib made.
Racists are emboldened by Republican dog whistling, not Tlaib condemning racists on her site, on twitter, or on a t-shirt.
Republicans undermined the impeachment process, not Tlaib putting something on a t-shirt.
Don't misplace blame for that shit.
MAGA Republicans attempted to overthrow our constitutional democracy to make fucking Trump a MAGA Qanon autocrat, and almost every other republican in congress refused to even condemn it.
Many supported it.
I want Democrats to be running on preserving our Democracy, and that requires pointing out who is working to undermine it (MAGA Republicans and the rest of the conservative cons).
I want them to reach their constituencies with that message and keep focus on it.
If they're reached by a tweet, a statement on her website, or a t-shirt, who fucking cares as long as she's working to get the message out?
What do you think she should be doing?
Sitting around stoicly and quietly frowning when someone says something racist or shoots up a house of worship or a gay club?
What do you think she should be doing?
Really.
Yes.
Tlaib immediately turned the impeachment of Fonald Frump into a spectacle and fundraised off the hysteria she caused in the media over her gleeful "impeach the MF!
@er" camera comments.
The idea that you'd want her to turn the entire effort into a spectacle to just shamelessly fundraise off, rather than do it, to SUCCEED, is mind-blowingly dumb.
