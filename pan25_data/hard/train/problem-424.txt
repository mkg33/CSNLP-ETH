Of course, once he got a taste of the power of the presidency, he wanted to keep it.
Especially because it gave him a shield against lawsuits.
However, on election night in 2016 I'm convinced that he was upset that he was winning.
I don't think he actually wanted to win even after getting matched up with Hillary.
His real "plan" was to lose and spend the next 4 years grifting off the "totally unfair stolen election."
He'd have gone on FOX and other stations (or even form his own) where he could criticize President Hillary Clinton's latest action and claim (without any details) that he could have done so much better.
No, the CIA officer they brought in (I forget her name) was a 20-year career analyst who would try to take a “cable news approach” to her briefings was dismissed from the WH because trump didn’t like her.
He called her “mean” and probably didn’t like the way she looked.
I can’t remember which book mentions it but this was the regression of his President’s Daily Brief (PDB):
I can't remember where I read it, but I read an article several years ago that this is what W preferred.
The interviewee said that people had to be very prepared because Bush asked a lot of tough questions and recalled related points from briefings that took place months, sometimes years before.
