An entire people that could have their own country if they just accepted Israel and signed a peace accord.
Israeli view is to keep slowly expanding unless / until there is a true peace accord.

Existing Israeli policy is a direct result of decades of failed peace negations and “bad faith” efforts from the Palestinian side.
I hope one day we’ll see a good solution for the Palestinians, but it won’t be a one-state solution and Israel isn’t going anywhere.

Israel has not attempted in good faith to negotiate an equitable & reasonable solution for peace.
Israel benefits from the current state of affairs because they have an excuse to steal more land from Palestinians.
