If someone comes in with a net to protect smaller fish, this is against the laws of nature, against God's plan.
They will rally against the nets and shoo away the people with spears trying to protect them.
If gay folks are discriminated against, it's not the place of government to step in.
If minorities are disenfranchised because the conservatives worked within the current system to do that, then it's nobody's business but between them and the disenfranchised people (who can't have a say, because they are disenfranchised).
If you are rich you deserve to be rich because your skills/luck/grit and determination got you that money, and the government shouldn't have done anything to help (although they did - infrastructure and oil protection and international diplomacy with trade deals ain't cheap).
So the government (a small fish) taking from the sharks is against the laws of nature.
Except the sharks also use the government to help them catch the small fish.
They say it's internally consistent but they are regulatory capture, rent seeking hypocrites to their core.
