Yeah.
Historians have reviewed the pre-war societies and concluded they were basically haemorrhaging money and manpower hand over fist.
Many of their governments were full of infighting, competing and redundant organisations in an attempt to seize more power.
They had to invade to steal resources and focus everyone outward, otherwise their society would have pretty much collapsed.
They then need to look externally both for more wealth (they've sucked their country dry) and for an enemy to blame the current state of things on.
Which then results in the aforementioned defeat by external powers.
Not necessarily immediately but at least eventually.
Russia is a good example, at least when it comes to the whole fear of failure ++ corruption.
It appears one of the major reasons their military is in the state it's in && they couldn't achieve their stated aims is because of decades of theft at every level by leaders and those same leaders not wanting to tell Putin the truth for fear of falling out of a window while dying of radiation poisoning.
