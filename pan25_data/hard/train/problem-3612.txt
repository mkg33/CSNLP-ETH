This is the United States.
Lawyers file lawsuits more often than they change their underwear.
They're not really intended to succeed, just get an injunction that hangs around for the years it takes a case to grind through the courts.
Oh, gun rights do exist, but the kind of gun enthusiasts who treat their guns as toys are the ones for whom those rights must be proscribed, because exercising our rights entails taking responsibility for their use.
If you're already starting out the conversation using phrases like "death-dealing toys" it doesn't really seem like you'd be open to the idea of gun rights exist.
The gun control on the other hand absolutely loves lawsuits that don't go anywhere but that's because they can cause financial damage to manufacturers as a overall strategy to reduce access or force the manufacturer to implement something dumb like an internal lock.
You have it backwards on lawsuits.
Gun rights people want wins to actually get their rights respected.
Legal nonsense that ends with a bad law still on the books doesn't do anything for them.
There have been victories for gun rights through lawsuits.
That's actually how most victories have been happening.
See the last couple of gun rights cases the supreme court ruled on.
Similar cases are coming down the pipe for assault weapon bans and capacity limits.
This particular law is going to have challenges as it's requiring a permit but not actually setting up or funding the mechanics to allow people to obtain it.
Probably also on the mag limits thing too but that will likely be put on hold pending the other cases about similar laws.
