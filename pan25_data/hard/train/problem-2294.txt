When the war started there was huge sympathy and admiration for Ukrainians in India.
I've seen that largely wash away to veiled contempt in last few months.
At least on Twitter and Reddit.
The reality is that more US and EU pressure Indian govt to stop Russian oil imports, the more oil India will import.
Second - no one asked India to stop purchasing Russian Oil, that's just a strawman that India uses.
"The west" (or the U.S.) asked India not to purchase excess Russian Oil (India told the U.S. to fuck off).
Third, if at the end of the day, India wants to be within Russia's sphere of influence, then just come out and say so and end the criticism.
If India would just acknowledge that they are pro-Russia, then you wouldn't have to pretend not to be.
At the end of the day, I just wish India would acknowledge it has a pro-Russia stance in geopolitics, rather than pretending they don't.
This currently nonsense is all about distracting from India's deference to all things Russian and it is something very very recent.
It's simply economic opportunism.
And it's going to not benefit India in the long run.
Except, as a while India is benefiting.
Certain groups of Indians aren’t.
And, to dispel some ignorance, Eastern and Southeastern Europe are in the same position: people who stay in the country work for pittance in sweatshop conditions.
In fact, research into my country’s sweatshops (not Ukraine but also formerly eastern block) place then on par with Southeast Asia.
It’s a tala as old as time: the disadvantaged are shitting on the disadvantaged because they are powerless to shit on those who exploit them.
