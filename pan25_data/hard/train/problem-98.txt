My choices are between hypocrites who want to reduce my quality of life to their own benefit, or the Chair of the Senate Environment Committee who brought a snowball to the Senate in order to disprove the existence of global warming.
A hard choice for sure, at least Republicans are more honest about their intentions when they say "Drill, baby, drill!
".
That is not what is happening.
Humanity has tormented its fellow creatures and devastated the natural world for a long time.
The vast majority of earth's vertibrates now are tormented in the food industry.
We turned this planet into a giant torture chamber.
Meat and Cars are two giant offenders.
Lots of other stuff we consume is also noteworthy.
But all I hear about all day every day is "uhhhg yeah we use some more EVs and build wind turbines" as if that was enough to even come close to solving the problem.
No.
And that means that all other targets are at best a "maybe", cause once we pass 1.5 several amplifying feedback loops will be triggered and we have yet no idea how severe the results will be.
Once that threshold is past, there is the possibility that even if humans stopped all emissions immediately, climate change would just keep going until all current ecosystems are destroyed.
Sure you can (and at least I used the key words probably and chance rather than talking in absolutes), about as much as you can quote "models" as saying that no level of warming will bring about the extinction of the human race.
Period.
