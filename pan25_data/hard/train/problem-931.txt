Nukes have trended towards lower fallout and lower dispersion in favor of more complete destruction of the impact center.
It makes sense, you want to make sure the bunker at ground zero is gone, you don’t care about the forest 10 miles away.
You want to take out the city center, the suburbs aren’t a priority.
But short of population attacks (which really are only useful on tier 1 cities) you don’t just fan them out and pepper one spot with them.
They’re individually targeted allowing you to hit multiple targets in a relatively close (couple hundred mile) vicinity.
So for instance, they’d probably chuck a few at the naval stations for some redundancy, same for Camp Pendleton, 29 palms, the airport, shipping port etc.
my local Target is likely not a target.
Most modern nukes (1970s tech and newer) also have an incredibly localized deadly fallout zone, which makes sense because fallout means you had an inefficient detonation.
Nukes have trended towards multiple warheads air bursting over a large radius for a wider area of destruction instead of dropping one warhead with a high yield.
I have a radiation detector from when we first started detonating nuclear bombs.
I’ll have to dig it out of the attic, payed a quarter at the local GW.
