We probably don't have that info now.
China goes to great lenhs to conceal the locations of all their nukes, transporting them between silos via a network of highly restricted tunnels known as the "Underground Great Wall of China" and storing them in underground bunkers designed to withstand nuclear strikes.
It's the foundation of their second strike policy, designed to make it as difficult as possible to do exactly what you describe without getting nuked back.
As former Military and one of the last to pull the trigger on a nuke, there would be no hesitation and this is where putin is wrong in guessing everyone will give in on the threat of nuke.
Honestly I'd rather die in flames than live in putin's world.
Fuck putin and everyone that follows that idiot.
These NAto BoOTS oN ThE grOUnd takes are absolutely stupid.
That's literally how you trigger a nuclear war.
For instance, you probably know that during the , the U.S. and USSR came closer to nuclear war than ever before.
But you probably don't know that if it weren't for one man, we would all be wandering around a charred, radioactive wasteland today.
And that guy wasn't JFK.
Nuclear war... Doomsday... WWIII... forget about everything Stanley Kubrick, James Cameron or (God forbid) Alan Moore ever mused on the subject.
Fact is stranger than fiction, and the truth is we came closer to nuclear annihilation than even the most taut Cold War thriller would let on.
More than once.
Taking this as the opening shots of WWIII (which they kind of were), Captain Valentin Grigorievitch Savitsky ordered the B-59's nuclear-tipped missile be launched in retaliation to the U.S. surface ships.
Had this been the case, it is likely that the U.S., USSR, Cuba and most of Europe would have had a full shooting-war on their hands, cowboy hats and all.
