This is true only if corporations didn't collude to keep these benefits from all of their workers.
Yes, this collusion is illegal in the USA.
But you can guess how many times a company has been forced to change it by looking at the cable oligopolies in the US.
Same here.
But in the USA it is not mandatory and most jobs/employers across entire swaths of industries don't offer it to any employees.
Especially the lower wage workers.

>The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not require payment for time not worked, such as vacations, sick leave or federal or other holidays.
In fact only a handful of workers in America have legally mandated sick days, it's something that needs to be changed nationwide.
The reason lower paying jobs don’t come with sick pay is because employers know that workers care most about the wage number and less about sick days.
Exactly But also please investigate ‘exempt’ employees who only get 5-7 days of sick pays.
No matter how much over 40 hours per week they actually work.
The congress/senate actually voted these policies into law All against the American worker.
This is not new And they still upheld these policy’s against the American worker Thanks so much to the representatives who have unlimited sick pay, paid insurance and a really nice retirement after 5 years.
I actually had to work 20 years for my retirement and health insurance.
But my retiree health insurance just went up to $810 a month, for a single person.
