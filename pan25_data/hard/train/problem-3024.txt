No corp is going to invest in Ukraine knowing their brick-and-mortar assets will be a big fat target for a drone-swarm.
Even if Ukraine drives all the invaders out of their lands including Crimea, Russia will continue with the drone strikes and cross-border rocket attacks.
They can continue the civilian targeting with drones and cruise missiles as long as they can maintain the stock, but that's not going to win them the war and its not going to bring down Ukraine.
Ukraine isn’t a static entity either as seen in how quickly they’ve progressed technologically with their long range and drone weapons.
Don’t confuse justice and mercy for inability.
Ultimately, “made in Ukraine” is whatever Ukraine and its allies declare it to be and Russia can’t do anything about it.
Once Russia is pushed out of Ukraine's borders, Ukraine will join NATO or an ad-hoc mutual defense treaty (for example, with the UK, Poland, and the Baltics).
Ultimately, Ukraine also needs assistance creating long range standoff missiles so they can help everyone else by de-militarizing Russia within a few thousand KMs from their borders.
Wipe out Russian airfields, army barracks, naval yards, production plants, and train yards.
