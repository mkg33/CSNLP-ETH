Soooo… according to the article, the Chinese army started scheduled training drills in the area this morning, and all of a sudden, fishermen saw a ufo?
The US just confirmed the others were balloons too.
Schumer said it on an interview on ABC this morning.
They haven’t blamed them on China though.
Not officially.
But he spun the announcements of the balloons into talking about China’s balloon spy program.
there are only so many times you can use the word balloon in a pentagon briefing before people start to laugh it off.
Ah the old "look we have spy balloons invading us too, so those other spy balloons couldn't have been ours."
trick.
Of course they are forgetting that they already demanded their downed spy balloons returned to them, the other day.
Yeah they weren't the same as the PRC balloon, however they were still balloons.
I don't see why the general would call them balloons if they weren't.
Already have read your article.
It states these objects are not similar to the original PRC balloon, however they are still balloons according to Schumer and the Canadian General.
