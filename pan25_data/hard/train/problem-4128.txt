So you know the history of slavery in Africa?
How so called slaves had rights.
And their children weren't born slaves.
That most of al slaves were captives of war.
That most western/subsara african economies did not necessitate slavery as most were communal socieoeconomical.
And that when Africas tried to cease slave trade with Europeans once learning the conditions of chatell slavery they would be either forced into slavery themselves killed or forced to continue to capture?
I already told you my opinion on Slavery, all I am saying is that in this day and age we were taught more of the Europeans doing slavery than what other countries were doing that took part or contributed to this awefull practice.
Yeah, but it seems strange to me that there is NO native African leader who pointed this awefull thing out and tried to get rid of the Europeans.
I dont think that this "but Africa and Arabs learned their lessons and are finally turning against Europe" is as sunny and bright as you portay it.
Untill this very day their are still slaves in those same countries, hell they even appear in China and India.
