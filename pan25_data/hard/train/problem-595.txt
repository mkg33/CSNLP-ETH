I don't know about that.
People said the same thing during the Balkan wars.
There was widespread refugees throughout Europe.
And yet when the wars were over the vast majority of Balkan refugees returned to their homes.
Refugees in most conflicts never ‘go home’ p. After the war they stay where they are or ‘move on’ to opportunities.
This was the case of Poles, Vietnamese, Syrians, etc.
now Ukrainians.
They will look to countries like Germany, Canada, Australia.
Germany officially has about a million Ukrainian refugees but that number could quadruple this winter if Putin keeps destroying infrastructure..
It wasn’t ‘free movement’.
Ukrainians need apply for positions etc just like an American.
It didn’t mean they could just decide to move to Berlin next week.
Now they can.
Many won’t return.
Ukrainians never had free movement to live and work in Western European countries.
Now they do without having to meet EU and Shengen block standards.
There’s no way, even if and when the conflict ends that countries like Germany can force them out.
