What an incredible silly take.
Illhan had legitimate critique of Israel.
Can’t be having that.
But they are just fine with outlandish space laser conspiracies.
No on takes the latter seriously.
I think the point was missed.
I’m not taking a position of the technical feasibility of weaponized lasers.
The point is, that racism is not the explanation for why Illhan, with her criticism of Israel, is shown the door whilst MTG is allowed to spread her claims about Jewish space lasers.
The explanation is simply that the former is taken seriously whilst the latter is not.
Those claiming it is based on racism are gaslighting and very likely serving the same masters as the republicans who showed Illhan the door.
Note the author of the linked article is a member of the Israeli tribe.
Again, her comments were not directed at the Jewish people.
Zionists bend over backwards to defend Israel by labeling any criticism as being antisemitism.
Not moving the goalposts, just pointing out that her comments weren’t anti-Semitic and no one in her party agreed with having her removed from committees for her comments.
Except that she isn’t anti-Semitic.
You are literally arguing with a Jew about what is and is not anti-Semitic.
How about you let us decide for ourselves what we’re offended by, ja?
Republicans openly admitted that this was done because their people were kicked off committees — for making direct threats against other sitting members of Congress and glorifying violence against them — last session.
