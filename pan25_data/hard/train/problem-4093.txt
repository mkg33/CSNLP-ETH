I suppose the best case scenario from the GOP's viewpoint is that the DOJ gets off it's hindquarters and indicts Trump, so the GOP can "support" him while not actually doing anything, which might let them hold onto the MAGA crowd.
The difficulty for the GOP is that Trump will not go quietly into the night; I think the best case scenario for them at this point is that the Justice Department immediately indict him on some serious and very ironclad charges, enough that the more online griftpeddlars like Steven "Dog Cum" Crowder, Smallface Kirk, Dim Tool and KKKlandace turn their backs on him completely.
I would expect Crowder to be the first to go; he's so utterly in hock to his paymasters that he'll go whichever way they tell him to (especially if there is dog cum there), given he has literally no positions of his own to speak of.
KKKlandace probably holds on a little longer than her boss, who's already shifting position, Dim Tool will pivot when the others do because he's really, really dumb and will just follow the herd...
I think Charlie Kirk might be the longest holdout from that crowd, unless we start looking at even more fringe wackos like John Doyle.
They're moving very slowly, arguably justifiably given the real prospect of violence as a consequence of charges, helped in no small part by Trump's only real talent - burying any attempt to nail him with anything in so much bullshit everyone gives up and goes home.
