>Biden aides have been sifting through documents stored at locations beyond his former Washinon office to determine if there are any other classified documents that need to be turned over to the National Archives and reviewed by the Justice Department, the person familiar with the matter said.
One, where the National Archives tells Biden all documents appear to be accounted for; then years later Biden's people volunteer the information that they discovered potentially classified materials in an office space no longer used and use due diligence to make sure any other unrecovered documents are found and turned over..
It's a very large failure on NARA's part that whatever documents Biden had somehow went unnoticed, but as soon as Biden's staff found them, they turned them over, and then decided to check every other potential location to sure they found everything.
Did I miss the “fbi agents needed to raid a place because Biden said he had already turned over the documents on multiple requests for specifically named files” in the “it’s not like trump”?
I really would have expected to see an article about that if so… would have been pretty pissed if I saw that….
Seconding the you should.
I recall learning in library class on the rather explicit need to do this in order to accurately read the news to avoid misinformation… and that was decades ago.
The thing I find funniest about this sort of response is how much it explains royalists.
The dude had state secrets in unlocked areas with people we’ve been in conflict with for decades having known agents freely roaming the premises and the response is “well the justice system has failed to punish that so it’s a-ok with me”.
