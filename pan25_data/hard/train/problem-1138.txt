I guess I can't support police reform or vaccine mandates in schools either, wouldn't want to be anti-union.
Calling a person anti-union because they support education reform is about what I'd expect from a person who gets their news from the intercept.
Supporting more school choice and reform does not necessarily mean public funding for unregulated private schools ran by right-wing groups, you're strawmanning there.
Do you know how many private schools are already funded entirely by right wing organizations grooming kids to join awful organizations like the federalist society?
supporting school vouchers and steering public funds to private interest groups parading as schools is categorically undemocratic.
Charter schools deserve no public money unless they are held to the same educational standards and subjected to oversight by independent parties.
If they do adhere to those standards there's no reason to invest in them over public schools anyway.
Why give them more resource to indoctrinate young minds instead of using that public money to invest in public schools that desperately need it.
