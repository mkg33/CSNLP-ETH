I am going to give Laxalt credit.
He has, as far as I have seen, been handling the count with dignity.
I have not seen him crying fraud or saying that it is impossible he did not win, but seems to have, at least from what I have seen, taken a reasonable stance and is correctly informing people about what it comes down to.
Realistically Nevada will for sure hit a recount, but with it being down a couple thousand votes, it probably should just to be sure.
The Democrat odds of winning the Nevada Senate have gone up considerably since that time.
Same for the Democrat running for governor in arizona, her odds are way up from where they were.
An anonymous source said yesterday in the New York Times that the Laxalt campaign is contacting voters to get them to cure.
In Nevada they have until Monday to cure signature problems with their mail-in ballots.
Just fyi, if you're looking at the New York Times needle or the Washinon Post forecast, those were not updated after the very early hours of Wednesday.
It is so nice not to have Trump and Giuliani screaming about stolen elections.
Lindsey Graham is the only one who really seems to have a microphone yelling about it.
