Russian civilians have no rights in Ukraine and israeli civilians have no right to be in West Bank.
It is not Israeli territory and is occupied.
Not a single country on the planet recognises West Bank as israeli territory.
West Bank isnt in israel.
Occupation soldiers arent cops any more than Russian occupation soldiers in Ukraine are cops.
And yes, nobody denies the legal right of Russian soldiers to kill Ukrainians, if they're actually defending themselves.
Including the people who agree that the Russian invasion is completely illegal, but understand international law.
In fact, including the Ukrainians themselves.
They aren't arguing that every single Russian soldier that defended himself from a Ukrainian attack is a war criminal.
The issue is with Russian soldiers claiming to be only defending themselves, when they clearly weren't.
That simply isn't the case here.
If Netanyahu boasted about ending the laws against cannabis use, and people were still arrested, indicted and jailed for smoking weed, it would mean those laws are still in place, and Netanyahu simply lied.
I'd really like to see a defense lawyer telling the judge, "but your honor, Netanyahu boasted about it!
".
It doesn't matter what Netanyahu "boasted about".
Just like it doesn't matter that Arafat brazenly violated Oslo by launching the Second Intifada, or that Abbas is brazenly violating it by financially supporting terrorism.
It doesn't even matter that Abbas openly said, , that he's withdrawing from Oslo.
