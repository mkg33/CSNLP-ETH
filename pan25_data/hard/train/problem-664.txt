You can almost pinpoint on a timeline when the first units of volunteers and conscripts sent overseas to train arrived back compared to losses of Russian units.
There are still a lot of units training in the EU, UK and US on equipment more recently signed off for donation, once those systems and people start getting offloaded into Ukrainian territory we'll see even further escalations of relative combat performance.
I mean even if the west scales back support for Ukraine, at this point Ukraine has loads of battle hardened troops going up against essentially terrified civilians led by corrupt cronies with no military background and Russia is already reaching into museums for T62 tanks.
And as other posters pointed out, Ukrainians made up about 40% of the red army, to say nothing of how many were drafted from Belarus, the Baltic states etc.
Honestly, Stalin and Russia spat on the Ukrainians by drafting them to defend a nation they werenâ€™t actually a part of, after butchering millions in the genocide that was the Holodromo.
I'm sure antagonism towards the Ukranian independence movement played a part in Stalin refusing to help them, but Russians were also trying to assimilate them into a more Russian cultural identy, not kill them all.
After all, the Kievan Rus were ethnically the cultural ancestors of both Russians and Ukranians...essentially the same people but with differing cultural identities.
That's why I'm still not sure it was a planned genocide like the "final solution" was.
That's still a debate among scholars.
