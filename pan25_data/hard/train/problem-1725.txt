They get all kinds of shots, and no one complains.
This is just political bullshit because there are so many idiots that think masks and vaccines are against their “freedoms.”.
This is what happens when you have scientifically illiterate morons in leadership positions (republicans) that had the bright idea of making the vaccine political.
These morons do not care if they weaken the military and its readiness so long as they get political points.
There are plenty of senior officers in the military who argue that covid mandates are decreasing readiness.
The point is to boost military recruitment numbers which are very bad right now partially due to vaccine requirements.
Should have been paired with getting rid of marijuana disqualifications.
I would agree that not all soldiers are conservative and not all conservatives are anti-vax but a large portion of the pool of recruits (lets say 20-40% as a complete guess) are conservative and anti-vax and thats sufficient to affect recruiting in a major way.
