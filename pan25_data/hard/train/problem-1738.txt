absolutely.
that’s probably one of the reasons why the US is considering producing weapons in Taiwan.
but, much like the lead up to the Ukraine war, the Chinese buildup leading to any invasion of Taiwan will give the US and other governments sufficient time to get ready and deploy.
China will never invade Taiwan, US military analysts have it wrong just like they had the Russian military wrong.
They can’t because Taiwan is a gridlock, if China invades there will be an immediate response by the US and will drag NATO into the conflict in less than a day, and China knows that it can’t handle all of NATO all at once, especially since it isn’t even a major nuclear power yet.
They will use strategic economic and financial means as a way to bring recession onto Taiwan and coerce them into submission, which will likely never happen due to the intense anti-Chinese sentiment there.
What’s most likely going to happen is that they will try to weaken US connection to Taiwan and gradually separate Taiwan and the US until they can do something like a military blockade and then force them into submission.
