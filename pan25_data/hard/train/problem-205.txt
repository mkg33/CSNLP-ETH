Because the format was elitist, a blatant cash grab run by the worst club owners in football and overall a disgrace to the spirit of the sport.
It is too big to fail, most big names are attached to it in one way or another, you need the leagues to attract the people, the people bring money, money goes back to FIFA, it is a perfect corrupt circle of garbage.
The corruption surrounding it isn't even worth highlighting as it's literally standard procedure with fifa and you talk about others being dumb ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.
Yeah.
Why was it perfectly fine to watch the 2018 world cup hosted in Russia, but we're supposed to feel bad about this one being hosted in Qatar?
If you're trying to argue it from a human rights angle then it's still wrong as Russia hosted it in 2018 which is far worse than Qatar ever will be.
Women's rights in Qatar are almost non-existent in Qatar too, comparatively Russia while slightly worse as most of the West their women are reasonably free and equal.
Qatar has poor LGBT rights & women's rights, but they haven't invaded other countries or started wars.
Anyone who actually thinks Qatar is worse than Russia is delusional as fuck.
Sure one thing Qatar is better than Russia is, is on rule of law and security, but that's primarily due to the mafia-state nature of Russia.
But the rule of law in Qatar ain't exactly much better than the chaos in Russia, since the law of the land is Sharia.
Russia is terrible but to say 'far worse' than Qatar is bit of a stretch, at least in terms of human rights.
In Qatar they don't even have the pretence of democracy like in Russia(they are a damn absolute monarchy).
As bad as LGBT stuff is in Russia, in Qatar homosexuality is illegal entirely.
