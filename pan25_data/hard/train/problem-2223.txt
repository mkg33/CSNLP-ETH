"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket.
Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.
".
Oh yeah.
So, we should actively protest gun shows.
We should punish businesses that carry guns, or allow gun owners to do business there.
We should target schools that have guns mentioned in their criteria and ban that.
We should refer to gun owners as dangers to our children.
Maybe start calling them groomers.
We should absolutely make kids show if there are guns in their house before they can play in sports.
We should try and limit services to gun owners on religious grounds.
Let's bully gun owners until they are forced to commit suicide.
And while we're at it, let's have national level discussions on which bathrooms gun owners can use.
Gun owners are, at most, minorly inconvenienced.
Meanwhile drag performers (and by extension the trans community, because we both know that is what is at the root of this) are being actively targeted and threatened.
And you know?
Maybe we should start demonizing gun owners in the same way.
But we won't, because there are still a shit ton of liberals that own and know how to use guns without making it part of their core identity.
