They ARE the SDF.
The US just rebranded them due to the PR disaster that the YPG was engaging in before the US got involved with them, namely forced evictions of native residents in territories they controlled, which continued all the way up to 2015-16 when the US forced them to stop.
Oh, also.
Wanna know why the Kurds have never been able to unite under a single flag?
It's because a third are Islamist, a third are communist, and a third actually don't care about independence and are okay with just trying to get more rights in the nations they live in.
Turkey actually has good relationship with Iraqi Kurdistan.
In fact, the Turks train and provide weapons to the peshmerga.
The Turks target the PKK in the mountainous areas along the border.
The Iraqi Kurds also don't like the PKK much, as the PKK considers them traitors to the independence cause.
If a kurdish group is actually engaging in terror in another country that's one thing, but YPG wasn't.
The YPG actually shared values with the rest of europe and fought against ISIS, while turks helped isis.
I think you are right, however a Kurdish state in Syria is not in Turkeyâ€™s best interest.
If formed, Turkey would eventually lose some soil to that Kurdish state so would do anything to prevent that.
