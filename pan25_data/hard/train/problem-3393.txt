Well, the congressional salary is 174,000 a year.
That’s a lot of money when you don’t really have to work (since he’s not on committees).
He just has to show up for floor votes when an important GOP bill up.
He‘a just waiting for his constituency to forget that he exists so he can collect the paychecks.
But now he’s party of a party that doesn’t care what their extremes say as long as they vote with the block.
Santos is betting that his party loyalty would garner GOP support (we don’t like him/but we like his voting record.
Hmmm that sounds familiar).
Unfortunately (for Santos) the opposition research has been published, and his scams have made a mockery of the local GOP.
So there is no chance that the local GOP won’t run a replacement in the primary.
He won’t make it past the primary.
But Jesus Christ, why the fuck is he still sitting.
Well McCarthy is why.
Fucking democrats need to campaign on this obvious corruption and incompetence.
I really can’t imagine he would get past the primary.
I know you you know your district better than mine, but I think republican leadership in Nassau County will make sure that he won’t win.
I know the district intimately and I would not bet just yet that he wouldn't win the GOP primary again in 2024.
Nassau county republicans are awful people.
I bet very few of them are at that protest, if any.
They're Texans without the Jesus shit.
