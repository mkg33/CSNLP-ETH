Numerous laws were broken which allowed this minor to even get a hold of this firearm, so adding more laws wouldn't help.
Numerous laws were broken which allowed this minor to take this firearm into a place that firearms are not allowed, so more laws wouldn't help.
Numerous laws that could be created for this incident could also be circumvented just as easily.
The only one that would "work" would be to ban all guns, but as we all know, thats a pipe dream so it's not a good argument.
Yes, clearly "ban all guns" would solve this from ever happening again, but there is no way to actually get there, so it's a non-starter of a discussion.
Yep, and you just got a slew of down votes for stating the blindingly obvious: There is absolutely no fucking way that America could transition to a zero gun society overnight.
Most Americans have never left the USA.
They have little clue about foreign societies.
They also think that America is superior to everywhere else.
This is a big part of why American leads the world in gun violence.
Your countries leading cause of death for children is firearms.
How absolutely delusional and heartless can you be to think that trying to reduce the amount of available firearms isnt even worth trying.
As a firearm enthusiast and father of young kids, I agree it is extremely irresponsible and you shouldn’t likely own guns if you don’t have a safe.
I believe your child commits a crime with your gun, you should get charged with everything they do plus several charges for them being able to.
I think that’s how all gun laws should be.
Extremely harsh sentences for crimes committed with guns or for prohibited people possessing them.
