If they build new units they make sure to not do so if it’ll depreciate existing assets.
They play this game all day, every day.
In essence, if they’re building it means they can still very effectively maximize potential profit which means no degradation of COL in the area they’re built.
Not necessarily.
What these corporations do is buy rental properties and leave a very specific percentage of them vacant in order to maximize profit by way of artificially increasing scarcity that raises rents owed versus the net loss accrued by carrying a vacant property on their portfolio.
My anecdotal experience as a tenant of those small enterprise portfolios is that they squeeze every last drop of profitability out of their units by doing exactly as you said, maximizing capacity, while doing the absolute least amount of work as well as keep staff skeleton crewed with low pay while offering subsidization of units to employees (keeping their money in the property).
The last property I rented in Anchorage was owned by one of these management companies.
Mud and tape, a quick roll of paint, a 10 minute carpet cleaning, and a touch and go cleaning crew that did nothing but wipe down surfaces.
I had to clean the apartment myself when I moved in and one of my friends worked maintenance at another property the company owned.
Yup, I live in a decent apartment building and I’d be shocked if even 60% of the apartments are rented out.
The parking lot is maybe 50% full, the two units across from mine have been empty for 3 years and the common areas are always devoid of people.
