Recently listened for like the 50th time to Dan Carlin’s Hardcore history podcast.
MacArthur legitimately saw himself as the personal protector of the Philippines.
Like a line from a movie, after the Philippines was initially invaded and he was evacuating citizens, the official record states.
The American occupation is the most benevolent one out of the three occupiers of the Philippines (Spain and Japan being the other).
It also helped that the US gave Filipinos independence willingly and MacArthur convinced FDR to return to the Philippines when they were occupied, making the Americans look like they will hold their promise when they make it.
The Americans, even as they were betraying the Filipinos on their struggle of independence, understood that they have to grant Filipinos independence eventually and spent money and effort to provide Philippines the tools to survive and proper post-independence.
Most of the government institutions today in the Philippines have their roots in the American colonial bureaucracy and its education system from the American teachers who landed after the soldiers.
There were still economic exploitation happening but more under the influence of market capitalism and not the mercantilism of Spain or full resource exploitation of Japan.
Subic and Clark are gonna be impossible to return as military bases.
Subic turned into a major commercial post with a large shipyard while Clark turned into a major cargo airport and a lot of government facilities are moving to the old base as well.
Philippines prefers that they and the US develop a new base somewhere close to the trouble regions and far from the Filipinos.
US and Philippines are working together now on a suitable location for a military base (eg, like we have with the Japanese and South Koreans).
I’m sure you know this, but the Philippines was a U.S. territory and has a major military base presence near Manila until the 1990s (like in Japan.
