Exactly.
This is why Trump wants election day to be one day, paper ballots only, no early voting.
Lots of red states already have restrictive voting hours that make it difficult for people with jobs to get to the polls on election day.
Exactly!
And this has been a mainstay of the Republican voter base for decades.
EVERYONE wants to vote in a Presidential election.
Midterms, though, used to see WAY fewer people march off to the polls on election day.
Older folks and retirees are have the time and leisure to pay attention to politics.
Saturday voting could HELP the GOP, too That's what is extra fucked up about this Now that the Warnock/Walker runoff isn't going to decide control of the Senate, Republicans are going to have a harder time poking their base to get out to the polls again.
The GOP loves it when fewer people vote and when only the old retired folks scared shitless by Fox News vote.
Funny how much republicans don't want people to vote.
Then again this is the same party that likes to say "we're a republic, not a democracy" as if the US isn't both at the same time.
