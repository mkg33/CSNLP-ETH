I think the long game is more interesting.
What happens AFTER these draconian laws get passed.
You’d think that’s when the real fight begins.
I think (hope) a large number of people get really stirred up, and put the crazies in their place.
I guess we’ll see.
Assuming this passes, I wonder if we’ll see a backlash?
I wonder if the pro-healthcare GOP team up with independents/Dems and vote in more moderates?
Would they establish more sensible abortion restrictions (or none at all)?
The whole point of Roe was privacy which was over an abortion.
These people be screaming if someone said: “don’t listen to them because they are bipolar or have cancer.” Of course they be the first to go: “it’s not your business to know these things.” Yet they can’t see that.
They think they are some big heroes trying to prevent death when they are encouraging and enforcing it.” Here is the thing let’s say the GOP and MAGA don’t last and Trump or those like him regress or die out by 2024.
It’s going to be a long battle with those clinging to those ideals and will take a good 20 years or more to return to a more progressive status.
