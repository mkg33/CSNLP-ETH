"[The medic]... was wearing a clear first aid vest when the shooting happened," it said, adding both the men who were shot were declared dead at hospital.

So to be clear, a guy was walking around the battlefield without any medic vest when he was shot.
Being a medic does not create a bubble around you where everyone within several feet is considered a noncombatant.
In every armed conflict, combatants walk near medics at some point.
Secondly, civilians do not move around a gunfight next to medics.
Medics are part of the armed forces of one side and often interact with armed combatants on their side.
Civilians typically hide from gunfire.
