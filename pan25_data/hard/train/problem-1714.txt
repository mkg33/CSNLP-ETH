When I was a child we could go to our ski lift and later in the evening just ride an alternative path all the way down to our home.
This path hasn't had snow since a decade, as every degree warmer pushes the snow line hundred meters higher up the mountain.
The season used to last several months longer.
It started way earlier and now we are happy if it even has open at Christmas.
It will also not be profitable for much longer for my town to operate a ski lift.
In a world of chairlifts bringing all sorts of people that have no business outside the kid’s ski area, t-bars are a great filter.
Not sure what T-bars are like where you're from, but here you need skiis or a snowboard and a smooth surface to glide on the ground to use them.
Definitely not doable without snow (unless they made the ground smooth and with some kind of all terrain inline skates maybe) and definitely not doable downwards as you'd be faster than the T-bar.
Snowboarders need to be able to ride uphill, but without strapping one of their feet in so they can still get off.
Poor beginner snowboarders often wouldn’t make it more than a few feet after getting on.
Absolute death trap.
