Desantisâ€™ rhetoric may change, but his policy will not.
The republicans are still going to have the same agenda, Christian nationalism and legalizing their bigotry.
Their Supreme Court picks will help them, we still have the upcoming decision that could entirely change election laws.
This is not over yet, republicans will still be a serious threat to democracy because the only thing they care about is power, money, and enforcing their own moral code on others.
Yeah, I'm really hoping this made Republicans realize that democracy won't go down quietly like they hoped.
They will have to literally fight to defeat democracy and the appetite for that fight just isn't there.
But the path for them to achieve minority rule is still right there and that's a very bad thing.
We can't rely on them having a change of heart.
It remains to be seen.
If the Democrats somehow manage to get the trifecta, it won't be a big enough majority to end the fillibuster and overhaul voting rights.
Meanwhile the supreme court is set to gut the voting rights act even further, and even more consequentially, Moore v Harper could let Republican controlled states simply flip election results they don't like.
So there is a very real possibility that Republicans will have an unbeatable advantage going forward and we'll pretty much be in a minority rule situation.
This was really the last chance to stop it.
