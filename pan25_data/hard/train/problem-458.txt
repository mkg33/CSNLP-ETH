I like the think that internal governments will fall REALLY quickly in a nuclear disaster.
The leaders of that new world (if possible) will be the ones looking to survive.
Nobody will want to listen to someone who is hell bent on violence.
I canâ€™t even imagine people following a US president after a nuclear war unless their first priority was stability.
No, it is not the delivery of arms to a defending people that leads to a nuclear catastrophe, but a criminal, unscrupulous regime without morals that would rather use its nuclear weapons before it perishes.
reality is their air defence is shit, that in case of nuclear war, ruzzia will be annihilated, with their "historical West enemy" maybe suffering from some nukes hit targets, but very very very not likely, as the corruption that was cultivated by this imbecile putin resulted in everything falling apart.
- if there is no fight back from this county, make up bullshit about liberation.
And start slow genocide and eventually spread their "russian world" there.
