Who cares what he says?
He's claimed he would never invade, then he did.
He claimed he was fighting against Nazis, and he isn't.
He claimed he's fighting against Satan, the US, NATO, etc... but the reality is still that this is just a failed invasion of a neighbor that could end any time Putin decides to end it.
Naturally, that isn’t what Putin is claiming on the surface - he’s claiming some sort of deep-seated plot on the part of the West to destroy Russia, one that predates his own invasion (and in fact made it necessary).
He’s attempting to reverse cause and effect.
Yup, that would be the deep-seated plot to destroy Russia.
If Ukraine etc.
is and always was part of Russia , Ukraine existing as a separate nation automatically dismembers Russia.
If Putin Khan means Ukraine taking back what Russia "annexed", then yeah, the West is certainly seeking the dismemberment of Russia.
In reality there are tons of groups in Russia that want to dismember Russia and become their own countries.
The actual threat is coming from his own disaffected populace.
The West would be fairly indifferent if Russia Balkanizes or even opposed as it would likely lead to significant instability in Eurasia.
Once again Putin is blaming the US and its allies for Russia's own internal problems.
