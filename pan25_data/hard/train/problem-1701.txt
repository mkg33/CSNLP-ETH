You'll just have to repeatedly Grandfather generations in and out of gun ownership, after about 100-200 yrs you can have no gun sales and no more hand-me-down firearms.
The only guns should be revolvers for the home, shotguns for the home and hunting, bolt action rifles for hunting.
The Glock 17 is one of the most popular home defense guns.
It’s a big handgun.
It is super hard to conceal carry with its size, especially if you aren’t a bigger person with baggier clothing.
There are far better options to conceal carry.
So we are effectively banning these full size weapons that many people currently have for home defense, to stop a crime that these guns typically aren’t being used to commit, and drive people to smaller size frames which for less experienced shooters (home defense situations) is more likely to result in missed shots.
In my mind, there is a big difference between a single shot musket that was prevalent at the time the constitution was written and a semi-automatic rifle that can is designed for killing a large number of people.
What’s next?
Everyone being allowed to carry heavy machine guns?
Rocket launchers?
There has to be a line somewhere; a compromise.
There is a line.
The difference between small arms, and artillery or munitions, is ancient and quite clear.
If you want to put the line somewhere else, amend the Constitution through legitimate democratic process.
