I was more or less making a joke but right now India and USA has a common enemy in China so if shit hit the fan it would probably result in India siding with USA at least against China.
As for China yes I agree if things go south India will side with US, but again we never know what China will do if Pakistan becomes rogue.
The chances of being another North Korea is small because Pakistan is in a bad neighborhood, so most probably China will suppress Pakistan militarily to secure its assets and interests in the region.
I mean how should I put it, we are not.
It brings us more trouble if they default and become rogue.
Most educated and intellectual Indians know that the worst thing that could happen is having a rogue nuclear power in your backyard.
It's better that the US is helping them, we just wish its not militarily.
I know it was a joke but there are people who will take this seriously and think "Oh this must be US getting back at India for not supporting Ukraine" if you follow this sub closely you know this view is normal here.
