Well, this is cutting edge stuff.
The US is the first to develop laser defense systems and the first to deploy them on combat vehicles.
It wasn't until the advent of solid state lasers that they became small enough, light enough, and cheap enough to deploy in large quantities.
Given the way a laser works they probably won't be that good against saturation attacks.
Patriot missiles, RAM, and good old CWIS will still be relevant.
PAC-3 is one of the best anti-ballistic missile systems in the world.
Sure, it's not a THAAD or SM-3, but short of those systems, it's right up there.
Also, NASAMS is one of the shortest range and least capable anti aircraft systems the US has short of a MANPADS or CIWIS, and it's still ruining Russia's day.
More like this sub is unable to cope with the fact that no matter how many western SAMs you send, they won’t be able to beat Russian missiles.
If they can’t even stop Scud missiles then they have zero chance against something like the Iskandar.
The SM-3 is the best anti-ballistic SAM in the world, and the SM-6 is the best anti aircraft missile in the world, and it isn't even close.
