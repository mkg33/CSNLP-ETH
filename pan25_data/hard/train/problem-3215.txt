But every time the details of something like this come out, I will admit to still being a bit shocked by just how little cash it takes.
Yes, it certainly isn't shocking at all anymore that Republicans are willing to sell out their country for Russian cash.
Wow, not even remotely shocked... its been factually obvious that Russia has been fucking with Republicans for atleast the last 5 years.
Russia has literally said that's what they are doing over and over including very recently.
Also I can show how those troll farms the wagner founder created - along with GRU hacker groups - used the antimask/anti covid groups online to fuel the divide in the usa during the pandemic and how those same groups have dropped most of that nonsense for new talking points about not supporting ukraine.
They have even stated what the goal is: to divide the United States and make everyone in the government eat eachother until democracy dies.
Edit: They see the usa as the figure head of democracy, but really their attacks are much broader, they do the same meddling in any democratic nation that they see as a threat.
It's all about dividing and pitting against oneanother.
Unity is their greatest enemy and if they can divide and sour relationships its to their benift.
