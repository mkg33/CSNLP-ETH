the thing is, mammals weren't dying in mass from bird flu until last year, now it keeps happening, the virus mutated to adapt to mammals and is now just a couple of mutations away from Human to Human transmission.
The animals were found to have a mutation of the virus that could make it easier to infect mammals, but there was no evidence of transmission between mammals.
In other words, livestock and poultry are great at making it easier for viruses to spread amongst humans.
As to why this is, one author explains:
Perhaps the biggest risk of disease concerning livestock and poultry is influenza A - the only influenza virus known to cause pandemics.
It is hypothesized that every influenza virus that causes pandemics in humans is derived from avian influenza in aquatic birds.
Normally this wouldn't be an issue for us.
The infected wild birds usually don't get sick, and the virus doesn't easily spread amongst humans.)
But industrialized animal agriculture has changed that.
