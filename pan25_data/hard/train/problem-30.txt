This is honestly terrible news.
Russian social media was a goldmine for information on the Russian army.
Every single Ukrainian army breakthrough was captured in real time.
The entire disaster around mobilization was captured in real time.
I really don't think a lot of Redditors understand how much information they see which originates from Russian media sources.
It's hilarious how often I would get called out by redditors for "regurgitating russian propaganda" for the same information that Ukrainian sources were sharing.
Honestly it's not that hard to cut through the propaganda.
If there's anything we learned from this war it's that the Russians were the biggest victims of their own disinformation campaign.
If there's any reason discussions are being banned it's because the constant Russian failures were causing the Russian military community to turn against their leaders and it was only a matter of time before they turned against Putin.
I’m just picturing those Russian propagandists who have been spending the last couple months yelling at each other about the state of the war and the country just all shutting up and looking at each other in a cold panicked terrified sweat any time the conversation inevitably veers toward the state of the war.
War must be going great if merely mentioning it is enough to damage Russias morale and national coherency….
They are allowed to criticise certain aspects of the war as Putin deems them to be central in the public war morale effort.
He knows the people don't believe the government so when they see these "independent" bloggers who are overall supporting the war, they believe them.
They said "public discussion", all these milbloggers know they are under the thumb of Putin and being used by him.
