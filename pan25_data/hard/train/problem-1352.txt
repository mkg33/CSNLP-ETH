The intent of a federal ID is to ensure a national database for tracking people.
The idea is to prevent fake IDs which many states can provide to illegal aliens.
Think about an Iranian terrorist sneaking across the Mexican border.
They can get a drivers license in California.
However, they can’t fly or take a train with that drivers license.
It makes it impossible for them to bypass TSA checkpoints.
After all, CA has no way of doing a background check on an illegal alien.
The federal government does.
Of course they can.
Anybody with enough resources and support can do just about anything, including defeating the US military.
Reference Vietnam and Afghanistan.
Security is about making things more difficult to do to protect innocent people.
You know it was ridiculously easy for the terrorists on 9/11 to do what they did right?
Yes it was easy for the 9/11 terrorists and it had nothing to do with fake ID and knives.
And their tactic died onboard 4th hijacked plane.
Bollocks.
Each day more and more U.S. citizens and LPRs enter the USA with face recognition and don’t need to present documents.
