of course just its because its a natural equilibrium doesnt mean the natural equilibrium is fair or just - but we all already know this because we live in societies where some people have billions and others starve.
They already get away with not paying fair wages because the system is already at equilibrium paying unfair wages - this is how capitalism works - because, surprise, the system is already inherently unfair.
The reality is unfair, and the reality is that millions have no choice but to scrape by for minimal wages as drivers or deliverypeople to survive, and this will happen whether or not foreigners tip.
So I talk to a lot of drivers, the vast majority of them claim you can earn about 1800 dollars a month (again, on my specific city, canâ€™t say that this is the reality of the rest of the state, much less the entirety of Brazil).
That 1800 can be broken down to about 1000 to 1200 dollars being the cost of car maintenance and such, and between 800 to 600 dollars to the driver, they work something like 10 hours a day, Monday to Saturday.
