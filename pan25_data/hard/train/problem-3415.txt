It would really and truly be some of the most epic “fuck around and find out” level shit in history too.
If the cartels showed up and started killing Americans (especially with the shit they show off online), there’s quite literally zero chance we don’t get the go ahead from Mexico to completely wreck their shit.
The Mexican government is pretty fucking lenient with them just because of how brutal they can be, and also because cartels have infiltrated the police and military to an extent.
Well it's in tradition that drug lords pays well, from the lowest police officer to the president themself, some might've even won the election with the help with cartel, but Chapo gotta be VERY desperate to try to use his favors with the Mexico president at this stage, knowing well this is a long shot.
Also do not forget, that amlo is the only president so far in the story of México that has pictures and videos of him eating in a party full of narcos and even going to salute the chapo's mom, and promising her that he would do something to help them see him in prison.
That is true, there were a bunch of different rumors about every single one of them having ties with some criminal group, but not a single photo of them together, unlike this one.
