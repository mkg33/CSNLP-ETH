This is what this package of bills will do.
Is this the slippery slope you guys are all worried about?
Let me guess… you’re against these bills in Michigan, and all sensible gun control measures, see nothing wrong with kids getting murdered in their classrooms, feel that it’s the price we pay for freedom, and that the reason we have so many more gun deaths in the US has nothing to do with how many more guns we have.
And you think your “right” to own a gun shouldn’t have the smallest controls placed around it regardless if it means a school kid takes a few bullets.
Well there’s already so many guns out there- yes there are, let’s stop increasing that number and save some lives in the process.
Are you really against these sensible measures which likely would not impact you or other responsible gun owners in any way?
Do you think you have a better chance taking on the most powerful military in the world with some pistols and rifles than you do with a pointed stick?
Would you prefer to protect yourself with any form of small arms or a sharp stick?
An armed intruder breaks into your home are you better prepared with your own firearm or your cell phone calling 911 then waiting for armed help defenseless?
I see it says your from New York how’s all that strong gun control working out for you guys?
I just saw the other day there was a shooting in Times Square how could that happen in such a gun control bastion?
