That doesn't mean everything should be labeled to death - but substances which are known to be the reason of a significant amount of annual deaths absolutely should.
If you go onto the street and ask people what they think how alcohol kills people/why it is deadly, they will tell you: Liver, brain damage, the direct stuff.
The vast majority of the harm done by alcohol has nothing to do with its role as a carcinogen, and everything to do with its ability to induce intoxication and cause liver/brain damage.
And then they drink, because they think knowing the risks immunizes from them, or because they just want to.
As for alcohol, we all know it's risky.
But so is mountain climbing and skiing.
Choose your high, they all have risks.
We all have to go sometime.
We get it.
Everything causes cancer.
The sun causes cancer.
The spray we put on to protect us from said sun cases cancer.
Processed foods cause cancer.
Cigarettes cause cancer.
Red meat causes cancer.
Alcohol causes cancer.
The hormones in chicken cause cancer.
The fertilizer I use in my garden causes cancer.
Sugar causes cancer.
The exhaust from our cars cause cancer.
The pesticides on our fruit causes cancer.
The plastic in our water causes cancer.
Seriously, we get it — everything causes cancer.
Now why don’t you let us get on with our cancer-filled lives and go legislate something meaningful.
