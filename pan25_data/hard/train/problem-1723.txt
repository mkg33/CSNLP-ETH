I mean, the whole point of the article was that this General was right on the cusp of sending the Guard in there to fuck the Insurrectionists up.
Obviously he didn’t, but it was a close call.
If Trump actually tried making the announcement that he wasn’t leaving office and they were going to institute martial law, it doesn’t sound like the General was just going to sit on his hands for that shit.
The (acting) secretary of defense , even if they took longer than they should, it didn’t matter that Trump was deliberately ignoring the situation or Pence was demanding they deploy.
Of course there is.
One that recognizes defending the constitution includes honoring the constitutional chain of command and authority vested in the President (ArtII.S2.C1.1.11).
The secdef’s authorization was what the DC national guard commander was waiting for which is what this story is about.
The oath of enlistment is similar and says “…and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me…” so at a minimum, anyone who listed to his orders would be breaking their oath.
But, assuming you are defending his inaction, I'll say, first, the for military officers includes an obligation to "support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic[.]"
There's no possible interpretation of that oath that treats allowing a mob to besiege and sack the Capitol as upholding the oath.
And the oath is also a law Congress passed, so you can't claim "rule of law matters" while also supporting violating one's oath of office that was passed by Congress.
If rule of law matters, then so does upholding one's oath.
... rule of law requires enforcement.

Authorized torture, he admitted it, its not up for debate, he committed a crime, he was never prosecuted, he was never pardoned, rule of law requires enforcement.
