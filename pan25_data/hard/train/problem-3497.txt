After receiving the narrowest congressional reelection margin in the country, U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert has apparently learned absolutely nothing.
By refusing to stand or applaud the heroic Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during his speech to Congress, she has once again embarrassed her 3rd Congressional District constituents and the entire country.
During this historic speech, Boebert was seen scrolling on her phone rather than listening, while sitting next to U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz who was doing the same.
It’s clear that Boebert does not understand the importance of defending democracy in our world and does not care about the wishes of her constituents.
She is clearly on the wrong side of history.
Will she never learn?
Why would you expect her to learn anything?
Her constituents gave her the green light.
The only way people such as these two only learn when they loose the race.
She takes the win as they love me.
