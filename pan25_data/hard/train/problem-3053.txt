Oh wait… we have an executive branch pushing the idea that a President may not be indicted.
The Legislation passed laws to prevent insider trading and are doing everything they can to ensure they can keep that up as long as possible… SCOTUS members aren’t subject to their own ethics rules they set for Justices….
Hmm… but if “your” lawyers are trying to argue a mutually exclusive and self canceling position, their nonsense shouldn’t be entertained long, if at all.
The trouble here is that this consensus can get set simply when nobody attacks the convoluted nonsense creative lawyers propose.
Worse yet, this garbage is very often never cleaned out until it gets pushed to higher courts for resolution.
TL;DR: It's clear to my lawyers.
It's also clear to yours.
Trouble is our lawyers don't agree... hence we need the courts.
So why don't they just call this out with their lawyers why does it take forever to sort this crap out?
Aren't some things in law fairly binary?
There are clear rules right?
Can't they just be like "Nope.
show up on Tuesday cheese dick.
".
