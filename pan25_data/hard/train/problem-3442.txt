Edit to add: He got 79 votes in the Swedish election (dual citizen), so they might as well call him a Swedish MP.
Edit: His party got way less (at most 4,288 since that is the total votes for indepednets) in the 2022 Danish election, I was looking at 2019.
Yes, because we have rule of law.
The Police are not allowed to stop a legal protest.
The police even made sure to not allow him to protest outside the embassy but forced him to do it a bit out of the way.
The Police does not like him, but they have to follow the law because we are not a police state.
Yeah, what shitty journalism is this.
The Russian link seems to be real (I have read about it in Swedish news) but I am not sure I would trust some journalist who can't even use Wikipedia.
He isn't.
The guy possibly on Russian payroll is Frick who proposed the idea to Paludan.
There is still no reaosn to think Paludan is on Russian payroll, he is a useful idiot.
If you had read the (admittedly shitty) article you would have known.
ehm yeah sure this news article here seem pretty questionable.
they have been burning the koran for a freaking long time now, way before the ukraine war.
A guy who has been known to be burning Korans for like ten years now has been linked to Russia?
So in what ways was he aiding Russia for the other 10 years he was burning the Koran?
