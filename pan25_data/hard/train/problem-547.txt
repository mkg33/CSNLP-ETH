And probably further advanced US interests waaaay more than that dollar amount would in other ways.
Foreign countries love American things that go boom.
Exactly.
Any confrontation with Russia would, basically, require an ally to get punched in the face .
Then NATO would respond with force.
So for whoever ends up as the initial recipient of Russian aggression, life would suck.
I’m actually curious to know what kind of foreign relations deals have been sealed by some good ‘ol fashion weapons.
Like how the US is trying to cajole Turkey into accepting new NATO members by promising to upgrade their F16’s (read this somewhere).
While nothing is really funny in war (my correction), it is quite ironic.
When I read that the Russian soldiers had fled a battlefield, abandoning a functional tank and the Ukrainians just driving off in that shit, it makes me smile.
I understand a lot of the military hardware in their neighbors’ armies was “left” in these countries when the USSR dissolved, but the way they sell arms to pretty much anybody, they were bound to end up in conflict facing their own weaponry.
Gotta have some chill when it comes to export controls.
I have a gut feeling that the US pretty much only doles out the stuff that they have definitive counter/kill capabilities for (obviously there are exceptions).
I find it hilarious though, that Russia fighting pretty much any of its neighbors, will be fighting AGAINST their own weapons (until the NATO stuff gets brought out).
I think that Russia, particularly with China's potential alliance, thought 6-9 months ago they could fight so hard against NATO that NATO would bow out.
Pretty sure I read that the NATO strategy in the Baltic states is to delay any Russian advance until reinforcements arrive in force.
And remember the demands to NATO Putin made in the beginning of 2022 - move back to pre-1991 lines and essentially leave Poland and the Baltics hanging inside Putin's "sphere of influence".
