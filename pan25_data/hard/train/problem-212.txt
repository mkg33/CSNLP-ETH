Putin never kills anyone, he just has incredible bad luck and people keep falling out of windows around him.
He would never kill Zelensky, those Russian born assassins sent to do so had nothing to do with him /s.
“I try am to not very much like kill Zelensky.
Try I to separate his soul from his guts out of love for man…er not like” he shakes his head blushingly poking through his circle, “ y know nite but a man love like he a little boy child and me, his onkel who also drives a bus, volunteer life guard at kiddie pool, and wrestles bears in speedo.
Me strong, erect; him hairless little boy, crying .
Me like bug I wish to splatter and make love to myself his putrid guts steaming as I come to completely compete….
NSA wiretap of the gremlin unto the kremlin.
That's what he was trained to do as KGB.
I'm a bit dumbfounded Bennett legitimately thought he got through to him.
Though Russia could stop Israel in Syria, momentarily, he knows that his card and some concessions there buys the Israelis from overt assistance to Ukraine too.
I'm sure after they tried and failed repeatedly at that point to kill Zelensky it was easy to pay lip service to that...
Yeah, they lie about the most meaningless bullshit, there's surely no way Putin would lie about definitely not wanting to kill Zelensky.
That's why they went straight for the capital city and tried to rapidly capture forward positions like Hostomel airport with paratroopers which is just on the outskirts of Kyiv.
Entire point was to decapitate the government, how that happened I think they didn't really care much about (whether they flee, get killed or get captured).
Same government they branded as neo-nazis.
