Actually the current technology used to intercept hypersonic missiles isn't enough to protect us.
Assuming Russians would fire 100 warheads (a small fraction of their arsenal) even if the defense systems would manage to shoot down weapons at their maximum capacity, billions would still die and most large cities would get wiped off the map.
Assuming you're somehow correct about the poor state of their arsenal this doesn't really matter that much.
Even if it's only at 50% functionality or less, this is enough warheads to glass the US and once again, there's no reliable way to defend against an attack of this caliber.
Ideally it's usefulness as a weapon is acting as a deterrent, but when everybody has a deterrent, it's just a stalemate until some loose cannon says fuck it.
NATO or the US will not start a war unless provoked via first strike from either China or Russia and surely neither of them are that stupid.
There is a chance that if N. Korea attacks Japan or the U.S could trigger WW3 but only if China gets involved, even then idk if NATO would get involved or if it would just be the U.S. and Japan.
If China starts sending weapons to Russia, it will be a big geopolitical shake-up, but I don't think WW3.
I mean, when you think about WW3, either Russia or China will need to directly attack NATO first, or NATO will need to directly attack one of them first, or there has to be some sort of accident that demands a military response.
(someone accidentually shoots down a NATO plane, for example).
