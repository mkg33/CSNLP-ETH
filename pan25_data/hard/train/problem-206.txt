Its already available for mail order and has been since Covid.
The problem is that major pharmacies wont ship to states where abortion is illegal.
This FDA thing doesnt really help that either, but it does make it easier for all Americans to get access simply because more pharmacies will carry it, and it makes it easier for those who are ok with skirting laws to acquire the pills and then ship them to red state women.
Now the FDA has “eased” the regulations so the majority of pharmacies should be able to fill out a bit of paperwork and be able to fill prescriptions for the abortion pills, politics aside.
Before today, the medication was only able to be filled in specific pharmacies.
These pharmacies were not like CVS or whatever- they were alt-pharmacies that had filled out tons of paperwork in order to fill these prescriptions, and they filled all of the United States abortion prescriptions.
Now any pharmacy can provide it rather than needing to go to a clinic, so as long as you can get a doctor to prescribe it, you can get an abortion.
Mifepristone, the first of two drugs in medication abortions, previously had to be dispensed only by clinics, doctors or a few mail-order pharmacies.
Now, if local drugstores or chains like CVS agree to certain rules, they can provide it.
