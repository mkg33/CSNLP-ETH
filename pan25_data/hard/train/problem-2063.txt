Originally NASA was put in these states to try to educate more people there because of their low education.
They even have a large engine testing facility in Southern Mississippi.
Sure they could move but that would be extremely difficult and yes it would mean rockets would notnbe able to carry as much payload since they're not as close to the equator.
As much as I heartily agree with the sentiment there are reasons NASA operates there....you want your launch pad to be as close to the equator as possible to get a boost from the Earth's rotational speed.
I do think NASA shoots themselves in the foot from a talent standpoint by having such massive operations in Houston, the Cape, and Huntsville.
The difficulty with NASA leaving Florida is the orbital dynamics.
There's nowhere more east and south and isolated that would have close to the same benefits for rocket launches.
Wallops in Virginia is good, but much smaller, has much less infrastructure, and is further north with more limited launch corridors.
I think Michoud outside of NOLA should just be left as a rubble pile after the next hurricane.
Clearly that's what God wants or he wouldn't keep ripping the roof off...
