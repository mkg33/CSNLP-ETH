because of how differently terrorism is handled from a strategic perspective (having a non-state enemy that often hides requires completely different military and financial approaches than having an enemy thatâ€™s a country with a UN seat).
The definition of terrorism as opposed to war crime is primarily a legal one, as the ways of fighting the two are highly different (terrorism generally requires detective work/law enforcement in addition to bombings and diplomacy).
It's still an atrocity and still equally bad, but the solution to Russia bombing the shit out of innocent civilians is different than the solution to a doomsday cult bombing the shit out of innocent civilians.

Ha.
Really?
Amazing.
They commit one crime and get caught and then admit to planning other crimes.
These guys are far beyond FreeDumb, They're FreeDumber.
That could well be their logic, however stupid, but it's not the public phony reason anyone might give.
Even Steve Bannon has interesting phony reasons for his scamming and other crap.
That "they're just like us" thing can lead to huge problems.
Not understanding other people, friend or foe, is a seriously big problem in foreign relations and wars.
War isn't a more favorable label than terrorism.
But I don't think there can be any doubt that Russia is intent on fighting the world like a trapped animal.
Russia would try to defend of course, but for ww it needs to involve most of the countries in the world.
So beside NK and maybe Iran will anyone support, and even these 2, would they actively defend?
