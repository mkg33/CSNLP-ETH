Russia has already lost, Putin is just murdering his own people at this point.
Ukraine will not give in.
More and more advanced weapons will keep flowing in.
They should get all the weapons they need.
Ukraine never asked for this war.
But the brave courageous people of Ukraine have stood up to Dictator Putin so please give them what they need.
Giving all that money for Ukraine Is good for the fight against Russian Imperialism.
Something that could help america's allies and america Itaelf In the future.
For you populists anything that inolves us aid is evil.
You are out of touch with the modern world.
Ukraine's far right parties got only 2.5% of the vote, Ukraine Is one of the least antisemitic countries in Europe, most of Azov is dead and they needed them out of desperation and most of Azov weren't nazis anyway.
Blah blah blah.
We pro Ukrainians have to say stuff like this over and over again because you anti Ukrainians keep forgetting It.
Lol.
I looked up the casualties of the gulf War, the war in Afghanistan, the Iraq War and the us involvement in Somalia, Libya and Pakistan.
The civillian casualties of the Era when the us was involved was a small part of the civillian casualties that were from the other sides in those wars.
The Ukrainian civillians who died In Russian hands is potentially in the 100,000 or more.
The civillians who doed from us hands in the middle east is far smaller.
For one.
The civilian casualties number is far lower than that of Ukraine.
And most of these weren't done by us hands.
Unlike Russia's war.
I haven't let a darn microwave do anything to me.
I'm not even American.
I simply support Ukraine because they are fighting an Invasion that Is meant to take their lands and turn their government into a puppet.
The Ukrainians are fighting and liberating their land.
And wanna hear something that could piss you off more?
They are winning.
And Russia Is losing.
Soon the superior west will rise even more about the failing and despotic east.
