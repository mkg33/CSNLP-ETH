It's almost like we've been pissed about this shit since the '60's, but does that make the fuckin' headlines?
Roughly 40% of the homeless youth in the US are some flavor of LGBT.
They need our help.
Trans folks in unsupportive families and bigoted areas have a sky high rate of suicide attempts - they're not doing it because they're trans, they're doing it because society treats trans folks like shit.
The rhetoric is getting worse not better its literally scary how many right wingers are blaming the victims and the LGBTQ community for bringing it on themselves.
The right calling us groomers and degenerates is going to get more and more people killed unless as many people as possible step up to push back against bigotry, forcefully.
If you compare the way they talk about trans people to what language the Nazis used against the Jews, it's identical.
Republicans want a trans genocide, and they're not going to stop after that.
The rest of the LGBT community is going to be next on their list, as Colorado Springs shows.
Anyone who's queer or any ally (aka "sympathizer") will be a target too.
I sometimes wonder if the human condition itself has a cap on how much space it's willing to give queer communities.
It feels rare to see "divergent" behavior in other cultures.
It makes sense.
I was first baffled when I heard about this and was wondering how far that really went.
