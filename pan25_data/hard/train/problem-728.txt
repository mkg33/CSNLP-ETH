That'd be impossible.
Russia only attacks hospitals and daycares, they'd never stoop so low as to hit a military target.
That's just ungentlemanly.
How are they supposed to fight back if you hurt their army instead of a bunch of strategically powerless civilians?
Nah, I don’t think it’s good to target civilians as revenge for an adversary doing so.
From a moral perspective it’s obviously unacceptable.
From a purely practical one, using cruelty as a weapon against the cruel tends not to work.
You could blow up a school full of Russian children and the leaders of Russia would simply get excited at the opportunity that represented for them.
This is why I said Ukraine should target what Russia values - its power and prestige in the form of weapon systems and warfighting infrastructure it cannot replace.
Of course, Ukraine is supplied by weapons made outside Ukraine, so this effect isn’t very helpful to Russia.
No one ever asked for direct intervention, and russia digging trenches on it's border is a pathetic stunt, because we both know Ukraine doesn't need to invade.
Just look up this sub.
Anytime ATACMS are discussed people are scares shitless of russian nukes or pretend to be that way.
