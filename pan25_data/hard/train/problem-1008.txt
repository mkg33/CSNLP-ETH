The problem is the existing budget is all going into giving the police more guns and giving them training classes that say they should be constantly looking for an opportunity to shoot someone, and after-murder sex is awesome.
Not if you consider how much funding is wasted on unneeded military grade equipment, and paying speakers to come to departments to tell officer the best sex they experience is after they put down a criminal, or that everyone wants them dead so they need to be afraid and approach every situation with adrenaline pumping.
Defunding also wouldn't hurt with reforms as the lack of multi million dollar lawsuits would make more funds available for therapy, descalation training, and hiring mental health staff to deal with members of the public in crisis instead of sending hyped up armed thugs.
This isn't true at all.
Police training nowadays includes a lot of talking points from trash like David Grossman's killogy.
They tell officers everyone wants to kill them.
They tell officers failure to respect their authority is tantamount to assault on an officer.
The training they undergo is explicitly to make them armed thugs the government can deploy who have had their humanity stripped away.
These cops were trained to treat perceived disrespect as violence against them and this is the result of that training.
Then again his training seminars are called killogy.
Fucking David Grossman is a monster and claims his words are taken out of context tho.
They don't need more funds to achieve this.
They need to stop wasting money on military grade equipment.
They need to get rid of the 90% bad eggs and hope the 10% of indifferent don't become bad eggs as properly trained replacements come in.
