On one hand I don't think that's the worst idea, on the other hand if the military situation was so far out of hand that bombs and missiles were hitting the US mainland, I can't help but imagine the war would have gone nuclear before that point.
Most of the stuff the West sending shouldn’t be new to Russia, and if they were a real super power, they would’ve updated their doctrine and gear to the capabilities of their potential opponents, you know, before starting a war.
If we had the capability to strike russian power plants we should've absolutely done that, albeit some military targets can be a higher priority.
Russia is wasting expensive and finite (they can’t make them post-2014 sanctions) guided munitions on pointless attacks against civilians that only spurrs them harder against Russia (which is always what happens when you do this).
Every cruise missile that strikes a transformer is one that doesn’t strike Ukrainian soldiers.
So even if they know exactly how it works, there is nothing they can do to replicate it before it’s beyond outdated.
They cannot manufacture the microchips needed for advanced weaponry, and everyone that does has sanctioned them.
