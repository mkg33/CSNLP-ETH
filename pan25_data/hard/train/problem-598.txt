I try to inform these rural Texas who spout about “their tax money” that they’re not even coming close to paying their own way, and wouldn’t have electricity, phones, internet, paved roads, etc.
if it weren’t for the blue cities in Texas and blue states in the US subsidizing the hell out of them.
They either don’t believe indisputable reality even with sources proving I’m right, or they come back with “what would the cities do without food, huh?” Well, we have money and hence can buy food from elsewhere if we had to.
And we’d have a lot more money if our taxes weren’t paying their bills plus our own.
At least with Flint they had the reasoning the city was bankrupt.
We’re doing just fine financially and otherwise here in Austin, even funding the red parts of the state to a huge degree with our taxes, the yokels just don’t like how we vote.
They have no problem taking a huge amount of our tax money though.
This dipshit claims he wants to lower taxes, a quarter of our property taxes could go away with no local impact if recapture was done away with.
The funny thing is , this is a bill to make the government even smaller, in terms of taxes and regulations.
Is there a way to find reports of where tax subsidization is redistributed among states?
I know a few folks here in Idaho that I'd really like to sober up every time they talk about being legally "robbed" by taxes.
