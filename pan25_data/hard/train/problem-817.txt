The middle ground of "I want to stab you a bunch" and "I don't want you to stab me" is "I will stab you a little.
".
Yup.
A good friend of mine does that.
Says he has a laundry list of qualifiers about who he's going to vote for.
Always votes for the republican, hasn't voted for a democrat in decades.
Claims he only chooses the best person for the job.
I usually call him out on it because its so freaking stupid.
i know this is stupid, but i had to look into how fucking stupid.
if you move from a blue state to a red state, you can lose your right to vote for 5 years.
but what if you're a MAGA wackadoo fleeing a blue state once the states call dibs on their color?!
?
Let me just ask.
Does she think red states would still get to vote for president of the united states if they left?
Does she not realize that DoD wouldn't be on their side?
They would immediately lose all Federal Funding for all the crap that goes on to their state.
Texas MIGHT, keyword, MIGHT be able to support itself, but add in every other Red State and this new "country" wouldn't have the U.S Army to defend them.
She seriously doesn't have a freaking clue how any of this works.
Well they would get Russia's army as Putin would accept them into Derma because Putin Desperately wants some land on North American Soil where he can land troops.
