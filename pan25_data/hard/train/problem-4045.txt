I’ll focus on the second question since a lot of people have answered the first.
The answer is that we have to completely restructure the role of police in society.
Removing qualified immunity and holding police accountable would go a long way but I think we ultimately have to restructure things from the cops to the courts.
At the end of the day this is what Abolish the Police means, it’s going to require so much reform that future law enforcement looks completely unrecognisable as what we call policing today.
Taking right wing extremism more seriously would also be a huge step forward since we know violent far right organisations like Atomwaffen have made a concerted effort to join Law Enforcement and the Military in an attempt to influence things from the inside.
They’ve been more successful becoming cops than soldier because there’s lower standards for joining the police.
Hold police to a \_higher\_ standard than civilians when it comes to criminal conduct, especially while on the job.
1% of better quality of people in law enforcement is better than nothing, so is 5%, 10% and so on.
Nothing’s gonna change overnight, but it’s better than actively doing nothing.
