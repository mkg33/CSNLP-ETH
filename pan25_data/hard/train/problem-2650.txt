The Iranian regime really wanted money and if America were to offer money + global economic integration again, they'd likely jump at the opportunity.
These types of statements almost always amount to nothing, Iran funds Hamas directly from what everyone gathers and Israel never makes an attempt at real war with Iran, because its army is big compared to Palestine.
Israel doesn't need a war to harm the nuclear program, so there's no reason for the war.
That doesn't prove anything other than Israel's willingness to violate the sovereignty of nations even in times of peace.
It certainly does not prove that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons.
Firstly, to date the IAEA has seen no evidence indicating a weaponization of Iran's nuclear program.
The enrichment levels are a little concerning, but on its own enrichment is not proof of weaponization.
On top of that, there is no evidence Iran has even decided to develop nuclear weapons.
And that's not me saying that, instead it's the US intelligence sector which is saying Iran has made no such decision.
I guess the question comes down to whether Iran is doing that of its own volition or because it simply does not have the capability due to foreign interference.
Besides that, all the fearmongers need to explain why it is that if Iran is trying to develop a nuke, that they would make deals with other nations to outsource uranium enrichment.
Those deals of which only ended because the United States pressured the other nations into ending the deals.
