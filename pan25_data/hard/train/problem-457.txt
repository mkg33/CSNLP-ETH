When the interest rate increases, it becomes more expensive to borrow money.
Would you rather borrow $100 at 1% interest, or at 5% interest?
Just a hypothetical here, let's say Ghana needs to buy one barrel of oil (currently around $80).
They need to convert their own currency to USD first in order to buy that barrel.
Currently, it takes 14.41 Ghanian Cedi (their currency) in order to get 1 USD.
Maybe that doesn't sound like a lot, but at the beginning of the year it was around 6 Cedi = 1 USD.
A HUGE difference.
A single USD is now 135% more valuable compared to the Cedi than it was on January 1.
Reduction in borrowing by companies means reduction in the supply of dollars (This is a very ELI5 statement).
That's one current goal of the Federal Reserve (maybe that's another ELI5 question).
TLDR; The Federal Reserve is fighting high prices in America.
That's one of the things they're required to do.
However, in fighting high prices in America, they're inadvertently harming the exchange rate of developing nations.
For example, yes Ghana can sell their gold for dollars, but they're getting fewer dollars for the same amount of gold now.
In this weird niche situation, it makes sense for Ghana to buy things with gold instead of dollars because the government is such a bad risk, they're almost cut off from international finance, and their foreign currency reserves are low.
