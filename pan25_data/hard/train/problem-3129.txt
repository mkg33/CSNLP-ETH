So many people in the US think Rich are those that make double the median income when we're really talking about those making 300 times the median income.
Hilarious that thereâ€™s like 22 million millionaires in the US alone, and they got 200 of them to advocate for higher taxes on the ultra rich, and they think this is a big deal.
You hear about millionaires saying that the rich should be taxed more, but do you ever hear about any of them donating to causes that would help facilitate this?
The millionaires who are supporting higher taxes for the ultra-wealthy aren't all doing this because they're compassionate people (though in all fairness, some of them are).
They're looking after their own interests as well, and that's fine.
This is what they see down the line if we don't make some changes soon:
The billionaires have been pretty successful in turning the tide of anger towards immigrants and poor, claiming that those people are the reason why there isn't enough tax revenue to cover basic services.
But their bullshit campaign can't last forever.
