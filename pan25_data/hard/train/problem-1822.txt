Because people still don’t get that we’re talking about 2023 Russia and not 1943 USSR.
They think Russia is this unbeatable super power with 10,000 tanks ready to go and millions of trained soldiers on stand by.
Honestly the only thing world class thing about the Russia military prior to February 2022 was their PR department.
Yes and no.
Russia certainly bungled a lot of things and they could have been a much more potent force than they turned out to be.
Also anyone who can put 5,000 tanks and 500,000 troops on the battlefield and then fire 10s of millions of artillery rounds at the enemy is certainly no one to laugh at.
In that sense I don’t blame people for overestimating Russia.
That said the degree to which Russia was overestimated was shocking.
I’m talking western analysts who thought Ukraine would be completely defeated in a week or two.
Hell even Poland did some war games a few years back and thought that Warsaw would fall within weeks if Russia attacked.
If I was writing a book on the largest western intelligence failures post WWII I would certainly include a chapter on the degree to which the west overestimated Russia.
The West has a lot of intelligence failures regarding Russia.
The fall of the USSR took everyone by surprise, too.
Not to mention the fact that the first thing that the US learned from its spy sattelites at the beginning of the space age was that the USSR had way fewer missiles than they thought.
If there's anything Russia is good at it's appearing more powerful and stable than they really are.
I mean they don’t even need to invade Russia, just a country that Russia’s supposedly “protecting”.
Then again I think there’s some similar shit going on in Romania.
