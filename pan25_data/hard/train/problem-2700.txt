I totally agree.
I would pay for another seat plus fees to let my dog fly with me in the rare times that I want/need them to come on a flight, but the only option is for them to fly with luggage where dogs have died or have been severely traumatized from the experience.
It’s up to the airline and it has never happened, which is likely due to not enough pet owners being open to paying extra and/or having restricted choice of flights in order to be able to fly with their pets.
I’m a pet owner and yet your response is disingenuous to the conversation at hand, in fact several airlines allow non-service animals to travel in cabin if they are under 50lbs / can fit under the seat for safety of all fellow passenger which - typically limited to 8 pets per flight.
Likely in part because from the pet’s standpoint, touristing around is not worth the stress of a plane trip, and most people won’t travel with pets for business… so the vast majority of people taking pets in planes (aside from service animals) are probably moving from one state or country to another.
And the pet owners who cheat their emotional support pig onto the plane usually fly economy because they're not prepared to pay what it would cost to fly service animal accommodation class.
Pet owners are not availing themselves of the services of a pet friendly airline within the limits of thats airlines allowance for such services.
