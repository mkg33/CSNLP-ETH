Tell lenders your assets are appreciating astronomically (bigger loans with them as collateral) and tell the IRS they’re depreciating like mad.

We know rich people have lots of avenues to skirt tax laws, its not just Trump.
I saw an interview and Trump voters think he’s smart for not paying taxes and want to be exactly like him when they are rich.
At his 2016 presidential debate with Clinton, trump literally said that not paying any taxes meant that he was smart.

Homeless people paid more in taxes than trump.
