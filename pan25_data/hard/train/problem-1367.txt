As a student you are required to buy your own access to your school's Outlook and electronic services.
You can't share your .edu email with other students, especially if it's used for testing.
You can't share your school zoom account with others for the same reasons, cheating.
Netflix is not treating students any different than the school does, which requires prompt payment for their services rendered.
Netflix pissing off students means those students are less likely to pay for the service once they have their own careers.
Sounds like you're a Netflix employee to sell their services so hard.
You'd know that tons of people are quitting Netflix, if you would have checked reddit forums lately.
It's non sensical to think I'll be using 4 different screens under the same house to watch Netflix.
They promoted sharing, now all they promote is greed.
Again, it's not the same thing.
Once you give in to TV it'll be the same for every screen.
Have they defined what's a TV?
They'll just downsize the definition of a TV to include every screen.
That's a pretty apologist situation and a very dangerous one.
Every service you use online will then ask for a charge when you change your location.
Is it really the right thing?
And once implemented it'll be for all, not just the rich.
