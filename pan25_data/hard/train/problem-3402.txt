Spend $millions on lawyers to keep the files from being opened, while knowing those same files would show a Billionaire paid less taxes than the millions of people struggling to make ends meet working their lower middle class jobs?
(All while blaming them for not being smart because they didn't cook their own books).
For years he has been openly bragging about how brilliant he is by finding loopholes in the tax code and yanking on them to exploit the system to his own advantage -- at the full expense of those beneath him on the financial hierarchy.
Without a hint of irony or thought that maybe even “loopholes” might just be patently illegal fraud, that the president should probably be held to a higher standard, and that all those other rich people should probably not be getting away with skirting tax laws.
One person said something to the effect of, “well yeah, because he’s smart and pays smart people to ensure he uses every tax loophole.” And another responded, “Yep, every other rich person does the same thing.”.
For a guy who is a self declared "stable Genius" he sure doesn't know many people (dinner with anti semites) or what is going on with his taxes.
The best memory too.
