So anyone who might have experience with the needs of a giant theme park won't be allowed to make decisions that affect the giant theme park.
I know the Republicans will claim this is to avoid conflict of interest or "prevent Disney from controlling the board that makes decisions that only affect Disney World," but it sounds to me like the classic Republican "people with experience in X are the elites and need to be kept away from decisions regarding X.
".
But yes.
If Disney took off the kid gloves and decided that only Disney was in serious peril until they put DeSantis in his place, they could crush him.
Disney has too much money, they are too important to Florida, and a brawl with a beloved entertainment company is the last thing he needs when thinking about a run for President.
They could start investing more into Disney Land, but it would be a huge risk for them to start pulling focus away form their flagship theme park.
DeSantis is counting on Disney not being able to really move out of Florida.
Which is a pretty safe gamble.
Itâ€™s a safe bet.
Plan for power outages, tourists getting beaten and arrested by panicky cops, broken traffic signals, food poisonings, leaking roofs, infested hotel rooms and more.
