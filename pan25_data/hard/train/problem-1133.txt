Mitt Romney is the absolute best benchmark for watching how the GOP is shifting.
Back in 2008 he was considered a radical conservative, and now he's considered one of the most moderate Republicans in the party, and he hasn't changed his positions.
As someone who was active in the GOP primary and a Romney supporter in 2008, I can assure you he was not at all percieved as a "radical conservative".
He was constantly mocked on the stage by folks like McCain and Giuliani, who weren't super conservative themselves, for being a RINO and not a real conservative.
He was a moderate as governor and pretty transparently flip-flopped on several issues leading into 2008 to be more of a standard conservative (not some radical one though).
I disagree with this idea that Trump was elected as a response to Obama.
If that was the case, all of these folks that helped Trump win would've shown up to vote for Romney, and Obama wouldn't have been re-elected.
Trump was a reaction to establishment politicians like Clinton and Bush, not to Obama being black.
That is why there were so many Obama->Trump voters in places like the Midwest.
More like Trump supported 99.9% of the GOP agenda, which Romney also happened to support already.
Not sure why you act like Romney only voted for those things just because Trump wanted them.
