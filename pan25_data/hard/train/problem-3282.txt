Do you really think Sweden's freedom of expression was under fire here?
In a long list of priorities, burning qurans and waving pkk flags around at the Turkish embassy while Sweden is trying to join NATO is a pretty selfish, entitled, stupid move.
Sure, these right winger nut jobs are a little less silly to you and I than someone religious getting offended by it.
But it's a fucking stupid thing to do at a piss poor time.
Europe needs Sweden and Finland in NATO.
Ukraine needs everyone's support from Russia and a stronger NATO is a better deterrant against Russian aggression.
Burning religious books to piss off Turks is counter productive.
Burning a book in protest of the presence of those that believe in the book is hateful, xenophobic.
Hate the text, debate the human, but don't hate the human just because they identify with a system of religious texts and beliefs.
The reason why the book is burning matters.
Why is everyone being obtuse and pretending burning any book in any context is the same?
I am not a Muslim.
With that being said, Muslims view the Quaran as a collectively owned resource and have many traditions on how to maintain and manage that resource, such as washing your hands before touching one.
Acceptable ways to retire an old Quaran is burying it, sinking in a river, or burning it completely and then burying it or sinking the ashes.
Right-wingers claim to be protesting the book and ideology, but the point of the protest is to offend and disrespect the people that adhere to it.
That's xenophobic.
Again, protesting against Islam and it's ideology is not inherently xenophobic.
They are burning the Quran, not their passport.
If religious fanatics moved into my neighborhood, I would be upset too.
It wouldn't matter if they are immigrants or moved from within the country.
