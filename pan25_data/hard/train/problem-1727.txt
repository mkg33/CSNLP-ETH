It’s not so easy to pull out when you have a significant amount of Abrahams Tanks delivered to the Ukraine.
Simply because you maybe want these back after the war.
An other trust/security method could be that the US will deliver Abrahams to NATO Countries as a replacement for the Leopard 2 Tanks for free, similar to the „Rinausch“ where Germany exchanged UDSSR Tanks from Eastern Europe allies against Leopard 2 Tanks, and delivered the UDSSR Tanks to Ukraine.
I think the idea is that the Abrams tanks are more a symbolic gesture to help Germany be more comfortable with sending their more practical (for the situation) Leopard tanks.
An announcement about the tanks could be part of an attempt to break a diplomatic logjam with Germany, which indicated to the US last week that it would not send its Leopard tanks to Ukraine unless the US also agreed to send its M1 Abrams tanks.
The timing around the actual delivery of the tanks is still unclear and it normally takes several months to train troops to use the tanks effectively, officials said.
The Biden administration is finalizing plans to send US-made Abrams tanks to Ukraine and could make an announcement as soon as this week, according to three US officials familiar with the deliberations.
