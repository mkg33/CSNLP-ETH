Oh shit, I have MassHealth.
I didn't know he was partly responsible for starting it up.
I know the ACA funded it dramatically later on but that's very cool nonetheless.
I enjoy having a $35/mo prescription cap and having no monthly premiums meanwhile maintaining basically full coverage.
I love this state.
Romney is a classic republican, he still has wacked out political views, but he has at least a modicum of integrity and he knows crazy bullshit when he sees it.
Romney is the old school Republican that I just strongly disagree with on policy, not the new breed that I nearly universally disagree with and goes out of their way to be terrible people.
After Romney lost, his concession speech and actions over the next few months convinced me he has principles and reasons for them, I just disagree with him on most major policies.
He's the last Republican I think that's true about.
He's always been bipartisan.
He's one of the few senators that consistently votes based on his values, and not just based on the party line.
He was always anti-Trump (working with the leader of your party is not kissing his ass), and consistently votes based on his values and positions, regardless of what the party line is.
He has more of a spine than 90% of congress.
