They are doing alot India is getting rich off it, not just from the cheap oil but rolled steel as well, at least Russia is not getting their full international market value.
That’s crude steel but The Russians are undercutting local more advanced steels and seems India is buying all that Russia can supply and then exporting it ….
That is a key demand Ukraine is barred forever from joining NATO.. Russia gets to keep at very least Crimea with the water (Rights)switched back on.
So they don't recognize Crimea but they think there should be a cease-fire while Russia holds it?
You do realize that a cease-fire only helps Russia right now don't you?
Russia holds those territories which are rightfully Ukraine's so all a cease-fire would do is allow Russia to regroup and strenhen in those areas.
So basically China proposing the cease-fire that RUSSIA WANTS is only them trying to help Russia.
China is explicitly siding with and supporting Russia so why are they pretending to be neutral?
The Chinese "peace proposal" is not even calling for Russia to leave the illegally occupied territories.
Unless the so called peace plan from China involves Russia going home and leaving all Ukrainian territory there is nothing to talk about.
Russia cannot be allowed to keep any land, be it Donbas or Crimea, as that will only embolden Russia to lick its wounds, rebuild, rearm, and try again in a few years time to take even more Ukrainian land.
So basically China's "peace plan" is let's let Russia keep Donbas and Crimea and Ukraine fucks off until Russia has time to recover and invade again.
Wow what a surprise.
They just took Russia's last cease-fire request and wrote "by China" at the bottom of the page.
