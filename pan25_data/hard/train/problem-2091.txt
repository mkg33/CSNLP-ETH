I believe in the Baker's right to refuse service to anyone.
I also know it's illegal for the government to deny the marriage of same sex couples.
They can get married and have every legal right that comes with, but they might have to find someone else to bake their cake, do they really want a homophobe making their cake anyway?
And also the law you're suing about doesn't even prevent you from not making a cake for a same sex couple:
Correct.
0 clients want this persons services - gay or straight.
It's an entirely theoretical business.
The web designer at the heart of this particular case was never ask to create a website for anyone - gay or straight - so they've never had to refuse to provide service.
The court just found some wack job who would put their name to this case so that they could legislate from the bench.
SCOTUS just cherry picks cases so that they can legislate from the bench.
5 SCOTUS judges have centered their entire lives around believing that gay people are less than human and so they took this made up case so that they could make new laws and they're going to keep doing it until someone stops them.
Maybe one of the Liberal justices can ask the petitioner’s lawyers to point out where in the New Testament Jesus instructed His followers to discriminate against da gays.
Perhaps it’s right after Love they neighbor” or “thou shalt not judge”?
