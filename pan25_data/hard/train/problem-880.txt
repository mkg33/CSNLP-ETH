So how do you describe the number, depth, and severity of lies this man has made?
Comical?
Ludicrous?
Astronomical?
Requiring a new unit of measurement because our existing ones simply don't properly grasp the scope?
I would like to propose "Santostical" as a new adjective explicitly for describing a) a singular, incredible lie, b) a set of lies made by one man that come together to paint a fantastic false reality, and c) a man who made such a set of lies.
Plethora seems insufficient at this point.
The scope of his lies and sheer shamelessness in lying AND in taking responsibility for his lies defies reason entirely.
When lies you tell start to open you up to perjury and you lie about things that are for no particular reason, it becomes abnormal and problematic beyond simply being an asshole.
This man seems categorically incapable of speaking truth, about anything.
The fact that he's being cynically retained by the GOP for his vote in the house instead of immediately expelled is beyond galling.
