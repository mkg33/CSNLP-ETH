I can't speak for the average person, but from what I experienced and what I saw in my family, it wasn't necessarily Escobar, but the surrounding gangs.
My older brother was robbed at gun point a couple of times.
Police was less than helpful.
I remember one time in particular in the late 80s where someone on a motorcycle rode by firing some sort of automatic weapon at every house, including my grandparents, where we lived.
This was in Envigado, Antioquia BTW.
A lady across the street was shot from the balcony and I saw her rag doll off the balcony and into the sidewalk.
A lot of blood and screaming.
As a kid, I didn't really get hassled.
I moved to the states in 1992.
Don't worry about it!
Colombia has done a 180 since then.
They're on par with the states now in terms of tech, health, and education.
I'm very proud of that.
I remember seeing a couple of brutal and senseless murders a block or two away that I haven't forgotten.
Yeah I remember when all the violence kicked off a year or two back, some of the videos were horrific.
Didnâ€™t the cartels even bring down a chopper with a damn rocket launcher?
So the cartel killed people and won?
Wtf?
So we are teaching them that killing people is effective at accomplishing objectives?
Well guess what that leads to?
More killing when the cartel is upset.
This is not.
This.
The headline is clickbait because it implies ties the killings to the extradition when the extradition process in Mexico is just slow (closer to years than days).
The headline is such clickbait.
It implies the killings are causal with the extradition being stopped.
The extradition being stopped was done by a judge because extradition from Mexico is hard if the person to extradite fights it with good lawyers .
Some of the Zeta Cartel leaders caught years ago are barely being extradited.
