As far as i can tell the change in ownership hasn't really obviously skewed the politics of their reporting.
Probably that's partly due to the fact that there's already an established culture in the KTVU newsroom, and partly i imagine that, if for no other reason, the management understands its audience and the demographics of the Bay Area and know it would be a losing proposition to go all Tucker Carleson on the station's ass.
But they have brought the stations aesthetic (things like colors, logos, etc.)
in line with the greater FOX brand, and i have no idea what kind of more subtle news direction choices are being decided behind closed doors (i.e.
maybe they're not shoving super conservative slants down peoples' throats, but maybe they're choosing not to cover smaller local stories about progressive victories or whatever either), so that's something to be cognizant of and watch out for over the next little while.
That being said, KTVU has come under more direct FOX control in recent years.
Previously, while channel 2 was FOX programming, the actual news was owned and run by a different company, but a few years ago FOX bought it and started running it themselves.
I believe the gentleman above you was actually agreeing with you - he was refuting the fact that this was a FOX slanted article by pointing out that it was the local affiliate's article, not FOX News' article.
The alternative is that my father is just interpreting the local news to be supportive to his views regardless of what they are actually reporting.
This could be likely as well.
He's been known to say that people agree with him when, in reality, they disagreed but just not forcefully enough in his mind.
Exactly.
My father claims that all of his local news stations agree with what he hears on FOX News.
I'm wondering whether any of his local stations are Sinclair and thus parrot the same stuff FOX does.
