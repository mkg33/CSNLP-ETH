"Test"?
Test of what?
Everybody knows the elections in Russia are some of the biggest jokes on the planet.
(Unmonitored) Russian citizens would be the first to tell you that much.
It's not like they've been somehow fooled into thinking Putin legitimately won all elections, and legitimately changed the law to give himself unlimited mandates.
The only thing this would be useful for would be convincing Russians who, by some miracle, have not noticed that Putin's "elections" are criminal and laughable - but at this point, I can't say I believe that any Russian who acts like this is any more than just a Putin supporter that acts apathetic.
I'm not claiming that majority of Russians are oppressed innocents, probably far from it and currently much less than the sum of "apolitical" majority and active putin supporters.
But the opposition forces are higher than we notice on the first glance.
Somebody is brave enough lighting buildings on fire, many are in prison or in forced immigration, some are moving out of the country themselves with their capital and tax money, few even participate in public activism still, but even more are just anonymously voicing their opinion online...
Still not enough, but shouldn't be ignored imo.
Tsardom, USSR and Federation are all authoritarian states, but differ in many significant ways.
Absolute monarchy, totalitarian socialism, informational autocracy all have varying approaches to population control and different core values/ideologies guiding their decision making process.
Current regime learned lessons from previous iterations for sure, but I think it started a development of it's own toolset with Putin coming into power, with 2014 and Crimea annexation marking the moment when it fully formed in what we see today.
