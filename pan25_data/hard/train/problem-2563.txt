You're not wrong.
But as a practical matter Russia is already set up this way (Putin "owns" Gazprom and simply allows it's CEO to act like a minister in his government or a trusted subordinate).
You'd never want the official head of a country to also be the official head of a company because running a country takes a huge amount of work and you ultimately will need to delegate every kind of sub-division to someone else.
Minister of Education, CEO of State oil company, Minister of Defence, etc.
etc.
etc.
etc.
If you want to think about it like an org chart, if Biden woke up today and said, "you know what, screw Apple, I want the CEO gone, I want them to move all their production to America, I want my face to come pre-loaded as the lock screen image" can he pull that off?
No, not a chance.
If Putin wanted the equivalent from Gazprom?
One phone call and every barrel of oil will have his face on the side and the CEO will fall out of a window onto seven bullets that just so happened to have been laying on the cement facing up exactly where he fell.
What you sometimes get (and let's say there's some debate about where America is on this spectrum), are situations where the government and companies are TRULY separate entities and are pulling away from each other as they compete for power within a society and government finds itself increasingly unable to control a company.
...where large companies gradually take over governments with their own police force, army, legislative institution, lobby or rather direct influence that effectively controls politicians, and so on.
Just thinking aloud: Now I an curious if there were no complaints for example from Tencent or other big Chinese developers when politicians proposed a law to restrict screen time for kids/adolescents.
Video games are creating such a big revenue for Chinese developers.
