That seems pretty reasonable to me, but it is way down in the article.
Also, this makes a lot of sense:
Good points.
Given how poorly the US scores on all of those metrics, Iâ€™d be interested to see what happens when a country intentionally encourages its own economy to import all of its goods.
US companies already pay import tariffs on components and finished goods imported, so it would be nothing new, other than in scale and structure.
So, it would influence the "build here" versus "contract manufacture" decision, as well as add a level of consideration to where and how that contract manufacturing gets done.
How do you think things get done now?
It's a largely opaque system based on political whim and closed door negotiation.
If, on thebother hand, there were a scoring system with a published, publicly available specification for scoring and publicly available audit reports, it would be pretty transparent.
And, with the wealth of reporting by credible journalism, as well as a growing range of open data sources on things like carbon emissions and human right violations, if there's a major discrepency between what a nation or entity should have scored and how it was scored, it will be obvious, and countries or companies with a competitive interest will be sure to raise that issue.
You know what I'd like to see?
A tariff system tied to a composite score based on environmental protection/decarbonization, human rights, and labor rights.
As with any big change, it would be best done with a soft start, getting the key elements of the scoring system in place, with minor changes to the base rate, and then start cranking up the base rate, giving countries with poor environmental, labor, or human rights time to consider what access to the US market is worth to their economy, and US companies time to shop for new CMs.
