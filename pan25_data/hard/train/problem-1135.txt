In the first phase of the pandemic, we didn’t have ANYONE come to the ER.
Then we had a few covid people come in, then we had to watch a lot of people die of covid, then we had a lot of people coming in like, “oh who cares, the government is lying about it” after we just had to watch a lot of people (with a wide variety of ages and risk factors) die in front of us, completely helpless to do anything about it.
So when it comes down to it, I feel like many providers have already said to themselves, “what happens if I get covid and die?” And accepted it.
Not only that, but we’ve gone through the phase of trying to convince people that something we’ve seen with our own eyes is real and important, and been shouted down by people who hid when they heard about “a new SARS-like virus out of China”.
I think we need a “deadbeat dad” phase of the WHO, where it’s just like, “wait, how old are you?” while the usual protesters are saying “hey there’s a serious problem here”.
I know we’ll continue to approach future pandemics with the same warnings, caution, and advisories, but I want everybody to know that when we stepped up and risked our lives and health, we were met with a deafening silence as the world watched to see what happened to us.
Many of us would do it again.
Many of us wouldn’t.
When we inevitably get our next pandemic, 🤷🏻‍♂️.
Scientists were saying for decades how unprepared we were for a pandemic.
Sure enough COVID comes along, continues to fuck things up, and exposes just how fragile everything was: supply chains, geopolitics, economy, trust in science, civility.
