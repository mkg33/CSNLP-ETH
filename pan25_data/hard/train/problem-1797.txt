Allowing certain disabled people to be paid less than the normal minimum wage is the only way some of these people can even have jobs.
Why would a business hire an employee they'll definitely lose money to keep on?
Charity?
Unless the minimum wage is set at what's profitable to pay for a very mentally disabled person to work, the minimum wage will result in those people losing their jobs entirely.
3) If a disabled person genuinely cannot work at the deemed exchange rate for minimum wage, and they aren't super-happy at their current job...then maybe they should be doing something else with their time and paid a livable amount just to exist because they aren't capable of working (competitively)?
Again, we're the richest country on Earth, people shouldn't have to work to support themselves if they can't or just don't want to.
2) We're the richest country on Earth.
We should be able to pay everyone a living wage if they're giving our time to us through working, either through the employer's money or through subsidizing what the employer can give in order to produce a living wage for the disabled employee(s).
