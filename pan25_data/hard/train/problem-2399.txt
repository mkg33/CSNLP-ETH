> The attorney generalâ€™s office admitted in its letter to the court that the firearms safety courses that are required before someone can obtain a permit to buy a gun are not yet available.
Require a permit to purchase a gun: While yes this makes sense, when the state enacting the law does not provide funding to setup said permit program, or provide police the resources need to hold classes and approve permits, then it becomes a de-facto ban.
If this law went into affect, you couldn't purchase a firearm until everything else with police, trainings, and permits went into place.
This is the part that was no thought through.
I'm talking about a nationwide "do not sell firearms" database where if a person is ineligible to possess a firearm, like committing crime or mental health, then no matter where they move or go they will be unable to purchase a firearm.
Ban on magazines over 10Rds - okay whatever, I would've liked to see more nuance in the law putting a deference between caliber or type.
