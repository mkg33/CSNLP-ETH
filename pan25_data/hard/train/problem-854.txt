And now he gets to be the sacrificial lamb for the elites.
The conspiracies they scream about are done by them, LOL.
"Trump was a useful idiot to distract, the Federalist society and Heritage Foundation picked the SC Judges and got their tax-code changed.

This.
Biden's administration is a shining example of not letting perfect be the enemy of good.
Progress is slow, but there's progress.
Reminds me a lot of Obama in this way.
Clinton and Obama both had these.
Clinton was so successful in economic, domestic and foreign policy that the GOP took the only tack they could, and deliberately did everything they could to stymie him with unprecedented attacks on his private sex life.
Obama was hamstrung by racist backlash and the need to actually give the GOP a chance.
I also think Obama legitimately had to give the GOP a last chance to step up, so the majority of the US really could see no legitimate shared compromise was possible.
Simplest answer: Biden's experience, empathy, skill in working with others, and willingness to change his mind and negotiate with others in the legitimate interest of achieving positive results.
I think that, in addition to Biden's own merits, their examples helped provide Biden with lessons, experience and experienced people to work with.
As well as providing the majority of Americans and experience of what the Democrats were dealing with, so Biden had a stronger negotiating position.
And the presidency of Trump solidifying that majority understanding.
