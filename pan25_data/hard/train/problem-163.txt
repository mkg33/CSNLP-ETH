Trump running in 2016 was absolutely a publicity stunt, but Trump himself quickly became addicted to the fame, pomp, and prestige of the position.
A lot has happened since 2016, Trump certainly has rabid fans but most rational people have drawn their line with him and it's becoming clear he's electoral poison after one fluky win.
They are correctly assessing (and confirming) that Trump's candidacy for 2016 was all a show he wasn't supposed to win, and that him running again is like a show that ended but for some reason was picked up for one more season and it sucks a lot.
They don't want to be a part of it.
They don't want to purge them.
They just want to marginalize them again.
They want them locked back up in the attic, ready to vote on election day, but otherwise being on the periphery.
Seriously.
I feel like if I went back and took any random day from the Trump administration it'd have the kind of wacky thing any other president would have brought up all the time.
For Trump, it was just Tuesday.
Like, Jimmy Carter took shit for fending off a swamp rabbit.
HW Bush vomited on the Japanese prime minister.
W had the shoe dodge.
