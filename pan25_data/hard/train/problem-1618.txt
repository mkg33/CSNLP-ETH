While the context is important, it's been a year since the full-scale invasion started.
Every day the war takes the lives of innocent people.
If the Swiss wanted they would have already changed their laws.
For me, it's hard to understand how supplying \defence\ systems would break their neutrality principles.
Swiss can allow to supply systems to defend energy infrastructure faaar away from the frontlines.
For example today’s missiles targeting Chernivtsi flying over Moldova and Romania.
Maybe I’d understand if Swiss never ever supplied arms outside Switzerland, but that’s not the case.
To me it sounds like omission (hope it’s the right term).
Just imagine if one day someone will attack Switzerland and everybody around them will stay neutral.
So I would say the Swiss are neither neutral nor intelligent when it comes to handling their "neutrality".
Maintaining neutrality until the bad guy wins and decides to take you over seems like a pretty stupid idea.
And financially aiding one combatant in a war over the other doesn't seem very neutral even if it is to protect yourself.
Even if you don't think it is, sending weapons in any way shape or form is picking a side, righteous or not, and therefore not neutral.
They are neutral to the point where you get complaint threads like this, they aren't a military threat and they aren't doing anything to help anyone's enemies.
You could go after their land but there's not much worth taking that you could take in a war.
