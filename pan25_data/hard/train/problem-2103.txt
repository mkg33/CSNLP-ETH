For many years, no one really cared about the fact that the signature requirements for an initiative to get on ballots no longer corresponded to what the federal government said were Mississippi’s congressional districts.
Numerous initiatives were passed, none of which have been retroactively invalidated as far as I know.
Their reasoning was that to qualify for ballots, state law said that an initiative had to present an equal number of petition signatures from each of the state’s five congressional districts (a requirement meant to ensure that Jackson couldn’t get do a ballot initiative on its own.

We already had this in Flint.
State came in to take over the finances, appointed a board without any voter input.
They went for cheaper water supplies, but needed more chlorination because of the contamination.
The extra chlorination corroded the cities ancient water pipes, releasing unsafe levels of lead into the supply.
And thus we got the Flint water crisis.
