Patriot can do it and Ukraine is getting ONE for the whole country after a year of asking for it.
It's great it is finally happening but I don't understand the reason for such a delay and providing only one system.
Ukrainians could definitely be trained to use it, that can't be an excuse.
Ukraine can use their own weapons for anything they desire.
NATO, on the other hand, does not want to have their provided weaponry attacking russia proper.
At this point in the war, NATO wants nothing to do with the appearance that they are arming Ukraine for the specific purpose of attacking russian territory.
"n the Armed Forces of Ukraine there are no fire devices capable of shooting down this type of missile.
".
Oh.
I misread your first comment entirely.
I read it as they were being launched from the bomber and then flying 4000km to their target.
You were saying that the bombers were stationed that far away lol ignore me.
Am dumb.
How are they able to fly that far?
A quick google search suggests that their max operational range is only 600km.
Are they really able to improve the range by that much simply by launching from a high altitude?
