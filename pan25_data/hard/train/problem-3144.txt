Armed black self defense groups like the Deacons of Defense were critical in protecting the lives of civil rights organizers in the 50s and 60s.
Imagine if all the Klan had to do was get their racist sheriff buddy to petition a friendly judge to have law enforcement roll up on the homes of their targets and seize all of their arms without trial without any suspicion of any crime.
They could come back that night and know they could safely lynch the lot of them with zero resistance.
There is absolutely no legitimate reason for these brazenly unconstitutional laws to exist.
Terroristic threats are already illegal.
If someone made one, charge them with a crime.
Otherwise the government has no legitimacy to deprive a person.
Red flag laws are utterly disgusting and contemptable.
A total nullification of the presumption of innocence, the right to arms, the right to property, the right to a trial before jury of your peers, and the right to face your accuser, all in one tyrannical package.
If someone did something bad enough to justify stripping them of their 2A rights and their property, then charge them with a crime, arrest them, have a trial in a court of law before a jury of their peers, convict them, and then you can do that.
No, if they actually committed said crimes, then the solution here is to charge them for it, have a trial, convict them, and then they can be barred from purchasing a gun.
If someone has a history of domestic abuse and was never charged, then they should be able to buy a gun?
Even if they express a desire to harm?
What is a "desire to harm others" here?
Because if they made an actual threat, then thats a crime.
The police can arrest them for that.
They have literally never needed red flag laws to do so, thats always been illegal.
