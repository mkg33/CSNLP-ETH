I heard a story about a young person who became very concerned that she was mentally ill and hearing voices but a doctor was able to determine by simple questioning that she was confused and was just experiencing her own thoughts.
Very few eligible voters actually vote.
It’s a hassle for a lot of people to vote and they don’t feel like their vote would make a big enough difference to make the effort.
Overall, right now, the EC is really just a way to disenfranchise votes, and has gone a long way in giving the impression to people that their votes just don't matter.
So, if say, you're state has 10 EC votes, and 40% vote dem, and 60% vote rep, then the republicans get 10 EC votes, and not 4EC for dem, 6EC for rep.
Having the EC vote be more representative of the actual vote would be more fair, and probably close enough to reality that it would be good enough.
The upside is that more states would be campaigned to, although individual districts may be ignored.
The downside is....at least for republicans, is that they'd probably lose more elections.
