It sounds good but how are you going to fund it?
Thereâ€™s an aging demographic so less people paying into the pension but longer life expectancy so more people withdrawing from the pension.
I'm not advocating for anyone else paying for my retirement, I'm advocating for ensuring the pension that I'm currently paying for others to have is still available when I retire in 30 years.
So, while raising the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64 may indeed allow to collect more retirement contributions from worker (as well as decreasing the amount or retirement pension to pay!
), this specific aspect of the reform is perceived as disproportionately penalizing poorer, diplome-less workers (who possibly have a lower life expectancy on top of that).
And when the government pushing this project claims that it's for protecting our redistributive tax system, it's really starting to sound like BS.
Hence the angry population.
With the government showing no intention to negotiate whatsoever, this whole thing is rousing quite a wide range of the population.
Even if they raised sound arguments for this reform, it would be difficult to be heard anyways.
