Ukraine's already hit Russia though.
Russia just doesn't want to admit it.
If Ukraine hits Russian metropolitan areas like Moscow though, then that'll give Russia a reason to use their nuclear weapons.
We'd most likely trigger article 5 and use conventional forces to clean sweep the Russian military off the face of the earth over a couple weeks time.
Unless that didn't pan out well.
Then nukes.
Absolutely agree.
I don't think NATO/the West would preemptively attack.
So, it's a matter of counterattack after a Russian 1st strike.
That 1st strike has the potential to be devastating.
So, it's a classic situation of mutually assured destruction to some extent.
If Russia doesn't wipe out conventional western forces, then we'd likely strike in force with conventional forces in response to a low yield nuke.
If it was a widespread attack that severely limited conventional forces, then you'd likely see a direct nuclear response.
Either way, it's a scary scenario for all.
The collective western military capabilities dwarf Russian capabilities and they're well aware of how weak their position is.
That's why they keep threatening to use those nukes with zero intentions of crossing the unforgivable line.
They are already sanctioned, having veto and nukes makes any compensation unlikely.
Although the cut in gas and oil from EU is going to hurt them a lot.
The existing buyers, India and China aren’t paying market price so that’s a loss too.
