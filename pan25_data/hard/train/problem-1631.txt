Surprisingly I moved in September, my rent actually went DOWN by $400 and it’s harder now for me to make it than it was just 6-7 months ago, I make $15 doing landscaping and am starving.
In 2021 I was making 9 fucking 50 and was swimming in extra money, what the fuck happened?
I couldn’t imagine having student debt on top everything else, I have $200 in collections I have no idea how I’m going to pay back, life is hard out here.
Today kids are going $200k into debt for an undergraduate degree, and some are continuing on from there.
Utterly insane.
When I finished undergrad in 2003, med school was $15k a year.
The next year it doubled, and by 2010 it was $50k a year.
In order to also live and pay rent, you'd have to go $250k+ into debt just to get a degree.
I thought that was insane, but at least you'd have an MD and eventually make serious salary.
In my field (public health) there are masters programs that charge $110k for a two year program now.
I paid $15k total for my MPH.
The average salary of an MPH is like $48k a year.
Imagine being 2.5x your starting salary into debt before you start work.
How tf are they supposed to do it?
My alma mater spent over a million dollars to update our logo and signs.
They took the , and added a .
It would take a 15 year old with bootlegged photoshop like 10 minutes to do that.
They paid $50k for the "art" and over a million to do the signs.
