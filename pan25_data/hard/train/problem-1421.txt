Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years.
What he really means is "Down with Progress--down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal," and "down with Harry Truman's fair Deal."
That's all he means.
That is true .
80s just demarcates where the Democrats truly started to ape Republicans in the post WW 2 era and given up on even the pretense of social democracy ( or a mixed.
economy).
since then you have even in the middle of a global pandemic the unwillingness to temporarily expand Medicare and overpayment into COBRA in fear of “Americans may like Medicare“.
Republicans call mixed economy socialism so you are missing the point.
They literallly call any one who disagrees with them a socialist or commie.
It is bad politics to play into their games.
The Republicans are not talking about actual socialism.
That’s just a way to attack whatever the Democrats do.
So even neoliberalism is “socialism.“ As is teaching kids that slavery happening.
So is a movie like Knock at a cabin.
So is a drag queen performance.
