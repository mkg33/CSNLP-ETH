The entire reason that governmental powers are specifically enumerated in the Constitution is to limit the powers to only what is enumerated.
If there is a list of governmental powers that is a limit as anything not on the list is out side of the legitimate authority of the government.
Then there are many of the amendments that even further specifically limit the powers of the government.
The bill of rights and semi-related amendments guaranteeing individual rights are just a small part of it.
Most of the constitution is guaranteeing rights that the federal government has over states.
The Constitution establishes the base laws that apply to all states.
That’s why you have the right to free speech, right to carry a weapon, right to remain silent, etc whether you’re in Florida or Oregon.
No law can restrict these rights.
If the system worked as intended, no law would.
We as a society have allowed people in government to convince us that no right is absolute.
It sets a horrible precedent.
Gun restrictions are on a long list of acts we should have never let our government do.
Well you have the right to carry a weapon, but there are still restrictions on what weapons you're allowed to carry.
I'm failing to understand where the line is drawn here on gun restrictions constitutionally.
