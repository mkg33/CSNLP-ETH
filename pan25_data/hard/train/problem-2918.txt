It doesn't make much sense for Republicans to vote for her when the gap between Dems and Reps in Arizona isn't that big.
It's not like a Republican candidate can't win an election there.
Democrats are going to have a hard enough time holding the Senate in 2024.
We don't need unforced errors.
In a state that elects senators by 3% margins, there is absolutely no good strategy in nominating a Democrat when a politician who's already caucusing with Democrats is running.
Republicans will win 99 times out of 100.
Sinema will pull off too many moderate Democrats for the Democrat to be elected.
Hopefully the Democrats would be able to win a 3-way race, but that will depend a lot on the quality of each party's candidate.
Myself, I think they should just go for it-- hit 'em with a three-way race, but do it hard enough it takes down both the Republicans and Sinema.
Now she can't be challenged at the primary level, if the Dems want to try to replace her by running another candidate, they risk kicking it to the Republicans in a three-way split.
