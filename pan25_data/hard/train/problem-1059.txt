That's very interesting.
I'm a little surprised they weren't at least somewhat prepared for this.
They knew Biden was going to Poland and "surprise" visits to Ukraine from world leaders have been a thing for nearly a year now.
Will Putin need to address the Joe Biden visit to Kiev?
There appears to be a very strong reaction among Kremlin supporters.
So if he does, then how soon and what do you expect to hear from Putin on the issue?
Is there a reasonable likelihood Putin could be toppled?
Or are the Russian elites far too corrupted and self-serving to think on the nation and the needless casualties of war.
Do the lower and mid level people in the Russian government think they’re going to win the war?
Or what does the Russian government see as the stopping point?
Like how do they envision a realistic ceasefire on what terms, with what kind of gains for Russia?
Lol, he’s supposed to be a former intelligence officer Ukraine is a heavily Russian speaking country next door to Russia.
The one foreign country Putin should have been informed about the public mood on most of all.
But is that understanding conveyed to Putin?
After all, he didn’t know Jack about Ukraine when he decided to invade and thought there would be broad support in Ukraine for a Russian takeover.
