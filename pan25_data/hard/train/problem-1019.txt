Literally saying the top lawyers in the country apparently told him that Pence needed to break the Constitution, in order to save the Constitution.

ALL THE PRESSURE is now on Pence.
This painted a MASSIVE target on his back, and likely led up to his tweet later blaming Pence, leading to the crowds to chant 'Hang Mike Pence'.
And for the fighting remarks, all of them were inflammatory, to cause anger in his base- but listen to some of the bullshit he said on that day;.
In both case, politics and the comedic skit, the prevailing logic is that the ends justify the means, even if they hated or still hate the “means” deep in their heart.
