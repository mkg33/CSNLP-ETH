I'm looking at the salaries of Harvard, which is a non-profit university, and there are multiple people there that make several million dollars a year.
I don't think they're raising tuition because they "don't get the budget they want.
".
I get it.
Republicans are bad.
My reddit scroll is functionally serving the same purpose that fox plays for boomers.
All of these articles just further normalize the outage.
Trust me faux news republicans are just as outraged about the free handout.
They view it as a free handout.
We view it as you mentioned.
The difference is we don't compromise.
I'm not making a false equivalence, but pointing out that their emotion or reaction is similar or the same when they are being told it's a free handout.
It's by design.
It doesn't change anything.
It's not apathy, I'm politically active and do what I can.
I'm just tired that no one can find common ground and just instantly jump in their camps instead of listening..... God, and any time someone points out something you Don't agree with, it must be a false equivalence or they are completely missing the point.
I think there are valid arguments against loan forgiveness that I chose not to agree with...
I understand that republican politicians are acting in bad faith on this entirely.
However, it's okay to understand where the average Joe is coming from when they are opposed.
Maybe someone who never had the opportunity for higher education or whatever it may be can have the thought that it would be nice to have a car loan forgiven or have some kind of break too.
There's lots of people that work hard that don't catch a break like this.
And there's lots of people that are well off that can take advantage of the nice bonus.
I think the bill itself needs a to be a lot more targeted and narrow on who is eligible.
