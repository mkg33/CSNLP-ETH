It's not really clear to anyone.
An article from Washinon Post points out how the numbers are confusing because the US is using a broad band of estimates that already had a disparity of at least 15k back in August.
We don't know where in that band the more recent 100k figure falls.
Could be on the high end so 80-100k or the low end of 100-120k.
Maybe somewhere in-between or the band could be even larger.
Not included in the article is a question of what multiplier the US estimates are using for death to casualty.
It's been stated in the past it is normally 2-3x, but Russian practices may mean more casualties are dying than expected.
And seeing how very bad Russian medical support is, far worse ratios than 1:4 or 1:3 dead:wounded can be expected.
To speculate that 1/10th of the entire Russian military is dead and that 25% of it's invasion forces are dead is far-fetched.
There'd literally be nobody left to fight.
The US Army maintains about 7-15% combat forces vs infrastructure support.
Even throwing people into a meat grinder during WW2 was 19% combat forces.
If Russia actually lost 10% of their combat forces they'd be entirely crippled.
Assuming WW1 level 'chuck bodies at the enemy' % of combat forces the US ran 28% combat forces.
Russia would have theoretically lost that.
It would have completely collapsed.
It's not mathematically possible for Russia to have 100k dead soldiers.
At a terrible deaths to wounded ratio you'd be at 200k out of commission.
Of around 400k troops sent in and 1.1M total military size it's just not 100k dead Russians.
They've only sent 400,000 or so.
They haven't had 1/4 of the entire invasionary force killed.
If Russia kept the standard 2-3x ratio that leaves 100k-0 people left.
If they were 1:1 they'd have half their forces left.
There's just no way 100k are dead.
Only one website is calling it 100k deaths.
Everyone else is reporting 100k casualties, including the US and UK intelligence reports and NGOs on the ground and a media project in Russia has barely identified 10k dead Russian soldiers by checking obituaries, social media posts and physically going to cemeteries to find headstones.
