I agree, also “Ted” Cruz’s real name is Rafael Edward Cruz and “Mitch” McConnell’s real name is Addison Mitchell McConnell.
Nothing wrong with either first name, but you KNOW that GOP base voters will denigrate both—racist and sexist, respectively, if I had to guess.
You can be sexist and still prefer a female candidate if you think she’s the best person to take away women’s rights and punish women more severely than the other guy.
Eh nothing special she flip flops way too much the only thing I’d like about her winning would be to piss off the left in the fact that the first female president isn’t a democrat.
Even if Trump wasn't in it, I don't like her odds simply because she has a vagina and the GOP has shown massive animosity towards women leaders.
Those leadership roles are "men's jobs" in their eyes.
If Biden runs, I think we see a different VP pick.
Outside of casting some Senate tie breaker votes, you don't see the same stories of her complimenting Biden and advancing his agenda like you had when Biden was Obama's VP.
In addition, whoever Biden picks as VP would basically be the presumed front runner for 2028 and it's very clear Harris would not have the pull needed to win the presidential election.
