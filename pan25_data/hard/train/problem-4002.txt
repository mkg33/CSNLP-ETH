I did the math of this: if every black person in America were to receive $5 million, that would be $234.5 trillion.
That’s 2.41 times the GDP of the entire PLANET.
Black people hold 4% of the wealth in America but are about 13% of the population.
But this proposal would place reparations for black people at several times the GDP of the United States.
How can the victim of policies that inhibit the growth of wealth be owed a larger slice of the pie than there is pie in existence??
I mean if this resulted in the racial wealth gap being closed that would be one thing but this proposal alone would result in black folks being owed far more dollars than currently exist and the equivalent of 2.4 earths of economic productivity.
That’s the high side, sure, but even if the number of black Americans who could access reparations were half the total number, that’s still the whole earth plus 20% or America times 4.
Heck is more than ten times the gdp of America.
All of America doing nothing but paying black folks for ten years.
So they really think the suffering of their ancestors entitles them to this today?
And I know that this is just supposedly for discrimination faced in San Francisco, by why is what black San Franciscans faced not worth the same as black people everywhere?
With the SF case it seems a case of lost economic opportunities when the tech giants came to town, but even if successful (which I doubt) .. think that would apply to all racial groupings of long term residents who lost out when the inevitable reverse discrimination lawsuits hits.
