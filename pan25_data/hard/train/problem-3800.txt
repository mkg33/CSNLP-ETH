I’ve always heard right-leaning folks make the argument that prayer has benefits similar to meditation that would be good for everyone.
It’s a bad-faith argument (pun intended.)
it’s not about prayer, it’s about creating another foothold for Christianity in schools.
It’s morning prayer time now, next it’s prayers at assemblies, then it’s faith-based events funded by the school.
It also blurs the lines between public schools and faith-based private schools which supports their other primary goal of getting government funding for Christian private schools.
In case it's not obvious, this is yet another bad faith argument by Christian groups, designed to add more Christian influence in schools.
These groups are antithetical to a democracy.
They literally want to push Christian religion in schools and turn the country into a theocracy.
They are singling out atheism as being a problem while literally trying to force their way into public schools to indoctrinate other people's children.
I hope they are ready for the Satantic Temple to be in their schools.
Imagine the pearl clutching when that happens.
