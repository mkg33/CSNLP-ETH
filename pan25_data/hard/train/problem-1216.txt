No and that's why it's going to take so long for the US to send their tanks, they need to be "downgraded".
Basically Germany wouldn't send tanks unless the US sent tanks, the US agreed so Germany and other NATO countries are sending tanks.
The US will send tanks but our tanks aren't just "tanks" they are a whole weapons system and would be too much for Ukraine to operate and maintain so we have to adjust them for Ukraine.
Yes, Ukraine will be able to make good use of all the tanks being sent, even the Abrams.
Not everything will be a front line vehicle, and some will be reserved for offensive actions like their recent thunder runs (which is the strategy that helped win them back the region around Kharkiv).
Specifically, there's usually water trapped in gasoline.
Additionally, some of the fuel can polymerize to the sides of the tank, carb parts, injectors, fuel lines, etc.
The fuel filter can get clogged as well.
The water itself can cause rust in the tank or anywhere it's allowed to settle and sit.
