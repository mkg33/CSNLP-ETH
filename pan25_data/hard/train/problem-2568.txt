Not quite.
It was done to give Russia geopolitical allies on its borders and maintain existing trade relationships.
But the relationship has always been Russia sending in troops to help its allies, and never its allies sending in troops to help them.
If there was no war in Ukraine there would also be no conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
Russia would have sent troops to Armenia to push the Azerbaijanis back.
And even though armenia is reliant on the CSTO do to Turkish-Azerbaijani aggression - is Russia doing anything for them?
Azerbaijan with the support of turkey literally controls actual Armenian territory, with Russia just giving thoughts and prayers.
Armenias own CSTO ally Kazakhstan supports Azerbaijan in its war against it.
Turkey is the reason Armenia is forced to go with CSTO rather than trying to build closer relations with NATO.
Turkey would also like to see itself as the big player in the region (as would Iran).
You forget that it was/is to Russia's benefit to show that they can keep the peace in their sphere of influence.
That's something only great powers can do and Russia is desperate to be seen as a great power.
That's because the "alliance" is supposed to help Russia.
The aid flows one way.
Being part of a Russian or Chinese alliance is like voluntarily becoming a slave to a corpulent dickhead.
They expect you to give them your labor and soul in exchange for the odd scrap of bread from their plate or pat on the head.
Armenia has been attacked repeatedly this last year.
Where was Russia's helping hand?
Non-existent, of course.
