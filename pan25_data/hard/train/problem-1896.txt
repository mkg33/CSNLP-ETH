Im saying that's exactly what happened under Bush.
And likely would have been an even bigger win for Democrats now.
So you got your Biden presidency but gave up a big majority in Congress for it.
And you couldn't even repeal Trump's corporate tax cuts.
Was it worth it?
I don't have to own the Republican House now or any bad stuff they pass in what will likely be a generation of Republican control.
Biden voters do have to own that.
You chose two years of Biden who couldn't even repeal Trump's signature legislation over a massive blue wave.
I'm just saying you should take responsibility for this Republican House.
That's all.
See the presidency is always more important than Congress to BNMW'S.
That's fine just own it.
Don't pretend you didn't choose the presidency over Congress.
Except the midterms went incredibly well for an incumbent President?
If your claim is that some other theoretical Democratic President would have somehow had an even better midterm, weâ€™re gonna need you to show your work on that one.
