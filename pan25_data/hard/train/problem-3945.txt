The fear is more that the collapse of Russia might bring instability to the region.
A partition of the territory (if not political but de facto) would see local armed conflicts.
The emergence of private military groups in Russia is a step in this direction.
Warlords fighting each other for control over those regions represent a high risk for the nukes they have.
The risk is not really of them using it (i don't think those warlords would be able to have control of both the nukes and the means to send them), but more the risk of them selling it to anyone.
Seriously tho, I think a lot of the Russian nuclear arsenal has been at risk of sale/pilfer for a very long time already.
In the 1990â€™s it was a fear that was discussed frequently in the press, along with the fear of Russia disposing of nuclear material improperly.
The fear of Russia's breakdown reminds me of the fear of Russia's attack, and then the fear of Russia's escalation.
We shouldn't keep doing everything to not let that happen because ultimately it's up to an already unstable player.
We should plan and organize multiple contingency plans in case it happens.
The fears of Russian invasion were extremely high and Ukraine was projected to fall within 72h, but look what actually happened.
Russia's collapse will be a similar thing.
As for a complete collapse of the Russian state, that's absurd.
Putin's not a king or emperor, the state can function just fine without his psychotic ass sitting at the helm.
There are several other political players in Russia that would prevent a complete collapse, particularly one that would risk the chances of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands.
The Russian Strategic Rocket Forces is kept completely separate from the rest of the military for this exact reason.
There is no way that they would allow any rogue elements to mess around with the nuclear arsenal.
