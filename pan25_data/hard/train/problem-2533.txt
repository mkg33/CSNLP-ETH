Skepticism is understandable.
But Mueller ultimately reported to Trump and Senate Republicans ignored the evidence in covering for Trump during the impeachments.
The fix was in for all of those previous attempts to hold him accountable.
The fix was in on all those previous attempts, but that wasn't 100% clear at the outset.
In hindsight it was clear, but people legit believed Mueller was going to absolutely nail him to a wall.
The fix could be in here also we just don't see it in the moment.
No way in hell.
Mueller was given a chance under oath to give his opinion on whether or not Trump committed a crime or should be prosecuted for one - his own opinion outside of the bounds of the DOJ's constraints about reports on sitting presidents - and he fucking said nothing.
Mueller was given an opportunity under oath to speak his own truth outside of Rosentsein and DOJ limitations and he said fucking nothing.
He could have easily said, the DOJ has a policy of not doing blah blah blah but if it were anyone else I think there would be enough evidence to prosecute - but I'm not the one making the final decision, that's up to our elected officials.
But he didn't say anything even remotely close to that when he was given the chance.
No they couldn't have, yet.
Giving him a lot of opportunities to give the documents back was a smart move, and one that significantly improves their chances of prosecuting him successfully.
They could prosecute him on this part of clause (d): " or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it on demand to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it".
