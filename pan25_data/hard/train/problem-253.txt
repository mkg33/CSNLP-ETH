What’s changed?
In 1988 renewables were a shot in hell.
It was not popular opinion that it could scale up to the point it could sustain us.
We are now at the same point with carbon capture as to where we were in 1988 with renewables.
It’s some new technology that doesn’t look like it’ll ever be able to scale.
But it will.
And we will be able to use both renewables and carbon capture and perhaps some new technologies to overcome this.
So, on the tipping points: there may also be positive ones that could help us to reach a better pathway and reduce greenhouse gas emissions faster than expected.
An interesting article on critical and positive tipping points has recently been published on :
In my opinion it's our to assume the worst possible outcomes and act accordingly to avoid those, so pessimism certainly has its place, but it shouldn't bar us from realizing observable positive changes, are these are the ones we need to strenhen.
How could we do that without noting them?
We have to be aware of the risks at stake and the chances we can take to find effective strategies and steer our future into the desirable realm rather than into chaos and dismay.
