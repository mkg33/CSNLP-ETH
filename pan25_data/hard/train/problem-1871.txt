The American polarization on guns didn't really exist until the 80s anyway.
Before then gun control wasn't particularly pushed for, and gun rights weren't advocated for much either.
It wasn't until the violence of the 70s and 80s that gun control became a bigger push, and the gun rights movement was awakened into the powerful force it is today.
It is true that Reagan, working with a Democrat majority in the California legislature, passed a ban on open carry of firearms as a response to the black panthers.
However, the majority of California gun control, such as the handgun registry, AWB, ammo restrictions, etc, were in the 90s and and 2000s.
Not under Reagan in the 70s.
I will also point out that it is a stupid response to people criticizing California gun laws to bring up a politician wh retired over 30 years ago and has been dead for almost 20.
Lots of right wingers here are complaining about California's gun laws, yet those idiots don't realize that most of those anti-gun laws were passed by the Reagan administration.
The Republicans did so because black people were getting armed for their own protection from bigots like Republicans and their neo-nazi/kkk allies.
Republicans wanted black people to be defenseless against the attacks from Republicans.
