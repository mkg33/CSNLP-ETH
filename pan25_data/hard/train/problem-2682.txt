Step 3) collect 174k/year for 2 years and potentially get to stay on the federal employee Healthcare plan.
Which is basically an ACA gold plan, with the government covering 72% of the premium (I had trouble verifying this one, it may not apply to a 1 term member of the house).
Step 1) move to a red district (preferably a new one after the census, or with a retiring or out of favor republican representing it).
And since he is a Republican in a crucial otherwise Democrat district, nothing will happen to him for 2 years.
Right, it's the democrats fault that a heavily republican district elected a conman.
How about the Republicans vet their candidates?
How about people read up on candidates?
How about Republicans not install him into congress after all this comes to light?
But that's all the democrats fault.
