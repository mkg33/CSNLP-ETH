I think her time at the UN was great.
She had an iron fist and helped reign in the out of control funding we give to some foreign countries.
She's the least whacko person from the Trump administration.
She served at the pleasure of rabid bigot and lying hatemonger Donald J. Trump and continues to softly support him and his shit immigration policies.
NNH 2024?
I disagree.
It is her full legal name.
She is a staunchly anti-immigrant child of immigrants - a hypocrite of the highest order.
Calling her that would mock her hypocrisy, not her race.
I think your conflating the "Racism doesnt exist" line.
What she is actually saying is Melting pot vs Salad.
She's a second generation immigrant and a POC.
She is saying that rather than being defined as "an Indian immigrant" she wants to be an American.
She also removed the confederate flag from the state capitol.
Moving the embassy to Jerusalem is a complicated situation.
Alot of folks support it and alot of people don't.
Before you criticize the move, you should read Some history on the Israel/Palestine conflict.
Don't believe what the celebrities tell you.
They don't have foreign policy experience.
