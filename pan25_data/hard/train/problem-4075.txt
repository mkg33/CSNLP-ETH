The point isn't 'everyone should have gender-affirming surgeries as teens', and that isn't what transgender people or the modern consensus on medical standards of care for trans people are arguing for - the point is that Republicans don't even believe their own lies about why they are going after any and all kinds of trans healthcare.
There is absolutely no evidence of puberty blockers as 'potentially dangerous' for transgender kids, to be clear.
Trans teens on puberty blockers are regularly monitored by doctors, not thrown out into the forest if they start experiencing any side effects - and the side effects can often be relieved by additional treatments, like calcium supplements for bone density concerns.
Edit: I have since been informed that it is standard for people taking puberty blockers for transition to also receive supplementals to handle the side effects.
I have to admit that I was not aware of the calcium supplements for people taking puberty blockers for transition.
Thank you for letting me know that the doctors are taking responsible steps.
Overall, I think the state should keep it's nose out of medical decisions between patients and doctors.
This decisions are not made for the safety of the child or the need for care, they are made out of moral opinion without medical knowledge.
Moreover they are made to score points with a political base steeped in outrage politics.
