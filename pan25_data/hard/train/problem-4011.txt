I cannot recall who did this study but, ANYONE can look it up and see I'm not making this up if you read this.
If that was a few off, I'd brush it off but, he went to 5 different Republican lead States and did this same kind of like bit or whatever..
The answers and responses I just..
It made me so sick to my stomach..
It was along the same type of responses.
One old man said no DC is where the government is and the other DC is more those POC ones... Smh.
You know what killed my soul though?
Watching those Jordan Klepper or, Kepler videos.
Him asking simple things like, "We have the State of Washinon so should we combine the State with the DC of Washinon?"
He was just being silly..
Person after person after person etc....
They argued that they are the same.
He would say, "You know the State is on the West Coast and DC is on the East Coast?"
They would stare at him and say no, THERE IS ONLY ONE WASHINGTON, THAT'S OUR GOVERNMENT..
Some even got frustrated saying he's giving them a TRICK QUESTION He said, "So, you don't know the difference of DC and the State?"
They kept arguing that this is the problem with, "THE WOKE MEDIA TRYING TO INDOCTRINATE!
".
the spr is crude.
the usa doesnt have the refining capacity.
putting the crude on the market lowers the price, and it goes out to get refined.
the usa imports refined oil at a lower price.
When it's cheap to buy oil, you fill the reserves, when it's expensive to buy oil you use the reserves to keep prices lower.
This is not some end of oil backup only in emergency reserve.
