I've worn glasses most of my life and never even considered contacts.
I can't stand the idea of sticking things into my eyeballs.
Not only babies born who will die in minutes/hours after being born, but babies who will suffer increasingly for 3 years until inevitably dying an agonizing death from Tay-Sachs disease.
There are some backward states that require fetuses to have burials after 2nd trimester abortions, and bill the woman for it.
Please stop presenting long distance travel for late 2nd trimester abortion as some kind of inexpensive and easy thing.
Abortion would save the family grief, the woman the pain of being pregnant and giving birth, the medical system tens of thousands of dollars, and the family a debt of many thousands of dollars too.
I just wanted to comment to contradict that myth, in case anyone here might need to be reassured that their abortion is not going to ruin their chances of having kids!
Telling women that abortion will make them infertile is one tactic of the anti-choice movement, so she could have just assumed that’s why she can’t get pregnant again.
When you have a miscarriage, or a medically necessary abortion your grieving really hits when the pregnancy is terminated.
Plus there is the hormonal hit of that.
Pushing that out by SIX MONTHS of pregnancy is fucked up.
