Motherfucker no When there’s an outburst of infectious disease you don’t want unity You want isolation.
Xi wastes the time and patience of the last years not vaccinating the population.
He did this to the country.
Rather than to work with the rest of the world, he painted the west as disorganised and that the Chinese’s approach was superior.
Well now you’ve painted yourself into a corner.
Too proud to use better western vaccines, as it would be an admission of failure and policy.
And it’s not smart to wait and see if vaccines works.
Bitch, the whole legal, regulatory and scientific process of developing vaccines is to make sure it does work and safe.
They didn’t wait till the last possible moment before they begin developing a vaccine.
And the fact that most nations don’t have to wear mask and life has resume normal is prove enough that the vaccine works and is safe.
Yes, you could say vaccine is considered safe.
But we didn't know that at the start with multiple vaccine brands rushing to release.
