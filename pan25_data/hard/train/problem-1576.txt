The first would seem to require the occupation of Russia without too many nukes going off, at which point the Russian government’s objections to ICC jurisdiction stop mattering because the Russian government no longer exists.
In which case a separate tribunal is not necessary.
A lovely soundbite that doesn’t address the actual problem: How do you get Putin et al into the courtroom?
Two possibilities exist: Either an outside force goes and gets them or there is a change of government in Russia and the new regime hands them over.
There should be no way this war ends and Russia isn’t completely isolated from normal world society until change occurs, or the current leadership is prosecuted.
Meaning for me anyway, that cannot leave Russian territory without the threat of being arrested in nearly every country.
Unfortunately the Russian people don’t care enough now to remove Putin and his subordinates from power.
Such measures are probably counterproductive because it will just make it less likely than Putin will give up and instead will fight to the bitter end.
Of course such charges could also be negotiated away in order to try to get Putin to give up.
Basically if he quits he can go into exile.
