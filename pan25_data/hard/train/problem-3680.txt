You are fine with criticism for Germany yet you can't be bothered to look up how much they are actually doing?
And don't start with gdp.
I could use 100% of the gdp of my made up lala land and I wouldnt help Ukraine one bit.
This is not a "look who has the highest percentage" contest.
It only matters how much help actually makes it to Ukraine and in that regard Germany is the leading contributer in Europe and worldwide only surpassed by the US.
Germany has been unfairly singled out over Ukraine issues a lot lately, and it's been mostly propaganda bullshit, because between their own support and the money they've added to the EU support to Ukraine, again, after the US, they've also been the country providing most of the support to Ukraine.
The thing that gets left out a lot is that Germany isn't only providing aid and arms to Ukraine as as single nation, but they're also the largest contributor of money to the EU aid to Ukraine.
Even beyond that, Ukraine isn't the only conflict or crisis going on in the world, and again, there isn't a country that provides more foreign aid in the world other that the US.
So, just maybe... just fucking lay off of Germany for doing better than pretty much every other country in the world, both in renewables and in foreign aid?
