It’s broken at every level.
The privates and corporals don’t have adequate training, their are no NCOs to lead them and the lowest ranking officers aren’t generally leading the assaults.
The mid ranking officers are often 100km behind the lines and don’t really know what is going on on the ground meanwhile competent high ranking officials are considered a risk to Putin so the overall war is being managed by incompetent generals.
Meanwhile at every step you have micro management and the pursuit of arbitrary political goals.
The Russian military structure is a mess but that said they have the shown the ability to put half a million men into the field, 5,000 tanks and pump tens of millions of shells at Ukrainian forces.
Even an “incompetent” army of that scale can’t be beaten easily.
This line of thinking resulted in Putin concluding that the west would never apply serious sanctions to Russia and would easily choose cheap Russian fossil fuels over commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty.
China's not to be dismissed though, in the same way the west chose not to intervene in Ukraine as a security guarantor, and keeps throwing out excuses such as "crossing Putin's red lines", it's all because Russia is a nuclear power.
That sort of combination with their compulsion to establish themselves as a great empire.
You can see similarities between Russia and WW2 Nazi Germany, but they're not all dumb.
