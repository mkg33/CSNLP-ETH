True, but there are also supporters of Grzegorz Braun and his party Konfederacja Korony Polskiej, which has been openly sewing anti-ukrainian propaganda since the war started, harassing Ukrainians as well as the institutions which are helping them and aggresively demanding our government stops the "ukrainization of Poland" and "rampant demographic changes in Polish society".
.
PERSONALLY I think it's an anti-ukrainan provocation, either by our anti-immgrant far right that blames the Ukrainans for all the bad things that happen in this contry lately, or by someone connected to Russia.
If ukrainian government was stupid enough to think that they can cause a NATO intervention by driving a car into Poland and blowing it up they would've lost the war long ago.
and let's not neglect even the Polish president was ready to announce a Russian missle was the cause, and only backed down after his military advisors told him to.
A ja jestem przekonany, że zarówno NATO jak i Polska nie chcą w chwili obecnej przystąpić do bezpośredniej wojny z Rosją.
Szczególnie, że rakieta, najprawdopodobniej uderzyła przez przypadek.
