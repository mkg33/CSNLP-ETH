PHILADELPHIA — Democrats on Saturday voted overwhelmingly to remake the party’s presidential nominating calendar, embracing President Biden’s push for South Carolina to be the first state to hold its contest in 2024, replacing Iowa amid calls for greater racial, geographic, and economic diversity in the process.
Saturday’s voice vote marked the last formal step in the DNC’s efforts to fundamental overhaul the nominating calendar, as the committee’s members officially approved the new order set by Biden.
But the push to reorder the states still faces some hurdles.
It seems to be an issue that states and the DNC are still trying to figure out themselves.
Here's what some Iowa legislators had to say about the DNC decision:
EDIT: you seem to be talking about going into Iowa” as the day of the caucus.
You may not be taking into account that the first caucus/primaries are 6-8 months in the making for the candidates.
Depending on the cycle and how open the field is, candidates can start showing up in the state up to a year in advance.
That takes money, yes, but not nearly as much as it would take to concentrate on 12 states at once.
Only the most well-established candidates would have the fundraising available to compete.
The only reason it survived is that nobody who ever thought of running for president would dare to vote against it.
Even raising the question would kill any aspirations of being president.
With Democrats moving on, I foresee them pushing to end corn ethanol soon.
If both parties left iowa, the boondoggle known as corn ethanol would be gone soon after.
Increasing world food prices, using more fuel than it replaces, harming farmland by having the same crop planted over and over, instead of cycling, corn-based ethanol is a disaster.
