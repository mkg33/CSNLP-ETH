I don't know why the whole of Africa is taken as a whole.
You didn't say all of SEA is shitty cause of Myanmar, why does Africa in general have nasty regimes?
Africa is huge, there are stable places like Namibia or Botswana.
No, it is not Africa in general that has nasty regimes just like how no one would say Europe in general has nasty regimes cause russia is bad.
All I said was that Africa does have a bunch of shitty regimes, relative to most other places on Earth.
This is true - I talked about Afwerki and Kais Saied, but I could've mentioned Paul Biya, or Museveni, or Teodoro Mbasogo, or any number of violent dictators or corrupt governments that have managed to remain in power.
In comparison to, say, Europe, it is indisputable that things like freedom of the press, democratic participation and free elections, or the Human Development Index, are lower.
While it is true that there are a number of stable regimes with societies that are becoming better to live in, the continent in general, on average, compared to other continents, remains less developed and in the grasp of more dictatorial regimes.
-Africa in general has a bunch of, well, rather nasty regimes to put it charitably, but you gotta mention Eritrea and Afwerki, under whose rule , was living in slavery, the second highest rate on Earth after North Korea (and I doubt the numbers have improved all that much since then);.
Unfortunately, it's absolutely not restricted to the Middle East, despite how much they've outdone themselves recently in the "horrible governance" competition.
-A bloody civil war is still going on in Myanmar as we speak, with the military junta in place razing villages and burning children who resist them;.
