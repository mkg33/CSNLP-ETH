The Bundeswehr really does not have many Tanks, something around 260, and not even half of them are in working order.
It's not about Germans having not enough tanks.
They need to give permission for others to give German tanks to Ukraine.
This is about sending western tanks TO Ukraine.
Not refreshing the supplies of those who send older tanks.
As in the poland example, up until a point nobody would send western tanks to Ukraine, only older mostly Soviet stock.
The idea of seriously sending western tanks to Ukraine for their use only has been on the table very recently.
I thought that was clear from my original wording.
There recently has been a scandal where a lot of new Puma tanks were unusable at a training exercise.
This guy wants to avoid the question of "Where are those 100 billion bucks huh?
".
Yeah.
It wasn’t phrased well, but I mentioned the 100 bil figuratively - as in, Germany’s military is well funded but doesn’t have much to show for the money.
Mostly wondering why Germany’s military is in bad condition, despite the 50bil/year budget even before Russia’s invasion.
