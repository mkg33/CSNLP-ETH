From the article “At the same time, it is noted that debt repayment shall not be considered a reason for the resumption of supplies in case of non-compliance by the foreign buyer with the order introduced in March.
That is, gas payments in roubles.” …..
Meaning you can pay off money you owe for gas you already received in foreign currency.
But to continue gas imports and avoid disruptions you still have to pay in rubbish.
I mean rubles.
Go buy rubles with US dollars.
Now try to convert those rubles back to dollars.
The value of the ruble is what Russia claims it is, but ultimately, it’s a load of BS.
The value of the ruble in the exchange market has little to do with what Russia claims.
If anything, we've seen governments fail repeatedly in trying to control value of currencies--see the intervention by the BOJ, aggressively buying the yen in September and October.
Effects are temporary, rarely lasting more than 2 days.
As I wrote, its value is the same as before the war.
The value of a currency being high is not necessarily "good" either.
It means exports paid in foreign currency decreases, and net exporters will suffer as a result.
