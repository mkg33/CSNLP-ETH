Either way, the defendant would be sentenced for a non violent violation with a sentence of less than ten years - thus, the BOP would normally place the prisoner into a prison camp.
Lastly, with 11 years, the defendant will be remanded into the custody of the BOP at a low security prison.
Once she has a minimum of ten years she may be transferred to a federal prison camp, though it's not guaranteed or necessarily timely.
A camp is still a prison.
Additionally, the federal system doesn't have probation.
It has supervised release once no longer in the custody of the BOP.

A defendant that ONLY possesses a pound of weed could be charged with simple possession which has a maximum of one year incarceration.
If the federal prosecutors can prove the defendant intended to distribute or sale that one pound the maximum penalty would be five years incarceration.
