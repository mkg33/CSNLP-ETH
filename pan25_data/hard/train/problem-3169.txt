Well from my very limited googling, I have found that the first “fighter jet” was constructed and built in Germany 1941, so it’s plausible some would know of it.
überbleibsel von vor den Reformen... ich erinnere mich aich noch an geleakte Berichte der Bundeswehr in denen beschrieben wird, dass genug Luft-Luftraketen für den Kampfeinsatz eines Eurofighters zur Verfügung stehen..
What the very first sentence of the article says: Germany is offering to use its own planes patrol Poland’s airspace.
More likely to intercept any missiles that happen to enter Polish airspace, and to get more radars into the air along the border to track missiles with.
They did, yes.
Tipping the V1 over too much for it's gyrostabilisation system to correct back to level flight would make it spiral into the ground.
Something about the gyro having a fairly low max roll angle before it would lose its zero setting and no longer "know" which way was up.
To my understanding, this technique was developed as a safer alternative to shooting it down with machineguns and autocannon.
The warhead of a V1 was so large, its dangerous blast radius was larger than the effective range of the fighter planes guns.
Several aircraft were lost or damaged to debris from otherwise successful V1 shootdowns, so the seemingly insane trick of nudging it over with a winip was considered less dangerous.
