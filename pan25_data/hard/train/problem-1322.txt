‘Undated and unverified reports say that some dude in a turban in some country said at one time that he heard a cousin of an uncle of a friend’s friend tell him that they heard of a plan for Al-Qaeda to acquire enriched uranium.’ -Newsweek Senior Bullshit Correspondent.
"A shipment of enriched uranium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons, has fallen into the hands of 9/11 terrorist group al-Qaeda, according to a Middle Eastern report.
Just read the first two lines.
Newsweek is publishing a story which is 90% "background" and "context" and two lines of "some other newspaper said so based on an unnamed source".
The material was allegedly being delivered from Iran to Houthi rebels in Yemen when some of it was intercepted by the terror group, Israeli newspaper Maariv said, citing unnamed sources.
".
Yeah.
Which is worse?
The perpetrators of 9-11 getting this or the Houthi rebels engaged in a war with Saudi Arabia getting it?
Both are going to use it for similar attacks.
Maybe the only difference is Al-Qaeda would for sure use it to attack the west or Israel and the Houthi will only maybe use it to attack Saudi western suppliers instead of the Kingdom itself.
