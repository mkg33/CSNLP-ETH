Russian is rooted into Ukraine quite a bit, to the point where even families from somewhere like Kyiv speak Russian instead of Ukrainian.
There’s also a mix of both languages that developed in more rural areas - Surzhyk; this mix is usually regarded as improper Ukrainian and often looked down upon.
What’s interesting is that russians don’t understand Ukrainian as a lot of words are different.
As a matter of fact, our language has a lot more similarities with other Slavic Eastern European languages than with russian.
As I understand Ukrainian shares more words with Polish than with Russian (and even more with Belarusian than with Polish), but Ukrainian grammar is closer to Russian than to Polish.
I say this because all the young ones I talked to (mostly rich ones from Kharkiv, os just south of Kyiv) speak russian in "formal" settings, but a mix between themselves (hecnce why I say they view Ukrainian as "improper"), though they know Ukrainian fully.
It might now change and they'll start to view Ukrainian as the only language to really use now.
