With 6 conservative Supremes (1 apparently willing to rubberstamp anything that any wacko presents), and coming off of a re-election campaign, I'm guessing Abbott figures now is as good as any to send in a Christmas list to Santa SCOTUS.
Election Denying was meant to be 2022's winning issue and it turned out to be a bellyflop, so the Republicans need a new issue to circle the wagons around, and it's going to be immigration morphing into Replacement Theory i.e.
"a victory for workers.
".
I don't understand how or why the Republicans made serious inroads with Hispanic-Americans, but clearly, immigration is no longer a turn off issue for many Hispanic-Americans outside of California and Arizona.
in 2020-2021, Republicans created Critical Race Theory as an election rage point, and DeSantis and Youngkin used CRT effectively to fear voters.
Youngkin won on it, and DeSantis used CRT to ram through some useless legislation that he ended up campaigning on as a "victory for parents.
".
Gov.
Abbott says he will "fully authorize Texas to take unprecedented measures to defend our state against an invasion.
".
Hmm.
I feel like the republicans have held Texas long enough that something should have been done to thwart all those Satanic job takers by now.
But vote for the republicans and surely theyâ€™ll solve the problem this time.
