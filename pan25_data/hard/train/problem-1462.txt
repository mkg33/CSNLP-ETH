Every idiot online who claims that Elon was just setting things straight can have this thrown in their face, and will lose credibility to those new to the conversation.
No this will be lobbed at rightwingers in mneme wars for years to come, or it will force them to stop using twitter as an example of "censorship" b/c it will backfire everytime, as someone will throw this link at them.
It's because of the numpties who whined their "free speech" was being taken away by being banned from Twitter for racism or inciting violence.
Then cheered when Elon "claimed" he was "bringing all free and legal speech" back to Twitter... and then promptly banned lots of left-leaners and anyone who hurt his fragile Reichiwhite fee-fees.
I'm just calling out the hypocrisy of Elon Musk and all of the people who complained about right-wingers being banned.
