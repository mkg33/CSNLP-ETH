But I do wonder if its Russia intentionally trying to amp up tensions between China and everyone else.
Russia is the only one "gaining" anything from these UFOs/"balloons" (they arent all balloons) in so much as it distracts from Ukraine.
The Chinese are not engaging a balloon, they are engaging the same type of objects the US airforce and Russians have been engaging.
Americans think they are so special and that they are the only country with Chinese spy balloons in their air space, when clearly there are also Chinese spy balloons in Chinese air space.
Nah I'm guessing China is the culprit and wants to shoot down a balloon over there air space to feign ignorance on the situation and act like a victim too.
My guess is the Pentagon has intentionally been conflating the Chinese balloons with these UAPs...
So that when they started shooting them down people would just confusing them with more Chinese balloons.
The Pentagon btw has not confirmed that these drone like UAPs are Chinese.
They are still calling them UAPs.
The thing is the US Navy has been reporting these strange objects for 20 years but never did anything about them except to observe.
Then in the last 5 years the number of them has exploded.
