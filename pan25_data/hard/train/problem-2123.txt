To be fair, Russia hasn’t been a world superpower since it was the Soviet Union.
The world playcated Russia in an effort to see Russia become more modern but when Putin seized power that was never a possibility.
He’s ex-KGB.
He was always going to see the Soviet Union’s downfall as an embarrassment for the Russian people and looked to blame it’s failures on The West.
Not saying the west kept Russia down, but the west IS a titan compared to Russia, doubly so when the USSR fell apart.
For the record, most of Russia's problems are Russia's fault, but saying that the west could have 0 impact on them failing/succeeding is just wrong.
If someone 100 feet tall kept pushing you down, did you really stand a chance?
Was it a fair fight?
Were you just a failure?
Again, I don't agree with it, just pointing out their "logic" isn't flawed, it just isn't based in reality.
If we wanted them to fail, we absolutely could have made that happen.
They just did it for us.
If someone much more powerful than you decides that they are not going to let you thrive, and has the power to make that a reality, are you a failure or did they fuck you?
