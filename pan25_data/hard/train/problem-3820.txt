Honestly it should be banned as a source.
They put out some blatantly false headlines recently.
Not just in Russia either.
They were the ones that started the hoax about Iran sentencing 15000 people to death and raping prisoners so they don't go to heaven.
Honestly it's kind of rare to see, since most of the time there's not enough evidence to say it's a lie, so there is never a retraction..but I think claiming that 15k people were going to be raped and killed was just a little too far to go completely unchallenged.
They are relying on freelancers who scan Twitter and Telegram for headlines and do absolutely no research to back it up.
And you can find literally anything you want to find on those websites.
Just a few days ago they claimed that Putin has cancer, fell down the stairs, and shit his pants, based on nothing but a Twitter post.
Very much what you’re saying, and hey don’t get me wrong, I’d love it if Putin fell down the stairs and crapped himself… I just don’t believe it happened based on an anonymous Telegram message.
