My only concern is that I think Jim Jordan is somehow even worse than McCarthy.
Now I’m not sure how real I think that threat it but it’s something I’m conscious of.
Yeah that is what I kind of figured, it's just a weird sense of foreboding that I don't completely ignore anymore given certain political happenings in the past decade or so that I thought would be impossible.
Todays votes are taking it away as well.
There's no winning this for the GOP.
Literally the only way for the dems to lose here is to break rank to vote for McCarthy.
At this point, it seems almost more likely that some of the more centrist GOP will break ranks to get Jefferies the speaker ship.
If a few republicans want to stop the humiliating shit show then it’s Jeffries they need to vote for.
It would take just 11 of the anti-McCarthy cohort voting present to throw the speakership over to Jeffries.
And why not?
It'd be a mostly symbolic move.
Republicans would still hold the majority and would still control committees.
Jeffries would have some control over what gets a vote on the floor, but republicans aren't looking to govern anyway.
They're looking to showboat and that's done in committees.
Not within the committee.
If the committee sends a bill to the floor to be voted on, the speaker has some power to affect whether it ever gets a vote.
That power isn't absolute.
A vote could be forced.
But again, republicans aren't looking to legislate anyway.
They're looking to investigate nothingburgers and perform kabuki theater for their base.
That all happens in committee.
