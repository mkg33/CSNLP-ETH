And will bet $50 the areas most adversely affected are low income Democrat.
Besides, if it raises the overall costs of elections, that will give them even more excuses to shut down voting precincts in poorer areas of the state.

2020 was a bit different in that Democrats have been taking COVID more seriously, and post-2020 efforts to restrict mail in voting has been disproportionately hitting those Republican demographics.
The GOP is willing to disenfranchise some republican elderly (especially poorer ones who are probably also more like to be concerned/upset about social security cuts) if it means weeding out more democrats.
Well off GOP elderly votes might want SS untouched but they also are likely to have financial resources not impacted as much by SS, like pensions and stock investments.
So they can give up their SS payments if it means other wins that affect them more.
