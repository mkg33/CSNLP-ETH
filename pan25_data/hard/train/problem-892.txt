For those who say hypnosis is real and works, it is provided you want it to work.
I took a hypnosis class and it was absolutely ineffective on several people including myself.
I just wasn't ready to allow even the sense of someone else controlling or affecting me take place.
Yes, I was taking the class but couldn't ever get over the feeling, it didn't work for me.
You cannot hypnotize an unwilling person.
But for the people who were able to accept it, hypnosis had an effect and very noticeably so.
A placebo effect might be more akin to whether a person used a professional hypnotist vs. a layman but that may not be a good analogy.
It seems like hypnosis works in the sense that it almost requires and produces a state of psychosis, where people are willing to believe that something that should have no effect, actually does.
Real hypnosis works, if you define hypnosis as a technique for guided meditation.
The idea of someone using hypnosis to brainwash someone or deprive them of their free will is bollocks.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean hypnosis is not a real thing.
It’s as real as meditating is.
At the end of the day, they still did with the hypnotist said.
Even if it was just in a play along type of way.
