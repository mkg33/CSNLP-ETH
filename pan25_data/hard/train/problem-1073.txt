So this discussion is, in effect, smearing his bad name, then?
Truly a Republican concept, isnâ€™t it?
So Republicans get a mulligan?
At some point Democrats have to start dropping the hammer and aggressively go after this kind of bullshit because right now Republican politicians seem to get away with everything.
And y'all keep calling Democrats liers and frauds and such, but everytime you turnaround in someone from the GOP, getting caught, lying and committing some type of fraud, SMDHðŸ¤·.
Just how little do they think of not only their potential voters, but the long-held as valuable general democratic process that they'll openly lie and deceive the whole public?
They really don't care at all.
So much for the Party of "morals and values" and "law and order".
It was all a 50-years long lie......
Typical Republican lies and liars.
So much morals and values going on that they'll make you cry at the lack of morals and values of mere mortals.
/s.
You can't make this up - it's a new level of sick(ening)......
