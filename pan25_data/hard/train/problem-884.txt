I'm gonna put on my tiny tin foil hat here, just to be completely transparent.
But if you don't think there's surveillance in every sizeable public area in the US, and also think any such surveillance is not being intercepted by the NSA along with the tracking data from multiple companies that regularly share location and search information and use it, data that would be trivial to access for our intelligence agencies... Well, to be honest, I'm jealous and wish I lived in your world.
Local government is not representative of the US federal government, which is an insanely complicated beast, and in my opinion, you just vastly underestimate it.
As if to say the US has no programs like the Chinese government has in terms of collating data on every citizen for the purposes of... Whatever purpose.
I mean, is it paranoid to think we have such programs, or is it na√Øve to assume we don't?
Basically anything else we have the capability of doing, we have the ability to do, above and beyond what other countries are capable of.
You talk about exascale data centers .
That's not even the biggest data center in the US, it's just the most well known.
A cursory Google search reveals just how many massive data centers belonging to various government agencies there are.
So I really don't understand what that last paragraph is about.
Sure, they're expensive but we have them, and they are all currently operational.
I don't know what the jazz about Walmart and best buy or whatever is supposed to mean, but exascale data infrastructure does indeed exist in the US.
The strategies towards application of this amount of information are indeed different.
That doesn't mean the US has no comparable systems to what the Chinese government has over their citizens.
Ya know, I agree that China isn't really a nation now that you say it.
It's more an overarching oligarchic force holding together a bunch of others.
A prison of nations, if you will.
