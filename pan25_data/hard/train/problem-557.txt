Why did he resign, and what was erroneous...does he believe they could have defended against the missile but failed?
I don't quite get it, not enough context.
Thank you, I am reading the sky news account of this...they say, that he had claimed the missile that blew up the building had been shot down by air defences.
Russian propaganda used this as a way to blame the destruction on Ukrainian air defenses.
What I got from reading the news is earlier Ukraine accused Russia of targeting the building.
However, now they say the building was hit after the Ukrainian air defense intercepted the Russian missile.
The missile that hit the Dnipro residential building is a Kh22 which is something a Patriot can intercept and down but none of the systems Ukraine currently has can.
Kh22 have always been successful so far, the UAF has a 0% success rate with them.
Arestovych heard from "someone" that there might have been a 2nd explosion that's why he assumed live on air that what fell on the building was the remnants of the intercept and that is not only false but the russian ambassadors used his words like as argument that "it wasn't us".
Coincidentally, the same missile type was used in Kremenchuk on the shopping center months ago.
Russians claimed that was a UAF missile there too but there was CCTV footage showing the massive 1 ton warhead dropping on the building.
Ukraine doesn't have anything like that.
No matter what the truth is, the Ukrainians can't afford to have their own people contradicting leadership in such a public manner.
He contradicted the official government position that the Russians deliberately attacked the civilian apartment by saying it was possible the Russians targeted something else but Ukrainian AA activity might have knocked it off its original course...
