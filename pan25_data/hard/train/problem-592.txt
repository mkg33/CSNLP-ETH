I suspect that (and annexation in general) is about trying to keep Ukraine from joining NATO even if Russia is forced to completely withdraw.
I don't understand how US politicians ever expect Ukraine to have confidence in a peace deal with Russia, it's pretty clear Russia will re-invade when they see fit.
Unless Ukraine has NATO membership before they can re-invade or nukes.
Ukraine will be the lasting example for smaller countries to never give up your nukes, because the western military countries may not fight for you.
Even if Russia is pushed to their pre-2014 borders and kept there, they will toss missiles at Ukraine and manufacture endless crises to keep Ukraine from meeting the criteria to join NATO.
Nothing less than the collapse of the Russian government will stop this.
I'm curious how much allowance NATO gives for alternative military agreements between member/non-member states.
I would love for Ukraine to get a shared defense agreement with just the US and a couple of European states while dodging Turkey's bullshit.
After this war, hopefully Ukraine will become a NATO member.
Any attempt on Russia's part to come back for more will be met with a proper response from NATO, not just the current trickle of military surplus we're currently handing over.
I mean I get the geopolitical reasons why NATO hasn't got militarily involved in the conflict, but it is pretty frustrating when we have the ability to basically end this in a week or so, saving thousands of Ukrainian lives in the process.
