Well that's because liberals actually believe in democracy.
Is it so surprising that most of us are loathe to engage in authoritarianism to achieve a better democracy?
The question is not if they can win elections if they become a monolithic authoritarian body, the question is can they win enough to undo democracy and remain in power through other means while they do it.
So, it's not so much a question of whether they can win as a christian nationalist party, it's a question of whether they will succeed in burning this democracy to the ground.
They'd never win fair elections as a Christian nationalist party in enough numbers to have control.
They'd just keep control of the reddest states and Dems would have a permanent national majority.
That is why they are moving to make new Jim Crow type laws, push propaganda, and "legally" rig elections any way they can.
When they get more power, they will use that power to further corrupt the system to stay in power - that is what is happening in Florida right now, and it's how authoritarian regimes work.
Power is the only real priority.
Democracy is a check on that, so they will reject democracy.
That is why their plan is to corrupt democracy.
They cannot win as a party of extremists, so they will break our elections instead.
States like Russia provide a roadmap for them.
