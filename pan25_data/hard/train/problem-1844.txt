I guess that means they are all innocent in your mind then?
Pretty sure the families of the victims in a vast majority of those cases would whole heartedly disagree.
After reading about the atrocities these people have committed, I stand by my belief that they all deserve the death penalty.
Botched or not, it is a better fate than their victims received.
Innocent people shouldnâ€™t be spending their lives in jail either.
The fact that innocent people are getting convicted is a completely different problem than the punishment that is handed out.
I think the issue that needs to be addressed is how are innocent people being convicted in the first place.
The state executing one innocent person should be enough to say no more executions.
Life in prison without parole is a better option, and it's actually less expensive in the long run.
Edit to share: 190 death row inmates have been exonerated since 1970.
At least 20 people have been executed with a high likelihood they were innocent.
That alone should be reason enough to do away with the death penalty.
Ya!
Especially all of the innocent people the U.S has put to death over the last 250 years.
I'd they didn't want to die an excruciating death, they should have just not been railroaded by a broken judicial system known for false convictions.
