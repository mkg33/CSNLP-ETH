Measles has all the tricks.
Infectious days before you show any symptoms at all?
Check.
Virus hangs around for hours after you breathe it out?
Check.
Virus can reach more than _100 feet_ away from someone contagious?
Check.
I very much doubt there would be any problem at all; unless you have too many vaccines very close together, or the vaccine itself is very hard on your body (like smallpox/shingles vaxes) which MMR is not, extra doses are rarely a problem.
But it's something to discuss with your doctor.
Measles is the in the world.
It's so contagious, Michael Osterholm (renowned epidemiologist who is now the President of Joe Biden's Covid advisory board) once said.
Measles might just be a bad cold and body rash for you, if you're really lucky.
But boy, does it have some effects if you're unlucky.
It can cause encephalitis (brain inflammation) - including some up to _27 years_ after you get infected.
It can blind and/or deafen you.
It can so that you get reinfected by all the _other_ diseases you already had immunity to.
I had the MMR in the 80s and by the time I was 32, I had no immunity left and had to be re-vaccinated.
Ehm do you know that getting a vaccine still helps even if you get infected, right?
Even if you get measles, the vaccine you took will make the disease a lot milder.
I was vaccinated but still got measles as a child.
Thankfully I was a pretty mild case, likely because I was vaccinated.
I wish people would just get vaccinated so this disease could follow smallpox into extinction, but too many anti-vaxers are keeping the virus active and evolving.
