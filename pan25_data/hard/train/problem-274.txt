But the rest of my Republican family...
I have no idea how but it's like they don't even take in any of the negative news about Trump, even if it comes from his own mouth.
They're not tech savvy and don't know what Twitter or any other social media is, so even if I showed them Trump's posts they wouldn't believe it.
They're so incredibly sheltered and delusional, I'm pretty sure they think I'm a Trump supporter like they are.
Yup, pretty much.
I'm pretty sure it's because they live in a bubble.
They don't absorb or entertain new ideas/information.
Pretty much the only thing they ever watch on TV is Fox News or OAN.
One of my parents was a huge fan of Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly.
Anyone they meet who is more liberal or LGBTQ, they just brush them off as crazy.
I can't even ask them questions about their beliefs (not inserting my own) without being ignored or straight up told "no.
".
Yep.
They don't want to find your information for you because they know they will only find information telling them they are wrong.
They just hope you take whatever they tell you as truth.
