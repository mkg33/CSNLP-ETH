Ideally I would like tk see Biden let an already established, more left leaning politician take the reigns but assuming he doesn't give up that post soon then I would thing he would run in 2024.
He kinda has to to put up a decent fight.
Thing is, putting Trump in there will drive a larger negative voter turn out.
DeSantis running in 2024 would not have as much as a negative impact on the republican party and those who are hard core for Trump will eventually come to the polls for DeSantis for the sake of "making America great again".
When you (DeSantis) tries to shoehorn how "Woke goes broke in Florida" it's sad to say that the entire state and perhaps the country (if he's nominated for the republican ticket) is doomed the longer he has political power.
Regardless of who ever is chosen, that person / campaign team will need to make Trump and DeSantis one in the same.
Don't allow DeSantis to show any difference between him and Trump.
He doesn't have a cult following like Trump.
He's still a relatively unknown typical politician in a $3,000 suit and will have less latitude than Trump.
