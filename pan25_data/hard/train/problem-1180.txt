Above all, it creates business connections betweens Japanese/British military contractors and construction which then trickle down to personal ties between citizens of the countries (marriages, influx of population in the area, colleagues become friends, etc.)
which just overall strenhens the camaraderie between both nations.
I haven't read the article, but I assume they will be naval bases.
The Japanese navy and the American navy both being nearby means not only will iron sharpen iron (Britain easily can conduct exercises, learn different tactics, etc.
And vice versa) It also means there is a future where Japanese ships can freely patrol in European waters.
Really the move just strenhens the naval presence and readiness of an already extremely powerful naval coalition (USA, Britain, Japan).
In regards to surface warships, one could argue Japan has a stronger navy than the UK, especially when one considers the Type 45 with a full load v the Kongo + Atago + Maya + two new behemoth destroyers Japan is building.
The Royal Navy's main gap right now in capability are surface to surface missile destroyers, both of which the US & Japan do well.
but the RN is due to receive the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) sometime soon that'll be fitted to the T45 and T23 frigates being built currently.
Always found it quite amusing how both the Mongol invasion of Japan and the Spanish Armada's invasion of England where ultimately defeated by storms in the end.
