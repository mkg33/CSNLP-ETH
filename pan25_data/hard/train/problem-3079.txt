Greenland was warmer when he settled there.
The Vikings were able to farm crops that simply cannot be grown there anymore like wheat.
It has to do with ocean currents more than anything else.
The world's climate now is technically warmer overall.
Sure, temps were also up to 9C warmer than they are now, and much colder too.
But it took hundreds of thousands to millions of years to get to that rather than less than 200 years for an increase of 1C.
It's not so much the temperature that's the problem as it is the rate at which it is changing.
Average global temperature change of 1C over only 200 years is a lot.
Our overall average temperature month-to-date is running 2.5° higher than the all time record set 100 years ago.
(records go back 125 years).
However, look at the actual month-to-date temperature stats here just 18 days into what is statistically supposed to be our coldest month, and you'll find we've already had 10 days at 70°+, 6 days at 75°+, and 2 days at 80°+.
We've set 4 daily high temperature records this month alone.
January here averages 10.5 days with a temperature ≤32°, and we have had ZERO, and with none currently forecasted.
Here in Dallas for example (also a 30-year resident here), it is true that it's not too unusual to touch 75° every once in a while in January.
