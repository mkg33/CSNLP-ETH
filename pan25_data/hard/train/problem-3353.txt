I didn't say anything about stealing elections.
I was replying to the comment "and the billions he stole" above.

He's also 1 for 4 in as an official presidential candidate.
That's a losing track record in anyone's book.
Not to mention the large group of GOP congressional nominees he propped up as "winners" in fact, lost their respective race.
And Trump was a proven loser before Republicans nominated him in 2016, and then voted him into the White House with fewer votes from Americans.
Trump also isn't in charge of all the Republicans' campaigns.

The GOP didn't underperform because of Trump.
The GOP underperformed because it's full of Republicans.
Including their avatar, Trump.

The last one still in office is McCarthy, who had Trump's endorsement for Speaker thanks to his groveling after the Jan. 6 attack he blamed Trump for.
