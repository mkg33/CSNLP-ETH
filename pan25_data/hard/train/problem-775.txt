Absolutely, and this is a completely valid shareholder complaint.
Maladministration of resources.
Musk needs to show the business plan that the income received by sending those resources to do work elsewhere benefits the overall business/investment.
If Musk is the CEO of Tesla, then it's fine since he is the boss, even if he is not the majority shareholder.
But if he is not the CEO, then some managers at Tesla have a lot of explaining to do and can literally be fired for it because it's not part of the business plan, and also if a shareholder gets to borrow resources, then why not other shareholders?
He has a fiduciary responsibility to Tesla as the CEO of a publicly traded company, which by "stealing" engineers from TSLA, he is not filling, as they are then NOT working on Tesla projects that are already years behind.
Even if he's paying Tesla a fair market rate (which I doubt) that still doesn't necessarily mean it's in Tesla's best interests, they aren't a consulting company so having those employees working for Twitter means that their primary jobs aren't getting done.
To say we’ve not seen Musk make any business decisions prior to the Twitter takeover, wilfully ignores the fact he’s been CEO at Tesla since 2008!
