My personal thoughts on Suze Ormann is that she gives pedestrian and idealistic advice with unrealistic contribution levels for people in their twenties and no acknowledgement of market volatility.
She's the queen of the cherry picked charts I mention and doesn't seem to grasp that young people struggle with extra money to invest or that life circumstances happen that can throw a wrench in the plan.
Thanks Suze Ormann.
I was nowhere near responsible enough to have done that in my twenties or even thirties.
I have about half that at 30 and feel fairly happy about it, knowing it will compound over time still.
I'll be upping my contribution in 2023 also which I'm excited to do.
Unless you live in an extremely large metro area or plan to retire in one, this is a pretty insulting comment.
I live immediately outside of a middle sized metro area (approximately the size of Portland OR, but not on a coast) and I help keep track of a couple of my older family members' finances who have... let's just say definitely NOT 1 million in retirement.
