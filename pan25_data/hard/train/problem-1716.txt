You really don't think the convergence of OPEC vs RU and covid was the literal bomb that went off?
Small and Mid cap frackers went bust... More money to big oil.
Setting aside Covid and the bullwhip effect Oil has been very very profitable over the last 5-7 years... Big oil has also benefitted from Covid killing off a bunch of small to mid cap American frackers...
The profit is multiple years out, at least.
If you think the Dems don't have a messaging problem I think your head is in the sand.
It's not the Dems messaging.
It's the fact that oil prices have been wildly fluctuating for the past 5 years with the oil war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, COVID, and now the war in Ukraine.
It's a coin flip if investors can make a profit with the market being the way it has been since the oil war.
By doing so you are handing a heck of a lot of power to other producers of oil.
It's a _very_ fine line.
Saudi Arabia will fall to pieces faster than the west will if the producer/consumer relationship they have ends, they don't have an economy worth talking about without the oil, but they still get to choose to cut the ties or simply just set some pressure and see how far they can take it to the breaking point.
