Think of it as a more complex version of US-China relations.
Both are actively taking military actions against one another, but trade continues.
It really isn't.
In terms of foreign policy, Israel's center-left governments were consistently better performing, and that includes Iran as a threat.
I think it would be hard to argue that foreign policy isn’t the wedge issue that keeps the Israeli right wing in power.
For as much theater as Iran and Israel’s right wing display, they are both the boogeyman the other needs for legitimacy.
So it kinda weird how Israel like to project itself as fighting against Iran, yet they have done nothing to prove that, aside from empty threats.
This is a weird thing to be prideful of, considering Israel obtained Nukes in secret and for decades kept denying existence of their nuke heads.
Edit: And seeing how Israel for decades have been claiming Iran are 2-3 years away from nukes, and under last deal with Iran, it was shown they were no where near that....
It does cast huge shadow of a doubt on what Israel has been claiming.
