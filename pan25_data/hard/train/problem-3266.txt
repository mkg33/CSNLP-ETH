What is the legal argument around them passing through other countries that they could have stayed in or even safer countries there in central America such as Panama or Costa Rica?
Does a refugee get to pick any country they want to go to from a legal standpoint?
Refugees do not get to pick their country.
Asylum seekers do get to pick where they lodge their claim of asylum, since they travel outside of the country of the origin and not directly into the arms of the UN or affiliated refugee camps.
But even then, it's often more a case of what kind of escape route can be managed, i.e.
if you were fleeing the middle east, it's probably going to be Greece, Italy, maybe Spain or Portugal that will be among your main landing points, depending on the route of escape taken.
For one, refugee or asylum already does not include economic reasons or simply a dislike of the political environment in their home country.
It, at least in terms of the US, a "well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion" to quote the initial refugee convention of 1951.
But in general, the groups viewed as "scary" are coming in exclusively under the 1951 convention definition.
And either have made it here and gone through the asylum process, or probably languished in a refugee camp for years on end waiting for a country to accept them.
It's not something you can just claim on the basis that your prior country isn't a great place to live.
There are broader qualifications, such as status under the Lautenberg Ammendment which makes it easier for certain religious minorities in the former Soviet Union to come over to the US, provided they have family here, under the refugee act.
