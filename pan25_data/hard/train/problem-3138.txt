Right?
The whole "those countries need to fix their problems" thing is great, but what about the people who are looking for asylum right now and can't wait for that to maybe never happen?
Since the US isn't even in the top 10 countries receiving refugees/asylum seekers it seems pretty obvious, to me anyway, that the system is the problem.
Agreed.
Asylum or refugee status is only available to someone who's suffered or fears persecution based on one of five criteria.
To be granted asylum you need to show a well founded fear of persecution by your government based on race, religion, political beliefs, ethnicity, or membership of a particular social group (which btw, doesn’t mean a cisfemale afraid of DV, or being a member of a particular gang/non-member) on top of that you can not have ever been a persecutor yourself, and on top of that (this one is important and not oft-mentioned) you can not be able to avoid the persecution by relocating somewhere else within your home country.
Well most aren’t leaving because of valid asylum claims either, otherwise the grant rates wouldn’t be a minority of judicial decisions.
