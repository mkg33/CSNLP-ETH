The first was the UAE's Hope orbiter and how it was gently going to be inserted into Mars orbit to perform studies of the atmosphere.
Next to arrive was China's Tianwen-1 orbiter and how it would also be gently inserted into Mars orbit.
After 4-5 days of systems checks, it would release the Zhurong lander to safely parachute onto the surface.
I remember a story on British media regarding the 2021 Mars missions that arrived around the same time.
However, they could not even be relied on to provide truthful updates on the status of their Mars rover.
China did not provide timely and accurate updates about the status of its Mars Rover.
That it had failed was only revealed after NASA took orbital imagery of the Mars Rover.
It takes a lot of coordination of complex and limited resources to interact in a useful way with a rover on mars.
First step is using a Mars orbiter to receive the rover signals, to transmit to appropriate receivers on earth.
I think they did some experiments to see if the ESA orbiter could be used to relay Zhurong signals, it’s feasible but not something that could be done routinely or in parallel with the orbiter’s other jobs.
