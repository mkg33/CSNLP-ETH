Are you an American living in Venezuela?
It's difficult to believe any Venezuelan who knows their history would say something so wrong.
Its not a secret that the US funded this coup just like it's no secret they funded the coup in '48.
Do you know where Jiminez fled to safety when actual Venezuelans threw him out and restored democracy?
The last American president openly put a price on Maduro's head and everyone knows about the USAID jackpot that awaited Guaido.
Even if you pretend the multiple coups never happened, you can't escape the fact that the US was all too happy to be Chavez and Maduros most important trade partners-- whether it was toppling Venezuelas govts or supporting their dictators, the US has always been involved in Venezuela and you embarrass yourself saying otherwise.
Angarita was a populist, Jimenez was a dictatorship and got coup'd too, funny how you say USA weren't involved then but "actual Venezuelans" when the governments after him were really close with them.
Back when he was appointed 99% of the people I know were happy and hopeful for the future, but ended up being exactly the same as most opposition leaders, we lacked a plan and good leadership.
Here's to another few years of Maduro's bullshit, "opposition" shitting the bed and absolutely nothing changing for years.
