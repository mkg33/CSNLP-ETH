Serious question: why is SCOTUS allowed to basically run the country?
I get overturning previous court rulings, but there is shit coming up like them being able to overturn FDA drug approvals.
How is it possible for them to just do whatever they want when something was an FDA decision, act of Congress, etc.?
It seems like all it takes is some conservative asshole to sue about something they don't like and poof the SCOTUS can just change the whole country however they want.
I get opposing the current Supreme Court, but hyperbole really doesn't help the situation.
As far as we are aware, every Supreme Court justice ever has been a Christian.
Being conservative and conservative rulings can be found within the constitution without having to consult the bible, even if religious views influence the ruling.
I fail to see how that's not coequal.
That's within the authority of the Supreme Court.
We both may disagree with his position, but that does not take away from the fact that as a justice he is entitled to that opinion and to vote along it.
Even if it did.
It is literally a check on the legislature for the court to say that the legislature cannot do that.
Do I agree with it?
No.
Is it within the scope of the court's power, probably yes.
Judicial review is critical as a check to a democratic government that enforces a constitution.
Without it, anyone could come along and ignore the constitution as they see fit.
Whether or not the current court interprets the constitution the same way you do is irrelevant to the fact that a bad expression of a useful institution does not negate that it is a useful institution.
It's infuriating because Judicial Review has about as much textual and historical proof as Substantive Due Process but these conservative justices aren't talking about abolishing the very principle that gives them power.
They should put their money where their mouth is and overturn Marbury v. Madison then enact honorable Seppuku.
