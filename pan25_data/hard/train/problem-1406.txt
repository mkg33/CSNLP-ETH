Yeah, more the 2nd one.
And that leads to a person being cancelled.
Just saying that you don't like Coke doesn't "cancel" it.
Everyone else can still get it in the same places they always did.
I hate Pepsi.
Did it just disappear from every store?
No?
That's because it hasn't been cancelled.
Has she been recalled?
Is she out of a job and out of the party?
No.
She has not been cancelled.
Someone made an official statement claiming that they don't agree with her decision.
That is quite literally all that happened.
Nothing more.
Cancelled = you no longer work in this industry.
If you need an example of what being cancelled actually looks like, check out Kevin Spacey.
One allegation and he was fired from his own show.
That's being cancelled.
That is not what cancel means at all...
Cancel is when a group express disapproval thru means available to them, like social media or boycotts.
Again you are insisting your definition of cancel is limited to people that gets fired.
As i said, cancel also applies to when customer boycotts or have a social media campaign against it or a person.
Goodyear and other products got cancelled:
As a customer, you can cancel a product like Coke or Walmart.
So Coke no longer work in the industry?
Also, a lot of emplyees are cancelled but that doesnt mean theyve been fired you know.
