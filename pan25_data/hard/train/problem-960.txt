This is a fact.
DRPK was never a part of the ROK.
However, it is a lie of omission.
The DRPK was never a part of ROK because both were created after a civil war which fractured Korea into two separate countries.
It is clear the intent is for ROK + DRPK to reunify into one Korea.
Likewise, it's clear that Chinese reunification means to reunify PRC + ROC into one China.
You can disagree with the reunification, but to claim that reunification doesn't exist is ridiculous.
This a common meme, but it's damaging to Taiwan if you support it's independence.
It implies that China and Taiwan are one country ruled by two governments, which is supported by the CCP and rejected by the DPP.
But as we all know, since the PRC was founded in 1949, not a single day has elapsed where the PRC has controlled Taiwan.
Always good to point out that this is a term of propaganda, as Taiwan has never been a part of the People's Republic of China, not even for a single day since the PRC's founding in 1949.
For argument's sake, let's start by assuming that today's "China" is synonymous with "the PRC".
After all, it is a fundamental claim of the PRC government that China = PRC.
China considers Taiwan a part of China, not that the government of Taiwan doesn't exist.
Taiwan has been making independent international decisions for a long time now and this is no different than any of those.
