I'm ok with it, facts are facts.
It's not like I'm trying to redefine Canada, I'm just pointing out something too many people have ignored for too long.
US citizens, myself included, calling ourselves 'American' as though the label is distinctly ours is kind of stupid.
It'd be like English people telling the Scottish and Welsh they can't consider themselves British.
I'm not jealous of anything, I love Canadians and the fact is that they are Americans.
To only think US citizens hold the claim to being American is, to put it mildly, really fucking stupid.
Probably really going to upset people by pointing out that Mexicans are also American (as are all Central and South Americans).
No thats stupid it's the name of the continent they're on not the fucking country they're in no Mexican or Canadian(barring dual citizens)will say they're American if you mention it to them.
I have never heard of any Canadian or Mexican identifying as "American".
We do not call ourselves "American".
The Term "American" is used exclusively to describe people from the United States of America here in Canada, and is treated as the USA equivalent of "Canadian" or "Mexican".
