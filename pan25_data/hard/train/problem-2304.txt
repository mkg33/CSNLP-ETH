The fuck Trudeau flags are so common that i started assuming the worst in anyone witb a flag if j don’t see it right away.
I haven’t, but I feel kinda guilty when I see a flag hanging out of a car and get mad thinking it’s a Fuck Trudeau flag only to see it’s a Ukraine flag or a sports flag.
I'm genuinely angry that they co-oped the flag in their bullshit, because now whenever I see someone with a flag on their car, that's the association I make first.
It's generally not as bad as the American police violence issues, though there's good arguments that it's only that way because of other outside factors (far fewer firearms about, for example).
There's relatively few (non-zero though) issues with killings or brutality, and honestly, if you live in just a run of the mill middle class suburb, it is entirely possible all your interactions with police are positive or neutral.
Officer is probably just a normal guy.
But then you get to poor, remote, or First Nations communities (which unfortunately tend to be both of the former too), and that whole positive veneer comes off very fast.
Hearing about a First Nations man being pulled from their car and handcuffed for the "crime" of driving home from work isn't rare.
