That's not at all the only conclusion possible here.
There are many reasons to not shoot it down, including watching what China is doing with it.
If they really see little risk of the balloon getting novel intelligence, letting China's actions and intent unfold can be worthwhile intelligence gathering of its own.
Like China would be stupid enough to send over a balloon that we can just know everything about and that has sensitive information?
This is probably a stupid question…but is there a way for the US to capture and study tech attached to the balloon to see if China’s reasoning are true or not?
It being in the US’s airspace makes it fair game, no?
In theory, it's in US airspace, the US can intercept it.
However, they likely want to see where it is going to try and get an idea of what China is trying to scope.
There's probably little risk because most major assets aren't visible openly, and those that are can be seen on any number of sources anyway.
I mean, they likely are, it's just not public.
But now that they public is aware of it, private citizens are tracking.
