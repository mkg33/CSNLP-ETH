A bond fund is like a stock fund in that you can buy and sell at any time.
And that fund, in turn, buys and sells bonds trying to hedge against these risks and provide reliable returns.
Those strategies can be anything from a simple "bond ladder" i.e.
buy and sell bonds every year on a fixed schedule, to sophisticated strategies trying to predict the market.
Bonds usually have a long maturity like 5-10 years or more.
If you buy them you have to wait that period of time to get your cash back, during which time you are exposed to interest rate risk.
Like if you had bought 10 year bonds 2 years ago, you'd own bonds that are paying interest at 3-5% below market, so you are losing money.
The only way you lose your money with actual bond ownership is if the entity that issued the bond goes tits up.
That’s why the bond funds also tanked.
The bonds they were holding became worth less as interest rates increased, so the value of the fund decreased.
Bond funds don’t return principal and have constant maturity, plus are not tax exempt.
So most people would be better off buying 20 year bonds rather than tlt, but signing up for an account at the treasury direct website is tougher than your etrade account.
