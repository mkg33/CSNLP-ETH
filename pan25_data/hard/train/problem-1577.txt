Santos lived in two countries, under several assumed names, married a woman while having a consensual/problematic relationship with another man, scammed people on GoFundMe, ran for congress and won.
Like, as far as we're aware right now, he's lived in two countries, lived under several assumed names, married a woman while having a consensual/problematic relationship with another man, scammed people on GoFundMe, and then ran for congress and won.
He does exist and word is that he’s the greatest Democrat secret operative that has ever existed… when everything else is a lie who’s to say he’ll vote the way McCarthy thinks he’s supposed to?
Or at least that’s what I’ve heard… probably worth spreading around….
Matt Gaetz revealed during a heated exchange with Cedric Richmond that he understood the problems minorities face because he had secretly adopted a mixed race teenager years ago named Nestor.
Matt Gaetz is unmarried and weird and this reveal in the heat of the moment was the cherry on top of a towering cake of bizarre behavior.
It was never investigated because it did precisely what it was meant to do.
Make everyone stop listening to a black man talk about how the Republican Party always managed to say crazy shit to make people stop listening to actual problems.
It could not have been more Pavlovian if it tried, Richmond was literally saying not two seconds before how the public would drop anything if republicans said something bat shit crazy enough and sure enough….
Nestor.
