No.
I disagree.
The net effect of all of that noise would be to diminish the public’s confidence in elections generally.
“If everyone is cheating, what does it matter, why bother voting?
Who cares?” Etc.
It’s wise to not make a big deal out of one off instances of voter fraud that are caught and prosecuted because the system is working as intended.
"Even though there's clear evidence of malfeasance by the Maricopa County bord of electors, it's the GOP who's really committing voter fraud here".
Yes.

It is not up to them to determine if election fraud occurred.
It is up to the courts, which so far has not seen any evidence of massive voter fraud like those on the right keep screaming about.

All of this is being carried out under the accusation that other people are committing voter fraud, which courts have dismissed as and .
