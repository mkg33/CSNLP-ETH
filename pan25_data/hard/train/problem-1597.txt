I think a lot of militaries are very quickly realizing that swarms of kamikaze drones are an incredible counter to expensive machinery like tanks and grounded planes.
This is one solution thatâ€™s already being tested on Navy destroyers as a close in weapons system against drones, boats, jets and missiles:
I was referring more to small stealthy surface drones, like Ukraine's can carry a 200kg warhead and have a one-way range of 800km, but underwater drones...
I mean, that's pretty much the literal definition of a torpedo, no?
A modern Mark 48 torpedo has an estimated max range of 38 km at 55 kt or 50 km at 40 kt, probably even farther if you ran it slower... or if you weren't trying to fit it into a 21-inch-wide tube.
However, I'd imagine swarms of small missile boats are probably a bigger problem.
It's a very cheap way to get a lot of anti-ship missiles in the air to saturate defenses.
Fair, but drones are way cheaper then basically every other weapon system that could take down a warship.
It's not something insurmountable, but will certainly require an adaptation of tactics.
Sure, but human waves aren't very effective against boats, which is what we were talking about.
Drones are also a pretty good force multiplier, so if a country doesn't want to, or doesn't have the manpower for human waves they may serve a role there.
