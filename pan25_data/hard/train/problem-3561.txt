Doesn't even need to be by an Argentinian--you could get pregnant there and give birth here and get legal residency right away and citizenship after that.
No, You gotta give birth there, what they meant is You can get pregnant anywhere and and as long as the kid is born in argentina it automaticaly gets a citizenship and it males it easier for the parents to get one.
That doesn't really matter: as long as the baby is born in a country that grants jus soli citizenship, he or she will be a citizen of that country regardless of what China's laws say.
The baby isn't going to be charged with a crime for being born abroad, and neither is the mother.
Exactly: the US will not recognize any renunciation that doesn't meet their very specific requirements.
For example, if a Chinese dual-citizen tells the Chinese government that he wants to be Chinese only, and that he renounces his US citizenship, the US won't recognize that.
In practice, China will ask the dual citizen to elect one citizenship or the other when he or she reaches legal adulthood by renouncing the other one, but the Western country won't recognize any such renunciation of their citizenship.
I remember reading a few years ago about a British couple that didn't know this, their son was born in the US and was American by birth right and they couldn't do anything to reverse it, only way is their son renouncing the citizenship at age of majority IIRC.
