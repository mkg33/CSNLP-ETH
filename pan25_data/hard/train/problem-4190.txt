unions could be an electoral issue.
biden would rather align with the republicans on labor disputes.
that’s a strategic mistake, since there’s already an anti-union party.
there's no party offering them a solution, could have been the democrats and they decided not worth the effort.
going back to my original question… why would union workers reliably vote for a party that doesn’t reliably represent them?
Absolutely, because the better solution is to vote for Republicans who want to completely dismantle unions and repel of all labor protections That will show those Democrats why they shouldn't forget the unions Even at the State and local level who are much more union friendly!
Ya, Progressives need to believe that there is some deep well of white blue collar voters who would just start voting if only they had a really good Progressive candidate, when election after election shows the opposite.
Progressives are a small portion of the democratic party, and they already reliably vote Democrat.
They are not going to go away as much as they pretend to threaten to.
