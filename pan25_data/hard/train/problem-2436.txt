That and the fact that guns kill more people in household accidents or domestic violence than they do during actually self defense - not counting the almost daily mass shootings we see in the news .
No, and it's a tragedy that our laws don't go far enough to protect families from dying to gun violence/ mishandling.
But you never hear stories of all the people who own them responsibly.
Of course people want risk mitigation.
Owning a gun specifically for self-defense, would be that risk mitigation.
I'm not arguing for states that have no-limits, I think they're a big part of the problem.
But while guns continue to end up in the wrong hands through those states, living anywhere else is more dangerous.
There are armed people who want to harm you and your family just for existing, and the government canâ€™t help.
Of course people are going to want to protect themselves.
I believe it's in the best interest of people who might face danger to have something to protect themselves.
these people carry a gun because they are paranoid that they'll need it when there is no perceived threat.
well someone carrying a gun is a real threat, not perceived.
plenty of people saw someone carrying a gun, thought nothing of it, then the person started shooting.
