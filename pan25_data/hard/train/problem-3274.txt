Washinon and many Western allies say the Leopards - which Germany made in the thousands during the Cold War and exported to its allies - are the only suitable option available in big enough numbers.
A German government source said Berlin would lift its objections if Washinon sends its own Abrams tanks.
U.S. officials say the Abrams, which runs on powerful turbine engines, uses too much fuel for Kyiv's strained logistics system to keep many of them supplied at the front.
To be clear, the US is sending a very large number of armored fighting vehicles, but modern US tanks (Abrams), are extremely high maintenance gas guzzlers with some of the most advanced tech out there.
Germany seems to be using this as a sticking point to avoid sending their own rather than for reasonable protest, other NATO countries are even sending their tanks.
I don't have any real issue with the US sending tanks, but if Germany wants to be a leader of Europe, they should act like leaders and not just ask the US to spearhead everything and take all the responsibility.
Didn't the US government just have a hissy fit a few years ago when Germany and France were talking about making a combined EU military to lower dependence on the US for security?
Europe realizes it, has discussed forming their own EU military before, and everytime they do the US freaks out and tries to get them to stop.
The US is fully opposed to Europe even trying to be independent when it comes to security, and they make that very clear every time Europe is talking about it.
