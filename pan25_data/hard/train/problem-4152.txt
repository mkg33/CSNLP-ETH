You want to know who brings that up the most?
Its not local businesses, or local employees.
No no no.
Its the damn arrogant tourists who think they can no wrong.
"treat me like gold while i treat your city like shit, and youre just going to take it cause tourism dollars".
"treat me like gold while i treat your city like shit, and youre just going to take it cause tourism dollars".
its not my idea and i dont live there, but i can see the logic.
Tourism can ne a very dirty industry, people dont like to clean up after themselves, especially on vacation.
I have family in Wasaga beach, longest freshwater beach in the world or NA iirc.
During the pandemic the beaches were closed, which meant all the public bathrooms too.
That didnt stop the tourists ftom toronto, no.
They setup tents, dug a hole in the sand and then pissed and shat in the very place where local children like to play in the sand.
Sometimes the tourism dollars arent worth it.
I guess if they don’t want that tourist money flowing into the country then shut it all down.
I personally couldn’t care less.
The weather is shit there anyway and if I’m going on vacation I want a beautiful white sand beach.
The other people who want drugs, sex and debauchery will go to Vegas, Thailand or other places with legal prostitution.
I always thought that district was for prostitution and the rest of the touristic area was for weed, never really saw people smoking while looking for sex workers there.
