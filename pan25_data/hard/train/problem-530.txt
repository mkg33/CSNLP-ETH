So if someone once to donate 6 million dollars to St. Jude’s children’s hospital they can just go pound sand?
Not saying dark money isn’t bad, but you have to come up with a more nuanced solution than blanket banning donations, because it could have unintended consequences.
Why shouldn't those dark money donors - so intent on using their money to control gov't to their advantage, while so desperate to keep their identities hidden - not be subject to the same requirements as the average citizen?
And the Roberts Court batshit-insane ruling that "corporations are people" and "money is speech" aka Citizens United - should be first to go if we are ever to have a chance of preventing a Republican-led authoritarian rule.
Meanwhile if I donate so much as $25 to a political campaign I have to give all kinds of personally identifying info including whether or not I am employed and who my employer is, if employed, etc.
This is what has to end as dark money is what funds the GOP's and other criminal enterprises, e.g., Chamber of Commerce, Federalist Society, Heritage Fdtn, ALEC, etc., regulatory capture of nearly all our govt agencies as well as judicial capture of the SCOTUS (conservative majority) and the lower courts, etc.
