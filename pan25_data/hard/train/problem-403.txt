Err… China have been heavily investing in African countries.
Of course they’re going to say that.
They invested $43.5bn in 2020.
They have a horse in the game and don’t want anyone else to win… the game being resource procurement/exploitation.
It would be a lot better if those African nations were the ones exploiting their own resources and making a profit.
No bodies here even mention that it's up to African nations to choose what's best for themselves.
Most Western audience here cries colonialism yet treats African nations like children with no agency of their own, just because they chose China.
It's this exact Western colonial mentality that cause African countries to favor China.
“China has helped Africa to get out of the blackmail of some western countries, which wanted to treat African countries as if they were slaves countries”.
Global capitalism from the West and China will still exploit the hell out of Africa regardless, but it will likely be less agregious.
It's objectively good for Africa to not be near exclusively exploited by Western corporations who have enslaved/scammed them out of rights to their own natural resources/ability to improve civil infrastructure with the investment.
Competition in Africa is the only route to effectively securing their sovereignty/future, sadly.
Africa could've been solidly in favor of the West, but we completely ruined that.
Personally, i'm glad China is more involved in Africa, not because i want them to own it/exploit it (they will try), but because the west/IMF have given them horribly exploitative "deals" for decades.
The West has to be more fair in our dealings now to prevent African countries from accepting the many objectively better deals currently offered by the Chinese government.
