Dems squeaked out a win when they were supposed to get destroyed.
It's probably the best performance by the in power party ever.
Now the R's are showing us how they are going to deal with inflation.... by investigating Hunter Bidens laptop.
It's a loser issue but McCarthy can't avoid it because he has to appease the lunatics in his party because he has a very slim majority.
McCarthy is a human turd come to life but just because the Rs are comic-level villains doesn’t give Dems a pass in being incompetent centrists that lick Corporate boots.
PS: Kevin McCarthy is a massive piece of unamarican shit and doesn’t deserve to hold one iota of power here or anywhere else.
McCarthy is the most worthless person in politics today And that says a lot He is ahead of Lindsey and McConnell.
McCarthy only cares himself and to hell with civility.
So, now he his going to be leader of the house?
And no one from the GOP is going to stop this?
Sorry, but Rick Scott’s have hearted attempt was BS.
The GOP still does not realize the partisan politics of Trump should die!
The American people are screwed.
More tax breaks for the unltrarich, and more wasted money for personal vendettas.
