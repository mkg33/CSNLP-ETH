I teach in a really red state and have never had anyone come close to criticizing my curriculum.
It's beyond fucked that FL teachers have to put up with this.
At some point Florida teachers are going to have to protest.
I know it's illegal in Florida, but it's now illegal for you to have classroom libraries!
?
I have some Karl Marx, would you like me to send it you way?
I mean at this point I'd love to watch my town lose their absolute shit over what's on my bookshelves in my classroom.
If you don't want to protest, move the fuck out.
They'll be fucked without education despite thinking that it's going to do wonders for them.
And it's fucking sad because those kids that end up misinformed or uneducated because of people like their parents and DeSantis can't do anything about it.
They've got a LOT of catching up to do, and clearly their state has no intention of helping.
The school closures for 2020/2021 have severely affected kids educational development, especially kids that would have been in kindergarten through 4th grade during those years.
And it's these same parents who laugh and cheer when the 'hawt teacher" gets caught having sex with a 14 year old boy.
"Damn y'all where where these sexy teachers when I was a kid??
".
Yeah.
I really wish people would pay more attention to things for sure.
I hate Trump with a passion, but if anything, I feel like Desantis has the potential to be far more dangerous than Trump ever was.
And thatâ€™s a really scary thought.
