No but I am seriously questioning your reading comprehension.
Muslim conquest of the area did not expel Jewish people, their war was against the Romans/Byzantine , who were the ones who expelled Jewish people and even forbid them from Jerusalem.
Key point it not being due to arabization.
In fact due to Ottoman rule in the area immigration was allowed into the area to jewish people fleeing persecution and massacres in europe.
That is one set of criteria the UN applies, there are several as so many indigenous people were colonised and cultural genocide practiced on them.
Something that was extremely common in the levant due to repeated conquests.
It was attempted against Jewish people quite often.
I mean, in Israel the Jews don’t appear to be safe lol.
But actively exterminating another people and making them unsafe isn’t right either.
I like how to totally skipped over the hate crime stats, can you please post a resource supporting your claim of Jews being the most hate crimes inflicted group in America for me to research or are we just going to say you were lying to support your argument?
Ahhh yes, the Jerusalem post, totally unbiased and shocker, the 70% figure isn’t mentioned at all, it’s 58% of all RELIGIOUSLY motivated hate crimes, which are way less prevalent than racially motivated crimes per the FBI stats I listed earlier.
This article also says Jews were the second most targeted ethnic group in America for hate crimes then sources itself as the source, but according to the FBI stats, directly from .gov, that’s nowhere near the case.
How about the 54% of religious hate crimes in the U.S are directed Jews despite being only 2% of the population.
Yeah, we are clearly welcomed in the U.S. Just because you ignore the blatant antisemitism or hate doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
Without Israel, Jews aren't safe, wherever they ,may live.
But god forbid Jews have a state in their ancestral homeland.
How awful.
Hypocrites.
