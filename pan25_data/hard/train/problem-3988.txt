Only 3 million people in Qatar, its like $75,000 per person.
Now millions of fun loving people with disposable income are about to take a vacation to a place with sunny weather to watch football, sorry, no beer.
Could turn out to be an epic boondoggle.
Hopefully this will be the end of this nonsense.
It is a great honor for your city to host the world cup or olympics but the city shouldn't be expected to spend $50,000,000,000 for a 1 month event.
I'd rather get arrested in upstate NY than Qatar anytime.
It's like someone didn't think this through.
Japan, Russia, Brazil all phone how to deal with drunken belligerent people.
Qatar doesn't.
I don't understand what Qatar is doing here.
Why pay fans when millions of die hard football fans want to attend?
They will all be cheering at the games.
FYI, Qatar didn't have a major problem selling tickets.
They sold 2.9 millioin.
That's only 5% less than 2018 world cup and higher than 2002, 1998, 1990, 1986 world cups.
I didn't look at earlier than 1986.
I really doubt most people care about how the stadiums were build with horrible worker and human rights.
I'm sure many care but there are an extremely high number of fans.
I'm guessing it might have to do something with the pandemic either concern of covid, flights too expensive, restrictions on re-entering their country, etc.
Or the fact that Qatar is literally just Doha which is a mid-size city and hotels plus fights are way too expensive to visit a mid-size city hosting a world cup.
Even worse is that Qatar is a fairly common stopover for Southern Hemisphere people to fly to Europe, so a lot of people affected by this bullshit likely had no intention of seeing Qatar anyways.
Well, I suppose there will be even less fans in Qatar now, because some people will surely jump off - also because they are afraid that they will be sitting in Qatar and that their hotel might be canceled.
