Coca Cola sells the syrup to different bottling companies across the United States.
Those companies than bottle or can the syrup and distribute it to their local market.
If you are drinking a coke in the US it was more than likely bottled relatively close to you.
I'm from the US and won't order a Coke unless I see they serve bottles so I'm probably not helping the problem at all.
That means it's normally Mexicola with sugar instead of HFCS and tastes much better to me.
It's common in the US for people to buy coke syrup and fill their own bottles?
Or are you referring to drink machines at restaurants and gas stations?
I feel like companies should move into branded reusable bottles and charged refill stations at shops.
You just take your empty coke bottle to the machine it refills and reseals it and you pay for the refill.
Well, it used to be that glass bottles were recollected, sanitized, refilled, and resold.
I visited Germany recently, will need a local to confirm, but when I got take away, they did not provide disposable containers, I was given an actual plate and was able to return it when I was done for a $3 refund.
