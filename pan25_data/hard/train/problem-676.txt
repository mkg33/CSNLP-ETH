The SOTU featured an interesting exchange where Biden brought up the fact that some of the GOP wanted to end social security and medicare.
This is supported by a significant minority of House Republicans but it polls absolutely horribly with the general public.
Biden cleverly used the vocal minority of the GOP to put them all in a negative light.
Huckabee-Sanders could have used her platform as a rebuttal to push back on these accusations but she didnâ€™t.
She wasted the opportunity and Biden will likely sew a small and temporary jump in the polls following this speech.
For the most part I agree with you but suspect there may have been at least some directed at the fiscal stuff that Biden focused on and perhaps just a little less of the other junk she talked about.
I believe this was recorded before the state of the union address... she anticipated a cultural emphasis to the address which led to her focus/comments not really aligning with the largely fiscal focus from Biden.
I am a bigger fan of Biden now than I was in the past and feel that his speach did a great job, especially in the first third when viewership is highest, of focusing on topics that will actually help the party in future elections.
