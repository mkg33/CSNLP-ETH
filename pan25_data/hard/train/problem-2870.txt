You're also completely leaving out that all of the military aid packages have been part of the Lend Lease Act and will either be repaid monetarily or by requiring Ukraine to use US contractors to rebuild.
So far, the lend-lease authority has not been used and there is no expectation that Ukraine will reimburse the USA for any of the assistance that it has provided to date.
The USAI is a third tool in which funding is provided by the USA to facilitate training for Ukranian forces and direct access to American defense contractors.
They are giving a lot of economic assistance as well, but yes the military aide is basically just Americans paying Americans to send assloads of weapons to Ukraine and then also replace them by building more (with newer and better ones, naturally).
Larger countries have entire foreign subsidiaries operating there full time.
Smaller countries will put out large bids that attract a lot of competition for things where they don't have local production.
One of the major factors of that competition is how much "industrial offsets" they are willing to offer (i.e; local production).
