44 here and I will be glad to see this.
Been “lead” by old, rich, raciest, white MF’ers my entire life.
Ready for them all to be ousted.
My kids (19), (18) both voted in the mid-terms and are ready to vote Democratic in 2024.
Boomers show up, and vote for their ideologies, and people their age.
Change needs to come from the younger generation.
it doesn't happen magically.
Only 27% of voters 18-29 showed up.
That's 73% that didn't.
If you want to point fingers, start with the 18-29 year olds that refuse to vote.
The younger voters could push these dinosaurs out of office.
They don't.
twitter burns, and complaining aren't action.
Also, remember the majority of younger voters refuse to vote.
They understand politics like the boomers understand tech...but the boomers at least get something for their ignorance....re-elected.
Younger voters complain...constantly about the older crowd being in politics....but the old people vote.
So sorry the youth vote cares about climate change, our continued democracy, and has empathy for the poor and people who are different from them.
You don't seem crazy if you have the presence of mind to encourage young voters to make their voice heard We have real crazy old folks who want to raise the voting age because the young folks didn't vote the way they wanted them to.
THAT's dangerous crazy.
