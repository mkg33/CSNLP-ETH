The only way Sweden got played here is if Erdogan set things up for our NATO application and I think that’s very unlikely, don’t you?
I suspect that the Swedish far-right's decision to burn the Quran had a lot to do with infuriating the Turks in order to undermine Sweden's NATO bid.
Let's be clear: Turkey is using the Quran burning as a cynical excuse to block Sweden's NATO bid, mostly because Sweden wouldn't play ball with Erdogan's effort to get Sweden to hand over Turkish political dissidents in Sweden.
I find some irony that Turkey is basically saying that until such time as Sweden curtails the freedoms of their citizens and becomes a much more oppressive government with strong censorship, Turkey will not support their involvement in international relations.
So reading into this, the Turks are mad because people in Sweden are allowed to freely protest, and these particular protests were ones Turkey didn't agree with.
It wasn't something the Swedish government did, but people just doing things they're allowed to do in a free country.
