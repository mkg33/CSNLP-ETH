You're a doomer.
You disregard entire humanity's effort and the fact that we have faced multiple crises and have overcame them.
You think there is only one solution and that is simply not the truth.
We will overcome this as well.
Obviously you are right in the sense that if tomorrow everyone stops living high maintenance life then the earth would be much better off but developing nations are simply not going to stop developing.
The US and Europe live in luxury with air travel, AC everywhere, many cars like you said but even the developing countries have to bear the brunt of climate change as well.
So why should only the west live comfortably?
Do you think the ozone hole formed in Africa and Antarctica was because of people in Antarctica?
Obviously no, countries have had bad environmental effects in other countries since long time now.
I agree, but that doesn't mean we stop uplifting people.
It only means that we should experiment and keep researching new technologies that reduce our impact on developing while developing.
For example, China is still going to create 300+ nuclear plants, and is the leader in green energy capacity developed per year.
In fact from 2020-2025, Chinaâ€™s renewable power mix is projected to , which exceeds their target of 33%.
