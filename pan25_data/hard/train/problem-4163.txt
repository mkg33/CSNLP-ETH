I think balloons are technically inflated, so if it's like a zeppelin style thing it's not technically a balloon?
They might just be waiting until they're recovered and they're 100% sure, whereas right now they might be only like 90% sure.
They look like balloons, they move like balloons, I'm not seeing anything that would indicate these are anything other than balloons other than that they aren't just saying they're balloons.
Balloons are actually very hard to detect on radar due to how high they fly at usually and how the surface usually isnt a major radar signature.
Radar isnt always 100% the higher the radar signature, the closer you are, and atmospheric conditions imoact how obervable are.
These factors are why these are hard to detect if you arent already looking for themm.
But they only discovered how to track them in the past year and only have known about them since 2021.
Once they figured how to track them they used SIGNET to trace back previous times balloon fly overs confidently occured.
They were able to extrapolate from the most recent Chinese balloon that it had happened three times during 45's tenure.
That is different from saying they had that knowledge while 45 was in office.
