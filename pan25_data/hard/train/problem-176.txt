Some things will change.
For example, young men will stop being shipped to their meaningless deaths, fewer Russian children will grow up fatherless, and fewer women will become young widows.
That’s crazy to me.
Why would you love what it has done to Russia?
It has made them and everyone around them worse.
Shouldn’t we want to see Russia improve, not slide even farther into insane totalitarianism?
"If only there was something Putin could do to prevent such a horrible horrible thing from happening to his country!
".
Good.
Russians need to feel the pinch for their slaughter, rape, and torture of Ukrainians (and others in the past).
I feel bad for the individual Russian people but I love what this Ukraine situation has done to Russia as a nation.
Somehow Putin managed to fuck up even worse than we did with Iraq.
100% it’s the same kind of brainwashing the US did to its own people to justify the Iraq War it’s just that the impact of the Iraq War wasn’t immediately felt at home and wasn’t nearly as intense.
