Nah, they are Soviet era mines I believe but I don't suspect the Ukrainian army has sanctioned the mining of their own nation or any mining for that matter.
Edit: It is very unlikely that Ukraine is using mines that are so hazardous to civilians in their own country.
Russia however does not care what hazards they leave behind in Ukraine.
Russia's accusations are laughable.
They are.
The mines Russia dropped months ago will still be there and are still going to be dangerous.
It is far less likely that Ukraine is using mines that are so hazardous to civilians in their own country.
If you read the article you'll learn Ukraine (admittedly) has a stockpile of millions of them that they've been dragging their feet on destroying.
I'm not saying I think Ukraine has deployed these here, but there's no denying they have a lot of them.
So you're saying that Russia is doing the very thing they've accused Ukraine of?
I'm shocked.
They've never done that before.
(\Said in the most monotone, un-shocked voice possible.
