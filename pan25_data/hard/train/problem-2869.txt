Here's an easy step 1 for a "diplomatic solution" for Putin: He turns his troops around and leaves Ukraine entirely.
This means all of the provinces that "voted to join Russia" (voting at gunpoint doesn't mean anything).
I'd toss Crimea in there too.
Once all Russian troops have left, then the diplomatic process can begin.
This will likely include (not not be limited to) reparations to help Ukraine recover from what Russia did, sending the millions of Ukrainians kidnapped/human trafficked into Russia back to Ukraine, and cooperating with international war crimes trials.
I hope Ukraine gets justice and Russia has to pay for their crimes, but to play devils advocate, would it ever make sense to live in a world were they concede Crimea and Ukraine is welcomed into NATO and guaranteed future protection?
I am not an expert.
I am just trying to think rationally.
Wouldn't a Crimea operation be unlike anything so far in this conflict?
So the argument that Crimea was very pro Russia before annexation should be treated with scepticism.
Like it or not, Crimea is very pro Russia and was even before the annexation.
Russia is very fortified there an retaking it will be a huge, bloody operation.
