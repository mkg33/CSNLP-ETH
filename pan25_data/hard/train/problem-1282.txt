I don't know what you're talking about, no one is going to shoot anyone.
The people protesting are those that voted against the current government.
Unfortunately they are a minority in Israel, that's why their side lost the election.
That's how democracy works.
It can happen in any democratic government.
It happened in 1930s Germany too.
Coalitions are a part of all democracies, although a lot of people in the US are unaware, but our coalitions are within the political parties themselves.
Of course, in a closely divided government all it takes is a few centrist to break ranks with the coalition run by the extremist minority, but yet they rarely ever do.
After a parliamentary election the parties need to get together and get a majority of the members of parlament to vote in a prime minister.
Parties will trade positions and favors to get over that majority line.
Bibi, even though only his supporters like him, has one of the biggest parties.
That puts him in pole position where he needs to do the least amount of horse trading.
However, it seems like the only people buying horses this time around were the zealots.
I'm not Israeli so grains of salt.
Isreal has a ton of parties for reasons that I've never figured out.
No party ever gets close to a majority so they form political coalitions to form governments.
But since they all have different ideologies they always bicker and the partnerships breakdown, which triggers an election.
Bibi cultivated a cult of personality that most dislike but his supporters love (think Trump in 2015).
He's done a good job of holding on to these supporters over the decades.
I've been loosely following this for the last few years.
What options are left?
There's been like 3 elections in the last 4 years, there are so many parties and they all want conflicting things.
They aren't protesting a fraudulent democratic process.
What's the "soft landing" strategy for these protests?
What kind of reforms could lead to a more stable political system?
