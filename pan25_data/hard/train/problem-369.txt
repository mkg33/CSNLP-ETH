'the West' only makes demands in Russian propaganda.
Have you ever heard of a U.S., EU, or NATO demand which referred to itself as 'the west'?
Russian propaganda on the other hand, needs something to show for.
Something they can claim to have won.
All Russia has won is an army in the cold being fired upon by precision artillery dying from shitty supply.
Russian propaganda needs to create the false narrative of fighting an enemy bigger than Ukraine.
The actual west is fine with Zelenskyy making the demands and he very much wants Crimea back.
What do you mean by "back to where it started" if you mean all of the annexed territory by Russia, minus Crimea, yes.
But what do you expect out of this war truthfully?
A demilitarized Crimea isn't as big of a loss as the whole south of the country or even just donbas.
Maybe this is a controversial opinion but this is actually a pretty reasonable treaty for everyone.
The "putin stays in power and avoids prison" bit, while on the surface a bit infuriating, when you consider the utter humiliation this war has brought on Russia as well as the economic turmoil this war will ultimately unleash on the future generations of Russia, and what he is conceding to Ukraine (all of Ukraine, Crimea becomes a dmz), he's almost guaranteed to be ousted from power and probably killed by his own competitors.
That being said, putin isnt invading my country so I'm sure the people of Ukraine probably feel way differently given the losses they've suffered this war and the blatant disregard of sovereignty.
