Heck, even if you have all the maps, rebuilding after a conflict isn't easy and a bunch of people likely will be killed by those mines before you can afford to get to then.
And yes, there are areas where mines are effective that way, but the impact wouldn't be that massive.
AP mines won't really work on a highway unless you blow it up first, and even on a highway, trucks will be moving in a column, just a bit faster.
And speed doesn't matter that much.
And again, no one is preventing you from using the same tactic on the enemy territory, when you have to abandon an area or have a chance to scout ahead.
As such moves are way more effective when layed quickly where enemies don't expect them (for example securing a strategic target that you just took over in a foreign territory).

Yeah well...
It is not a very good mine if you can just swipe it off the road with a foot.
I think I heard something about other mines having anti-tamper system?
Totally not a mine expert, but that would make sense.
