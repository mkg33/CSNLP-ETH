We are seeing it play out with abortion right now.
Kentucky voted 52% to deny an anti-abortion constitutional amendment.
But they sent Rand Paul back to congress with over 60% of the vote in the same election.
On average, abortion is more important for the anti crowd than the pro crowd.
There are a lot of people that support abortion but aren't willing to make it a ride or die priority.
I think both the gay rights and abortion movements should start doing more ballot measures to get shit done.
Boil it down to a question on the one issue and don't rely on it getting bundled with other issues and assigned to a candidate.
Gay rights has the same problem.
Plenty of people don't care about gay rights or support gay rights, but there are also 50 other things they care about more.
Whenever I see so called centrists trot out the "over 70% of the country supports gay marriage, so there's nothing to worry about" line, I just roll my eyes.
It's easy to respond in the affirmative on a poll on a topic you don't care about, but perceive social stigma for being against.
That poll isn't measuring actual support, but something closer to apathy.
I know centrists who "support" gay marriage, but defend the don't say gay bills.
Ones who also think queer people are too woke and need to tone it down.
Ones who tell their queer relatives to "drop it" when uncle Jim is over calling queer people groomers/pedophiles, just to have a "nice dinner with the family", knowing their queer family member is more likely to acquiesce than the bigot.
There's also the ones who "Don't care about the gays" but will vote Republican no matter what, and make excuses that it's just 1 issue they disagree with, so it's not a deal breaker.
And in their mind, the majority of republicans in Indiana don't support it, so the republican senator not going with that opinion is an outrage.
