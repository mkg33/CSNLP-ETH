The only location they want real bad is Golan Heights for strategic purposes and thats the "Palestine" part not Jordan.
Iran will become an eternal dictatorship if they get nukes, a civil war might also mean said nukes end up in the hands of an extremist factions.
No country of the likes of Iran should ever have nukes and yes I also agree that Pakistan should have never been allowed to have nukes.
I don’t want Iran to have nuclear weapons, but be fair, the only reason why you don’t have a problem with Israel having nuclear weapons is because Israel is friendly with the west.
Israel treats Palestinians terribly, and is a massive threat to its neighbors.
First, Israel is not a massive threat to it's neighbors.
It factually gave back more land mass than it's entire size in exchange for peace with it's neighbors.
So your comment is very wrong.
So let me get this straight, it's the US and Israel who are the monsters and a danger to the free world, yes?
"We trust Israel to do the hard and right thing for us while we sit on our asses and try to point out every little thing it does wrong".
