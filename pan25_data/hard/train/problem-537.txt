So much this.
California's primary election is on March 5th, 2024.
Even if they announce 1/1/24, that gives them barely 60 days to campaign lol.
I'm pretty sure the as well.
Yup.
Most House Democrats and the overwhelming majority of California House Democrats voted against the Iraq War including Pelosi, Barbara Lee, and Maxine Waters.
Another reason to dislike Schiff.
Secondly, even if Iraq had WMDs, toppling Saddam was a terrible idea.
Whenever you topple a brutal strongman who is holding a country together, the result will be even more chaos, more sectarian violence, and the rise of terrorism.
The Bush administration didn't provide any evidence that Iraq had WMDs.
The job of a Senator or representative isn't to blindly vote the way the president tells them to vote.
It is to look at the evidence and vote based on that.
