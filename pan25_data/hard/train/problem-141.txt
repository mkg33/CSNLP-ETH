Another easy, low cost, low technical way to insulate your windows without replacing is by removing the frame around the window (wood detailing that is really just hiding where the drywall ends and your actual window frame begins) exposing the wooden frame everything is mounted on, and spraying (window and door specific!)
insulation foam in the gaps to eliminate draft as much as possible.
What can be done is addressing drafts from around the window itself, where there are gaps not properly addressed by a gasket.
Changing windows is moderately technical, even if you are keeping the frame and replacing just the window system (pop out old window and replace with new window with identical dimensions) - especially when it's a cold time of the year.
Having a single pane glass isn't great, but it's a million times better than double/triple pane with 0 insulation around the frame and allowing draft to enter the home.
If you're still on single pane windows it's worth upgrading, but the improvement from double to triple pane is not big enough to justify the cost usually.
At least not compared to other insulation measures.
And lastly, insulation changes the temperature and humidity in houses and walls.
Some old buildings become mold-traps once insulated.
