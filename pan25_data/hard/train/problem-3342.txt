Exactly - he almost won the seat, and might still.
And as bad as he is, was there any other Republican who would have done as well against an incumbent?
I agree with the gist of this, but why list 'first AA Senator' and a list of committees, etc If you want to use these as yardsticks then an incumbent is always going to be better than a challenger.
You're literally saying "He should be a senator because he's been a senator, and if you haven't been a senator then you shouldn't be a senator.
".
So right.
The republicans line up, rank and file, and vote R on every single ballot.
And every year too, not just general presidential elections.
Really is astonishing what money can do to politics.
Imagine if the people nominated someone like a job interview, as opposed to having a dumbass candidate jammed down their throats by the RNC or DNC.
Imagine how far left the spectrum would have shifted if every eligible citizen had voted in the past 50 years.
Democrats simply don’t vote as a form of protest.
They think it’s making a statement but all it does is enable the right wingers to shift the political spectrum their direction.
