Plus a bunch of people are either transplants from other states or are young enough that the name Herschel Walker didn’t mean that much to them even if they follow UGA football a little bit.
And I’m pretty sure they win this seat in 2022 if they run a generic R politician who can recite the GOP script semi-competently.
I'm just going to go out on a limb and say that senators should probably be at least fairly intelligent.
It amused me to no end when Walker did everything he could to lower expectations for his debate performance against that slick, silver tongued preacher man using all them big words.
What came into my mind was what i thought would be a good campaign slogan for Warnock: "Stupidity is not a virtue."
Expand this to an ad calling out the campaign sins of Herschel Walker: "Lying is not a virtue, hypocrisy is not a virtue, delusion is not a virtue, child abuse is not a virtue, domestic violence is not a virtue, and stupidity is not a virtue."
I need one more to have the seven deadly campaign sins of Herschel Walker.
How did this man get so many votes?
