this one is an easy story to run because unlike most right wing rage bait stories it isnt 90% delusion.
the balloon is real.
china is real.
it is at least superficially weird that china is floating high atmosphere spy balloons around.
China says it’s a weather balloon.
USA says it’s surveillance.
We have it now.
Someone’s story is going to have to change and how they handle it is what’s important.
Not weather balloons.
Not China trying to bring back 1940s military strategies.
There’s a ton of shit the military does and knows about that is not released.
Even to other parts of the government.
This weather balloon was made public because the public saw it and Republicans used it as fuel to feed fear, anger, and propaganda.
This is what they do.
It was trending.
Democrat leaning media reports... the news.
This is not a story that should be confined to Fox News Propaganda.
Not everyone finds a weather balloon scary but instead, interesting.
But the attention it has gotten from Republicans is only because they want Democrats and Biden to look bad.
They do this every day.
They already do that now.
I'm sure Biden doesn't hear about every us jet that gets scrambled when a Russian jet enters alaska airspace until after it happens.
