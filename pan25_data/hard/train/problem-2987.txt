Problem I have with these narratives is that there is very little evidence the money that the Democratic Party spent had any impact on elections.
Money makes no difference in general elections and only a theoretical difference in primaries.
There isn’t much evidence to show how large of an impact if any this spending has.
I doubt there is more to be said about campaign spending than the fact that Americans have more money than they know what to do with.
Take political spending out for a second and look for where you think Americans would rather be spending that money.
As a country, our military budget is clearly leaps and bounds higher than any other.
Our spending in healthcare and education has ballooned far beyond any realistic gains in either sector in recent decades.
Our spending in housing continues to drive an all time high housing market.
Our spending in entertainment has driven sporting events like Super Bowl prices to absolutely insane levels.
While not as extreme as the previous examples, we also have one of the highest motor vehicle to person ratios in the world.
Despite all of this crazy spending in every sector, we still have more money left over which is why some of it ends up spilling over into political spending.
I think it makes far more sense to talk about how the Republican primary voter’s gamble with far right candidates failed than to talk about any minuscule theoretical difference democratic spending had on those results.
Radicalizing Republicans and encouraging them to stop nominating moderates because they'll lose by primaries could be disastrous in the long run.
Plus those in states and cities that this fails in like NC are stuck with extreme candidates representing them.
