I agree, because Mar-a-Lago documents is the easiest to prove and has the fewest co-conspirators.
Also, Trump has basically admitted every element of the crime in his various public statements.
They may still be trying to figure out what happened to some of the documents, but I suspect they’re about ready to indict.
Jan. 6 is the biggest, because they want to get everybody involved.
That’s a long list.
Plus it will take a little while for the DOJ to put the data from the Jan 6 committee together with their own data and to chase down loose threads from that effort.
It’s still a little while out.
Then Georgia.
They’re interviewing the high-ups now, which means the investigation is almost over.
I expect Trump, Mark Meadows, and Lady Lindsey are all going to get indicted there.
When they decide to indict trump we should not send anyone to arrest him.
Instead we should send someone to tell him that we found proof that he won 2020 and tell him they have to take him to the new inauguration.
Then when he gets there it should be an empty basement like in goodfellas.
It was revenge for Joey Biden, and a lot of other things.
And there was nothing that we could do about it.
Biden was a made man and Donnie wasn't.
And we had to sit still and take it.
It was among the Italians.
It was real grease ball shit.
