"So, Mr. Trump, are you saying that you're not the healthiest of all the living ex-Presidents?
Is Barack Obama healthier than you?
How about Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton, and even Mr.
Carter?
".
Trump: "I'm the healthiest ex-President in history!
People still talk about how healthy I am.
No one has ever been healthier than me in the history of the presidency or actually even the United States of America.
Great country.
The best country, with the healthiest ex and soon to be president again.
I'm that healthy folks.
No one is healthier than me.
".

Not all boomers!
Been voting progressive for decades, as do all my boomer friends.
I will tilt at those conservative windmills as long as I have breath in my body.
Lucky you!
I look out my bedroom window and there's a Trump flag right there.
I have a personal bubble of, I think, every progressive person in SE Washinon.
The rest of the area is... Well, the land of Newhouse, McMorris-Rogers, Didier, and Matt Shea.
Pray for me.
