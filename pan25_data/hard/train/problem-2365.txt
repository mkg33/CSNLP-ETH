Yeah I still think a bigger Dem majority would have done more.
Tough to get that after only 4 years of a Republican president.
It's like if Kerry had won in 2004.
Probably not getting the ACA then.
Too many Democrats were celebrating this nomination process without realizing what is actually happening.
Republicans are setting the stage for max pain and I can guarantee you when the debt ceiling does come up, corporate Democrats will harken back to this moment as justification for why they had to give into the Republican demands.
This is gonna be a rough two years.
Hopefully you all think we got enough done under Biden's first two years to be worth this.
I think that's the real reason it is taking so long to confirm McCarthy.
Basically the game of chicken is starting now.
Republicans want to look as loco as possible to extract as many concessions as possible.
The question is whether or not dems will give concessions that the GOP will inevitably ask for, and what any such standoff will entail.
Even slight delays in raising the debt ceiling could have dire consequences, so it could become a very worrying game of chicken in Congress.
Can someone please explain to me why the previous Congress didn't pass before they left a debt ceiling increase that would have carried us through at least a good part of this term?
