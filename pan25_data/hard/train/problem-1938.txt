Ya’ll are missing the point.
This requirement is so that no one has to debate.
Especially Trump.
Just refuse to sign and then point at the establishment GOP and blame them.
It’s playing to his base.
And DeSantis, Cheney, Pence whoever won’t sign it either so no debates.
This is the RNC providing cover to not debate for their candidates.
This pledge has to do with republican primary debates.
So, Republican vs Republican.
They’ve already said they will not debate the democratic candidate.
This is pledge that all of the candidates taking place in the debates will support the candidate that wins.
It’s meant to not split the party.
It also, by some extension, give a bit of a boost to Trump.
There are moderate republicans who will never sign this pledge, so they will not be debating in front of voters for a chance at the candidacy.
Perhaps McDaniel should require Republican candidates to pinky swear in addition to signing her loyalty pledge - just to make sure.
And I fully expect that the RNC chair McDaniel w/her idiotic "loyalty pledge" won't say or do a damned thing about it.
As usual Trump will continue to trash the other Republican candidates and most definitely NOT support ANY Republican nominee - other than himself.
