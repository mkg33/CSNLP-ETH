No I'm pointing to out why it's a categorically horrendous idea to remove an anti-suicide measure from your social media site 2 days before fucking Christmas.
I don't ha e to be mad at the people who owned twitter before bc they weren't fucking stupid enough to shut off an anti-suicide measure during the peak of suicide season.
Are you being serious…are you literally trying to blame holiday suicide rates on this moron owning twitter?
So you’re saying that all previous holiday suicide rates can be blamed on all the people you’re seemingly defending, and owned twitter before?
It’s not an obsession, it’s just calling people like you out.
It’s really nothing more.
Things have devolved so much, most of you won’t pay attention to anything unless it dealigns with your perverted sense of politics, let alone acting how you are somehow now noble.
It’s really nothing more, I hate Musk, never used twitter, voted dem and progressive my whole life.
It’s really just calling out a hollowness that allows lies to build.
No more, no less.
Twitter always sucked, and your’re getting rage baited into headlines to push ad revenue, that you would never get if someone else owned it and did the same things.
Twitter’s response reads more like a “oh, shit, people don’t like what we did” attempt at public relations damage control.
The original interpretation—that it was intentionally removed—seems more likely.
Or even just that it was mistakingly disabled due to a bug.
But taking it down to revamp it?
That’s probably the least-likely explanation.
