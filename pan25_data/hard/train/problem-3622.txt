Indiana.
It was mostly forest before clearing in the 19th century and the soil is terrible.
Impossible to grow much without a lot of inputs.
The agrarian culture is just much more prevalent here.
Also , farmer's markets and local shops are everywhere.
When I lived in Indiana, there were a handful of grocery stores in the entire county.
Most did not have fresh fruit or any meat..
It would blow most American's minds of just how much food there is here.
At least a hundred tons of apples, cherries, apricots and plums just fall and rot on sidewalks and on roads in just my village alone every year.
It’s sad that there is virtually no public fruit trees here in the US especially in low income areas where people often can’t afford fresh fruit.
Fruit trees need water once or twice a week, fertilizing or composting two or three times a year and that’s about it.
Imagine if every town planted a small orchard, The upkeep would be minimal and you wouldn’t even have to pay anybody if you get volunteers.
