I live in Idaho.
People complain about California transplants constantly.
Republicans complain they're "bringing their liberal politics here and ruining Idaho!
".
That's the thing.
California conservatives feel the NEED to be Uber conservative in order to make up for the state that they live in.
The fact is, most of the California transplants I've encountered are all super conservative.
As far as I can see they are only bolstering the GOP stranglehold on state and local politics.
They should, but the "I've never been outside of Idaho" crowd is loud and doesn't get that California â‰  LA/SF.
To them, all Californians are commie scum escaping a failed state and coming to ruin Idaho with CRT, legal drugs, and universal basic income.
I like to gently remind folks not from California that our homelessness is awful because we've absorbed so much of the homelessness created in other states.
Working class people can barely afford rent, so getting the homeless housed is difficult (also shelters are always opposed by local NIMBYs).
