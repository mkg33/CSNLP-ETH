Genuinely.
Imagine making a vaccine that saves potentially millions of lives and then a bunch of assholes who can barely read try to put you on trial for it.
When you calculate all of this together with background rates, real, legitimate and causative severe side effects are almost unheard of from the vaccine.
Probably one of the safest vaccines ever developed.
They also ignore all the side effects in the placebo group in the original 2nd and 3rd phase vaccine studies.
Extrapolate those and include those as well (on top of background rates of all of these possible illnesses, prior to covid vaccine existing), and the real legitimate side effects are even more rare.
The side effects placebo wing of the Pfizer studies are very interesting to look at especially, like how the same, or more people had vomiting or diarrhea with the placebo injection than with the actual vaccine, same with severe fevers in the over 55 age group as well as severe headaches and severe fatigue.
Also instances of swollen lymph nodes in the placebo group as well as appendicitis.
