True, but russia also uses ceasefire as time off to regroup, prepare/make weapons, mobilise and train people to launch another attack breaking all previous agreements.
So having a ceasefire with russia isn't really an option.
I really can't see Russia ever giving up any part of Ukraine unless forced out, and Russia will only agree to a ceasefire if they get the land they think is theirs.
That won't stop Russia though - it ultimately wants ALL of Ukraine.
The thing is that Ukraine cannot win the war.
Putin is crazy enough to not give up no matter the economic or human costs.
He will just keep sending more people until Russia wins.
He will use nukes if he feels like he has to.
If things keep going as they are, Ukraine will simply lose after they have their whole country devastated.
That's if the war doesn't escalate into nuclear territory.
One can't exactly call for peace in a war of aggression without calling one side to surrender.
So unless Lula either condemns Russia or tells Ukrainians to give up their land, then Lula's calls to "make peace" are toothless.
