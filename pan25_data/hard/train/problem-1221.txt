I love that Pete Buttigieg is also working on developing a website for Airline passengers Rights to Travel/Refunds/Services they are entitled too.
DOT under him is forcing these airlines to set up clear and concise policies so they can't shove a coupon or credit for next trip when it should direct refund.
Thats crazy expensive.
Sounds more like rates for Tourists rather than locals.
But I agree with you that airlines should not be allowed to Resell a ticket and overbook a flight.
When you book a flight and can’t make it you should have a right to give the ticket to someone else.
It’s a seat you already paid for but many are not transferable.
That’s sad.
What ever causes a person to not be able to travel shouldn’t be an opportunity to resell a seat for the airline and make money Twice or charge large transfer fees.
There are a lot of things that need overhaul in the airline industry.
We have a small commuter plane between our island and Oahu.
They do not allow transfers and the tickets for a 25 minute ride is 240 dollars.
Maui can get to Oahu for southwest for 30 dollars one way.
It’s said how airlines can get away with this.
It depends on how much you are willing to spend.
240 is the cheapest.
