Doesn’t this light it up like the 4th of July for, well, literally anything that can track IR….
And also makes missile itself sensor blind… which is something you don’t want if you want your missile to A: dodge incoming fire and B: Uh, ya know, hit your target?
hypersonic weapons move so fast that no existing anti-missile-defense can even SEE/TRACK them.
if it flies at you, it needs to miss you won't even see it coming.
The Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) is a medium-range surface-to-surface boost-glide hypersonic missile planned for use by the United States Army.
What stuff like hypersonic glide vehicles are a way to extend payload range or to miniaturize booster rockets for the same range/payload over ballistic missiles.
Hypersonic cruise missiles are a bit more unique but have terminal velocities comparable to ancient weapons like the AS-4 Kitchen.
They simply decrease delivery time.
Plasma stealth is not a thing except for low-frequency early warning radars because 1.
High frequency radars including and above the Echo and Foxtrot bands (S band in IEEE), which are most fire-control radars are still reflected unless you have really really high plasma density.
2.
Plasma is fucking hot to the point where orbital IR sensors are likely to pick it up.
