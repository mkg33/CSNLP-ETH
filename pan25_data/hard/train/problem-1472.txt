If your entire sovereignty movement just blatantly ignores the basic structures of government as set out in the constitution, which is also the basis of your governments authority, you're gonna have a bad time.
The law’s not really about the sovereignty movement like the headline implies, it’s about trying to limit the power the federal government has when it acts (in their view) without proper authority.
Right now how it works is the feds write laws that then have to be enforced in the provinces, if they think the law violates the provinces jurisdiction they have to go to court and prove it.
This new law tries to put the onus on the feds to prove their law does not violate provincial jurisdiction before it is enforced.
When they actually make a law that violates the division of powers, it'll get challenged quick enough.
Probably not by the federal government, but by a civil group that got screwed over by it.
Quebec has a succession movement that is grounded in law.
A question was passed to the supreme court, and a procedure was established, and a referendum was held.
In order for such a law to pass, it would have to be amended in the constitution, which the majority of provinces would have to vote for.
