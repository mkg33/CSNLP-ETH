The elderly might fret about this a little.
("Helen We need to restock the bunker There's a radioactive tidal wave gap!
").
Hmm.
I'm not going to delete my previous comment, but after a bit more though, I may have been reading an in situ engineering analysis of recreating a naturally occurring tsunami.
Oh it's worse than that.
The back of napkin math says that at most something like .33% of the energy of a atomic explosion is propagated into a solid hydraulic pressure wave.
And that means even a modest 10m wave would require a litte more than a 500,000 kiloton detonation.
The tsar bomb, for comparison, has a hypothetical yield of 50,000 kilotons.
(Nuclear bombs just don't have the right force over time to make ocean waves.
).
Now.
I'm not an alarmist.
But given Putin's prior behavior the last 25 years, I have absolutely no doubts he'd sacrifice all his countrymen for the sake of getting his name to echo throughout history.
Whether as hero or monster, he doesn't care.
Ghengis Khan was a proverbial slaughterhouse made flesh.
Yet his name is still carried with fear and reverence.
That's what Putin wants.
He wants a legacy to last throughout the ages.
Not just some random president somewhere that had some little war with those folks who were once a part of the old empire.
