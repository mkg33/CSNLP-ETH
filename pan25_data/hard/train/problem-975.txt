I wouldn't fault him for donating to his own charity if it actually operated as a charity, but my understanding is that his acted as more of a slush fund for him and his family.
Fuck Trump, but assuming I had started a charity that was doing work I thought was worthwhile (presumably I would), that's probably the primary place where I'd put my donations.
I'm the last person that would defend Trump, but he didn't say he was foregoing his salary but rather he said he was going to donate it to charity.
So yes, him earning the salary is correct.
You mom gives you $100 to pay the landscaper and you put it in the bank.
When the groundskeeper comes, you write him a check for $100 from your bank account.
We're not discussing whether or not Trump is a fraudster.
We have proof he is.
We're discussing whether or not he donated his salary as he said he would.
He said he would donate his salary and he did (for a year) with a handout of a cartoonishly large check, as I recall.
Stupid question looking for an honest answer: I assume he would receive the salary but then donate an equal amount of money and call that "donating his salary."
But did he just not donate $250,000 to the other branches of government like he said he would?
Or did he just not donate $250k to charity at all?
