Safe to say they won the war, but the U.S. refuses to give up on their interests in the region.
(Hence the reveal in the Twitter files part9 exposing the DoD using "white listed" propaganda accounts on Twitter to spread Pro-Saudi Yemen war messages).
The Houthi's are Shia Muslims who live in a Sunni majority country.
They're a minority.
They also border Saudi Arabia, a country who has interests in keeping their boots on the neck of Shia Muslims in the region, and always have.
Saudi Arabia and Iran are sort of two peers of Islam.
Iran is a democracy (sometimes called a democratic dictatorship) with a religious head of state.
But the form of Islam they preach and promote comes from what is known as the "golden age of Islam"... and it's 10th century Islam.
It's highly Islamic and very much based on Sharia Law.
Wherever their influence is it's trying to remove any sort of civil rights and modernity from countries.
In the past the US intervened in these sorts of things.
Like Yemeni terrorists struck a US ship in the late 90s/early 00s.
But in this case, the US didn't intervene.
Saudi Arabia held meetings with the US where the US sort of blessed a Saudi invasion.
And so Saudi Arabia invaded to try and stop this rebellion before it spilled over into their country.... which caused Iran to increase their support for this invasion.
