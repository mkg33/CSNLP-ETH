Russian state TV showed the empty ballots being counted.
They don't even try to hide it.
The whole country is batshit insane, the sooner Ukraine wins, the faster the better for them.
How can the Russian public get behind his crap when it was clear that Russia invaded Ukraine.
Russia threw the first punch.
Trans-Caspian pipeline project was nerfed after Russia invaded critical parts of Georgia, the oil and gas basins in the Sea of Azov were off the table when Russia invaded Crimea, and the eastern Dnieper-Donets basins are off the table after Russia invaded the Donbas.
Ukraine was threatening Russia's position as a natural gas supplier to Europe, which would have had massive economic and geopolitical repercussions for Russia.
Not that I'm excusing Putin's actions, just that this was likely the top reason (amongst several) for the annexation and war.
It's somewhat funny how much projecting Putin does, accusing the West of conspiring to steal Russia's wealth.
What, is he afraid of competition?
He definitely didn't pay for his $1 billion dollar Black Sea mansion with his government salary.
