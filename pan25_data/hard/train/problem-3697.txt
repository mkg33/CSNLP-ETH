The Pentagon apparently wasn’t aware of the balloons until after Trump was out of office.
Would corroborate Trump’s team’s claim that he wasn’t told about them while in office.
I’m not arguing about the optics here.
I know the politics of it all, the Dems are already trying to play it as a failure of Trump in the media when it was a failure of military intelligence, which isn’t automatically/necessarily a fault of Trump.
Could he have played a role in it somehow?
Maybe.
But it’s only been a few days.
It’s going to take time to investigate.
I mean by all means investigate.
Any answer they find looks absolutely terrible for them outside of liberal plot, and that's the least plausible by a mile.
>“There was a potential opportunity for us to collect intel where we had gaps on prior balloons,” he said.
“And so I would defer to the intel community.
But this gave us the opportunity to assess what they were actually doing, what kind of capabilities existed on the balloon, what kind of transmission capabilities existed, and I think you’ll see in the future that that timeframe was well worth its value to collect over.”.
There is that too, which, well, after the bravado he had over the weekend about how he'd deal with it would be lovely to hear about how a Chinese spy balloon was so boring that it didn't make the briefing cut for him.
Esper: “I don’t ever recall somebody coming into my office or reading anything that the Chinese had a surveillance balloon above the United States…”.
