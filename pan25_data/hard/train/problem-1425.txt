Funny how the people already making well above minimum wage never talk as if their higher pay effects inflation it's always the minimum wagers who get the flack like they're the ones pushing inflation some how.
This would actually help inflation because inflation that was a result of price gouging would actually increase the minimum wage.
This tying the minimum wage to inflation would create a disincentive for companies to raise prices without justification.
So it does make sense (at least at first glance) to consider increasing minimum wage as of greater consequence to inflation than increasing salaries of upper and middle class folk.
It just seems backwards however.
Yes, there are complicated intertwining issues here.
But we ought to be increasing minimum wage tied to something like inflation or cost of living or given enough time the minimum wage becomes useless.
So it's because of inflation that we ought to raise the minimum wage regularly.
Funny as soon as we start to see minimum wage go up inflation goes up 10x higher than normal.
Companies will never allow themselves to make one penny less, so as long as wages increase, inflation will outpace it.
Because fuck everyone else but the “winners” at the top.
