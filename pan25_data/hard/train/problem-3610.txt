There should be a priority outlook on clearences for politicians in how fast they can get them, and how beholden they are to punishment.
A congress member should be able to do their duties within the first year of election, but they should also be held to a higher standard.
Yeah... but here's the thing, I think rule of law is more important than any individual politician.
I don't think Pence or Biden had intent to commit a crime, but instead engaged in negligent handling of those old "irrelevant" (we don't know what's in them... it's secret) classified documents.
Ironic that Biden and Pence didnâ€™t realize they had classified documents, but cooperated when they found out they did, but Trump, the normally incompetent one, did know he had them, and was just too much of a prick to give them back to the archives.
Compare this to Biden and Pence who legit didn't know they had them and are co-operating fully with the investigation and are following their lawyer's advice.
They are also probably going to take whatever dick-slap they are going to get (nobody's getting impeached or going to jail).
Trump on the other hand is just digging himself deeper into his hole and has been ever since he put those documents into that banker box.
You know at some point you have to wonder if it's the system that's the issue.
This is now the third person who has been caught with classified documents at home.
At this point there needs to be an investigation into how this exactly happened because something is broke.
