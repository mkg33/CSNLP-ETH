The main argument on Teslas side is that those laws were written to protect dealerships (which took the initial risk to establish a presence in a location) from competition with the manufacturer, which could undercut the dealership.
Tesla does not have any existing dealerships in place and should not be subject to that same law.
It's written differently per state, and ultimately I think Tesla is in the right (why should a private company be forced to work with a dealership when never established beforehand?).
It's also one of the few car companies that can do this.
Dealerships provide more than just sell you a car.
Corporations such as Tesla want to increase profits by not providing even remotely close service to it's customers as those through dealerships.
Tesla still sells like hot cakes in China, and has waiting lists of months in every country on the globe, while still increasing production by nearly 50% this year.
But if they won't begin to adjust prices - yeah they would be in trouble.
