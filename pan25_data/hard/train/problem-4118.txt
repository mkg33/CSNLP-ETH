Maybe it'll be enough rope to hang themselves for the 2024 election.
But yeah..they're transparent about their plans for us all, huh.
We'll try but no promises - these people will break it all if it means they can line their coffers.
they'll wreck the entire country just to fight over the fucking pieces.
They have limited power without the senate and the white house, their views are outdated and dying as fast as their base is - and a lot of people want actual answers on real issues instead of bullshit grandstanding...which is all they can do for the next year.
I think it's too slim a majority for them to realistically pull it off this time around - too many vulnerable republicans in swing districts.
Can't imagine what it'd be like if the midterms had gone the way the right thought it would.
That’s half the reason it didn’t go the way the republicans thought it would.
They have alienated any American who isn’t voting for them.
Time and time again anyone who isn’t committed to the Republican Party has watched it act with incredible incompetence in governance.
From the multiple debt ceiling crisis, the housing bubble fiasco, the entire Trump presidency, and COVID; the Republican Party has been ruining itself with its incompetence.
It is basically becoming their brand and pretty soon they will either have to abandon it or watch from the sidelines as the left splits into two parties.
