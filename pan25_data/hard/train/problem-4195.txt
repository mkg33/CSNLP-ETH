They didn't need to manipulate the entire country, not that the entire country voted for Brexit anyway.
They only needed to manipulate enough people to swing the vote.
They only needed to swing the vote?
Did you not read the bit where I said "no real evidence suggests that their interference had any real influence... let alone enough to sway millions of votes.
".
But anyway, keep posting pro kremlin propaganda on reddit that baselessly gives them credit for not only manipulating an entire country into voting brexit but also creating the very idea of brexit... You are a joke.
The main goal of their interference is to sow division and its a relatively new initiative (a decade or so) so its definitely reasonable to believe the russian continue to do so in an attempt to improve it.
Despite none of its results being confirmed so far.
Especially when its relatively cheap.
Yes Russia absolutely interfered in brexit, as they did in pretty much every single democratic election in the last decade (most of which were won by centre left candidates) and yet no real evidence suggests that their interference had any real influence... let alone enough to sway millions of votes.
Russian interference is very much a reason that Brexit happened, although I would say the largest influence was 40 years of Europhobic tabloid propaganda.
