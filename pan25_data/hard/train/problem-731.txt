The U.S and NATO did intervene and enter the war when Serbia was doing genocide in Kosovo, they also intervened and joined the war when Serbia was at war with Croatia when Yugoslavia collapsed.
I think people get this idea from Kosovo, etc - NATO intervened because it was a bad look for genocide to be happening across the border.
It is very region specific whether the big nations will bother to help or not.
If nukes were not a factor, NATO would have intervened already.
NATO doesn't like wars on its doorstep.
And invading Ukraine has given NATO the biggest casus belli since... well ever.
The EU should have course-corrected after Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014.
Putin did lots of dodgy stuff before that, but afterwards it was clear things would only get worse.
Yeah, it's like the parable of the frog and the scorpion.
EU (frog) assumed Russia (scorpion) would play nice and that way everyone would benefit.
Europe imported gas throughout the Cold War too, why would it be different this time?
But Putin fucked everything.
Fuck, Putin and fuck his supporters, and Fuck Al-Assad too.
Syria is more corrupt than North Korea for fucks sake.
After what they did to my people, I am surprised jt took them this long to declare them a terror state.
