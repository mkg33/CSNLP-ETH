And you figure an aggregator, especially a high profile one like 538, would try to correct for that or at least lead with that important information more often.
Reading the data and pushing the idea that voters seemed to be breaking for republicans in the last few weeks had me worried there!
One thought I keep coming back to is how, in the weeks leading up to Election Day we were seeing so many polls favoring the Republicans winning, which was clearly part of their strategy.
I wonder if that perhaps ended up backfiring on them.
But since none of that actually even happened, but they set up that expectation, it definitely seems to have made a difference in how both parties have reacted to the results.
Dems are even more motivated than ever.
GOP are basically at each others' throats.
Perhaps relying on a bunch of questionable polls to project a resounding victory was not a great move on their part.
With billions being dumped into ads in the weeks leading up to the election, it wasn’t unsurprising to see a shift in polls.
A common refrain - which is pretty true usually - is that the candidate that spends more on ads wins 90% of the time.
However, that’s not the sole factor.
Consider why said candidate has the funds for so much advertising: they have backers, they have promise, they have appeal.
Maybe their opponent lacks one or more of those things.
