No, they didn't vote for it internally.
Here is how it went down, executive suddenly informed everyone after the current session had already started that the name would change mid-session instead of for the beginning of the next session.
That these are the two choices that had been pre-selected by the executive and people could vote on them and only those two choices.
Either this means I haven't been around enough racist people, or I've been around much more racist people.
If you hear the word "brownie" and associate it with something racist, that makes you come across as way more racist then the person innocently saying it.
I mean, if far right racists suddenly collectively decide to commonly use words we freshly deemend "unracist" (in a demeaningful context or not), people would need to come up with new words again.
Which would start all the bullshit arguments over what's fitting all over, all while racists still be racist.
Someone said nobody ever uses it as a racist term, I said people do.
That's it.
The end.
Nothing more, nothing less.
You don't need to read between the lines, it's not that cryptic if you're not a moron.
Indians are black?
Like I said in my other comment, I've heard my own family members say this shit.
In fact it's the only other descriptive word other than "Paki" that I've heard from them for these people.
