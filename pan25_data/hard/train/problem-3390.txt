Here in Colorado my local power company is putting limits on how much juice they are willing to buy from people contributing to the grid with solar.
I don't get it.
I don't agree.
Tokyo has a lot of sunlight and unused rooftop space.
There is no inconvenience here for anyone other than very large companies.
If you read the article, the rule is that new homes built by large development companies require solar panels.
Hey we will install and service your solar panels, you just keep paying us the monthly utility bill you were paying the electric company.
(Meanwhile, they will also receive all of the money from the electric company buying electricity from those solar panels on your property, even as you continue paying them, but they won’t tell you that outside of the very fine print.
).

5 wards in eastern Tokyo (e.g.
Kōtō and Edogawa) are prone to massive flooding and have a large concentration of non-apartment type housing.
How will the Tokyo govt secure safety from electrocution when these solar panel systems submerge?
(The controlling party hasn't really answered this, which is understandably concerning.
).
And yeah.
It's fairly common for people to move into their old family home to look after their elderly parents.
