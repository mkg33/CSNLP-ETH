>The significance was not just symbolic, even in a state where power was already divided, with a Republican-controlled State Senate and a Democratic governor.
Republicans hoped to vote on several constitutional amendments that would not require Gov.
Josh Shapiroâ€™s signature; one would require voters to show identification at the polls and another would give the legislature the power to reject regulations put in place by the executive branch.
Democrats were worried that the Republicans would also change the rules of the House if they briefly won control, making it hard to elect a new speaker after the Democrats retook the majority.
Yep!
There was a real risk of Republicans rushing through proposed constitutional amendments on party-line votes with their temporary State House "majority."
And, as the NYT article notes, there was also risk of a GOP-run House amending House rules to delay the election of a new Speaker once Democrats regained their actual majority.
My understanding is that Democrats have a very slight majority but one member died and two got elected to higher office.
This was done to get a functional government in place instead of letting the republicans delay the special elections for months to claw at all the power they can for as long as possible.
