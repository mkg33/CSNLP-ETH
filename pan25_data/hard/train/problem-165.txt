I'm seeing some think pieces on how this is a win for the Democrats, and a possible approach on how to move forward in purple states.
It is, in fact, a demonstration of how objectively awful a Republican candidate can be and \almost\ win: Walker was a terrible debater, a walking gaffe machine, and had a horrible-but-true personal life that in no way demonstrated he was living his beliefs.
And with all of that, he nearly won.
The Republicans will learn from this; next time they'll have a halfway decent candidate and bury the Democrat candidate.
His lowering the bar also made it possible to elect embrassingly dumb people like MGT and Booblehead, and to run people for the Senate like Walker.
Spoewing vitriol is now the primary (often only) qualification to be a MAGA candidate.
Granted it was different back in the old-old days.
But not in the 'vintage' days of the 70s, 80s and even the 90s.
Take a look at the politics of the 40s-80s.
All of that was pretty standard for the time.
Anti communism, anti segregation, anti.
