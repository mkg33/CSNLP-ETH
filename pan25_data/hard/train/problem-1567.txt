You would have to look it with your own eyes to believe it, let's just say a part of R's base is zealot as they come, Hunter is amoral, most drugs addicts are, they no longer difference between right and wrong and Hunter is their perfect model to hate.
I ask you again, if Hunter running amok doing drugs and fucking hookers makes their base believe all kind of wild and crazy theories, why would Republicans send Hunter to jail?
once he's jailed there's not much left to do but hate on Joe for no other reason than being his father.
my personal opinion is... Hunter should be investigated, but he holds no office, why is the house spending so much time and effort on a private citizen?
The role of investigating private individuals belongs to the DoJ, which last I heard, still has an open case on Hunter.
I have not heard that anything about that case that might be unique enough to pass new laws, so there wouldn't appear to be a need to empanel an investigative committee (like the Jan 6 Committee).
There have been no credible accusations of impropriety by the DoJ, so there really isn't grounds to impeach anyone over that either.
