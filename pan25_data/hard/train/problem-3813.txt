What does that mean?
Well, you don't test for covid, there's no reason to automatically assume the illness was covid-created.
And if they had any lung issues before, then any lung problems aren't covid-related.
Hell, if you keep them on life support long enough, eventually they'll die of heart failure or sepsis or blood clots.
Hell, if you take them off life support, you can usually technically claim heart failure.
They can also claim that an underlying issue caused the problem, like we know diabetics with covid die more often, so if you're a diabetic with covid, you're going to be listed as having died from diabetes instead of covid.
Etc.
But sure, no one's died of covid ...
They changed the definition of "dying from covid".
IIRC, it's now something like "died of covid-created respiratory failure" or something like that (sorry, cba to look it up).
I remember reading that they ruled that in order to be listed as dying from Covid, the patient needs to die from respiratory issues, or something very specific.
It could be using the same restrictions that lead to the saying that no one dies from the flu in China.
