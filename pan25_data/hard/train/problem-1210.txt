Some credit is due to Biden, but it sure helps to have the HUGEST, MOST TREMENDOUS, NARCISSISTIC, FAKE-TANNED FOOL ever to have been a US citizen doing everything he can to fubar the Republican Party.
In that pursuit, I do earnestly wish Trump all the success the GOP deserves.
Trump was the catalyst which converted the unfocused Tea Party into the MAGA Movement.
Granted others, such as Gingrich, set in motion the stupification of the GOP, but it took a perverse political idiot savant to convert that into a truly malignant political movement.
Gingrich and the 1994 Republican wave started the process of dumbing down the GOP, and the 2010 Tea Party wave solidified the rise of the militantly ignorant within the GOP.
Republicans had transformed themselves into expert-loathing, faith-is-everything-evidence-nothing, I HATE CHANGE radicals without a sufficiently radical leader by the mid-2010s.
Trump took advantage of that.
But yeah, Trump being a POS helped.
Also, Trump appointments to the SCOTUS repealed Roe and put the right to get an abortion as medical care on the ballot.
