I can't see the Federalist Society being too onboard.
If you were to take this and apply it to every state and national election, then the courts are utterly worthless.
Which means the Federalist society would lose the power they hold within the republican community.
Just my thoughts though.
Thats kind of what I was thinking.
NY performed poorly for dems this round because their gerrymandering was rejected by the courts.
Honestly I just think dems need to find ways to work with this supreme court and use their rulings to advance dem priorities.
A lot of these rulings cut both ways.
I think this essentially would mean that state legislation decides the map and there is no one that can intervene.
Meaning there is no such thing as gerrymandering (even if there was no court could do anything about it).
Im hoping.
Honestly i think gerrymandering is terrible but if its ruled fair game by the supreme court then it becomes a tool you have to use.
Thanks for the information.
The most disappointing thing about this is if it is found to be constitutional by this supreme court, democrats wont take advantage of it.
