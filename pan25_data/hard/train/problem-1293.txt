Putin has to be severely desperate with the way oil prices are going.
They were expecting a vastly different situation for 2023 and are getting absolutely annihilated on the front lines.
It's not a mystery why they have been trying to push Ukraine to 'let them win' through negotiations recently.
Russia's condition for talks in the first place presumes the Ukraine to admit some sort of defeat, as things are far from static, no?
But, if that is the benchmark to look for, Ukraine can merrily liberate Crimea, and Russia will have to accept the loss of territories for talks...
Not to mention Ukraine is damn smart for not accepting any ceasefires or "peace talks" unless Russia leaves the country.
All Russia wants is time to get their troops rearmed before the talks will mysteriously fall apart and a renewed offensive starts.
Funny how Russia is the one screaming about peace talks but they won't give up anything to get those peace talks.
If we are to be technical, there hasnt really been any point in the past 9 months where Putin wasn't "open to negotiations/diplomatic talks".
They've indicated such repeatedly.
The problem with these faux offers of peace is that they all come with the very important caveat of Ukraine giving up all territory occupied by Russia, the end of Western aid, and several other things that are complete deal breakers for Ukraine/Western Allies.
The reality is that these "offers of peace" are actually just veiled demands for Ukrainian surrender meant to drum up pro-Russian voices in the west or fool those on the fence who don't understand the underlying implications.
It tries to paint a false narrative of Russia innocently wanting peace, only to be denied by those evil Ukrainian/NATO warmongers.
