Uh if Dems faced big losses in the midterms this subreddit would be nothing but Common Dreams articles talking about a lack of exciting candidates and other ways to divide us.
So if moderates/centrists aren't the better choices for some races, explain only 4 new progressive Dems getting elected this cycle.
Progressives make up like 12% of the Dem Party, the rest are Liberals and Moderates.
The progressive agenda is not as popular as some claim, considering even Fetterman somewhat moderated his progressive stances.
Maybe its because the progressive (Fetterman) denied being a progressive,and distanced himself from progressive policies.
I also don't know how you came to the conclusion I was shitting on progressives and young people.Fetterman ran a moderate campaign and denied being a progressives,those are facts.
Where you paying attention to the Fetterman race?He distanced himself from many progressive rhetoric and Bernie and Aoc.He ran as a moderate and his positions were left ambiguous.Just go to his website and see how vague he is is on issues.In the last hour, called in Biden and Obama to rally with him while Sanders stayed sidelined.
