Nah, he's too busy to waste his time with this.
These aren't good faith subpoenas, they are malicious ones.
Payback.
He does have other things he should be doing, and if he starts showing up for subpoenas for made up stuff, they will just inundate him with subpoenas just to hamper him from getting anything done.
Then there is the issue of taking a subpoena seriously when itâ€™s sent by someone who defied a congressional subpoena.
I think we should hear from Republicans reasons they think a subpoena is only valid if it requires compliance by Democrats.
Well exactly, and that's why I'm suggesting a strategy that might give more power to Congressional investigations, such that subpoenas will be enforceable and they won't have a choice to ignore them in the future.
Again, I don't think it's possible as the Rs won't support it, but it would be a positive strategy for the Dems, and making them appear in favour of strenhening the institution that is Congress is a better look to their own supporters and independents than merely saying, well the Rs ignore congressional subpoenas, so we're just going to be the same.
Better to say, we will ignore them until the Rs put stronger legislation in place.
How do you propose to make them give a real and direct answer to that question?
They have no problem constantly deflecting from their blatant hypocrisy.
Trying to catch them out with difficult "questions" goes nowhere.
They just don't care how their inability to answer makes them appear to anyone with any standards.
All they care about is maintaining power and appeasing their idiot supporters.
