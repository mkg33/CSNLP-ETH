I see your point and agree that American social media companies also mine user data but just because TikTok content may be made by American users doesn't mean they can't be influenced either directly or indirectly by the Chinese government.
I don't really give a shit if it gets banned, just think the argument that tiktok is influencing American users on behalf of the Chinese government is veering into conspiracy theory territory.
I just hope that if we do ban tiktok we take a look at facebook.
The data mining is enough for me to support a ban but the talk of tiktok being used by the Chinese government to influence American users has so far been entirely hypothetical.
It just sounds like a conspiracy theory but I wouldn't be surprised if it were true.
A decent majority of the hong kong protest videos I saw had the tiktok logo in the bottom corner.
I wouldn't be surprised if they were limiting the reach of those videos but I also don't see how not being exposed to public knowledge about the Chinese government would make people view it favorably.
I think the underlying issue is how many people rely on social media for their news.
