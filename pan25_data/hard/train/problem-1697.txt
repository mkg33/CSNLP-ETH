It takes time and resources to get a production line setup for a new caliber.
I don't see the value in starting a production line for 130mm ammunition since it's only used in one prototype tank.
It would be smarter to redesign the panther to use 120mm tank rounds which are widely available.
You have good points.
But I will say 120mm tank shells have been used effectively to destroy Russian built tanks in the past.
While the extra firepower would be nice, I think the added logistical and manufacturing challenges outweigh the advantages.
It would be better for Ukraine to not have to add another ammunition size to their logistics system.
Besides, Ukraine will likely need 3 million 155mm artillery shells in 2023 - about 2.4 million more than currently produced in the USA and Europe together annually.
The Panther stores 20 rounds, and will certainly not prowl around on it's own, but with other tanks, IFVs with infantry and ATGMS, so it will likely reserve those for more recent T72 upgrades, T80U or T90s.
You can pretty much be certain that each shell will mean the loss of another one of Russia's dwindling number of near-peer level tanks.
So providing a couple thousand shells max.
over a year for an extremely usefull system seems rather sane and manageable, compared to millions of artillery shells, weighing around 100,000 tons all taken together of at least 4 calibres and subtypes compatible only with certain systems (SMArt, BONUS, OGRE, ...).
Their APS system isn't a new development and launchers for 2 Israeli Hero loitering munitions shouldn't be a problem either, so the main challenge would be the gun and the autoloader.
They've been developing a 130mm gun for the Leopard since 2015, calling it the "Rheinmetall Future Gun System" - so who knows, maybe it is indeed ready for production.
I can't imagine Rheinmetall wouldrisk their entire reputation to sell what would hardly be more than 50-60 tanks.
