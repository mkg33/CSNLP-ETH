How long do you think China would allow a foreign aircraft to overfly its territory without permission?
Other than all that though, yes, countries have full sovereignty over their own airspace and can intercept anything in that region however and whenever they please.
I cannot possibly contort my thinking enough to see how a military balloon in any way makes sense for a country with satellites to spy on a country with mostly open borders and no real controls on who does business with whom.
That makes one of us.
They are making noise because they were given the opportunity to by us acting like baffoons.
If I cared about anything enough to want high res undistorted pictures from the sky, the last thing I would think is "lets try launching a balloon from half a world away, that will TOTALLY fly over exactly what I want to see!
Although now I'm amused by the thought of a balloon carrying an explosive and being directed into the path of another balloon.
Probably also impractical but mildly amusing.
Would have to be a remarkable drone to get that high.
The balloon shootdown was achieved at the very limit of the F-22's flight ceiling, and even then they needed the missile to close the gap.
I don't know if any drones are capable of that kind of flight.
