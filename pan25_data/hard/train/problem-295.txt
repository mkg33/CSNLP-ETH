The strong franc makes problems of course, especially in the economy that is focused on exports.
But it has also positive effects, like when you import resources and goods, you pay less because of the strong currency.
As a Swiss, i can assure you, this would not even be an option if we had joined the EWG in the 90's, that lead to the EU of today.
The Swiss Franc as currency was never in debate, nobody would be okay with abandoning the own currency for the Euro.
They are trying to devalue the Swiss Franc because everyone is buying it as it has one of the lowest inflation rates for a stable currency.
Switzerland exports quite a bit of tech products and if the Swiss Franc doesn't devalue like the rest of the currencies, people stop buying swiss Products.
Because Switzerland does not provide weapons to countries at war.
Switzerland gave Ukraine quite a bit of money, if they buy weapons with that, that's just how it goes.
They literally had a negative interest on accounts with more than 1M in them.
They wanted people to sell of Swiss Francs but instead rich people just got the money in cash and stored it in stacks in bank safes.
The problem is that the Swiss Frank is notoriously strong and by buying a lot of foreign currency it is tried to devalue the Swiss Frank.
This brought a bit of inflation as a side effect.
