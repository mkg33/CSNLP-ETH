Joe Biden in 2007 while campaigning in the presidential primary (Rudy was, amazingly, then the front runner for the R nomination): every sentenace from Rudy is a noun, a verb and 9/11.
And of course, the irony here is that Hunter Biden has a much stronger case for disputing congressional subpoenas given that Hunter Biden holds no public office and has no announced intentions to do so.
No, Hunter Biden is a private citizen who is under the microscope of the GOP purely as an attack vector for Democrats who actually are in office.
This is precisely the kind of harassment that Republicans claimed when Democrats sought Donald Trump's tax returns.
Congress would have a valid interest if Hunter Biden were serving in the White House or an agency in any capacity, such as or .
He has never served in those capacities or anything similar.
Nor would Joe Biden likely appoint him to any of those roles, given Joe Biden's overt and candid discussion of Hunter Biden's residual issues.
Biden is outpacing Trump, Obama, and Bush in his appointment of Federal judges, and he has the Senate for two more years.
With no legislation coming out of the GOP-led House, the Senate will have nothing to do but confirm more judges.
Biden also has appointed more women and POC to the bench than the previous three presidents combined in only 2-years.
