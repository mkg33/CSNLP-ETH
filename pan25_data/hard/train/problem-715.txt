The factoid I put out there is "It takes longer get licensed as a barber in NYS than it does to be a State Trooper".
There's no specific number of hours required in training to be a barber in NYS.
Training classes seem to run around 300 - 500 hours to teach the basics and get you ready for the licensing exam, and a class in hygiene and sterilization of equipment is required.
There is no requirement that you have a HS diploma or GED.
I'm guessing you're hinging this on "licensed" for the barber since they can't work unsupervised until they've completed a 2 year apprenticeship.
Since troopers can't just go out and start their own police departments, they're technically always under the supervision of their officers, with the exception of the Superintendent.
Officer ranks generally take far longer than 2 years to attain, sometimes decades.
The NY State Police isn't just handing a badge and gun to anyone who wanders in.
For troopers, the academy is a bit over 1000 hours, and that's on top of having 60 college credits (usually in criminal justice), and a HS diploma or GED ( which presumably you'd have needed for college as well).
Barbers also don't have to do any continuing education, troopers are required to take training every year to keep their certification.
