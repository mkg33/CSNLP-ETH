I’m aware.
I’m just using the term as short hand.
The Anti-LGBTQI BS in either country is meant to distract from horrors caused by other policies, at the expense of people who aren’t prepared to make a violent response.
Perfect targets for bullying.
In Florida it’s part of the governor’s Anti-Woke propaganda used as a smokescreen for his disastrous anti-democratic and failing economic policies.
In Russia, I’m just imagining that its providing cover for miserable intravenous drug use issues.
Russia has a massive heroin problem, and in the last decade or so, a particularly scary variant of it has been sweeping through Russia, I'm not sure the chemical name but the street name is krokodil.
it's essentially a small amount or heroin (dicetylmorphine) cut with a bunch of chemichals to make it hit like a much larger dose of heroin.
Users will often shoot up a bottle of eye drops (yeah, eye drops) after injecting the drug to make it hit even harder.
The name krokodil comes from the scaly appearance of the skin of it's users.
The average life expectancy of a krokodil user is only 11 months.
Why do people take this shit then, when heroin is still fairly accessible in a market like Russia (they share a landmass with Afghanistan where like 90% of the worlds opium comes from, so it should be just as easy to get heroin in Russia as America)?
Its cheaper.
Heroin addicts run out of money and get desperate.
Yeah, the USA has a policy issue where pharmaceutical companies have way too much power over the medical system, so a ton of opium gets imported.
However, since fentanyl is synthetic, its a similar issue to meth, it can be manufactured locally, even by users with relatively improvised setups.
Since you need so little fentanyl (mass wise) to lace so many doses, it's become a huge problem.
