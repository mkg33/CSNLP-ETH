I don't think anyone would disagree that the Iranian government is absolutely horrendous and is a murderous regime, but just because I'm wondering, do you have any link to where their constitution says that?
You'd think with the amount of verified anti-israeli quotes out there, there would be no need to make bullshit claims about Iran's constitution as well, seems like the ban was well deserved, thank you for the follow up!
Its hilarious to see people here calling this propoganda as if targeting Jews or Jewish targets outside of Israel isn't something Iran and Hezbollah has been doing for decades already.
The rise in violent antisemitism throughout the diaspora shows that there are already radicalized people out there who simply need the excuse and means to attack Jewish communities.
The Iranian government can just send out maps and a little nudge, and people who aren't directly connected with Iran, but are already possessed of antisemitic animus can be motivated to act.
The Iranian government has stated repeatedly over the years that it intends to eliminate Israel, which has the single largest Jewish population, entirely.
Plus, the Iranian government actively promotes Holocaust denial, so Iran's genocidal intent has been made clear.
