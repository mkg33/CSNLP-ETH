Army leadership takes money meant for producing advanced equipment and awards contracts to cheap alternatives while keeping the change, commanders request delivery for the cheap equipment that never gets produced in return for kickbacks, supply officers sell off whatever new kit does get delivered and dig out old junk from storage, armourers strip that junk of anything they can sell, and the common soldiers end up with bullet proof vests made of cardboard.
There's also a great video on lying in the Russian army, and how it leads to catastrophic battlefield mistakes because nobody is being honest about how things are really going in the trenches.
This is what we keep seeing, Russia launches an offensive, it is laughably under-equipped because their power on paper isnt real, tanks have no firing pins and are useless, troops have 1940s bolt action rifles and no winter clothing, half the artillery shells are duds etc.
You drill your troops every day but the troops are using outdated equipment to train with on the shooting range and so their accuracy ratings are worse than youd like.
Lets put you in the shoes of a Russian drill sergeant.
You have 2 kids a wife and her parents to look after, you want to rise up the ranks as fast as you can to look after them.
