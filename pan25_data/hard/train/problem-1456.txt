Sanders bill is excellent but it should go further and make all income subject to the SS and Medicare taxes.
About 40% of total US income goes untaxed, the Musks, Trumps and Bezos and their corporations.
Taxing them both regular income tax and SS/Medicare tax would allow for an overall tax rate cut for ALL Americans while eliminating the budget deficit and fully funding SS and Medicare.
Removing the current SS payroll tax cap is an obvious way to help keep the system solvent and should be hammered home by Democrats every time the GOP suggests cuts are the only way to save it.
They stopped the tax around there because there was no need for the government to secure more of someoneâ€™s retirement as the max payout was already enough for a dignified retirement.
Taxes stop being collected at 160k, but benefits also stop accruing at 160k.
Someone making 160k each year will recover the same payout in retirement as someone making 10 million.
Many people who labor make 160k a year.
Their wealth is built off their own work, not off that of other people.
I agree taxes should be raised on the wealthy who do benefit unfairly from the labor of others, but that is better captured by a tax on capital gains or wealth, not payroll tax.
