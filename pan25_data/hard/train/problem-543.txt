Not to mention what the winter would do to the Russians in the battle field, they look well supplied for winter.
Putin does not have winter supplies for all these soldiers.
He thought it would be done in a week or two.
A week ago.
Yet they only yesterday USA highest general said Ukraine should not stop until Russia is gone, and USA will make sure Ukraine can keep advances in the winter time.
All a "short truce" would do is give Russia time to regroup and rebuild its forces, and Ukraine currently has the momentum in their favor and truly has Russia on the defensive.
That's what Russia is trying to do with this, and Ukraine isn't taking that bait.
And let's not forget, this isn't the first time Russia has pulled this sort of stunt, just look at Moldova and Georgia as an example, they aren't going to stop.
What do you think happens to Belarus if they suddenly also decide to move towards warmer relations with the West?
And other countries like China is keeping a close watch on the conflict as well, as they too also have dreams of imperialist expansions to neighbouring territories, and in fact have done so in recent memory, just look at Tibet.
And we know they're really eyeing up Taiwan right now.
No one wants nuclear war and no one has forgotten what is at stake here, but the whole "Fuck Ukraine, it's not worth it I'm scared of Russia" is both a dangerous and frankly, ignorant road to walk.
