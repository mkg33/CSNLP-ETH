2016 was my first election, and I graduated college well before the pandemic hit, so I missed lockdowns as far as school.
I’m by no means a fan of Donald Trump or his covid policies, which could have been much better.
But having lived in a red state during the pandemic, my experience was that Republicans were generally the ones criticizing school lockdowns for the negative effects on education, pointing out that teachers were prioritized for vaccination, that the disease largely doesn’t pose deadly threat to children, etc.
I know most of us in my friend group were actively telling our elder relatives to get vaxxed, had no problem wearing masks in public areas, etc.
This could be for a variety of reasons.
One explanation might be because men are more likely to say that the patriarchal society doesn’t benefit them generally the way it’s often alleged to.
Another could be that they’re generally fine with social equality, and have been for some time, but are not trending one way or another politically because they don’t feel like either option actually renders a more equal society than the current one.
It’s certainly a very complex issue.
I do agree that these are complex issues with a lot of factors.
And definitely that many women are watching their rights being taken away, which has to make anyone more liberal.
That is exactly it - plus add in being lgbt and female, two groups whose rights, choices and lives are being taken away or limited on the whim and will of those with the power to do so.
