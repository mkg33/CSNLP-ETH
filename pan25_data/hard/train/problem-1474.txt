People in these comments dont understand what it means to be “leftist” or “conservative” in Latin America.
Latin America has a history of caudillos (you should know what that is if you're commenting), on both the left and the right.
Not every leftist in Latin America is someone to aspire to.
Castillo is extremely unpopular.
He has gone through I believe over 30 different Cabinet ministers.
He is incompetent and doesn't know how to run government.
There's good reason ordinary Peruvians are fed up.
I guess you are not familiar with Peruvian politics of the last 30 years.
It is no conspiracy.
They are tying to avoid jail time because of the scandals going back 20 years.
Ironically you are quoting right wing talking points from the election from embattled asshat and Oligarch Basombrio after it was shown he(Castillo) was a rondero.
Well the President in Germany said it in 1932...
Very rarely(lol) are right wing protestors ( that up until a few years ago were disappearing 100's of people, with corruption scandals going back 20 years) that are organised from the right wing judiciary and political side, better for the country.
Not really, the conservative parties are much more mild nowadays, my country is very conservative but I haven't seen much of what you say, maybe you are thinking about the times of Pinochet?
In countries with multiple parties there can be things such as being economically liberal while being socially conservative and so forth.
Likewise, we have had parties that are economically conservative while very socially liberal.
We have multiple parties and therefore you can find parties which are economically “leftists” while being socially “conservative”.
Likewise you will also find the opposite and everything in the middle.
