Data released by the Georgia secretary of state showed that mail voting in the state’s November general election plunged by 81 percent from the level of the 2020 contest.
While a drop was expected after the height of the pandemic, Georgia had a far greater decrease than any other state with competitive statewide races, according to a New York Times analysis.
While voter turnout remained strong, absentee voting in Georgia dropped off drastically in this year’s midterm election, the first major test of an expansive 2021 voting law that added restrictions for casting ballots by mail.
Turnout data suggests that a large majority of people who voted by mail in 2020 found another way to cast their ballots this year — turning to in-person voting, either early or on Election Day.
Turnout in the state was 56 percent of all active voters, shy of the 2018 high-water mark for a midterm election.

About 1.3 million mail ballots were cast in Georgia in the presidential election two years ago, compared with just under 250,000 last month — an 81 percent decrease.
Not absentee voting, but for early voting for the runoff they only opened 3 locations for my county of 300,000 people.
I dropped my ballot off directly into the Dropbox yesterday, and the line of voters was wrapped around the building.
They removed the majority of the absentee ballot drop boxes.
The only remaining ones in my county were moved inside, can only be accessed during voting hours, and have an attendant dedicated to watching them.
