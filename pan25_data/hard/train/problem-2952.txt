My electronic devices died by 19-30 and so I decided my only option at this point is to go to sleep as there's not much I can do in the dark.
Woke up half-an-hour ago.
Still no electricity, no idea what time it is.
Used gas stove to make some tea.
And as I sat at my kitchen table and unpacked pakhlava that I bought on my way home, electricity got back online.
I thought it was 3 or 4 am, but apparently it is not even midnight!
I haven't been so time-lost in like forever lol.
Btw, home internet is still not back, but at least mobile hotspot works well.
Most are actually impressed how efficient services are at hotfixing the damages.
Imagine being able to restore(albeit partially) supplies of water and electricity in a span of hours every time attack happens, while working in a +1C wet snow/rain weather.
Infrastructure workers are unsung heroes of this war and I hope they get the respect and praise they deserve.
Hope post war the government puts together awards for emergency and infrastructure workers similar to what you might those who served in war.
Obviously it's not the same thing, but their duties and work is no less important.
