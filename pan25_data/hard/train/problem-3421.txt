If Putin gets away with it, you're just kicking the can down the road because he'll be hell-bent on revenge, spend all his time rearming and preparing it and the next time the death toll might be much higher.
Terrible idea.
Which doesn't change the fact that Putin and his fascist apparatus will seek revenge on the west and will aggressively rearm and rebuild their military.
With one single goal: revenge.
Sure, there will be more fireworks when that occurs because everyone else will arm too.
But does that sound like a recipe for "saving lives"?
Has their old recipe worked?
No.
Putin has been killing, invading, annexing regions and destroying governments/nations because for the longest time there wasn’t retaliation or consequences.
I doubt every nation around Russia isn’t quadrupling their military arsenal after this war.
Either that or they are negotiating with the EU, NATO or the USA for some type of military contract.
Be it arms or protection.
It would take decades of investment in military for Russia to even be on par with NATO if NATO would actually bring out their arsenal.
Russia economy and demographic in on downward spiral.
Just to bring them back to what they were a year ago economically will take a long time.
