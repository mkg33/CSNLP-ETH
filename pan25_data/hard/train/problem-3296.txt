You would just never know when thing would just scatter the most after all, destruction is what it all causes.
When buildings get destroyed due to earthquake and people lose their lives that stuff is indeed difficult enough to watch over!
Even the strongest building gets destroyed though when earthquakes just hits the fact that a 6 magnitude earthquake hit my place.
Is It true that the Richter scale is not particularly useful when it comes to measuring nearby quakes larger than magnitude than 6.0-7.0?
I know the physical seismograph can only physically record about that high if you're near the epicenter of because there isn't actually room for the pen to measure higher than that.
I believe most devices are digital now, but do they run into the same problem?
Back in the '90s there was a study in which a person had to tap out the tune of a few simple songs like Happy Birthday - with no actual tune attached.
So they could hear the song in their head, but someone listening would only hear the beat of the song through the person tapping on the desk.
The person was first asked how many people they expected would pick up on the song they were tapping.
They generally said it would be obvious: around 50% or so would be able to name the song.
When they tapped out the song for a listener, however, only around 2% of people were able to name the song.
There was a huge discrepancy between what the person tapping thought would be obvious and what was really obviously to an uninformed person.
