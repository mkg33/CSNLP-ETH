Warnock's was the most persuasive political ad I've ever seen.
Imagine if we lived in a functioning democracy where his opponent could come out with a similar one to encourage people to get out the vote.
If you’re voting in person, try to get someone to vote with you, who may not vote otherwise to vote, if you can.
Imagine if 5% of just this sub did this, that’s over 400,000 votes, so spread the word on the sub if you can!
Hi person reading this, please make voting your 1 thing to do on your to-do list if you haven’t voted already.
Ignore this It’s too damn close I’m voting for Fetterman on Tuesday and I’m taking 3 other people with me to vote.
Ignoring that republicans will vote for any warm corpse on the ticket next to the (R), are their candidates really the best they can do?
Looking past the bullshit ideology for a minute, Walker, Booberts, MTG, and so many more are just terrible candidates for the job.
Suppose republicans fulfill their doomsday fantasies and gain complete control over the country, then are they still going to have people like that running things?
If not, then where are the better people now?
