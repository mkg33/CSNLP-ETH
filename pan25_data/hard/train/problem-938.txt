I feel like a better way would be for China to stop making imperialist claims and threats and aiding other imperialist endeavors.
People would probably care a lot less about spy balloons then.
So the US was just supposed to wave to the spy balloon?
We can now fly similar spy equipment balloons over their military bases and they would point, smile and wave at it?
Yes with Satellites, TicTok, Chinese home security systems, IOT, our own social media, phishing scams ect, there is no privacy breach already in place that a Chinese balloon made much worse.
But seriously the Chinese warnings are like Trump tweets the hot air they fill these balloons with.
When that didn't get traction they had to resort to claiming the US had sent 10 balloons over China last year...
China: okay listen, you shot down the red balloon, and your jet had plus 3 pen so you got the green balloon too.
But we’re about to send a rainbow balloon.
US: a rainbow balloon??
You can’t just skip past the pink and black balloons??
That seems like escalation!
