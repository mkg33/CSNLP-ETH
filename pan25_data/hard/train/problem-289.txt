The amount they were actually given was probably closer to @ $50-$100M.
"for management-services/fees".
Yeah, right.
Yep.
Every time I make the point about how corrupt American politics is I get loads of down votes.
I don't care.
Eventually the suckers will get it.
There's a public database that let's you sort, filter, look up any one to see how much in bribes they are taking and from whom.
I'm supposed to be mad over Trump and his brats getting paid off, but when Nancy Pelosi raises a billion dollars I'm supposed to think nothing of it?
Like all those corporate donations over the years weren't bribes?
Almost everyone in Congress is on the take.
Why should I care about the exact dollar amount and source?
You either are corrupt and accept bribes or you don't.
There is no gray area here.
The grey area IS who.
Don't be obtuse.
There's a difference between taking "donations" from a company and being expected to pass a bill or whatever.
And taking 3 BILLION dollars from the government of an objectively bad actor government.
Don't hurt yourself bending over backward to convince yourself Trump isn't, himself, a bad actor.
