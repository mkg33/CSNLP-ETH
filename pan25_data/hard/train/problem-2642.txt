One of the Q conspiracies i saw floating around after the attack on Paul Pelosi was that the last job held by the attacker was George Soros’ chauffer/bodyguard.
Yup.
Yep!
That’s why it’s so infuriating that they won’t let it go.
It’s all for show for their base to keep them distracted.
They just want to keep their base distracted and outraged.
It’s a whole tactic, keep the people emotional and focused on something you can control, then feed them what they want so they stand by you and don’t look anywhere else because “why isn’t any of the news networks focusing on this terrible horrible thing They must be the ones who are wrong, they’re the liars.
Mitch Mcconel/MTG/FOX/Whatever-the-flavor-of-the-month is said so and this is proof of it“.
Also I’m of the opinion the laptop might not even exist anymore and even if it does it’s compromised and shouldn’t be legally admissible as evidence, from my understanding several active members of the GOP claim to have had their grubby little hands on it including Matt Gaetz.
Like why and how on earth would Matt Gaetz have legally gotten his hands on it?
Keeping people rabidly outraged about things no one else cares about can also turn people into single-issue voters who are subconsciously willfully ignorant to things that break the version of reality they created due to the us vs them mentality that it creates.
