Hunting isn't exactly taking off so it's safe to say the vast majority of buyers are "defensive".
Which are probably handguns, AR platforms, PCC and shotguns.
AR stands for armalite rifle, not assault rifle.
The AR15 isn't an assault rifle.
The military literally issues the M16 as the standard rifle, which is literally an AR15 with selective fire.
Yea a M4A1 that’s fully automatic is military grade and is an actual assault rifle.
Possible to obtain one with right permits?
Sure it is.
Out of my 20+ hardcore gun owning friends down here in the south none own anything fully automatic.
Zip zero assault rifles.
Bunch of AR-15 platforms?
Oh yea better believe everyone has a few different builds of them but no assault rifles.
When discussing mass shootings and assault style weapons, the poster child is the AR-15.
The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in America.
Why?
It’s no more powerful or effective than any of a dozen other rifles that wouldn’t be considered assault-style.
The answer is: Toxic gun culture.
It’s popular because it looks like the rifle the army uses.
Ban it, make a wish and they all disappear and the effect will be negligible.
The tacti-cool community will simply move on to the next one.
The VA Tech shooter (who held the record for a long time) used two pistols.
You don’t need an AR to easily rack up a big body count.
