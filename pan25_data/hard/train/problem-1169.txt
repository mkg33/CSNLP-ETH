In a Democratic primary, being one of the deciding votes against codifying Roe would essentially be a death sentence.
Much of the "unbreakable 9" in the House that aligned against linking BBB and the infrastructure bill were swept out of Congress.
And the Dem voting base cares a lot less about BBB than they do about abortion rights.
I don't think abortion is really the end goal, it's only a means to get voters.
The end goal is to reduce taxes for the .1%.
On that end, they are pretty successful.
But not a win that actually allows getting stuff done.
It's just another "moral victory".
Which isn't nothing, and yes, it does allow for judges to keep getting nominated, but it still doesn't allow for legislation.
Extremely narrowly.
He almost won even after all that.
He should have lost by a landslide but that just didn't happen.
In order for Congress to even pass legislation protecting first trimester abortion, we'd need to not only elect a democratic house but also at least 52 democratic senators.
48 Dems voted to bypass the filibuster for abortion earlier this year and we got another anti filibuster pro choice Dem elected.
You only need 50 if you have a simple majority of Dems who are also fine bypassing the filibuster.
So only one of those is needed now.
