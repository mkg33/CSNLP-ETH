I tried to find some points to put the power plant firing in context - I figure if I have a question about the news then others might too.
I typed up a couple paragraphs but ended up not posting most of it.
The Wall Street Journal has done a few good English-language reports on what's going on there, but it's still hard to keep even a few basic things straight, such as "who's the lead Ukrainian worker in charge at the actual site of the plant?"
or "how many IAEA inspectors are present?
".
Yep.
Stopping the war now and getting back to Russia with what is left of his army would be the most he can expect to gain.
Not trying to be macabre, but it will be a contest between the elements and bullets for most Russian troops eliminated.
Russians better get in that Goodwill holiday spirit.
As soon as the ground freezes enough, they'll have to do a lot of Goodwill Gesturing, since Ukraine is coming for them.
Stop being pussies and ask for a Ukrainian troops help in dealing with the Russian troops infestation.
The Armed forces of Ukraine have already come close to Kreminna, Literally a few kilometers from the city!
⚡️Rusnya whines that the Armed Forces of Ukraine went on the attack in the Kreminna-Svatove district of Luhansk region.
⚡️ The Ukrainian military has much more chances to develop an offensive this winter than the Russian army.
