Both of those countries are isolated islands, with Japan being relatively small.
Japan also has an ethnically homogenous population (this is not to be construed as something USA should strive for) which completely differs from the racial issues in America.
Which ones have a population near the US's or enacted gun control on a similar number of firearms as what is in circulation in the US?
I think that depends on how you qualify 'works' and again, a lot of those places have other factors that aided them in their success that I think the US doesn't have or couldn't have.
These other countries where it's supposedly so effective, don't have the same inequality and "work culture" we have in America.
They have free healthcare and livable wages.
The gun ban is not the reason for less hostility.
For evil people, as a starting point, I want to limit their access to firearms.
For people who have shown a tendency to do violent things, that means all firearms.
I think the best you can do is temper their potential damage by reducing the chance that theyâ€™ll get firearms that are particularly well suited to killing large amounts of people.
So, to me that means some form of ban on [whatever terms you want to use besides assault rifles, but basically high capacity semi auto rifles].
