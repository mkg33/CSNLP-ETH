If you think halting climate change is tough for humanity to accomplish, well, saving our insects will even be harder.
As the problem is far more complex, with no single cause identified yet.
And, reducing CO2 is relatively easy, but how the heck are we meant to reduce electromagnetic fields if tomorrow some smart scientific proved they're responsible for insects' population collapse?
IMHO, the collapse of the insects' population has little to nothing to do with climate change.
The latter is caused by greenhouse gases, while the former seems to be caused by something, or many things, that is/are toxic to insects.
Theoretically, we can get climate change under control, but still lose our insects.
As lowering our emissions, recapturing and thus reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere significantly can halt climate change or even reverse it.
But will very probably not save the insects.
(Before you NIMBYs complain, wasps in my insect garden are right where they belong.
Quit complaining, they were there last year too and you never noticed!
).
