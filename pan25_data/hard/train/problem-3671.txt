The collapse of the soviet union ended educational programs to train government officials.
Putin has brought potential leaders(that haven't fled) into his clique or they jumped out the window backwards over the last 20 years.
It’s true that Putin himself doesn’t place himself in the tradition of Kremlin leaders, and instead claims Tsarist ambitions.
The paper he wrote in 2020 that spells out his pseudo-historical claims for Ukraine as a part of greater Kyivan Rus’ proved that nonsense.
Removing Putin while the rest of the Kremlin power structure remains in place will do nothing to stop this war, and may actually make it more dangerous.
Our problem is with Putin, sure, but it won’t be solved while nationalist Russian culture shapes the Kremlin the way it is.
We can only hope that one of the moderates like Sobyanin, who is himself no angel, is able to end up in control as opposed to any of the siloviki.
Especially since it’s their policies that got Russia into such a mess and they’re currently losing all credibility.
It's causing problems for Ukraine, but I wouldn't say it's working necessarily - more like pissing them off.
I know if someone cut my grandma's power in the winter I'd be out for revenge.
Every missile strike gives the Ukrainian troops more reasons to fight.
