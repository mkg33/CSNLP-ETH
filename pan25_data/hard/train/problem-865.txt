Reagan said this.
He was a total ass and helped create the homeless crisis by refusing to fund community support for the mentally ill, and created the wealth gap through his fake tax policies.
Not only that but the Christian right gained power with his help.
The guy was essentially a corporate shill (he worked for General Electric for several years).
I expect McCarthy won’t last a year with these idiots calling the shots.
He won’t be able to censure them without them trying to remove him.
He also traded weapons for hostages with Iran, and illegally funded the Contras with drug dealing with the cooperation of the CIA.
The same thing will happen with this crew; the more extreme and annoying they become,the more national elections the GOP will lose.
The current House leadership will be mocked by the GOP senate as an embarrassment, and they’ll ignore everything thing they try and pass unless it’s bipartisan and reasonable.
I can't believe Republicans (people, not the politicians) can look at the clown show going on in the House of Representatives and be proud of what they stand for.
Many Republicans never directly look at the clown show.
Instead, they believe political pundits on Fox and NewMax when they claim that these people are doing an excellent job.
