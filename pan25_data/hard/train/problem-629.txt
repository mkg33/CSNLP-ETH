I always referee to them as the Baltic Sisters.
The Zara systems (Slavic Mythology), Goddesses of the Morning, Day and Dawn.
It doesn't make it any nicer when the first thing someone imagines or calls you when they hear a Slav is Russian and become suspicious at times.
Edit: so, basically because of russia, like all things bad in this part of the world.
Moldova was still a part of the USSR until 1991, and after that it was russia meddling with the union.
It diverged because I mentioned Romania and Moldova's relationship becoming as strong as the Baltics have.
At the very least it's not unlikely Romania and Moldova would become more tied just on the basis on mutual cooperation besides on that EU countries do to one another.. bit like how the Baltics support one another more closely.
Since Moldova’s government is in shambles, it kind of stands to reason that the country should become part of another country—but I’d say it makes a lot more sense for them to join Romania than to be annexed by Russia.
Moldovans are, for all intents and purposes, Romanian.
They speak the same language, they’re culturally pretty much the same… even their flag is practically the same design to reflect this.
And they share a border, whereas Russia would have to basically take the whole Ukrainian coastline to have a border with Moldova.
Although i appreciate Moldova's path, there are a lot of pro-russian people over there.
Morever, a large percentage of the young moldavians studying in the same city continue to speak russian and often blatantly do this.
It s a major sign of disrespect, honestly, especially during this time, especially as people from Moldova are offered quite a lot of benefits here in Romania (while some of us don't have access to the same benefits).
