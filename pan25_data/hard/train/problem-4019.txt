An Article V case is probably going to rarely come across the docket.
So, it would make sense that a judge would not be familiar with that article right off hand.
Rather, if a case did come across the docket, they could familiarize themselves with it and with other case law that might be relevant in making their decision.
They would have time to do this, especially prior to making a decision.
I think the most important thing a judge must have memorized are rules of procedure.
They will use those on the spot in every case.
Other laws and articles can be refreshed in a judge's mind by research or study prior to a particular case.
Typically, both parties (and interested parties) in this type of court court will file briefs which set out their arguments and legal theories and then apply those arguments and theories to the facts of the case itself.
So, the judge would read those arguments and familiarize himself with the laws and theories that would be in question.
For all else being equal, a judge should know the articles.
Maybe we can throw this one back and not give Foghorn Leghorn any undue credit for asking every judge the same questions that shouldn't be stumpers.
