Desperation weeds out scrutiny.
Even if Navalny is problematic (which it seems he is), it still would make more sense to support him replacing Putin and then holding him accountable, than to just dismiss the only viable option for change.
Now explain why Navalny isn't to be preferred to Putin because as I see it that take is nonsense coming from people who know enough about Russian politics to be completely wrong.
Navalny is not a liberal politician, he only frames himself as much as his base of popularity is to be oppositional to Putin.
And just because he is the "best" that Russia has left, since Putin assassinated all the actual opponents to his ideology, does not make Navalny worthy of our support.
And before anyone mentions how that would make him a martyr - Nemtsov was far more popular than Navalny and had a much more consistent vision for Russia without Putinism, but there was nearly no major unrest after his assassination.
The majority of Russians is complicit and doesnâ€™t really care about opposition figures, and those that do care are far and few between and are not at all radical as most of them are young, well-endowed and thus have a lot to lose.
