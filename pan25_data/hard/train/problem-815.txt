Back to the main point, every place has its good areas and bad areas.
Even the good areas have bad places.
I live in USA and haven’t had any issues outside of childhood scraps.
The only time I’ve ever been mugged was in Krakow, Poland on one of my many visits to see family.
My grandfather was mugged several months prior.
They didn’t live in a bad part of town.
I believe men hold other mens’ hands in that part of the world, in a cultural sign of respect.
Not completely sure about Dubai itself, but that part of the world.
I have no problem with Dubai being a great city.
I'm happy that you're thriving!
It's just a bit premature to say "safer compared to most European cities" because for most people that might not be true.
Excuse me for not writing a long drawn out list about which cities in Europe are better or worse and their advantages and disadvantages.
Would you like a list of petty crimes and violent crimes as well?
Do we have crime?
For sure just like any other country but relatively you can live extremely safely.
Yeah I agree, that doesn't mean they aren't safer than in other countries.
I know for a fact that gay people are currently GENERALLY safer in the UAE than in other places where they already have laws put in place.
The government doesn't give a shit what people do as long as it's not in public, and any homophobe that wants to do something to them is too scared of the consequences to actually do anything.
