"Obviously, I love that man,' said Greene of Trump.
"And I have his support 1,000%.
And unfortunately, Nancy Mace doesn't.
I will be very supportive of a primary challenger (to Mace), along with President Trump," Greene added.
"All I can say about Marjorie Taylor Greene is bless her fucking heart," Mace told reporters after that meeting.
(She won her primary and was reelected.
).
Idk.
Peasants usually get rowdy during this kind of thing.
The smarter ones have to know that.
Wtf do they think even the best case scenario would be?
Yeahâ€¦ I feel the exact same way.
ðŸ˜¬ It sure would be cool if that were all enough to make us finally get our shit together and organize.
But I donâ€™t see us doing that either.
I don't get it.
Conservatives always always always fall in line.
The GOP always walks in lock-step.
Talk of there being some civil war within the GOP sounds more like wishful thinking and fantasy.
There isn't a single representative saying the Justice Dept should indict Trump even when they are supposedly distancing themselves.
Not a single one thinks getting Trump out of the way is more important than Hunter Biden's laptop.
They're still bending reality and pushing the narratives the same way they have for the last 6 years.
A couple public statements that aren't entirely flattering and people start thinking there's a fault line forming in the GOP.
That's impossible.
Don't believe it.
Any division will be sorted out very soon and they'll be attacking democracy full-time again like they have been.
