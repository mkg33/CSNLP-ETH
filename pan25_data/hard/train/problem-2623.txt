Like what the fuck does domestic us law have to do with an international European incident?
Talking about morals is one thing, but morals and law are not the same thing, so why use US law of all things to review the ethics of such an incident.
How about you don't make sweeping generalisations about a country you don't seem to know much about.
Sky and sky news are not even remotely interchangeable.
If you can't get basics like that right you shouldn't be offering an opinion on this.
I don’t even think it’s a double standard, just the sort of kneejerk pseudo-morality I’ve come to expect here.
So your problem isn’t that Poland was occupied when it made that “deal” and your problem isn’t really with politics either… it’s just the absence or presence of treaties?
Well Poland never argued against the Potsdam treaty which declared that the big four nations would negotiate for the smaller nations.
Furthermore the USSR handled all the reparations for the eastern nations.
1953 Poland also declared, that they won't demand any new reperations.
Poland didn't argue against those treaties after the fall of the USSR.
So they must have recognised them.
Apart from that they actually received reperations.
