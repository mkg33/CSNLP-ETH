I'm not a socialist, but 1% of the people in America owning 30% of the wealth, or whatever the latest number is, is ridiculous and fucks over the 99%.
What rich people, sorry, I mean job creators, don't understand is that if there's no middle class, nobody can buy your stuff.
Greed is evil.
I believe the paradigm of socialism, or one of them, is wealth distribution.
Saying I'm not a socialist reinforces to me, that the the wealthy are pushing this kind of government tilt and even non-socialists agree it is warranted.
I would argue that we're at a point right now where things are about to break, in part, because we spent decades convincing ourselves that the choice was somehow not between socialism or barbarism.
I think we ought to lean into the fact that it is socialism vs. capitalism and get ourselves knowledgeable, organized, serious, and mobilized.
We are at a point where it's not a matter of socialists vs capitalists and instead one where things are about to break because people clutch onto words with no context.
But really, what's a socialist?
It's a term injected into ignorant and fallacious reasoning.
If only the world were high contrast apples and oranges.
