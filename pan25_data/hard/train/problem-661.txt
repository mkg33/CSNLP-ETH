To be fair, his dad did basically leave him before he was born, knocking up some other dudes wife which was basically rape, and only had him to die for the people that killed him.
Not exactly the best role model.
Plus his dad basically ended the world twice or something.
Oh man, been there done that with the whole Jerusalem burning thing lol.
If im not mistaken the Bible actually says its got one final torching in it before the end times.
As he predicted the destruction of the Temple, Jesus described it as the end of the age.
He absolutely predicted the end of Judaism in the Olivet Discourse, if you care to look.
While the Romans did indeed see it as punishing a Jewish rebellion, their part was to fulfill a prophecy Jesus had made a generation earlier.
The fulfillment of prophecy is a proof of divinity.
Can we trust the gospel accounts written 20 years after Christ’s death?
They were widely disseminated in the ancient world, yet no writer sought to refute the accounts.
The sheer number of fragments assures us that we are reading what the authors wrote.
Given the picture of the Pharisees we find in the gospels, it is similar to what you describe.
Their letter of the law approach allowed them to be confident in their own self righteousness I believe many Christians today are modern Pharisees ironically missing out on what Jesus had to give.
Jesus’s major criticism against the Pharisees (assuming you can trust an account of his life written decades after his death, that is) was that they took a “letter of the law” approach to faith, deliberately following the exact dictates of the faith while ignoring their underlying purpose.
