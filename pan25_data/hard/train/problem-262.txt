He is not wrong about anything.
Secularism modern and legal definition is just separation of state and church.
In theory it should give the people the right to believe in any theological belief or nothing at all without any government interference or privileges given to any group whether they are a minority or a majority of the population.
No, what I'm saying is, in ANY country, imposing your religious traditions on others, no matter which religion it is, whether you're a majority or a minority, is wrong.
Teaching about them is fine.
Forcing people (or "forcefully asking") to partake is not.
What I DO care about is people being forced or coerced to celebrate holidays that they don't want to celebrate.
As someone who doesn’t celebrate Christmas, i disagree with it being forced on anyone.
I didn’t like my office asking me to put up Christmas stuff on my cubicle either.
It has a secular meaning to a lot of people and that’s great, but it is still a holiday that not everyone celebrates, and since it’s associated with a particular religion, parents have the right to decide if their kid should dress as Santa.
If you’re a Christian family, sure, but my point is it’s totally legitimate to celebrate Christmas from a secular/non religious, even atheist stance.
Most of Western Europe is atheist/agnostic but we all celebrate Christmas as a cultural tradition and midwinter festival, more so than to celebrate Jesus.
2) Christmas isn’t even a Christian festival, midwinter festivals have existed in cultures around the world well before Christianity as a way to uplift spirits during the depressing mid winter months.
Christianity asserted that Jesus was born in December as a way to hijack what was already a time of festivities.
