Honestly, if I made one single IRL friend who actually liked talking politics with me, I'd probably delete my account that day.
Alas and alack, I'm surrounded by engineers.
95% of whom are completely apolitical, and the 5% who do care about politics tend to have... interesting beliefs.

Seriously, mass shootings kill thousands of Americans a year, embarras us on the international stage, and fuel political division that makes us more unstable and weaker as a country.
Who benefits from all that?
Russia.
Who's also laundered millions of dollars through the NRA and stuffed it to the gills with spies?
.
Well.
Wrong.

They cannot be THAT fucking stupid, right?
Right?
They're going to wait until May, at least.
Put a 12 year old on a planning board, and he'll figure out that shit in an hour.
