While they were obviously still being targeted, Jews in 1933 Germany still had more social and political influence than LGBT Germans, and there was even the Association of German National Jews (made up of literal Nazi-supporting Jewish people) that was still around for a full 2 years after trans and queer people were being actively targeted.
Even the historical Nazis didn't just "start" with targeting Jews and then move on to everyone else - they kinda started with , which might sound familiar to some.
The documents at the Institute for Sexual Research were part of the original, widespread Nazi book burnings, which happened the same year Hitler actually came to power (1933).
The original Nazis also failed, and it wasn't until years later that Hitler finally took power through legal means.
It's also worth noting that the historical Nazis also attempted a coup, just like our modern day Fascist friends.
Had they ever opened a history book, they would know the Nazi's, just like the Confederates, got their asses handed to them because fascists are INHERENTLY weak.
They lack courage of any caliber.
