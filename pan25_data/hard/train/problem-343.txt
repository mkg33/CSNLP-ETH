Zelenskyy at the G20 Summit: "One cannot trust Russia's words, there will be no Minsks-3, which Russia would violate immediately after signing.
We will not allow Russia to start a new series of terror and global destabilization./We know by name 11 thousand children who were forcibly deported to Russia./Millions of hectares of forest were burned by shelling.
Almost two hundred thousand hectares of our land have unexploded mines and shells./Peace is important for every person.
I am confident that it is likewise for each of you, leaders of G-19.
If Russia opposes our peace formula, you will see that it only wants war.
".
Kuleba: "Russia is hitting peaceful Ukrainian cities with deadly missiles.
Apartment buildings, energy infrastructure facilities are being hit.
Looking forward to a principled reaction of the G20 summit.
And please avoid “calling on both sides”.
Take the side of people, not war criminals.
".
Sec.
Austin assured Błaszczak of the ironclad commitment of the US to defend Poland and the DoD readiness to assist Poland in any investigation of the incident.
The two leaders agreed to coordinate closely together with their NATO Allies on next steps.
So the most likely outcome will be no direct NATO involvement but a big step up of NATO support for Ukraine.
The rhetoric by Biden and others now needs to be backed up by concrete actions without full escalation of the situation.
