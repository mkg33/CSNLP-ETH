In annexing territories, Russia has invested even more in keeping them, because to relinquish them at this point would go from being merely unsuccessful in an invasion to accepting a loss of territory which they've proclaimed as theirs.
As far as Ukraine and the West are concerned, Crimea isn't Russian land, it's Ukrainian land under Russian occupation, just like the other territories Russia "annexed".
Ukraine probably won’t be able to get Crimea, other countries are currently ok with sponsoring Ukraine’s war effort but many won’t be ok with sponsoring them to take back Crimea.
Ukraine can’t fund the war on their own, they’d never be able to take Crimea by force and wouldn’t be able to do it diplomatically either.
The Ukrainian’s have shown their strenh during this war, but they won’t be able to invade anything if they don’t have bullets for their guns and fuel for their vehicles.
Ukraine likely won’t lose anything, they might not get something they want but unless there’s a dramatic shift in the way the wars going it’ll be Russia who has to give up something.
Assuming that Western support for Ukraine doesn't dry up, Ukraine has way more than enough resources to take back all of their territory by force.
Putin can choose now between sending millions to the grinder or not doing so.
