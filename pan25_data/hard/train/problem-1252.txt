Does the Kremlin not understand that making threats is either going to hurt their credibility or it's going to have the opposite effect?
They're basically arriving at the same levels of absurdity as North Korea, threatening to drop a nuke from one day to the next, as if they thought this was the only reason they haven't been invaded until now..
I don't think Russia actually wants to escalate things, because it's not in their best interests, but there are things which can be done without going full on war.
Of course, that's entirely up to Poland, but if it were up to me, I wouldn't let that pass.
If Russia is afraid of escalation, they know exactly what they can do to reduce it, and it is none of the things they've been doing thus far.
What if it were Portugal that Russia was threatening to invade right now?
Would you want to give up a piece of Portugal to end the war?
Would you want other countries to tell you to do so?
The war needs to end, yes, but not by rewarding Russia's aggression or it will happen again, I guarantee.
They want peace, but have been preparing for perfidy by Russia since that is all they have ever gotten from those savages.
Let’s be realistic, Russia could not sustain a war on two fronts…they can barely hold their own against Ukraine….
I honestly think there’s enough long-brewing spite and modern tech that Poland would stand a good chance of defeating Russia by themselves.
Probably not march on Moscow, but relatively quickly repel any invasion attempt.
