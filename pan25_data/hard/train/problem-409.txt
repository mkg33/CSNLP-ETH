Actually, we are considerably less fucked-up than we were under the right wing government.
At least we are not turning into the next Hungary, heh.
Progress?
Dont worry, its only fucked up if you are a disappointed right-winger, letting off steam in a reddit comment section.
Reddit's attitude towards any nation when their politicians say dumb and evil things: "Oh dear, oh dear.
Gorgeous.
".
But than again.
I know redditors from USA and other unaffected countries, that never knew war or suffering, know better...
So I think that if anyone has relevant opinion on this, and can really sympathise with Ukraine, its Croatia.
Something is not right here… this is very opposite of the Croatian people and government’s stance to support European values and EU/ NATO partners.
In addition, we remember what it was like to have our country invaded- homes destroyed, lives lost and land stolen.
Hope we continue to provide help anyway that we can- although we may not be as influential as the larger EU countries such as Germany or Poland….
