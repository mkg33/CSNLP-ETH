They learned what went wrong last time, and have over-built the natural disaster defenses to the point that only an apocalyptic, Noahâ€™s Ark-level tsunami could breach it.
They have back-up generators on-site that can operate for days, if not weeks to keep the coolant pumps running as they fully shut down the reactor, at which point it will not produce enough heat to require constant cooling.
If shutting off the power was all that was needed for a nuclear meltdown, the nuclear plant in Zaporizhizhia would have exploded several months ago.
Yet, despite being under Russian occupation and having external power cut numerous times - and even having the plant shelled by Russian artillery a few times - the workers there have prevented any disaster from occurring.
If months of sporadic power cuts and raining explosive artillery shells and rockets havenâ€™t caused a meltdown there, Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s a testament to how rugged and reliable a modern nuclear plant is, being able to safely operate even in the middle of an active war zone and invasion.
One sabotage can take down electricity in an entire country, and a cheap but calculated attack can cause a nuclear disaster equal to a nuclear attack without the expenditure or know how of nuclear weapons.
Do you know how small EU countries are?
How close to enemy states they are?
A nuclear facility is like a bullseye ðŸŽ¯.
