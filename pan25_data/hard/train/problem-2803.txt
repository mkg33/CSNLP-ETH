I would end up having to quit my job because i would never out a minor.
I grew up in a Mormon family that was very transphopic and anti gay i saw first hand how cruel and mean families can be.
Thatâ€™d probably just mean that the entire set of homophobic parents willing to abuse their kid on the inkling of gay allegations would start in as opposed to one or two.
They're basically saying that teachers have to report a kid even if a parent could be hostile and perhaps hurt a kid for coming out as LGBTQIA+ (which most certainly happen).
One democrat points out how outing every LGBT kid to their parents absolutely will lead to some kids being abused.
The author of this bill's response?
"Johnny said he was trans?
I thought he was talking about trains, that he was just really into locomotives.
I told him to go to the library and check out Terry Pratchett's Raising Steam, and that if he liked it that author had some very good books featuring dwarves if he was thinking about joining the police, and another about a regiment of soldiers if he was thinking of enlisting.
".
Yes.
I won't be surprised when they propose revoking the matthew Shepard/James Byrd act, because Republicans have made it clear how much they want LGBTQIA+ people in the morgue.
This unfortunately won't stop because Republicans want to kill LGBTQIA+ kids.
They delight in it.
Republicans would rather have a dead kid than a queer kid.
