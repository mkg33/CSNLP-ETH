Exactly.
Shoot it down, stuff the pieces in Mr. Blinken's luggage.
When he arrives, he can say, "hi, I'm returning something I found that belongs to you.
You're welcome.
".
Now look at what they said.
"Force Majeure caused supposed weather balloon to go off-course.
Not intended to violate sovereignty.
Please keep a leveled head.
".
So...
It's a balloon.
No propulsion system to put it in any specific spot.
Which means it's probably not just recording data to be retrieved later.
It's most likely transmitting it as it cruises around the jet streams until it eventually comes down.
So, odds are strong that the military is just letting it do its thing while recording the feed to decrypt it.
It's also possible that they're analyzing it for what equipment is on board.
But really, what an absolutely pathetic device.
Our civilian companies have mapped the entire earth by satellite.
Our military decommissioned the SR71 in the late 80s, not because it was outdated, but because satellites were doing the job just fine.
Which, even then, the BlackBird was put into service in 1964.
So, that tech is almost 60 years old.
But China couldn't get a plane over us, or a satellite over us?
Had to use balloon technology?
