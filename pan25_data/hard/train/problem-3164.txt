I guarantee he would.
He has never consequences for anything in his entire life.
Why would he think he might face consequences for something as minor as perjury now?
This is an attempt to show regret for his actions to get a softer punishment.
If the jury believes he regretted what he did and was sorry they MIGHT either leave the amount owed at what it is or lessen it.
Lawyers will be like: "my client said he was sorry and he means it, how about $20 and a handshake and we call it all good".
But in a "oh shit I just lost $20 bucks" kinda way, not in a "I feel sincere remorse in my soul" kinda way.
He may be wishing it now that it's about to cost Fox a few billion dollars in restitution for flagrantly defaming the voting machine companies.
When Paul Ryan (who is on the board of Fox) chipped in with his concern that all the lying might cause financial damage to Fox, that was quite revealing.
That is, it revealed that even the "normal" Republicans like Ryan don't give a fuck about democracy, they care about $$$.
Ryan never made any public statement that the election was fair and Biden was the legitimate winner.
He had no concern for how the Big Lie was destroying America, only that it might affect Fox's financials in a negative way.
If Ryan is a good man then his failing to inform the public about the lies would constitute the "do nothing" which helps evil triumph.
Sure, Ryan has to do his job as a board member and protect Fox's $$$.
Failing to do that job could expose Ryan to a lawsuit.
