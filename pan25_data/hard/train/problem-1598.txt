Try to talk with them.
I, as a ukrainian who communicated with many russians, understood from the beginning of the war what the majority of them are like.
I'm sorry, but this is just mind-blowingly funny.
I will repeat what I wrote - talk to them.
If you can't, do you want me to talk in front of you and translate?
There is such an application - Discord and I communicate with people in it, I used to sit on 5-6 russian servers playing games, discussing hobbies and just talking.
I have a lot of experience in understanding how many russians support the war, as do most ukrainians.
So excuse me, but talking to me about the majority of reasonable russians is an absurdly ridiculous attempt.
Aren’t there plenty of “normal citizens” being atrocious humans while fighting for Russia in Ukraine though?
They might be forced to be there, they might only be trying to survive, but does that include rape and torture?
I honestly don’t know, but considering Russia’s record of domestic violence and acceptance of everyday crime, I don’t think they are forced to be disgusting humans.
I like giving people the benefit of doubt but at some point this is just who they are, this is just the culture they were raised in.
Same as anywhere, not everyone subscribes to it, but so so many do.
They respect power and dominance, and enjoy flexing it on whatever they can.
The guys that fled the country didn’t do it out of protest, or in solidarity with Ukraine.
They did it to avoid being a conscript.
