India derives its weapon tech from multiple countries so as to not get too dependent on any single one.
The only reason India got so dependent on military grounds to Russia, is because the US practically forced it into its arms with its with us or against us rhetoric when it clearly just wanted to remain neutral during the cold war.
Regarding the Russian military imports- that is a failure of historical US diplomacy which pushed india into Russian hands since the cold war.
India cannot just stop buying Russian weaponry now when 70% of its army uses it.
And let me remind you that India IS and HAS BEEN DIVERSIFYING away from Russian armament- not because of any ill-placed moral policing by Western armchair redditors- but because , again, doing so is better for its diversification .
Man, you just commented above on someone who explained India has diversified its weapon purchase, and how they buy weapons from France, and you shitting about india with a zero-knowledge about India's weapon purchase, and the post doesn't involve Russia also, no wonder why Russia is living rent free in your mind, by the way, there are two competitors for the tender another one is the USA who is pitching FA 18, and also pitching for the predator drones, aren't you got triggered and wrote lenh passage on that guy comment.
so it makes you more of an armchair diplomat, and for your knowledge, France supplies India weapons since the 90s, it's been the major weapon supplier for India for decades, and it provides TOT, India is one of the users of French aircraft, unlike other countries India has a big airforce, and therefore India will buy more aircraft, as of only three countries produces 5gen aircraft, USA, China, Russia, USA isn't ready for sell 5gen to India, China is an adversary, India had invested billions on Russia 5th gen aircraft but the project failed, and India pulled out, Russia went ahead with another project and built Su 57, India isn't interested in purchasing Russian aircraft after su 30, and French rafale is developing it's 5 the gen aircraft and india needs 200 aircraft, which France is competing for the bid.
