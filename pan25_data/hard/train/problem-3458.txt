You die from the same oxygen deprivation to the brain either way.
The broken neck keeps your from twitching around, but ask anyone who has broken their neck if its painless.
Not defending their horrible practice, but the drop method doesn't kill people any faster it's just easier to watch because they don't move around while they die.
I could be wrong, but I had the impression that when someone has their neck broken from a drop hanging, breaking the neck kills the persons immediately too, most of the time, which is why it’s the preferred method.
But even if it takes like 10 seconds for the person to black out, that’s still 10 seconds of agony that could be avoided.
It’s still torture for the sake of torture.
And Iran doesn’t use the drop method.
They lift the prisoner and strangle them until they’re dead, often using mobile cranes to hoist them up and guaranteeing a longer and more painful death.
So they probably were used as a very public display, to execute people in front of their fellow inmates.
If the punishment for protesting is the same as murdering the heads of state, you know what comes next from the protestors.
You’ve added fuel to a fire that will in fact burn you.
Not very smart to fuel a revolution.
