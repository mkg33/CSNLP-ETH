I think you have to really broaden the definition of lie to make this a true statement.
For example, a common example of a "lie" that Obama told was the statement "If you like your doctor, you can keep them".
Obama didn't mean you can keep a quack and with normal people this would go without saying.
Let's take someone like Senator Tammy Baldwin as an example.
She doesn't lie.
She may make a mistake from time to time, but it is not in her personality to lie.
Same with AOC.
In both cases if it turns out they make a statement that is shown to be not true, they will apologize and correct themselves.
So no, all politicians do not lie.
This does not mean that a lot don't lie often.
Some of them lie all the time.
People can be wrong and it not be a lie.
They can answer a question, recieve new information, change their answer and it still not be a lie.
Lying is not when someone says something you don't like or disagree with, no matter how hard you shout it.
Well, plus many of those accusing him of lying have a habit of calling anything they disagree with a lie.
If they don't want it to be true, then it must be false.
