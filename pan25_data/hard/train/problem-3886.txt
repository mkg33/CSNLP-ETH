The only real argument to be presented for not returning or loaning out historically significant pieces of a nation’s culture is that it’s too fragile to be moved.

If that's not a concern, go wild.
People don't want former colonies to be given ownership of their heritage so that no one else can see it, they want these items returned because it belongs to them.
If they decide to loan their history out, good for them, if not, whatever.
Do what many Latin American, African, and Asian citizens had to do to see a piece of their own history: travel.
Take for example: the many museums of Caracas, a city I visited before Venezuela went into its current crisis.
It's a magnificent city with rich cultural heritage on display at its museums, which are fantastic.
Due to the crisis there, however, many are closed for extended periods of time or don't have the funds to maintain what they house.
Would the UK or the US be justified in looting what those museums have just to preserve certain pieces?
Why wouldn't they be loaned out like other artifacts are loaned out to museums everywhere?
A cultural artifact can live in its rightful place of origin so that its citizens can enjoy it without having to pay thousands to travel abroad and be occasionally loaned out so others can see it, as well.
If the country of origin would like Britain to hold on and care for certain artifacts, Britain should accept them, but only with the permission of the country of origin.
I generally support the idea of returning Artifacts to their original homeland.. but if there's one major reason I support the British holding onto them.. its because of stability.
Look at Egypt.
Their revolution a decade ago had looters destroy a lot and steal from the museum.
Same in Syria and Iraq when ISIS came to destroy anything that wasn't Islamic.
