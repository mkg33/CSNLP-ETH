We aren’t going to because that means war with Russia, and what it likely would do is seem to justify the regime to its people.
Should one do the same things that we criticize Russia of doing?
Show the Russians we aren’t actually any better and that it’s regime was right about what we are ready and willing to do?
Attacking civilian targets didn’t work in WW2 outside of wiping two cities off the face of the earth, I don’t see why it would work now.
Especially since the Russian people aren’t really safe and secure.
Their economy is in shambles, they are being conscripted, a percentage of their population is fleeing the country, and they are taking worse casualties than all recent wars in the US combined.
Anyway, the civilians are hurting with what we’ve done to their economy, conscription, and how many lives are being lost in the fighting.
Bombing civilians to demoralize them is stupid and does the opposite of the intended effect.
Just look how well that strategy is working out for Russia.
Russia is running out of guided missiles.
That's why they're re-purposing Kh-22 anti-ship missiles and S-300 anti-aircraft missiles against ground targets.
