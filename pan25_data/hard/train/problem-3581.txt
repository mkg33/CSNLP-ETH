No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.
But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.”.
It would be funny if it had said something like “nazis are bad and will always be bad.
We won’t flip flip on this one”.
But seriously, sucks that Spanish people still tend to be religious which fosters toxic masculinity and a people-deserve-their-situation mentality.
Isn’t it interesting that the people closest to those in power making laws vote heavily for one party.
Also the reason Repubs will pretend they want to (to get the votes) but will actually block it if they can.
Enfranchising voters that might turn on them has never been their thing.
What they need to do is bait and switch the Republicans.
Vote a Republican into office one time and then they will think they will be a benefit to them.
Then in the next election just destroy them.
You'll not find a more vile useless group of politicians than is the current GOP.
They'd vote against universal prosperity and world peace if the bill D written.
