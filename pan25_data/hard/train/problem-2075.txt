You are correct in principle.
However, there are many unanswered questions about his taxes because they haven't not been audited in detail.
Obama and Biden have been audited (and released their returns) but for some reason the IRS didn't have the staff to even start on DJT until 2019 (coincidentally the same day the House committee asked about it) and even then didn't assign enough staff to check any of the 500 entities (mostly companies) that flow into his personal income taxes.
So that right there is cause for concern: either the IRS was improperly giving one president a pass, or else they are chronically understaffed and can't really check to see if complicated tax returns are honest (maybe both could be true).
It's the lifelong pattern that I would guess prompted concern when Trump wouldn't voluntarily release his taxes like every other recent candidate.
He's been implicated in all kinds of financial mis-dealings over the years, why would you assume his taxes would be different?
He's had too much time to figure something out to mitigate the bullshit and lets face it - he's done way worse than scam on his taxes and ain't shit been done about that.
We can all look at the top line numbers and say he's a tax cheat, because we know those numbers are unacceptable and wrong for society.
But I what I want to hear is whether our corrupt tax code really does permit the wealthy to do this, or whether there's been impropriety.
Yeah let's see, I just hope it the tax returns reveal crimes, there is still a pathway for the DOJ to freaking charge him for it, unlike the corrupt approach they took with Trump org.
that proved he committed crimes, yet only Weaselberg got charged.
