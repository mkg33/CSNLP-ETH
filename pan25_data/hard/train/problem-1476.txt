That's understating it.
The budget for Russia's air force is larger than that for the _entirety_ of the Ukranian military, as in all branches, combined.
And they were supposed to have a 5:1 air advantage.
There's a reason why people where completely flabbergasted at them being unable to achieve air superiority with that overmatch.
[1] Sure there's been training and modernization since 2014, but that's mostly been training vs any actual equipment and definitely no jets.
As mentioned before, the weapons really only came in weeks after the Feb invasion since everyone was expecting said air force and conventional mismatch to flatten everything and it'd be a guerilla resistance.
Also the West has specifically _not_ been providing any jets, and mostly land stuff the air force should be able to blowup, since that's the point of an air force.
yes, neither side is capable of gaining air superiority, and so far air power has had pretty low impact to the war overall.
They might as well fly ww2 planes and carpet bomb it would be far more effective then leaving your pilots open to SAMS.
Poor training likely, and s300s are effective regardless as well as whatever manpads ukraine was operating but my understanding was they held the skies for awhile before ukraine was funneled enough resources to strike them down.
A few months at least.
