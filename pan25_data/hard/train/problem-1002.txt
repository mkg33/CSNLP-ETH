Is it mandatory to have a cocaine addiction or something to work in the Kremlin, cuz the logic in celebrating Victor's return is just not there.
An arms dealer who is in no small part partially responsible for the critical lack of military hardware and ammunition that's killing Russian servicemen at an alarming rate and they applaud his safe return?
Not just a war criminal that supports the Russian regime, a war criminal that supports the Russian regime that has a network of black market contacts, warlords, and mercenaries from his days running guns, conveniently freed just as it turns out Russia is short on soldiers and weapons.
What could go wrong?
?
Am I missing the part where he’s not allowed to use a phone, or the internet, or the Russian mail service, or a fax machine, etc, that easily allow him to reenter this world of arms dealing?
Are we really being so naive as to think Putie doesn’t have shitbird friends with scummy connections?
?
Really, how so?
A washed up criminal behind bars for 14 years is suddenly going to jump right back into his old life.
Doubtful.
More likely he will take any money he has left and live out of the spotlight.
