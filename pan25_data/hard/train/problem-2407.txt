Negotiate what?
There's no negotiating here.
Debt ceiling needs to be raised for debts ALREADY INCURRED.
which has nothing to do with the debt ceiling.
its a shitty old timey thing introduced in a precarious time but they are using it to hold the usa hostage.
it needs to be gotten rid of.
>No.
Not really.
I think it's due to right leaning being more independent in general.
Conservatives are typically rural and more independent, self reliant, "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" personalities while liberals tend to be more societal, government controlled, pack/herd, mentality.
So they want, and in some cases need, to know what they should be doing or thinking based on the general "norms" around them and get that info from media sources.
Conservatives tend to not want to do what everyone else is doing or doing their own thing for their family and no one else so they typically ignore outside influences.
its funny looking at the comments in all the conservative safe spaces regarding the debt ceiling and .. they dont seem to really understand it.
like any of the basics.
they dont seem to know exactly what it is, what the history of it is, what it actually does, etc.
yeah, they believe in whatever gets them a 'win' in the moment.
they dont believe in anything, just that they come out on top.
zero sum world view and all that.
