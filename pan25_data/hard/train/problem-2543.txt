I wish it was a trillion and the money we invest into renewables sure as hell is a better investment than flushing it down the nuclear toilet.
Not to mention that the costs of nuclear do not even include the giant costs that are yet to come when all the reactors have to be build back and the waste has to be cared for literally thousands of years.
The EPR project in France.
15+y in the making, still not operating.
The budget has exploded 3 times the original budget.
The price per kWh will be between 2-3 times more of new solar PV.
Not included of course are the insane costs of building the plants back and taking care of the nuclear waste for thousands of years.
Nevermind that there literally is no business case for nuclear energy cause it is so freaking cost inefficient that the only way to make a profit with it is to make taxpayers pay for all the costs and externalities for you "bUt iT iS tHe cHeApEsT enErgY eVEr".
Another person who has bought into the propaganda that nuclear energy isnâ€™t the cleanest, safest and cheapest energy source.
This is more a demonstration that alternatives to fossil fuel is necessary right now with more clean energy, including nuclear.
