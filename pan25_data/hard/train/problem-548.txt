American doctors decided to perform horrific medical experimentation and which group was chosen: the Irish, Italians, Jews, Polish?
Black communities expect systematic abuse and vaccine reluctance is one of the many cultural reactions to being the most, historically, expendable and abused group of citizens in the US.
Vaccination hesitancy in the black American community is very complex.
This dude writes a good article about it:
““It’s not just mistrust of the medical system, it’s mistrust of institutions,” Bennett said, “There’s a lot of reasons for [Black people] to mistrust institutions.” The murder of George Floyd stands as one poignant contemporary example, but “Tuskegee [still] looms large in the minds of Black Americans.” The Tuskegee experiment exploited 600 Black men working as sharecroppers who had syphilis by knowingly withholding treatment and simply seeing what happened to their bodies as a result of the disease for over 40 years”.
It’s not unrelated though, it goes to an entire community’s mistrust of government agencies because of such interactions across recent and longer term history.
