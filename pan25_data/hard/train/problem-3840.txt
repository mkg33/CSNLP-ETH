Is this typical for such matters to be explicitly stated?
I was under the assumption that the wiping of Kim and his palace of shit off the face of the earth was always implied if NK was ever to use nukesâ€¦.
Even though NK nukes wouldn't land, I would hope that we still wouldn't nuke them in response but instead dump a bunch of conventional weapons on them until their current leadership is dead.
I don't think it would be mutually assured destruction, more like a 1-sided beating, unfortunately, US still has to worry about it's allies and if NK do have nukes, they would probably target SK anyway.
I'm pretty sure if anyone uses an actual nuke, not tactical, on the US or an ally they are going to feel the full force of the US military like noone has felt since Germany/Japan in 1945, if they aren't wiped out immediately.
I highly doubt many countries can shoot down too many US nukes, but I'm pretty sure the US would be rather effective at taking theirs out.
It's suicide for a country to contemplate it.
Even Putin ain't that dumb.
