People are vastly overestimating Ron DeSantis’ appeal outside Florida.
There’s office furniture with more charisma.
He has none of Trump’s charisma or fake populist rhetoric that the right and even some right leaning independents found appealing.
Probably only a third of Republicans will only go for Trump, and many of those aren’t actual Republicans.
Instead I think the important comparison is between people who will only vote for Trump vs. the portion who will never support him.
After years of seeing them feed and exploit divisions among Democrats it would be very satisfying to see them struggle with the same frustrations.
Unable to prevail in an election he would be both happy and proud to damage allies he considered insufficiently loyal.
If that ratio is in the right range it will make it far less likely that Trump, DeSantis, or anyone else can get the Rs back in the win column.
I think Donald would be less inclined to measure his impact by how badly the party performed in his absence than by how many election cycles it took for Republicans to once again become competitive or viable.
