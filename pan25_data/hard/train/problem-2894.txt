Alright, so they do believe it or end up believing it?
Then the commenter above is wrong and we should stop pretending these videos have no impact because they obviously do.
If they don't believe what the media tells them why do RT and similar "media outlets" keep putting this sort of stuff out?
And for whom if not for Russians?
The only Russian patriots are the ones who have been protesting.
Nothing but respect for Navalny, Litvinenko, Politkovskaya, Estemirova, Pussy Riot, and others, who have been protesting him for years and suffered greatly for their efforts (3 of them are dead).
These are great Russians!
Putin has a very high approval rating and has, his entire career as President and Prime Minister.
It's been above 75% more than it's been under 75%.
And I don't think it's ever dipped below 50%.
He's always been quite popular because of his image of being strong and, at least until recently, doing a fairly good job at giving the people (mainly Russians, I suspect) enough money to make them not feel poor.
