I can see Putin use that to try and create a rift between the US and their allies.
"Look their president traded a basketball player for a war criminal who is now helping us in our war with Ukraine.
".
"Truce?
What do you mean truce?
The guns are already on their way!
Peace talks... Alright forget it, I'll re-route the shipment to the Balkans.
When they say they're gonna have a war, they keep their word.
".
Yeah.
Everyone crying WHAT ABOUT OUR MARINE VETERAN clearly hasn't looked into it.
The fact that the US has been trying to free him since Biden got into office is kind of impressive, imo.
Like he's an american citizen, full stop so deserves freedom but also he's an american dipshit .
When he was picked up the CIA flat out said they would not use a spy without giving them the cover of diplomatic immunity..like the way he was caught seems pretty dumb for an actual spy.
From what I've read it sounds like he was cosplaying for karma and forgot that FSB doesn't take "lol jk" as a valid defense.
Or it could be that his charges were trumped up and the state department can use that as leverage to try and get him out.
