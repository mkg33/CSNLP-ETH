Typically, the police use tear gas to scatter riots when they use it correctly.
This isn't usually followed by a large enemy force firing at those incapacitated by the tear gas.
Chances are the enemy won't be saying "hey we're only using tear gas" and even if that were the case, there would be very little reason to believe the enemy when they already engage in perfidy.
It can easily just escalate into the next Russian field hospital getting slammed with a makeshift chlorine gas barrel bomb in retaliation.
The problem is that when Russia starts gassing enemy soldiers, it's not immediately obvious what gas they're using.
Chemical escalation was a big problem in WW I -- "they threw gas at us... quick, send the worst gas we have back at them!
".
E.g.
hollow point rounds, CS gas, deceptive uniforms/disguises, capturing people without paying them, putting pictures of captured people on TV, etc.
When Ford ratified the Geneva Convention in 1974, the United States established implementation policy that prohibits use of CS gas in warfare except in very narrow circumstances (to control prisoners of war; to prevent civilian casualties in riots, and in rescue missions).
I think he was just augmenting your point and inadvertently used the same word: that confusion about what chemical is used has already resulted in a disproportionate response in the past.
Therefore, a precedent of using CS in this war risks escalation (as we already know from that long ago precedent).
