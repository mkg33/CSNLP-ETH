I do think it needs to be pointed out that this also means certain defeat for Russia here, and that this was in some respects determined on the day they invaded - they do not now and have never had the necessary numbers to conquer Ukraine.
It's just that their massive size is letting them drag out the torment.
that's the thing though, they just flat out do not have the numbers.
Ukraine is a massive country of 43 million people that they attempted to invade with a force of 190,000.
Most western intelligence, including Ukraine itself, dismissed the idea of them invading because you can't take a country of 43 million with an army of 190,000.
They're attempting to plug the hole with waves of increasingly ill equipped conscripts but the numbers have never been enough.
even in the scenario where Ukraine received 0 help from anyone they'd be on the losing end of a bloody guerilla war.
none of this would be without massive losses from Ukraine but it's simply numerically unwinnable for Russia.
We can't get those people back and the side effect of this awful war is that even in losing, Russia is doing deep rooted and long-term damage to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.
Damage that will take generations to undo.
