In the video circulating you can see the Russian troops surrendering and then the last Russian soldier starts shooting injuring the cameraman, pretending to surrender and then attacking the other party is a war crime and makes those other soldiers an active threat, not POWs.
Is this the video where one of the "surrendering" Russians was hiding and ambushes the Ukrainians, killing one of them before the Ukrainians shoot back?
My first thought when I watched the video was the same - It initially appears the Ukrainians summarily executed the Russians because their friend came out guns blazing.
Remember the video of Russians torturing a bound Ukrainian soldier, then proceeded to castrate him?
Were they summarily executed with their hands behind their heads in grizzly fashion by an enraged UA solider heartbroken to lose his buddy to a Russian war criminal?
Highly illegal, completely amoral, and an undeniable war crime.
Also heartbreaking still though.
I'm pretty confident there's quite a few laws being broken by that Russian, Perfidy not the least of them.
