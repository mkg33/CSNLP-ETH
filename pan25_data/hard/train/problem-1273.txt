"For viewers who frequently travel or own a second home, Netflix says the account holder will have to sign in on their Netflix mobile app at least once a month while connected to the Wi-Fi at their primary location.
".
Yep.
I can see why the suits want this feature, but there's no way to implement it that doesn't inconvenience families with kids in college - one of the main legitimate use cases - or which doesn't introduce hilarious loopholes, like how you should theoretically be able to share an account with other people in your dorm.
Honestly, though.
If they just made it something like one location per screen, I feel like there'd be a lot less of a pushback.
Because currently, they're making weird assumptions like 4 people all watching it at the same time in the same house.
You mean like college students?
They're probably one of the main demographics of legitimate sharing, but Netflix only lets that happen if they can go home at least once a month.
Okay, more explanation: There is no reasonable definition of "household" from a technological standpoint that doesn't open up all sorts of weird technicalities.
The closest you get is an IP address, but I can already think of two major flaws in that.
1) If you're on public wifi, it'll also see that as a single house, and 2) if you have to cycle power to your router, you'll likely get a new IP address, so Netflix will think you moved.
But even if you could come up with a reasonable technological definition of a household, I still feel like watching on multiple screens is less likely than you'd think.
To me, at least, that always felt like a feature to allow for college students and similar, so you don't have to coordinate watching times at multiple locations.
(Think "Get off the phone, I need to use the internet") There are still some use cases for multiple screens, like if someone wants to watch on their commute, but they're a lot less common.
