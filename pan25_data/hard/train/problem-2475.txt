This isn't court.
Its a collection of elected people from all walks of life, ideally.
That was one of the main points, suit jackets are expensive, and uncomfortable for pregnant women.
The cardigan was a good compromise, but it took them a while to get there, and raises good questions why either sex needs expensive suits.
A cardigan is a sweater.
It actually makes sort of less sense imo.
You can have formal sweaters and informal cardigans.
Regardless, the rules were written for men, if the guys want to get rid of the suit requirement they should.
Either remove the dress code or have one that requires equal formality for both men and women.
Those are two perfectly fair options.
But thatâ€™s not what Democrats are arguing for.
They should, but for some reason they seem to think dress codes for men are fine but a female equivalent (even with considerably more flexibility) is a massive sexist imposition designed to oppress and control women.
Yeah people supporting it saying "they're just making it more equal", ignoring they can easily do that by loosening the rules on the mens dress code rather than making it stricter for women.
Guys don't need a jacket or tie to still look/act professional either.
