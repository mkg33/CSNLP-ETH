Yeah it’s not like the symbol stopped being used after the end of WW2, if anything it’s meaning has coalesced even more from the national symbol of Germany to THE preeminent symbol of neonazi antisemitism and racism in the world.
Oh man I posted a picture of a swastika themed molding in a building by Nazi POWs that’s still being used in Germany to this day and the amount of comments I got saying that there was nothing wrong with the carvings because lots of cultures have Swastikas and they preempted Nazis by thousands of years.
And I was like yah sure in other contexts you can say it’s fine but absolutely not in this context.
In this context it only means one thing and its support for the third reich and its extermination of minorities.
Like even if you want the image of the swastika to be rejuvenated, that doesn’t mean every single swastika ever made is now totally chill.
Yes and no.
If we don’t remember what Hitler did then we are doomed to do it again.
Just look how people today who didn’t live through it are already repeating the same mistakes.
