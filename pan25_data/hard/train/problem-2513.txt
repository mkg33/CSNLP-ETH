Considering they spend most of 2022 importing VERY little and still able to export a lot as people worked to end reliance on them, the outlook is absolutely disastrous for them.
It will constrain their ability to import things en masse (especially sanctioned items that are already way more expensive to acquire on the black market), but their domestic economy is very salvageable at least.
People in wartime tend to just accept having to live without as many modern comforts.
They're going to keep using western machine tools, that's a given.
They have a lot of those already.
It will be interesting if they can keep these working properly without any western support/servicing (although I don't even know if this is sanctioned yet).
Simply put they won't be able to produce as many state of the art cruise and ballistic missiles as they'd like to, but dumb artillery shells and the like are easy enough to produce that it can be done using mostly domestic parts and scaled up to meet wartime demands.
They can try to transfer into a war economy all they like but if they don’t have the basics needed to produce modern weapons systems and keep their infrastructure running they’re screwed.
