Twitter is incorporated still even while being private.
He leveraged something as collateral against the loan and likely leveraged there company itself as part of it.
Just like if you go but a car on a loan you’re leveraging the car on that loan and if you don’t pay they take the car to sell and recoup the costs.
They can’t however go after your other assets because they were never part of said loan.
This is literally what walking away from your home is too.
You just walk away from the loan, stop paying, they take your house and foreclose on it, you take a credit hit, and that’s it.
Because the house was the collateral for the loan.
Even if that car and house lost 90% of their value the bank can’t just come take the difference from you.
The person I commented on said that Twitter cannot go bankrupt until he runs out of money because he is personally liable for any and all expenses and costs.
My entire comment was that he can only be liable for what he leveraged in the deal, they cannnot go after his personal finances or assets if he decides to walk away or file bankruptcy as the company, which is filing bankruptcy there’s no guarantee they get all of the leveraged assets depending in the title of bankruptcy filed which is also something the comment I replied to said he cannot file for anymore to protect assets.
It absolutely can.
Private companies can still file for bankruptcy without him personally doing so.
He would end up forfeiting most if not all assets he leveraged to purchase Twitter but they don’t have free reign to go after all of his money and assets.
But to put it succinctly, he can't loose more than the total value of his stake in the now non-public Twitter corporation unless he decides to pump more money.
It's more so that you can't hide your profits with buying licenses from your daughter / parent / sister company, throw it all back into new projects or buy back stock and act like you don't have money.
