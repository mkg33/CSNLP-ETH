Edit: while the official cause of death hasn’t been released, I think it’s fair to say these deaths weren’t a coincidence or a result of pre-existing conditions….. cmon.
Lol you’re so annoying.
I would have said the same thing if it happened next door.
3 young people dying in a hotel room in a foreign country at the same time is suspicious genius….
It (most likely) wasn’t natural causes therefore some other unknown force was at play.
That is by definition suspicious.
The issue is the misuse of the word suspicious.
That creates issues in society.
There's nothing annoying about being able to articulate yourself properly.
You don't understand the definition of suspicious and you also don't mind the residual effect such a misleading comment makes.
That makes you ignorant.
Edit: For the ignorant down voters.
These people died of carbon monoxide poisoning with absolutely nothing to say otherwise.
There's nothing suspicious about that, it's unfortunate.
This article is useless, but there are significantly more detailed articles available.
