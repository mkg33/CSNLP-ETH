As Turkish people we need to face this embarrassing reality that our people intentionally elect a man of this caliber for 20 years.
Spot on.
They hate the other half of the pie so much that they don't give a shit.
They also see themselves in him.
They think they'd do the same things if they were in his place.
So none of these scandals bother them.
His votes didn't change a bit when the 17/25 December tapes were leaked and his massive corruption became clear as day.
Turkish people that vote for him are just as bad.
They know very well what they are doing.
That scene with the kids was an obvious PR attempt but this time I don't believe it.
Some people actually are like that, unfortunately.
If it was a PR attempt Erdogan would say something that makes sense.
He was literally caught off guard and looked out of it there and mumbled some nonsense like "I hope we can recover from this.
We'll do whatever we can but I don't know.
".
It is, that's why they did it.
People don't just build shitty buildings because it's more fun or something.
It's quicker, cheaper and easier to build a building when you don't have to deal with permits and codes.
I wonder if it's cheaper to construct buildings that aren't up to code and then just pay a bribe, cost of doing business fine, rather than do it right the first time.
