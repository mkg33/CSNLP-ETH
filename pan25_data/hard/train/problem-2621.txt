Counter example: I had a friend whose family is mostly indigenous Mexican, and he is a literal white supremacist, except, he thinks the other white supremacists count him as white.
From what I gather after speaking to a few more of my latino friends, this sort of 'but we're the ok ones' thinking is shockingly common among US right wing latinos.
Most people in Mexico are mixed Native American and Spanish and so as Americans we just say Hispanic when we mean someone who looks like George Lopez.
But there are Spanish people in Mexico whose ancestors never mixed and they are white.
It's because Latino and Hispanic are two different things that for some reason get lumped in together.
Latino is someone from Latin America while Hispanic is just anyone whose native language is Spanish.
So there are latinos who aren't hispanic and there are hispanics who aren't latinos.
I’m surprised the person you responded to didn’t come over the top and say not all Hispanics are Mexican yet.
That person asked an innocent question idk why y’all are dunking on it like ignorance about this stuff isn’t abound (like using Hispanic and Mexican as synonyms lol).
But thanks for pointing that out, solid solid virtue to signal, I’m sure you’ve caught yourself a real racist.
Prefacing their question with ‘sorry if this is dumb’.
You caught a prime bigot I’ll bet.
