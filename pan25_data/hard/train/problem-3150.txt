I would have loved to see entire teams boycott.
Especially right before the tournament so backfilling would be difficult.
But that would only happen if a group of high ranked teams decided to do it together.
And even then, fifa would sanction them, preventing players of the future from playing in world cups hosted in non-oppressive countries.
Shitty situation.
Just tear down fifa already.
My understanding is all the tv deals are already paid, viewership numbers matter to the networks and advertisers, not fifa or Qatar.
The media outrage is good, fifa did this by being a corrupt shitty organization.
The more spotlight there is on fifas corruption, the better.
I want them abolished and a new footballing governing body formed.
Dunno how we’ll keep the new one from being corrupt, but fifa sure as hell isn’t going to change or fix itself.
And then fifa, who want money ultimately, wont go to a shitty country again because people will boycott it.
I genuinely don't think FIFA will do something this stupid again tbh, regardless of whether we watch the world cup or not.
Might be naive thinking but I think they hear the backlash pretty well.
