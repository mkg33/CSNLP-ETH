They are trying to retroactively address their manpower issues but it's inherently easier for Ukraine to mobilize large numbers because of less logistical challenges due to defending their own territory, western training support, and the obviously fact that they are fighting a war for their very existence while the Russians are fighting a fairly pointless war of aggression and naked expansionism.
Eh invading a massive country of 40 million with near peer capabilities with only 200k-250k men was an excercise in insanity.
Russia has never significantly outnumbered the Ukrainians on the ground, which is not a position you want to be in as an invader when time is against you.
Once they failed to force a quick capitulation by storming Kyiv they were pretty fucked.
They already tried the same thing in Ukraine and are failing.
Chechnya is Muslim and isolated in Russia.
The West was not interested nor were they able to assist Checnya.
Even then, Putin had to lick Kadorovite balls to pacify Chechnya.
Ukraine is a different beast altogether.
