But yeah worst case scenario is that we have to build new weapons and delay our buildup and quota goals, and just do that faster somehow!
Dane here: Actually since we ARE part of NATO we still have to try an deliver on our armament quota or we face penalties, the fact that they are out and about, makes us have to replace them faster.
So we would be needing them, but we are probably also part of the lend lease program, so it makes fiscal sense.
I think Lend Lease is an American-only program, unless there is something else your country is doing that I'm not aware of.
As for NATO alliances, I don't think there are penalties if you don't pull your fair share.
My country, Canada doesn't either.
Additionally, I would suspect that what the US has said publicly (and again likely warned privately) that they'll just straight up delete the Russian military if nukes were used is keeping them in check.
I think your government is just being pragmatic about this.
The real threat to your nation is Russia, so any piece of Russian hardware that gets knocked out, your country is safer.
It just seems like the smart play.
