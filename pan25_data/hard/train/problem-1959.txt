Unilateral definition: "An action or decision performed by or affecting only one person, group, or country involved in a situation, without the agreement of another or the others.
".
Putin declared a unilateral ceasefire, which they violated after a couple hours.
Ukraine wasn't required to accept it, and they probably didn't even have time to break it before russia did so.
Didn't Ukraine not agree to any ceasefire?
Not saying we can trust Russia, but there isn't any ceasefire to begin with since both parties never agreed.
If you’re proposing a ceasefire it needs to be underpinned by honesty and goodwill on both sides for it to work.
Then a few people pointed out that putain didn’t observe a ceasefire on 25th December, so why would this one be any different?
Not a putin fan but… didn’t Ukraine tell putin to fuck off about his ceasefire?
I mean if there had been one putin would have definitely broken it.
But still I don’t think in this instance any ceasefire was agreed?
Or am I wrong?
Well, anything that explores the Ukraine narrative for the war gets bombarded with negativity.
Partly, presumably, the Ukraine social media army but also the sheep.
