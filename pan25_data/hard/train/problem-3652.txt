The debt ceiling was created to help fund World War 1.
Congress allowed the Treasury Department to start issuing bonds, adding to the US debt, without specific Congressional approval.
The Debt Ceiling was meant to be a limit on the Treasury.
They could take out debt to $X without needing more approval, but ideally they wouldnâ€™t go to that level unless needed.
Prior to 1917 the debt was handled in a way we would call common sense.
Congress passed laws to do something and they authorized the debt to enact those laws.
We could also force Congress to pass a budget every year.
If they fail to pass a budget in two years that triggers an election and no sitting members of Congress can run for election for two years.
So instead of throwing out the politicians when congress fails, lets throw out the lobbyists and ban them from lobbying for the next two years.
If you throw out all the politicians, then the only people left with any continuity will be the lobbyists.
That will force all the newbie politicians to be completely dependent on the lobbyists for a functioning government.
