"No, no, of course it's not that we think you'll probably be killed.
Also not that you might get your genitals shot off.
Or that you might suffer a spinal injury that paralyzes you below the waist.
Or that a traumatic brain injury might destroy most of your motor functions.
Also, not that severe PTSD may cause you to react violently to close human contact.
It's honestly none of those things.
".
Yep.
It's basically been a dystopia since Muscovy showed up and became the mongols' tax collector.
Before that, no one knew of muscovy.
Later, Ivan 3 forcibly took the independence and autonomy of the city of Novgorod, which Ivan 4 (the terrible) then massacred for supposedly planning to betray them to the catholics.
Novgorod had been one of the most proto-democratic societies in Europe at the time, with a system where all citizens could vote, though the nobility and merchants tended to have more power.
It was a key trading partner of the Hansa League in the Baltic.
Then Muscovy came and destroyed it.
Yeah, the kyivan rus had already declined, then the mongols came, and then muscovy eradicated the last remnants.
And yeah.
Ivan the third only captured novgorod and took its bell and independence.
Ivan the 4 then razed it.
