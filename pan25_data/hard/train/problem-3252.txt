Edit: My dad is from Rize, one of the more conservative and religious parts of Turkey.
I’ll be honest, I don’t visit often, but I don’t censor myself when I am there.
He himself is openly atheist and has been for a long time.
It is still not illegal to not wear a veil or a headscarf; many local women do not, and at most, some people might give you weird looks.
If I were to scream out my atheism in public at the wrong part of town, there is a slight possibility I might get a public beating.
People who beat me will still get arrested and prosecuted if I press charges.
Ignoring for a moment this was purposefully done in front of the Turkish mission, probably not - but I'd personally argue ensuring religious freedom is a core obligation of any modern state, and permitting or acquiescing to a blatant attack against any religion in the public arena does not track with that.
There are more nuanced and moderate ways to level criticism.
Not to mention, Erdoğan's stance in this instance has nothing to do with Islam, so I'm unclear what you would be criticizing here by burning a Quran.
What people seem to don't understand is that crass and provocative actions such as burning a copy of Quran or hanging a doll of Erdogan allow Erdogan to unite his voter base in Turkey.
It is almost like not all Turks support Erdogan, but you get called names supported by bullshit arguments in every discussion about politics of turkey anyway.
But the fact is, it is even more idiotic to hold Turkish people accountable for a dictators populist actions to consolidate his voters.
I think it is important to make a distinction between the belief of the Turkish people and the aspirations and political schemes of a politician here.
Erdogan != Turkey.
