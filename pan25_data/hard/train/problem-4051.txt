Biden could not have had a smaller majority in the senate and the smallest house majority since Bush.
And with those we got the largest climate investment in history, massive infrastructure, chips, etc.
I think you could argue the American Rescue Plan helped save the economy and the CHIPS act helped to make sure any future chip shortage doesn’t hurt us nearly as badly.
I think a more appropriate thing to say is Biden as accomplished way more give his smallest of majorities.
Obama had a super majority in the senate and 250+ house seats.
He could’ve accomplished sooooooo much more if he didn’t insist on working with Republicans.
So while yes I do believe the ACA may be more significant, I would argue it is not nearly as impressive give Obama had 59-60 senate seats where Biden had 50.
Obama should’ve and could’ve done more.
Biden did the most he could with what he had.
Oh well guess we gotta just shove Biden through again, and to hell with the concerns people have about him.
Not that Biden has done a bad job, but if he calls it quits in 2024, D’s would be like a bunch of cats trying to pick a leader.
Biden is the most effective President in my memory, 50+y/o, there should be no discussion of replacing him.
