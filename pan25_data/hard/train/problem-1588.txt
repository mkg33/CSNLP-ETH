It sounds well-balanced.
In principle, I don't have anything against a social system where society covers for when someone is in so much pain, they cannot effectively work.
Just take the time off and come back ready to rock when you feel healthy.
I personally feel the problem with cashing in paid sick leaves, is that it just transforms it into part of the wage that people assume.
Employers might count it as salary, as people.
All I am saying is that people get fairly compensated for the work they do.
Especially when they are covering for someone else's work.
But doesn't that penalize the healthy by shifting the work of the sick onto them for no additional compensation?
You understand that sick leave isn't a vacation, right?
It's not some extra privilege.
It's literally because those women are too sick to work.
Absolutely no one wants to need more sick leave.
In Spain, as a man you already have the right to have all the sick leave you need.
If you're jealous of those women with debilitating periods getting more sick leave than you, why aren't you equally jealous for your male coworker with chronic migraines getting more sick leave than you?
Imagine telling someone "it's so unfair my colleague with cancer gets extra days off for their chemo, why aren't I getting extra days off for the chemo I'm not having?
Where's equality???
".
Na, he is right.
The first 3 days are \unpaid\ leave.
For each day you will have the "1 day of work" equivalent reduced from your salary, so the specific amound will depend on your wage.
From day 4 to day 15 you will get 60% of your salary, paid by the company.
Beyond day 16 you will get paid by the government (60% first, 75% beyond 21st day).
