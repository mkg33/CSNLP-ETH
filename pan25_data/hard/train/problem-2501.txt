Plus what they use would be considered "subpar" even by North Vietnam in 1960s, majority of conspricts are just forced labour for the state without any training and economy on life support don't sound like something being able to keep all that tanks/planes/ships/trucks going.
For US defence, they had minimal garrison without heavy arnament which was middle of leaving South Korea.
First reinforcementscame from relative underequipped occupation forces in Japan.
There is other problem, PRC have some serious problem with North Korean illegal immigrants.
If they annex North Korea they not only got a shitload of socio-economic problems but also massive refugee crisis AND Koreans not gonna accept they are part of China.
That pretty much sums it up, china has to continue supporting the Kim regime as if its collapses, millions of North Koreans will go into China, and America will basically have a border with the mainland.
My understanding of the China-North Korea relationship is while China does prop up NK, they do it grudgingly, like a parent who has to repeatedly bail out their idiot son who keeps losing money on cryptocurrency.
