I wonder if we had back doors in all their stuff, or if they’re paranoid and buy from the Chinese who famously leave back doors which anyone else can exploit as soon as they find out.
When solar winds happened I thought how we were so behind and the Russians so ahead in cyber espionage.
Their intelligence and war fighting capabilities are atrocious.
Stuff we would be putting into long term storage destroyed their newest stuff in the hands of the Ukrainians who are doing an amazing job….
Our older weapons, and some new systems, def very limited what we are giving them… they destroyed half the Russian army with it practically.
Russia's breaking out leftover equipment from early in the Cold War to supply their troops and you're expecting them to have FLIR or an equivalent on hand?
I wonder how many people have been purged from within the Russia's military intelligence / planning at this point.
It seems all of their plans have been leaked in advance since before this war.
They have to be going nuts trying to find a mole.
I mean look at how much Elon Musk loses his shit over employee leaks and then times that by military Intel.
