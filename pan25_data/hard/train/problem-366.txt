In Ukraine, there's no way of knowing what the proportion is of command losses unless the Russian government suddenly becomes a LOT more open and transparent about the fatalities they're suffering.
However, the insane amount of loss of matériel in Ukraine means that this war has been far more painful for Russia than Afghanistan ever was to the Soviet Union.
When you consider that the Soviet military was vastly bigger in terms of raw numbers than the Russian military was at the start of 2022, then the losses Russia has sustained are even more painful.
No wonder Russia will lose the wars they started cause they are no longer fighting lousy terrorists in their country, but a professional army full of foreign PMC.
Jesus… that was hard to read.
And definitely this is one of the worst things a superpower such as Russia would want: people fearing and hating the military and wanting absolutely nothing to do with it.
What makes Russia & it's people so consistently miserable throughout history compared to other large countries that have had major upheavals & dictators (I.e.
China), which at some point stabilized somewhat?
It's not like Russia lacks intelligent people who want better for themselves.
Was any hope for a positive upturn in Russian civilization killed when Stalin banished & cancelled Trotsky?
