The US alone has contributed around 40 billion so far.
Thats around 5.6% of its yearly military budget.
They could keep this up for another 50 years and still have the world's most powerful military everyone of those years.
Doesn't matter if they 10 million.
They can't outfit what they are currently fielding.
They are running out ammo, armor (both wearable and mobile units), and even fucking uniforms.
They aren't going to send 20,000 troops in wearing civilian clothes and no weapons lol.
Not having enough troops was the secondary problem.
Not being able to move supplies to the front in time to sustain the advance was the primary concern.
On paper they've got that many men of appropriate age eligible to be sent.
The number willing to go is obviously lower.
The same is true of every country to some extent.
Every person in the Selective Service certainly wouldn't report if the US called a draft.
We're just seeing that in Russia there's a really big disparity between those numbers.
Yeap, there are massvive demographic swings in Russia after every war.
Also RealLifeLore is a great channel.
Also not to mention that the surviving male members of society then know that there are more women wanting them which will probably cause a lot of single mothers which means the family model is fucked as it is.
