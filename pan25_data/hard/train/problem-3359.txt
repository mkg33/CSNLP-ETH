For 45 years after WW2 the USSR blasted their population with propaganda how they are unbeaten righteous defenders against fascist through their determination and strenh.
And then Russia (USSR successor's) invade Ukraine with savage methods and rhetoric or racial superiority (calling Ukrainians pigs)....
Every single one of these places that used to be USSR start leaning more towards Europe and away from Russia suddenly and rather mysteriously have claims about "oppression" of "Russian speaking people" or "ethnic Russians" surface "forcing" Russia to send troops in to protect the population or something.
Every single place that has even briefly looked into joining NATO or even just googled the process or even just mentioned joining the EU suddenly have territorial disputes flare up.
Moldova being chummy with Romania?
Oh whoops there's Transnistria (although that's been 30 years going) demanding independence.
Ukraine electing a pro-West government?
Welp time to take over Crimea and destabilize Luhansk and Donetsk to make sure that scary, scary NATO stays away.
