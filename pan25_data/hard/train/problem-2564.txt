Republicans have been warmongers for decades, invading middle eastern countries left and right, but when it comes to a scenario of defending democracy from the tyranical regime of Russia, all of a sudden they switch stance because "we have to be anti whatever the democrats do" and because they secretly admire tyranical dictatorships because they want to end democracy in America.
Supporting Ukraine has been one of the best things I've seen Western countries do in years, All of us in Europe are cheering the miltiary aid our governments are sending to Ukraine to fight Putin.
At least the money is well-spent by the Ukrainian government and keeps Russia from further invasions to other countries at the expense of Ukrainian people.
Unlike the tremendous wasted money poured into Afghanistan and gave it away to the Taliban at the end.
Glory to the Ukrain and Ukrainian people!
Dear European Union, please show you actually mean something by doing more for Ukraine.
You whine that we are the world's police but when crunch time happens, you do VERY little.
