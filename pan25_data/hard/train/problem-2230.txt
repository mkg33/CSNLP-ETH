Is English your second language or is your reading comprehension that bad?
Or are you just being disingenuous by purposefully re-interpreting the English language?
Honest questions.
Russia invaded Ukraine, so obviously Russia is to blame.
Russia blames NATO expansion.
A sovereign country is free to choose who their allies are, we don’t need to invade or force other countries to join NATO.
We should not be expected to appease tyrants in Russia because they object to their neighbors warming up to the West.
These countries shouldn’t have to live in fear to placate despots.
It’s literally forcing them to be a buffer state that’s greatly influenced, if not completely controlled, by Russia for Russian oligarch’s peace of mind.
It’s those countries who suffer, because increasing ties with Russia is their only option, lest Russia throw a pissfit.
They expect countries near Russia to stay in fear of Russian invasion rather than ensure their security through joining NATO, so it was wrong of the US & NATO not to appease Russia.
This has nothing to do with supporting Cuba.
I was obviously saying that the right echos that the US & NATO are to blame for Russia invading Ukraine.
Is it your opinion that NATO has no blame here or just that the majority of the blame is on Russia?
Are you at all concerned with Ukraine’s attempted false flag last week?
