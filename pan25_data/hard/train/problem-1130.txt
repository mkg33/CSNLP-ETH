That is not what's going on right now.
Russia is throwing everything they've got at Ukraine while they prepare for another major offensive.
Ukraine is losing ground very slowly in the East and while it seems Russia is losing men at an unsustainable rate, they also have seemingly endless bodies to throw on the pile.
Ukraine needs help more than every now because Russia may not be the force we all thought they were at the start of this war, they're still a massive military 100% committed to this war and causing massive destruction in Ukraine.
Apologies if my above comment sounded like i am saying Ukraine wanted war(as its clearly an invasion by Russia).
How any American can not be livid over the invasion of Ukraine is beyond me.
But here we are, ready to relinquish any ground to the worst people on earth because we’re too comfortable to care.
Get your shit together, free world… the next century of geopolitics is going to be decided on whether you can maintain attention long enough to get the job done.
If attention span is a problem, send the real weapons so Ukraine can finish this in less than another year.
At this point Western countries need to help supply Ukraine with better weapons and get this shit over with.
Also,if the US has money to spare they can just fund Ukraine's redevelopment.
It would have more positive influence in the world and improve US's image of from being a warmonger to a Helping state.
