Well this will be appealed to the 5th which they now control, and infact are using as a pipeline to get this kind of shit to SCOTUS.
Oh...I see the you said "could be applied nationally".
I took that to mean it would imminently as a result of this decision not as possibly eventually.
If the case is the latter I don't disagree with you at all.
Remember when all those appeals courts ruled in favor of marriage equality and only the states in the those districts had to allow it.
It was still illegal in OH long after the 9th said that was unconstitutional because they're in the 6th.
In fact 6th circuit was the only one that said bans were ok.
It was then SCOTUS stepped in as they often do when appeals courts issue conflicting opinions.
That's a good example.
That's not how it works.
It's only true in the jurisdiction that court has control over.
If it gets appealed to the circuit court it could apply to the whole circuit.
If it makes it to the supreme court then it could apply to the whole nation.
Whether or not it is - it is a federal ruling.
Meaning it applies nationwide.
Now will states all accept it and go forward with it?
No.
But it sets the precedence for the whole of the nation.
