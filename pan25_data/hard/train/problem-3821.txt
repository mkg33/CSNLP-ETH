The Su-35 is newer and was considered a premeir 4+ generation fighter while the Rafale, while an excellent aircraft, is an older fighter.
The Rafale is not really a robust EW platform, so it's ability to jam a Su-35 is surprising.
It's more like a fairly new Toyota beating some suped up looking car on the 1/4 mile.
The Su-35 is not as capable as advertised.
Jamming the radar is essentially blinding the aircraft and denying them the ability to get the first shot off, or maneuver when you shoot at them.
It makes their aircraft look like shit.
Which is funny considering that Egypt has historically been a huge market for Russian(Soviet) weapons and aircraft.
Yeah it was pretty hilarious when a French Dassault Rafale jammed a russian Su-35’s radar during Egypt’s fighter acquisition competition.
Egypt did not choose the Su-35.
What makes you think they’re not a defensive weapon?
Maybe they want to use them to repel a russian invasion?
You know, because in the past, they were invaded by russia in 1575, 1654, 1733, 1768, 1772, 1792, 1793, 1794, 1795, 1813, 1920, 1939 and 1944?
