I feel that people in any position will convince themselves they're doing the right thing when they can benefit from it and get away with it.
I don't think they (the elite) explicitly think "I am going to screw my fellow man over" just to screw their fellow man over just like the everyday man doesn't.
That's an elementary idea and way too easy to swallow, imo.
""Sure, cried the tenant men, but it’s our land…We were born on it, and we got killed on it, died on it.

P.S.
I hate when I try to have a serious discussion about stuff like the gulf stream collapsing and people just ask me "why are we even talking about this".
Ah yes gifted with dreams of working in a field that makes a difference only to have it stomped out of you as you really can only be useful if you are making a product or weapons and government positions being so far from available and usually given to someone with connections more than brains.
