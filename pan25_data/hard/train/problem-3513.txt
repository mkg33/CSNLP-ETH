Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said taking back Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as the country’s long-occupied eastern Donbas region are conditions for bringing the nine-month war to an end.
Despite the Ukrainian military’s recapture of more than half of the territory it had lost to Russia since February, Russia still occupies large swathes of the south and east of the country, in addition to the Black Sea peninsula.
Seizing back all of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory would entail ambitions that stretch beyond Russian military gains since its invasion launched in February.
After Russia took over Crimea eight years ago, the Kremlin supported separatist forces in Donbas in a conflict that simmered despite a Franco-German-led peace initiative, effectively occupying much of the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.
⚠️ Annexed Ukrainian territories must be returned back to Ukraine including Crimea, Donbas, Luhansk, Donetsk and KRASNODAR, yes Krasnodar region was part of Ukraine before USSR.
