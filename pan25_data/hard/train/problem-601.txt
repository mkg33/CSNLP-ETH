TikTok’s been under some scrutiny because its parent company is ByteDance, which has thousands of staff in China and several business units headquartered there.
One big risk with TikTok is that China has introduced a suite of national security laws over the last decade that compel domestic companies to share data with the Chinese government (for national security or intelligence purposes) and there is typically no avenue (legal or otherwise) to push back on such a request.
My caveat is that the Chinese government could also obtain very detailed personal information on American citizens through buying such data off the dark web if it wanted to.
Social media websites such as Twitter and Instagram do get hacked, not to mention hospital records.
A lot of such information can be bought and sold on the dark web if the Chinese did want to do so.
TikTok would not be the only place Chinese authorities could obtain Americans’ data.
Might be a little off topic but even though tiktok is used for data collection by China why is it still legal and used everywhere in USA?
Why isn't the military or govt banning it?
