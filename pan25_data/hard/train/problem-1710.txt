And since they import most of their chips, reducing the amount they import would naturally free up millions of chips to be used in third world countries instead etc.
And you don't see how the Chinese military using those chips far outweighs any benefit that would come from having China produce the chips?
If you think how the US treats the rest of the world is bad, I can tell you with 100% certainty that China would be far worse, at least under the current regime.
Want proof?
Ask the Uighurs.
I really hope I shouldn't have to explain why we shouldn't give that technology to a country currently carrying out a genocide.
These are wants, not necessities.
Profits aren't what's important here, we can't afford to just hand this technology over to the government of a geopolitical adversary just for the sake of corporate profits.
It isn't worth it.
Just because we're wrong about supporting Saudi Arabia doesn't mean that preventing China from getting this technology isn't the right move.
You know what the Chinese government would use the chips for, right?
Military technology.
I really hope we can both agree that the Chinese military having access to our chips is not a good thing in any way, shape, or form.
If you don't agree, then I'm glad that you aren't the one dictating our foreign policy towards China.
You seem to think that the US would be OK with a free and democratic China.
They are more free now than they were 30 years ago.
What jas changed is they are becoming a near-peer competitor to the USA, and that the US won't tolerate, regardless of how democratic they were.
