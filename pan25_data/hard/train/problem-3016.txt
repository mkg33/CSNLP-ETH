The Democratic Party has gotten more progressive since the days of Bill Clinton.
That’s a good thing.
Meanwhile, the Republican Party has become more extremist and downright stupid.
Republican policies and rhetoric are centered around hurting people while only helping the rich and corporations.
Exactly.
It’s a sign to me that people who don’t know this OUT IN THE OPEN FOR EVERYONE TO SEE stuff are simply not paying attention and would rather “both sides” politics in a sad effort to make themselves appear more informed than they are.
Or they are willing participants.
You're clearly not as informed as you pretend.
Republicans have already said they're going to stop J6 investigations and investigate the INVESTIGATORS (Jordan).
They plan on furthering their attacks on women's bodily autonomy by making it a FEDERAL issue (Graham).
They have pushed more and more egregious voting restrictions on citizens (there IS no voter fraud - they couldn't prove any in courts of law), and quite a few Republicans have pushed to have electors overturn voting results if they don't like the outcome.
How can you honestly not see the ridiculousness in the statement that people voting who they want to vote for instead of who you want them to vote for is the end of democracy?
Just lunacy.
Democracy is people voting for who they want to vote for, for whatever reason they want.
The only threat to democracy is the the people who think that is a problem.
Which party has constantly claimed that our “democracy” is in danger when in fact this country isn’t a democracy?
It is a constitutional republic.
