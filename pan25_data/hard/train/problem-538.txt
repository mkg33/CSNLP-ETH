Then big difference is dems are not hung up on party loyalty.
Dems will vote for good legislation and will pass help pass things the far right objects to.
Once they embarrass themselves the freedom caucus will find they have very little influence.
If the party actually splits, the centrist could be much more productive than a similar split on the left.
The GOP would not support good legislation from a center faction of dems.
The dems needed every dem vote on everything.
I’ve been trying to imagine a Republican house with 219 seats.
Literally any two GOP could block partisan legislation.
The party will fracture.
Anything reasonable will get enough dems to pass.
But that anything wacky could be blocked by just a couple reasonable republicans.
Just 1% of republicans can block anything crazy.
It’s like the dems in the senate but for people that need to get re-elected in two years in very local (not statewide) races.
Maybe next time work on boosting candidates in local races in red States.
I had to make up names because so few offices had more than one candidate and they were Republicans.
I'm not "bOtH sIdEs"ing here, but from an electoral perspective they fill the same niche.
The parties they support would rather they stay quiet and out of the way of more centrist traditional candidates.
Boebert and Bernie are nothing alike but they're both a threat to their respective "big tent".
