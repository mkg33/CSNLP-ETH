Another r/politics thread where we decry the Supreme Court for taking our rights while desperately calling for them to take this right because people don’t like it.
I welcome you to go to those other countries, or stay there if you are already.
If gun ownership was a privilege and not a right the United States wouldn’t even exist.
You don't see the value in gun ownership or don't feel you personally need a gun so to you a bans and restrictions only has positives.
Obviously others have a different view point.
Using language like "sacrifice kids at the alter of the 2nd" isn't going to change anyone's minds.
That kind of thing only appeals to people who are already on board more gun control.
So what other actions do you think should be taken that'd be as efficient if not more than gun control?
My view, and could be wrong, is you need to start enforcing the guns laws on the books to draconian levels.
The science does not actually back up the idea of heavy handed gun control.
People talk about correlations but forget that doesn't mean causation while ignoring problems with confounding variables or cherry picked data.
