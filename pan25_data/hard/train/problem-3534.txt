No we haven't?
The revolution was in 79, and yes some official things are referred to in the context of the revolution eg.
the revolutionary guard corps, leader of the revolution etc.
but no regular person has been saying there's a revolution in process until these protests started and some people started to refer to it as the beginning of a revolution.
Yeah I didn't think people were going to misinterpret it but clearly I was wrong... She means the current protests which is the beginning of a new revolution in most Iranian's eyes.
No it means what it says, I just think non-Iranians aren’t familiar with calling these protests a revolution.
If you ask Iranians a lot will say this is a revolution, but in western media they’ve been referred to only as protests.
She’s referring to the current ‘revolutionary process’.
It happens in every “revolutionary state”.
The people who gain power from earlier revolutions simply co-opt the idea of revolutionary thinking and brand all opposition as counter-revolutionaries and reactionaries.
