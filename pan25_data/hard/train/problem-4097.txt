Fantastic proposals, I did not expect much other than the same PR mantras, but I was actually surprised with it, especially with this one:
If reddit existed in 1944, redditors would also be clamoring for the to partition Germany, because given what Putin Nazism did to Russia Germany, Russians Germans as a country were seen as blood-hungry, imperialistic, and warmongering by nature, so their nationhood deserves to be permanently destroyed, so that they won't be a threat ever again.
Wanting Russia to be destroyed only helps Russian propaganda's claims that this is an existential war, and that if Putin loses his imperialist masturbatory fantasies in Ukraine, Russia will become extinct.
The Putinism is nothing but modern reincarnation of “nationalism”… Russians (even people we call “progressive”) always though that Russia is somewhat special… (as a matter of fact the US has similar weakness and it causing all kind of problems).
In case of Russia it means that removing Putin and all oligarchs is not going to be enough.
The layers of tainted administration are going very deep.
And even if by some miracle we manage to remove all Putin admirers… who is going to replace them?
Best and brightest left and quite a few of them will never come back.
