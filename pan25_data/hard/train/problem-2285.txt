No, these types of people are mentally ill and/or addicted to some sort of substance.
And for me, I'd include being addicted to "hate" as one of those substances, because if you are a hate-driven person, you are quite capable of exhibiting the same characteristics (including paranoia, irritability, and confusion) as if you were addicted to alcohol or meth or some other such substance.
Thank you for labeling this behavior correctly.
Too many try to excuse this cruel, childish, a$$acholic behavior from MTG and the like as somehow excusable because, "These people feel abandoned.
".
