I didn't agree with all of the campaign's moves but I'm not a political strategist; either way I'm very proud of the team for the victory.
And I'm proud to have been able to help out lots of Democrats behind the scenes.
I may know who you're talking about.
We did some work for the Mayes Campaign since they launched and through to the end so I'm familiar with the team.
(Won't say what type of work we did since public campaign finance docs will narrow it down).
(Posting from my public burner because this can all be found in campaign finance docs anyways so why tie that to my anonymous main.
).
Couple electoral cycles ago I got to do my first ever training of a new hire on a campaign, getting her up to speed on the backend of Dem.
voter and donor outreach systems, since this was her first ever campaign job outside of a couple door-knocking sessions.
Honestly was a bit surprised our candidate insisted on hiring her over those with past experience, but she was definitely an eager learner.
A few years later, she ended up being Mayes's campaign manager for most of this cycle, and definitely played a sizable role in pulling off this skin-of-your-teeth flip.
Pending recount, (the Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court also signs off, but outside of retention races he isn't elected per se).
