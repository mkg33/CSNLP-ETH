Supreme Court judges have no code of ethics they're required to adhere to, so it's just a theoretical abuse of power really.
But beyond that, the only way to punish a SCOTUS judge is by impeachment, which requires a majority vote in the House, and then removal which requires 67 votes in the Senate.
Even if the Dems could impeach him before they lose their majority in a couple weeks, there is zero chance that 17 Republican Senators would decide to remove a conservative judge from the court, thus opening a seat for Biden to fill, knocking down their advantage from 6-3 to 5-4.
The honest answer is that you need a large percentage of the population to start voting for Democrats in every election.
I know that's not the answer anyone wants to hear, but that's really all there is short of a civil war of some kind.
With more Dems elected they can get big enough majorities to vote for rule changes (like eliminating the filibuster, eliminating partisan gerrymandering or expanding the Supreme Court), and actually make meaningful change.
More like, helped head off a major Dem bloodletting, but as long as the Republican-controlled legislatures are still able to keep their voter suppression & gerrymandering in place, the Dems will always be one election away from losing political power for the forseeable future.
Next time Dems hold enough power, they should really pass legislation, at the very least, requiring Justices and their spouses to report lobbying efforts and any other sources of income.
And have there be an actual penalty for non-compliance.
This click bait left out an important part of what he said - unfortunately, these statutes have no enforcement mechanisms.
So, Thomas and his wife could give a fk.
