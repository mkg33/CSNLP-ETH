Attack, no, but an emboldened Russia with a significantly increased influence sphere, with Ukraine's population, heavy industry, farmland and heavy industry can do to fuck shit up for the rest of us here in the region in myriad ways.
They don't have start launching missiles to terrorise its smaller neighbours, and given the history of our countries, the way Westerners poke fun of how Russia can't bake a cookie without it being somehow defective, guess what.
Mismanagement and sabotage are devastating, too.
If Ukraine doesn't win definitively, in one way or another the rest of us are next.
We know it.
Poland knows it, Russia knows it, and yes, Ukraine knows it, too.
No hard feelings between non-Russia, we know our history.
So we bust arse for Ukraine, because if she goes, we will slowly follow.
If Ukraine falls, Russia will likely continue, but not with Poland.
Moldova was probably supposed to be next.
There's no way in hell Russia will attack a NATO nation.
Russia know perfectly well that they cannot compete at all against NATO in all out war.
From what we've seen the past year, we can even take the US out of NATO and Russia still wouldn't even consider it.
