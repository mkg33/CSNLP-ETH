Jamaica has literally had crowds of people cheer on the death of gay people.
Extreme religious Caribbean countries quite fucked up when it comes to that regard.
Sadly there's a lot of ignorance in Africa and the Caribbean regarding that due to their corrupt governments and struggling education systems.
I guess the religious folk there would be mad, but religion should not be used for government decisions.
I lived in the Cayman Islands for years, as my dad was an accountant.
But yeah, it's quite crazy how they won't decriminalize gay marriage there.
The government there is more progressive than most other Caribbean countries and also has a British governor, yet for some reason that's not enough for them to give rights to those who are LGBTQ+ community.
Yeah this was a judicial decision rather than a legislative one, so there's still a lot of societal changes to happen before the LGBT community can feel safe in the country.
You could ask any LGBT person, from any Latin American country, where homosexual marriage is entirely legal, how accepted they feel by their society.
Furthermore, pools conducted in the most progressive cities of said countries show that, even if the majority of people are OK with same-sex marriage, they're still against same-sex couples adopting or even raising children.
