Pricing is whatever you choose to set, and an increase in sales is the.
That doesn't mean the pricing is correct or incorrect.
The other side of the argument is that some overprice content to the detriment of everyone.
Pearson is an example of that, and I would have no qualms about piracy hurting their profit margins.
That's why the assumption that pirates are simply "potential customers" if only piracy was stomped into non-existence is flawed.
Yes, can we stop claiming piracy doesn't have a positive impact on sales due factors such as word of mouth and people buying it after pirating if they think it was worth their money?
Convenience - If people pirate because of convenience then the price doesn't matter.
If I go somewhere with no internet and I want to load on stuff to do, then the price is irrelevant if I can't access the product offline.
If a company takes away a product you already owned from your account, then the price doesn't matter.
If I'm forced to go through a DRM and cannot read the book on the device of my choice, then the price is irrelevant.
On the book that I purchased recently, their DRM would not let me look at the book.
I had to go to an alternate source to find the information that I needed.
