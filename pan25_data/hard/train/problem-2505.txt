In many states in the US, the Catholic church is 50% Hispanic and priests talk all the time about how people need to do more for undocumented immigrants.
It is also 90% old people, which tend to be conservative.
The most common identifier I see for that crowd is being pro life, of which the catholic church is very pro life.
So there is a balance of views, some of the stances that the Catholic Church takes are Democratic stances, and some are Republican stances.
The problem is that the Catholic Church is growing in more conservative, traditional parts of the world while shrinking in the more liberal, progressive ones: .
Der synodale Weg is also not schisming (that would risk excommunication) but lobbying the catholic church for reform.
The risk of schisms does exist though as they do wish to change several dogmas doctrines.
It is publically also supported by a faction of German Catholic bishops and other clerics.
So basically they are the largest organized movement for catholic church reform in Germany and they do have beef with the rape accusations.
This isn't surprising because the accusations are rooted in legal matters, not religious ones.
Der synodale Weg has frequently voiced its disappointment with how the church handles the systemic rape accusations.
