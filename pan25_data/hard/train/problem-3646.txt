Keep in mind there are many other analogous vectors that liberals can attack the Texas precedent on (e.g., suing churches for harmful religious practices, suing corporations for political speech, etc.).
It is going to be a lot of work to generate legal arguments to carve all of those out while keeping the Texas law in place, and then they have to supervise implementation of all those carve outs by the (increasingly liberal) Circuit Courts.
I'm guessing that the 6 demons would prefer to utilize their limited docket space on other right-wing priorities that have higher impact.
That stuff does matter - even obvious partisan hack Aileen Cannon tried to defend her ridiculous orders in Mar-a-Lago with some legal argument.
Look man, these court opinions are not easy to draft.
They take a lot of work and lawyer hours.
You think these justices are putting these together for fun?
Of course not.
The legal doctrine they are building through their opinions is part of the game.
That is the legal argument.
I'm fully against it.
But it's not the same as Texas's thing in the slightest explicitly because we never got an abortion amendment.
I think thatâ€™s the hope, because it will be very hard for the SC to block this while allowing the Texas abortion ban operating under similar mechanisms.
