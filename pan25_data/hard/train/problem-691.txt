It's good to remember that economics is not a science.
There are no double-blind studies and rarely any efforts to eliminate confounding variables.
Economics is to our actual economy what astrology is to the heavens.
It's based on accurate observations, but comes to some pretty nonsense conclusions.
Market forces aren't inscrutable, according to economists.
The market is always supposed to behave logically.
(Spoiler alert: it does not.)
Not even a week ago I saw a classic explanation of inflation online that claimed prices had gone up because low unemployment and higher wages had increased consumer spending.
Turns out, consumer spending rose because companies jacked up the prices on necessities like food and gas.
Why would companies do that?
Greed.
Economics generally makes no provision for unbridled greed.
Greed and graft can crash a whole economy, and therefore it is illogical.
It shouldn't exist.
But it does!
I mean I think we are in it.
They always call it after it's happened.
Look at all the high flying tech companies laying people off.
But as inflation stays high and unemployment rises it gets exponentially worse.
Yep, because while they’re keeping wages way behind inflation, they’re raising prices above it.
It doesn’t take much to figure out what’s going on.
