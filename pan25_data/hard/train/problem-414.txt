Ukraine will win big here.
They depleted Russia as a threat to NATO and the EU for decades to come.
The pain of this year and next year will be followed by a defense build up to protect Ukraine from this occurring again and then massive investment to tap their gas and other resources and then I suspect a rebuilding like was done in Germany post WW2.
By defeating the bear Ukraine will be a new European hero and everyone likes and supports hero’s.
They will get a boat load of cash investments and possibly grants instead of just IMF and EU loans.
Not so much really because Russia has nuclear weapons and Ukraine isn’t part of NATO or the EU yet.
I hope Europe will look at Ukraines sacrifice and fast track them in.
I also hope NATO will find some way to either make a mutual defense agreement with Ukraine or allow them in as a member once Russian troops are off their soil.
And then there is the point, that Russia and Belrus still encycle Ukraine - while Ukraine isnt allowed to breach enemy borders, Russia can literally attack from any angle - if they ever get thier "army" combat ready.
Ukraine is still in dire need of assistence.
This isnt the time for "Mission Accomplished"-Olaf Scholz.
I don't think Scholz went full "mission accomplished" here, at least that's not what I heard between the lines.
But generally you're right that Scholz has no clue what he is talking about, he is just spouting whatever might get angry Germans off his back.
