I said that to illustrate the absurdity of the idea that the US is being heavy handed here when it comes to sanctions.
China has been like this since we normalized trade relations with them.
The field was never level to begin with and the US dropping these sanctions is a sign that China is a big country now that needs to actually participate in a free market instead of a "Free market with Chinese characteristics".
If they want their own advanced semiconductors they can figure that out themselves like the rest of us.
There is no 'level playing field' when doing business in China.
Why in the hell should there be one in the US?
Why in the fuck should the US play nice here?
Until every Chinese company doing business in the US is forced to do go through a US equivalent company while allowing an agent of the US government to be present at all times, no mater how sensitive the matter, I really don't give a fuck.
Lol I am no way defending China but to say all current “US companies have an agent of the US government that is present all the time” is false.
If that was the case we wouldn’t see FTX on the news.
