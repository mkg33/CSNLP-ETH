Wow it’s probably so hard to explain the concepts and spins because there’s no viable pathway for Russia to not be implicated in heinous human rights offenses such as; mass execution of civilians, using ballistic missiles and mortars against civilian infrastructure, and the big elephant in the room — a war of aggression against a sovereign neighboring state.
Take the time to explain your position, I and my brain cells can wait.
This is the crux of where the lies of the Russian government have been spread - lack of evidentiary backing, attempts to manipulate the media regarding the purpose for their war of aggression, constant blaming of others for their “moral” (read: violent) actions.
Lavrov said, "On the one hand, they keep spinning the irresponsible narrative that Russia is about to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine, and citing some statements by the Russian political leadership.
In reality, there have been no such statements.
".
Well, yes.
Yes it is, Sergey.
You wanted to play war.
You have shown that you are untrustworthy in geopolitics, trade, on social media, in treatment of civilians, in looking in the mirror...and SO many other things over the past 80 years.
Well, they ARE influencing a good many of OUR elected representatives, who can't be called politicians anymore...more like...puppets of Putin.
MTG has GOT to be one of them.
No one is THAT stupid.
