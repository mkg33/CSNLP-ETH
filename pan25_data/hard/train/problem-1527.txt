Not just doing business in Russia to supply food to the general public and create tax revenues driven by economic growth, but also supporting genocide in Ukraine by sending care packages to encourage Russian terrorists.
Not the person you are replying to, nor am I arguing any those points, but it should be noted that Russia was happy to starve African nations and their people who were in no way connected to this war by preventing grain exports and stealing that Ukrainian grain.
And we haven't even got to Russia being the largest exporter of grains, not even including what they stole from Ukraine, that many borderline African countries rely on to make it through times of hardship.
Are you aware of just how dependent Western Europe is on Russian and Belarussian fertilizer to grow their crops?
The EU, of course, has tried to find alternative sources for what it can ... but this is not only more expensive for the EU but its driving the prices up for a lot of poorer countries that just cant afford the price hike.
They're trying to reduce this dependence but this of course not only drives prices up for Europe but also drives the prices up for a lot of countries that cannot afford to look elsewhere.
(e.g.
EU looking to Morocco instead and depriving the cheapest source for a lot of borderline African nations that cannot afford to go elsewhere and cannot feed their people without it).
You willing to starve Africa, yourself, and god knows who else in your quest to starve Russia?
Do some research on the Fertilizer situation in Europe and how dependent the EU was, and may still be, on Russia as a cheap source of fertilizer to grow your crops.
