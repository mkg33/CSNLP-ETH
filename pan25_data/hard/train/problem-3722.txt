Well, the routes to Huancayo are still open, but it's not a sure thing because protests are still spreading out in the countryside.
Since it's her hometown, I suppose she still has family to keep her safe in case things go down fast (unlike those tourists trapped in Cusco and Puno).
To which part of Peru is she going?
If she's just gonna stay in Lima, she'll be mostly okay as long as she stays away from the Downtown (Cercado de Lima) unless necessary.
But if she plans to move to the provinces, better to just cancel the trip (even more if her destination is the South).
It's not worth the chance of getting stranded somewhere on the road.
Who knows?
Maybe no major protests would have boiled over if Congress hadn't strutted around like fucking heroes, when it was Castillo's own idiocy that got him time in jail.
It seems like there is plenty wrong with the Peruvian Congress too, but it's not like Castillo was a great guy that everyone liked who was being removed without cause.
I am not Peruvian, but it sounds like the Congress are a bunch of elitist pricks and the first real President they've had since the dictatorship ended was stalled constantly by them.
Leftist presidents of Colombia, Argentina and Mexico can't stand that a corrupt leftist president was impeached.
