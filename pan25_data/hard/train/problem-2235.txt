Holy fuck, our local ground water guidelines for 'safe levels' of PFOS and PFHxS is set at 0.07micrograms/l.... 70000ppt!
The WHO is proposing drinking water limits of 100 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA and PFOS, two of the most studied PFAS compounds.
The letterâ€™s signatories say the level will put human health at risk, and the EPA in June imposed new PFOA and PFOS advisory limits of 0.004 ppt and 0.02 ppt, respectively.
The agency is expected to make the limits mandatory in the coming months, and some researchers suspect the WHO is aiming to derail that effort.
If this were the only chemical it would get more attention.
PCB's for example, are in 80% of tidal segments in Maryland and 100% in Virginia's Chesapeake Bay.
That means if you eat crabs there you are eating PCB's.
PCB's are effectively a forever chemical because they don't decompose for thousands of years, which results in contamination increase over time even though the chemical has been banned for decades, due to sediments moving out to the ocean.
