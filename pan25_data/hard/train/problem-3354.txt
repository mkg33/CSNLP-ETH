Sounds a lot like USA and policing.
Except some of those bastards truly believe an armed insurrection isnâ€™t beating the hand that feeds them and allows them to be terrorists, bullies, racists, mobster, murderer and judge all in the same day.
The more protestors they put down like this, the more protestors they're going to find armed and willing to at least inflict a little damage before being put down.
Doesn't matter if they have the military or not, anyone caught supporting the current status quo will get caught in the cross fire, and they don't need tanks to create fear.
They just need to kill the family members of a politician or two.
The guilty-by-association rife will create an us-or-them mentality and, well there you have it, civil war.
That's how these things usually start.
Total brutality will crush a weak revolution before it gains momentum, its too late to attempt this now, if they do, the retaliation from every fence sitter will have their minds made for them and they won't hesitate to be brutal in return.
