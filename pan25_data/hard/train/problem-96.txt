This is a tragedy for this family, but those eyewitnesses are Palestinian and have a lot of sympathy and support to gain from the international community by alleging police brutality, even though these actions could be completely justified.
In most courts around the world, police reports are more trusted and can be used to prove what happened.
I don’t like it either, but that’s the way it is.
I care about human life; the girl dying is tragic as I said in the original comment.
Fact of the matter is, the Palestinian people elected terrorists to lead their people.
Unless they denounce HAMAS, they are complicit in terrorism.
Are you saying you also agree palestine aggression is correct since Israeli soldiers are clearly a danger to them?
Also, these are Israel forces patrolling Palestine’s country, occupied west bank.
Sucks to be shot by foreign occupying forces on your own soil.
No chance of investigation or justice.
Cops act differently when they know they can’t be held accountable.
That’s not the simplest explanation.
Israeli forces very frequently fire on civilians and children in Palestine when there is little justification.
Since they can’t be held accountable it’s common.
