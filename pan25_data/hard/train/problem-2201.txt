What's the difference between this guy and any of the redditors who hate the Democrats but consistently and religiously vote for them because "Republicans bad"?
Mainline Democrats are saying things like we literally should not have police or border patrol, which is as crazy as the strange GOP obsession with abolishing the IRS, despite the reality that there needs to be some federal agency in charge of collecting money to run the government.
Then they tell me any felon who "feels like" a woman is going to be put in the women's unit at correctional institutions, and so on.
And that's before talking about any of the COVID madness, where both parties hung on waaaaaaayyyy too long to policies and beliefs that did not follow the known science.
But I think "pro-sanity" isn't nearly as clear cut.
I say quite frequently that all the Democrats need to do to crush the GOP is be 1% less crazy, and they don't seem to be able to do that on a consistent basis.
I’ve found that especially recently the house and senate represent the people pretty well; a bunch of nuts - some wanting to help, some wanting to burn it all, and others just trying to make their money and get out.
It’s truly a microcosm of any workplace too, imo.
They’re idiots.
And throw in the nepotism, ego, unlimited “campaign $$”, and literal non-consequence - it makes it so much worse.
It’s the Sales Team from absolute hell.
A bunch of liars and schemers; leeches and snakes.
