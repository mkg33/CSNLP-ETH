Probably because it’s most likely a simple case.
Biden also reported them immediately, like he should have, so I’m sure that comes into account.
Just because it took a while to get a special counsel for Trump does not mean Garland is a hack.
Vs. Trumps flip flopping from they were planted, to they were declassified by him, to he took the documents.
The crime is knowingly taking, concealing, lying about and refusing to return the top-secret documents as Trump did.
Another example is when Sandy Berger, President Clinton’s former national security adviser, sneaked top secret documents out of the National Archives in his socks.
Yes, in his socks.
He knew he was doing something illegal, he tried to conceal it, pled guilty, and resigned as a policy adviser to Democratic presidential contender John Kerry.
For those struggling with the concept that the FBI raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago but not Biden’s residence, the act of forgetting to return top-secret documents is negligent.
It is not a crime if you return them as soon as you realize you have them.
