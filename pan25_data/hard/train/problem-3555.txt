hes only doing what he is in Ukraine as it serves him and undermines Sunak, Boris looks after himself and thats it.
With all due respect, as a Ukrainian you have no idea who Boris Johnson is.
He is a slimy, degenerate cunt who does not give a single shit about his own country, nevermind yours.
The fact that you have a meal named after him would be absolutely mind-boggling to most people here.
You should not like him.
He is not a "stand up guy", he definitely doesn't try his best, and he doesn't make mistakes.
He is an awful, corrupt, evil man.
He's a useless, corrupt, feckless cunt but he did good by Ukraine.
Literally the only good think about his Churchill complex is he saw his moment to leave a mark and took it.
I think it’s more that he relished the chance at playing Winston Churchill on an international stage to distract from all the scandals that were happening back home.
His domestic leadership in the UK was not the man you saw standing up for Ukraine.
Not that he shouldn’t have helped Ukraine.
The British public pretty much unanimously supported him because it was the right thing to do.
Not just helping Ukraine but standing up against Russia.
He’s not very popular in the UK after what he has done to the UK economy, the UK public and all the corruption that him and his government were engaging in.
