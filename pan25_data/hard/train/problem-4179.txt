There's always been an current of thought in the Democratic party that was sympathetic to Palestinians and critical of Israel since the late-70s.
The things that have changed and given this current more publicity (I'd argue it has not really grown in political affluence yet, it's just more frequently reported on) is that sympathy for Palestinians has generally grown in the past 30 years, while criticism of Israel's government has mounted.
On top of that, Fox News in particular have explicitly tried to turn support for Israel into a partisan wedge issue since the early 00s.
EDIT: As for the donors, it's fallacious to equate American Jews with Israel.
Most Jews with strong views on Israel already live there.
It's generally not an issue that motivates the donating or voting behavior of American Jews.
If the Democratic Party ever shifts to truly being anti-Israel maybe that'll change but it's a peripheral issue right now.
Iâ€™m surprised Dems have shifted so hard against Israel - I had always thought a lot of their donors were Jewish.
Though maybe that is not an issue with that group.
