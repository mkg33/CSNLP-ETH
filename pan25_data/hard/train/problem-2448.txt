Some of the conservative justices may of been wavering on their support.
It could of been a calculated leak by another justice to stop them from changing their position.
If they were to change their position after the leak it would look like they were caving into the pressure from progressives, which would be a very bad look for them considering they were put on the court for the sole purpose of championing conservative causes.
4 is the only possibility I can possibly believe, but as I said before, justices do _not_ want to have the appearance that public outrage / pressure can change their legal opinions.
If the supreme court changed their ruling after the leak due to public pressure, then it would open the floodgates because they'd be proving that they will bow to public pressure.
The only sensible move (and the move they took) was to stick by the draft ruling.
If a draft ruling is released early then people will start to protest and put pressure on the court.
The last thing the court wants is the appearance that people can bully them into changing their legal opinions.
This leaves pretty much the only sensible choice being to stick by the draft ruling.
The _only_ people interested in leaking it would be someone who supported the ruling, not someone who was against it.
Justices often change their minds and flip sides multiple times throughout a case.
However, this is all done behind closed doors as arguments are made and precedent is analysed.
Multiple drafts are made as things change.
