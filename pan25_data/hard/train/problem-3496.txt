I think the idea is that the situation that caused them to leave their homeland looks less likely to be resolved soon in Haiti than in Ukraine.
Not relevant.
I don't know whether this statement is made out of some misguided attempt to win an argument or if you're deliberately trying to mislead people.
The fact that Ukraine was extraordinarily corrupt has nothing to do with the masses of refugees today.
There were approx 6 million Ukrainian migrants worldwide from 2014 to 2021.
This year alone there are 7 million refugees.
Are you so deluded in thinking that the corruption situation generated an extra 7 million refugees this year?
Ukraine may one day win the war.
It may be in as soon as a year.
Their problem is almost entirely external, and they are getting a mountain of help.
But Haiti's situation is much more fundamental and it is on a downward spiral of internal problems, the natural disasters are just the trigger.
Haiti was still a mess of course, but temporary disaster visas still mean you eventually need to go back.
After that giant hurricane around 2010, a lot of them were given temporary stays here in the US while the country could rebuild.
