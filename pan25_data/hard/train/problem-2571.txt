Oleksiy Goncharenko, who is part of the European Solidarity party in Ukraine, welcomed the early results from the midterm elections, saying he followed closely the defeat of candidates who pushed a more isolationist foreign policy and the victory of lawmakers who have supported U.S. assistance for Ukraine.
Goncharenko predicted that the GOP congressional base aligned with former President Trump that has urged cuts to Ukraine aid will be less influential than previously thought following Tuesdayâ€™s election.
It's been largely bipartisan so far, but influential Republicans have spoken against further aid to Ukraine.
Such as MTG, J.D.
Vance, Rand Paul, and Tucker Carlson, while Trump has been quiet.
Tucker Carlson in particular has been recently trying to re-frame the Russo-Ukraine War as 'Christian vs woke' (ironic given Ukraine is anything but) which heavily implies he's beyond an isolationist, he's pro-Russia.
These people can certainly whip most of the Republicans to block all further Ukraine aid if they won big in the House.
