Which one?
If you're talking 1800's, I'm sure Canada has agreed that happened.
If you're referring to the schools in a province in the 1900's, that wasn't by the federal government but Trudeau has acknowledged the horror from those schools.
And the 2nd part, 'Chinese' can mean many things.
In fact, I just used "Chinese threat' but I did not mean Chinese people but instead China's government.
But 'Chinese' can also mean people from China and adhering to China's values or it can mean people of Chinese race which can be Chinese-Canadians or Chinese-Americans or Taiwanese or Chinese Malaysians etc.
I 100% agree in the two major points you made.
In trying to avoid being seen as racist, Canada and many others turn a blind eye to the Chinese threat.
The compulsion that leads Canadians to say, "oh but I'm not racist though," is also leading Canadians to turn a blind eye to Chinese threats.
We literally had which would put Canada directly under Chinese control.
That's ridiculous.
There's a line somewhere between "racist" and "conquered" and Canada has gone way past it because it's trying to stay so far away from the "racist" end.
It needs to grow up.
It's probably downvoted because there's no explanation about what Trudeau had to do with it.
He's not great but please be specific if you want to educate people about this.
