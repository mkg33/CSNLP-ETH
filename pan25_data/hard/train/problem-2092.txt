Two teachers in california in sf, san diego, or la would be an upper middle class household.
The issue would be establishing and getting housing, there are programs for that, but programs arent always easy to navigate.
Most of the teachers I knew the last couple years had amazing places though because of housing benefits from the city, the ones who didnt just didnt get through the program beuracracy.
traditionally a large number of male teachers came out of ww2 and vietnam and used the GI bill, today there are over 100000 veteran teachers working in k-12.
I get wanting veterans to have jobs but why would anyone think they could be teachers unless they were teachers before joining the military?
Does this mean that teachers are capable of actively engaging in combat, since it is assumed that veterans can step in to the role of teacher without any training?
Because the entire military system is built to teach people, and teachers coming out of class still need to be taught to teach.
Educate me on the military system built around teaching.
That is news to me.
I have not served in the military.
If you have, please include a little bit of bio like what branch, how long.
