It's the same stupid answer every time.
The Republicans are explicitly anti labor.
This cannot be the bar you measure Democrats by.
It is not enough for Democrats to simply be "not worse than Republicans."
THAT is a delusional stance.
Not just the conservatives.
It was Biden that decided to break the rail strike and I seem to recall more than a few center left types getting really mad at me when I said it was the wrong move.
Remember not even a few months ago when Biden and democrats in congress united to squash a railroad workers strike??
Because the rail workers were mad about dangerous conditions (among other things) and everyone collectively yawned as Team Blue did yet another thing to suck Big Businessâ€™ dick?
So when it comes to fucking the railroad workers, that's Joe Biden's job, but when it comes to holding the railroads accountable it's suddenly a state issue?
Well you see one story hurts the rail industry which Biden (and both Dems/Republicans in general) already showed he won't stand up to even for something small like sick leave.
The other story beats the drum of war which massively helps the military industrial complex add to its obscene pile of blood money.
There's going to be reporting, it's not being outright censored.
That would be a bit obvious.
But there's a reason it's buried under several articles about balloons, Jan6 arrests, Nikki Haley, inflation, etc instead of a top headline.
