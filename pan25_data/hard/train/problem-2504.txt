Republicans won the House in a landslide in 2010, the biggest victory in their party's history to this day, it was a massive sea change in Washinon DC.
When normal problems started to pop up with the ACA, when fine tuning or funding was required, adjustments to language here and rates there, the Republicans opted to just let it get worse, just let it fall apart.
In fact the first bill they passed in 2011 was the "Repealing the Job Killing Healthcare Law of 2009 act of 2011."
Instead of maintaining or improving the Affordable Care Act, the Republicans doused it in gasoline and dared President Obama to light a cigarette.
In 2009 the Democrats passed the largest expansion of taxpayer funded public healthcare since the Johnson administration by relaxing eligibility requirements for Medicaid; the Affordable Care Act did a lot of other things too, of course, but like any other piece of legislation that's ever been written and passed it was imperfect.
Problems, both predicted and otherwise, would eventually crop up, they always do, and that's where the next election comes in.
especially if you don't actually want to deliver, in which case you pretend to try immediately before the election and have someone to blame when it falls through right after.
he'll have to keep kicking that can down the road, as long as he wants the democrats to have any fucking hope of remaining in power, for the foreseeable future.
now there's a solution only a 79 year old can be happy with, because he won't be around to kick the can for very long.
all biden had to do was sign a piece of paper.
if that's hard for him to "prioritize" then he needs to be removed from office through the 25th amendment.
