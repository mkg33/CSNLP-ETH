It's running race between the virus replication and your immune system reaction.
And the vaccine gives your immune system a head start.
But if you have a huge viral load, or if your immune system is compromised, can alter the race.
The virus mutates, and what you are vaccinated with may provide you with some protection against mutated strains.
It would not give you the same protection as the strain of virus your vaccine targets.
So it’s not a vaccine then.
Vaccines prevent viruses and disease.
The Covid vaccine doesn’t do that.
It only “might” reduce risk of infection (and therefore transmission) as well as reduce symptoms of the virus.
I wish the world had gone the Sweden route.
Those who are at risk should have gotten the vaccine, those not at risk should be allowed to make up their minds and everyone else should fuck off instead of forcing them on the entire population.
Yeah they did.
Belgium, Spain and the UK all had higher death rates though.
I didn’t count Italy because most of those deaths are likely pre-vaccine.
You’re correct though regarding elevated death rate per million.
6,500 people between 18-29 years old is certainly too many as you stated.
The fentanyl crisis and gun violence in the USA are much worse for this particular age group.
What do we do about it?
We can’t vaccinate against those issues, guess we shouldn’t consider those to be an existential threat.
