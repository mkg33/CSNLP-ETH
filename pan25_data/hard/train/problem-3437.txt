Russia is already trying that with cheap self-destroying drones from Iran, at the point that they become cheap enough for this sort of attack they also become susceptible to light arms fire taking them down as they move slowly and are quite loud.
My hope is Ukraine can use these new drones to take out more launch sites, make it so any missile volleys that are launched are reduced so much that Ukrainian AA can handle it without issue.
Maybe they are trying to use them all up before the US delivers the Patriot air defense system to Ukraine, which would render most of Russias missles useless.
If I wasn’t such a pessimist I would be amazed but a part of me also thinks Russia is testing anti missile defenses and we are just giving them easy access to test our defenses for weaknesses.
I guess no where in history battles were fought and won with no hidden agendas… everything is done at face value… u must be a high level strategist or chess player.
If you were a super power like Russia how would you test an opposing countries military defenses without starting WWIII?… perhaps invade a non nato country with little defense tech… having the world rally to said country supply them with modern defenses and now Russia can test all they want and gather as much data to defeat those defenses while we have no data on their defenses.
