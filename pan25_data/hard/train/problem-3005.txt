There's a power struggle going on among the Oligarchs around Putin.
Prigozhin was being talked about as a potential successor but has recently been getting slapped down and has been lashing out at Shoigu (Defence minister) and Gerasimov (Chief of the general staff).
Prigozhin is also quite tight with the GRU and there's been some notable friction between the GRU and the FSB over the invasion.
Prigozhin needs Wagner to be succesful (or be perceived as being succesful) for his 'strong tough man making big tough decisions' image, so cutting off Wagner's supplies is an effective way of also cutting off his ambitions for power.
Also Wagner was achieving limited success by just throwing bodies at defended positions as if it was Stalingrad in WW2 and there was some stuff from russian military journalists and bloggers about morale problems in other units because of it.
Edit: This got tweeted a couple of days ago showing tensions between Wagner and the regular Russian military.
Obviously this is very much 'a pox on both their houses'.
Prigozhin has a lot more than just Wagner as he's behind the Internet Research Agency which is a huge russian troll farm that's been involved in trying to influence elections and destabilise the US and European countries.
But Wagner is his big 'name' thing as opposed to all the other stuff that brings in money for him (property, movie studio, foreign investments etc.
).
Yea.
That is effective.
I always thought amed battlefield robots would eventually be used in that manner (advancing mostly to reveal enemy locations).
Didn't expect it to be real people.
