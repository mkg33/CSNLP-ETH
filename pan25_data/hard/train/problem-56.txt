They can extend the pause as long as a national emergency (currently COVID) is used as justification via the HEROES Act.
The argument you're going to hear from Republicans is that the HEROES act is limited only to temporary relief, and that permanent actions such as forgiveness don't qualify past the timing of the emergency.
(I'm not agreeing with this, just saying what's to come).
This is the crux of whether student loan forgiveness will survive or not.
Despite MOHELA's statements which are often cited, the court still granted standing to Missouri to continue the pause.
This is the scenario legal experts have been pointing to that could kill Biden's action:
There are some people who believe that it’s all a ploy to win votes and Biden didn’t want to give the relief at all.
Not even a thought, they'll just suppress any voters that don't agree with them.
Welcome to America 2022 and they STILL couldn't keep us down.
Fuck the GOP.
Fuck them.
I hope everybody is starting to realize how dangerous Republican judges are.
We should never ever relinquish the Senate to Republicans again or else things will continue to get worse for us average Americans.
They're politicians.
Political tools for the establishment.
Evil basically.
