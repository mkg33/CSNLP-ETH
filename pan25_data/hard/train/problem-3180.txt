That is, the offensive is mostly for domestic consumption in Russia.. so that Putin can claim he's doing some big offensive, which will of course fall flat, and then more generals will resign or fall out of windows.
Maybe it isn't, and we should still support Ukraine fully.. but increasingly it's feeling like just another fake-out by Russia, in a long long long javelin-destroyed caravan of lies.
seeing the west take back their tank commitments pisses me off, they really, really dont want Ukraine to reclaim Crimea.
Ukraine is a full fledged western style democracy and if Ukraine falls, we will be looking at an all-out world war between NATO and Russia.
Better to kick Russia's ass in Ukraine and contain the conflict.
The quicker Ukraine kicks Russia's ass out of all of Ukraine, including Crimea, the sooner this war can come to an end.
To do that, Ukraine requires overwhelming force.
No military, not even a drunken one like Russia will "announce" offensives or counter-offensives.
As with the invasion, the offensive was identified through intelligence and observed behaviors.
No, not after all the genocide and other atrocities.
Crimea and Ukraine are the same country and one cannot appease a genocidal dictator like Putin by allowing it to be annexed.
