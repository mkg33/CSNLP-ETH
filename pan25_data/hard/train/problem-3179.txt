There's "no obligation" correct.
But if it's shown the CEO of Twitter directly orders certain things taken down and is silent or encourages others to be posted, their 203 protection from liability goes away and Twitter and EM personally can be sued.
There are emails and stuff too that are valid.
But again, all that stuff is "easily" available to Russian hackers that can load it on a laptop and plant it somewhere.
That's the best part is the "it sat unclaimed" for so long... so there's basically no legal chain of custody beyond some computer shop owner checked it in and then "reviewed it" ... before COPYING it and trying multiple times to send it to the FBI.
The whole thing is a scam... probably one based on what TFG was trying to get Zelenskyy to "announce" that hit TFG impeached.
it's EXACTLY the kind of vague evidence TFG was asking for in exchange for US military aid to Ukraine... you know because Russia was trying to attack them.
(So how'd that work out?
).
This is what should have come before everything else.
How dare someone steal the private property of a private citizen and not face some charges and prison time?
