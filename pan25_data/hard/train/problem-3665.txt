Regardless of the damage being critical or not, this still demonstates that Irans enemies (Which our warmongering regime has created alot out of) are now able to breach our territory.
I pray to God, that this isn't the start of a new chapter where more attacks will be made here.
Maybe I am paranoid, but i am praying for the safety of my family.
However, I as an Iranian, am still genuinely frightened.
Until now, I've rarely seen foreign countries be able to cause explosions on Iranian soil and despite all our neighbours being attacked and invaded by all types of millitias, we've actually been pretty safe (Well, looking past the persecution and harrasment from our own government).
No country is going to invade you, it would be a nightmare even for the US, but you are in risk of suffering massive bombardments and significant sabotage to main infrastructure in case of war, you're luck is that unlike Iran, its opponents not only have far greater precision weapons but their doctrines of warfare hope to minimize damage to civilians and focus on military/regime infrastructure, so you should be relatively safe.
Iran's main foes that have capable militaries (Israel and the US, as opposed to KSA for example) were always able to strike Iran if it escalates to full war, the main thing that they focused on were shadow wars, attacks that stay below the threshold of escalation to war, attacks that allow plausible deniability like "oh it was just a gas leak explosion, not an attack", assassinations and sabotage.
The Iranian regime spent many years building terrorist organizaitons and cells throughout the world to frighten its enemies from retaliating on its soil (this is also why they seek nuclear weapons), this caused this false sense of security which you and others may have had but you aren't safe because of its power, you are (or were) safe because Iran's shenanigans weren't significant enough to warrant said countries to smack you directly and risk escalations.
I am not really into conspiracy theories, but assuming Israeli Intelligence involvement isn't much of a stretch considering just their recent history of sabotaging the nuclear capabilities of unfriendly regimes in the region.
