In that there is no immunity to breaking the rules similar to what TFG attempted to get away with.
Security Clearances and rules for classified material are the governance of the Executive.
The Legislative can request (and will often be given clearance due to obvious oversight needs) but some sort of special select committee will probably not get along well with the WH.
But the Legislative needs to play entirely by the rules laid out by the executive, and will be punished if they try to leak and or abuse classified material.
If they want to dictate how, or what, it would require passing laws that the executive branch would have to follow.
That would be particularly hard given their position.
They may have to answer a subpoena, but it doesn't mean that Congress can dictate to them how and what to investigate.
Doesn't every part of the Executive Branch answer to congressional subpoenas?
Their only defense is Executive Privilege, but that doesn't apply when Biden is specifically not involved in the investigation.
Judges also don't have security clearances, and the Executive has broad discretion on what they see too.
Like if prosecuting the crime of mishandling classified information, the DOJ can only use evidence that they submit to the court, defense, and jury, but the defense and judge have no access to the other classified information not presented as evidence (even if it was sized together or otherwise "known").
This is much different from normal prosecutions where everything is available.
The relevant part is classification is owned by the Executive.
If a committee is compromised or asking for stuff they don't need to know, the agency invokes executive privilege and/or national security and shuts it down.
They can also set the procedures for seeing the requested information like in person briefing only without notes or records available for ongoing review.
