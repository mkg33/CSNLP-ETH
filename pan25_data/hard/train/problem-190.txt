Palestinian isn’t a religion and they warning about it because Christian’s are about the only people left in the Middle East who aren’t anti Israel and that can easily change.
This is East Jerusalem which isn't considered settlements; it's been Israeli land for decades where all non-Israeli residents were offered Israeli citizenship, and those who refused became residents.
Only decades later did the Palestinian Authority appear and has since tried to claim East Jerusalem as theirs.
And apparently the Orthodoxy has held this land for 500 years but Palestinians are still claiming it belongs to them?
They even protest settlements being built by Israel with land that has been sold to Israel by the Orthodoxy.
It's illegal to sell land to Jews in Palestine (punishable by death), so Jews have to buy property using shell companies pretending to be Arabs.
Then when the Jews want to move in, they raise a fuss.
If Israeli tried this with the mosque it would be an all out war.
They aren’t currently doing that and there’s no hypocrisy here.
Please learn what you’re talking about and realize Israeli Jews aren’t even allowed near the Temple Mount mosque, which would otherwise be their holiest site if they were allowed.
