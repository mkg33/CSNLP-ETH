Good thing the have been building artificial islands around it for years packed full of ASM’s and SAM’s.
They are unlikely to make the same mistakes the Russians did in Ukraine.
They have been anticipating our response.
There is a reason it’s an admiral saying this.
He knows Taiwan will be invaded and the Chinese have been building artificial islands around it for quite a while now to ensure that they have plenty of SAM’s and and anti ship missiles.
They already have their defensive measures in place for when they seize Taiwan.
He means an invasion into Taiwan.
That's been "the" conflict scenario being prepared for a long time in the USA's navy.
He's been conditioned to treat this as very real and imminent, which probably will help if it ever does happen, but it probably won't.
China got hella spooked by the comradery that Ukraine received both from other governments and private corporations/entities, in particular the ability for private firms to voluntarily withdraw their business slice and beyond government sanctions.
It's a facet of "free trade capitalism" that they didn't have on their radar, and they don't know how to surmount of they ever did attempt an invasion of Taiwan.
Then there's the whole western response to Ukraine, which has put the already limited chance of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan from unlikely to nearly impossible.
At the very least it's pushed it back decades, by which time the economic crisis of mass abandonment from economic sectors that has already started will actually hit, and we'll see some sort of internal shuffling and policy change with a very different China coming out the other end.
I couldn't tell you what those changes will be, but it'll probably be summer flavor of less totalitarian.
This is what happens to fascist states, even "mild" ones like PRC.
Basically, the only way they can win that engagement and sustain it is with nuclear arms, and this guy is convinced it will happen, when it probably won't.
