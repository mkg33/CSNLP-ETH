I've always viewed landlords the same way as ticket scalpers at events.
They swoop in and buy a bunch of homes.
They then mark up the price and act as the middle men that no one asked for while adding no value to the economy.
I agree with the college town example.
Moving to a new city, I'm currently renting until I find a suitable home.
It’s one thing to rent out the apartment above your multi family home you live in.
It’s quite another to buy up 30% of the local housing and then raise the rent 10% year over year driving all the locals out of town so you can sell the units at vastly inflated prices.
Depending on how steep those are, and if the proceeds are actually used to build more affordable housing, that could improve both rent and housing affordability.
Those capitalists/kleptocrats who benefit from the lack of economic democracy will also make political democracy a bit of a farce in order to preserve their power and privilege.
Under capitalism/kleptocracy, the ruling class makes most of the major economic decisions in society without any input from the workers.
Voting is important, but so are education, unionization, anti-corruption reforms, and building other forms of collective power and leverage with respect to the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class.
I'd encourage you to actually watch and read through the links I posted more carefully rather than assuming you already know or understand what they say.
Well-educated voters in a well-educated population are a big part of what's needed.
