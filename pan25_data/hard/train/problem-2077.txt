I certainly agree it's very grim.
But went them is China taunting the world so much with regular threats to start one over the smallest grievances.
But also ale they continue to take over island and attack other countries with lasers, chaff, soldiers with bats.
They seem to have a hard on for world war 3.
Sanctions could work but they would have to be catastrophic for both sides to have a chance.
Haven't seen evidence of any willingness to do that.
Doesn't work if the choice is a country dominating the world one nation at a time with the threat of nuclear war if anyone intervenes.
1) Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, really anybody - will use this nuclear blackmail strategy to get what they want.
We’d be in for a shit future.
5) Refugee crisis in Europe would only escalate as even more Ukrainians would flee Russian occupation.
Refugee crises would dramatically increase take place more often as more and more countries are entrenched with violence (Iran attacking Israel/Saudi Arabia with nuclear impunity, Russia attacking Kazakhstan/Belarus/Georgia, China attacking Taiwan, etc).
I got the joke lol.
My post wasn’t an attack or any slight towards you.
I just get nervous with more and more people casually labeling this as a proxy war.
Generally speaking, when someone uses the term “proxy war” it had a very negative US connotation.
