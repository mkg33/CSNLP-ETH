Plus, censoring stuff like this will only drive it underground, and like you said, it’s good to know how people feel about a subject.
As weird as it sounds, it you don’t keep things out in the open and let it fester underground instead, you’re more likely to get hit with.
Also, if you let it fester underground, it can grow.
It’s like the opposite of what we want.
Europe is also caught in their own case of resisting the rise of right-wing nationalism cropping up everywhere as a result of fear mongering and scapegoating that typically accompanies economic turmoil (with globalism and others being scapegoats).
Censorship lowkey goes hand in hand with isolationism imo.
Not going down the right path.
Between free speech and dealing with open homophobia and censorship that can restrict the freethinking needed to overcome that homophobia, I’ll take the former.
Advocating for banning certain political/religious opinions is spreading intolerance in a free society to make it less free.
Time for you to get banned, I guess.
