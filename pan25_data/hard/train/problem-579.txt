It's cute that actual opposition is just framed as "virtue signalling, though.
Like, actual opposition is impossible.
Edit: Seems simple enough: We should always oppose fascism.
There's no gray there.
"But what if a large majority / plurality / majority support fascism?"
Then we should always oppose them, too.
And, if you you can't really separate the christo- from the -fascism at this point?
If, when opposing fascism, large numbers of Christians say "Hey, they're talking about me?
".
Interesting point as well.
The starting point for my idea came from a history class I took on the German Peasants War, and the professor theorized that Capitalism/Fascism/Communism (all the modern governmental/economic systems) were formed by splits of ideology after the fall of feudalism and the invention of mass media with the printing press.
I don’t agree with all of his logic, but the way he formed the argument was that the peasant subgroups splintered, based primarily along religious lines, and the different sects of Christianity, along with Judaism, formed the cultural lines that would lead to today’s world.
Interesting also that many actual fascists considered the India/New Delhi/Pakistan/Nepal region to be the original “Aryans”.
