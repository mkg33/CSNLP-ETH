That is a rather peculiar phenomenon.
After the war nazism was widespread in these countries.
People were indoctrinated by the millions, it was impossible to change that in a short time.
You can not imprison half of the population and you can not reverse decades of forced propaganda.
So they simply banned being a nazi.
You could not say specific things.
So yes, it was a special case of reducing free speech.
Some people seem to think that freedom of speech shouldn’t protect speech that is offensive or controversial but that is basically the whole point of freedom of speech.
I mean those which are mocking/harsh, freedom of speech allows it and it’s good, but making a harsh and offensive caricature in the day of the tragedy deserves every bit of harsh backlash it gets.
And I am happy we have Free Speech so that we can be confronted with ideas that might initially offend us, but which might also have the power to change us.
And now, I learned that I was wrong.
I didn't understand the cartoon.
But having understood it, I have learned something.
