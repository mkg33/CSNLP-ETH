Trump is too much of a risk for the GOP to swallow though.
Yeah, those qualities appeal to his fanbase but the GOP wants long-term success and that won't happen if Trump ruins relationships with allies, makes reckless decisions, etc.
I'll be curious as to what happens.
I honestly think that if the GOP wants to remain somewhat competitive, they would back a more moderate conservative and abandon this whole far right candidate idea.
You can keep your "values" and appeal to the good old boys.
Otherwise, if they back DeSantis, I think Trump will run third party and split the party because he's a toddler and if he can't win, no-one can.
Well the GOP doesn't want Trump but much like the 2016 election, that doesn't matter at all.
If Trump runs for 2024, he will win the nomination, guaranteed.
The more I think about it, the more I feel like if Trump is still alive and not in jail come 2024, he's going to be the nominee.
Republicans still don't get what makes Trump work.
He's not an ardent ideologue.
He doesn't give a shit about the alt-right, conservatives at large or anything they believe in.
The alt-right conforms to Trump.
Trump could shit on DeSantis all day for things that the alt-right have been demanding, and the justifications will arise to side with Trump.
Trump is going to make up a nickname for DeSantis based on something DeSantis thought would have been a strenh.
Probably the Disney thing when Florida ends up getting that $2b debt despite DeSantis promising that won't happen.
Why?
Hasn't worked out for three election cycles now with far right people plowing through the primaries.
Don't see why it would be any different come 2024.
But the biggest thing is no one wants a fake when they could have the real thing.
"Trump without the baggage" is talking head bullshit.
The baggage is the point.
The rage is the point.
