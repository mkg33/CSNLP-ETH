The issue with f-16 isn't just training pilots (thought that is another issue) but maintaince and repair for the jets, it isn't something that can be learned within a few months and could take a few years with working experience on them before you could effectively work on them especially in a war zone where getting the parts you need could be hard due to logistics.
It depends, Ukraine needs their engineers working on their equipment during the war so they won't have many to send to other countries where they might need to stay for a couple of years learning a jet, I say couple of years because these jets are extremely complex and Ukraine have no experience with that line of jets, this also includes sending pilots to train on the systems as well.
So depends if they have people in training or not, I think jets are a line what is going to be extremely hard to cross due to amount of things what need to be done, but if they do it Ukraine will be in a very strong position.
I think they just wanna prioritize defense right now and armored vehicles are very helpful towards that whereas jets require a lot of maintenance and care that Ukraine canâ€™t be bothered too much with at the moment since a russian offensive is still likely.
Surely the risk vs reward of using jets in Ukraine is seriously negligible anyway whether you are Russian or Ukrainian, the sheer amounts of precision SAMs that is present in Ukraine surely lends it to being more of a drone/artillery war?
If Ukraine wins/survives I can see the Ukrainian army becoming more west aligned with it's weaponry, so that there isn't need to retrain soldiers/operators/pilots if another war/invasion breaks out, making supply lines much simpler.
Definately will be, you just have to question if it's the best use of resource to take pilots out of service and train them on a platform that they don't have and can not maintain, while the war does not seem remotely close to being over.
