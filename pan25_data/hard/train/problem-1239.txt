The difference is that the Pandemic was over the course of years, whereas this is a single massive event that has demolished areas, destroyed infrastructure, displaced people and disrupted government services.
That said the election's not for 5 months so its hard not to see this as opportunism on Erdogan's part, given his authoritarian leanings.
Yeah about that, Erdogan and his underlings are working hard right now, to delay or possibly even cancel the upcoming election since 'the people are in distress and cannot vote rationally'.
Pulling off this trick will be difficult, Erdogan is short on time, and any corruption that siphons off cash and benefits destined to go towards bribing the populist vote would be game-ending for Erdogan.
In short, he has to pull off a major governmental-led effort of recovery in a way that was efficient and free of corruption.
But dont underestimate Erdogan by comparing him to Trump -- Erdogan is a shrewd man and master politician capable of winning an election, fair and square.
Yes I am working with the assumption that anyone who gave up his turkish citizenship for the german one is better integrated in german society and would rather lean to a more libertarian, social and secular candidate then ErdoÄŸan.
That means supporters are at max 12,5%-25% of whole turkish population in germany, which is still insanely high for a uneducated islamist candidate, but well within general average of rural turkey.
