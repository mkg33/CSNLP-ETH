Its also due in no small part to defense contractors and DoD pushing that "near peer" bullshit to get Americans to support new procurement programs and a high readiness posture.
I'm mainly in the space sector.
And everything you just said about overwhelming our enemies is already true without those proposed weapon systems.
Do you really think the Russians or the Chinese can stand up to an F-35, B-2, or EA-18G?
The thing is, the nukes are always a frightening prospect, and Russia has them.
So no matter how shit their military might is, it's hard to imagine ever neutralising them as a threat because of those nuclear weapons.
Yup everyone forgets that the bigger threat the the nukes was the USSR invading alongside the US.
Then for sure the country would be split in two because you would be surrendering to both.
Germany thought that the USSR would fall apart within 3 to 6 months of war.
They obviously didn't happen so after their initial gains they didn't have any good plans.
They didn't just win by having a large population.
To preparation for the war they transported factories further east to be safe in-case of invasion.
They then burnt crops and factories when the invading armies arrived.
