To expand on some of the other answers here, the Russians use Latin Characters (So A, B, C, etc., like our English alphabet) to designate their various taskforces.
(US Armed Forces do similar things with Greek characters Alpha Squad, Delta Force etc.)
(edit: As pointed out in further comments, the naming is a little more complicated than I was originally led to believe.
The simple version is there isn't a 100% for sure reason Z was used but it may stand for "zapad", West in Russian.
So the Western Taskforce.)
The taskforce for the "wargame" that was being run in late '21 and was the initial push during the invasion was the Z taskforce.
So as mentioned elsewhere, all the armored vehicles had large Z's painted on them and the letter ended up being a coopted into Russian propaganda about the invasion.
So the flip of that is when people are talking about Russia in general, but particular pro-invasion, pro-Putin Russians, they sub in the zz's as an insult/distinction.
Outside of z symbol,they also hav e actual nazi tendencies like "Ukrainians are just confused Russians, and we will kill any Ukrainian who disagrees with being Russian".
Because the Z became their symbol of their war against Ukraine and the western world, and many idiots even paint it on their own cars, and act quite fascist generally, we use the double-z as an insult and as a comparison to the former nazi SS = "ruzzia" or "ruZZia".
"Terrorussia" also works fine, also "rushists" as a comparison to "fashist/fascist".
