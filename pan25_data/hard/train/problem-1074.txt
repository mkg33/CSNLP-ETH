And I suspect its because Black people overwhelmingly break for Democrats.
Where a white conservative person would typically vote for a Republican, the Black Conservative person may STILL vote Democrat due to the rampant racism apparent in the Republican party.
Either way, the reality is that the Republicans could pick up more votes by shifting to oppose racism but favor religious discrimination more highly.
If Republican’s were not openly racist at least 1/2 of African Americans would vote for them.
But Republicans would lose 2/3’s of whites who would start voting by class, so Republican’s cultivate and maintain racist values in the party.
This is why it’s unsurprising that the democrats are losing black voters to the GOP (although not a lot overall) at a faster and faster rate as the GOP reverts to LGBT issues as their primary wedge issue.
Black communities overall are conservative and religious.
The only reason they vote Democrat largely is because of the fact that the GOP is full of out and proud racists.
That’s it.
If the GOP dropped racism from their platform, a large section of the black community would vote GOP within 10 years.
