A S-300 was found at the scene (), but it's a missile that both Ukraine and Russia use.
It's also a missile that the vast majority have been made in Russia/Soviet Union (hence the Polish Foreign Ministry's "Russian-made").
Russia's been repurposing them as ground attack missiles (seen in Kharkiv - ) and Ukraine has been shooting Russian strikes down with S-300s as well.
Odd possibility is the first one was a Russian cruise missile and the second was a Ukrainian S-300 that was trying to catch it.
Well it is either a Russian missile that went off course or it is a Ukrainian missile used to shoot down the Russian missile.
The polish have a radar base nearby so they likely tracked the whole thing and know where the missile originated from.
Will wait to see how this turns out before jumping to any conclusions.
Article 4 will likely be triggered and the Polish will reveal to NATO members exactly what happened as they already know.
I also completely believe that Putin would intentionally fire just over NATO boarders to test the response.
