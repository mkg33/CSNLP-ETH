The state legislature part is something I’d hoped they’d address.
I’m not sure how things’ll play out regarding the SCOTUS on the state legislature theory, but this is a start.
Sinema in fact is playing some weird game of stymieing and hampering the democractic legislative agenda so not sure why you'd say that.
Nah, listening to the oral arguments o don't see them going all in on that insane theory.
I think they'll just use this to expand the federal judiciary's ability to step in if they don't like what's happening with a federal election.
We haven't seen how this story ends yet.
If this is still the case in '25, you might be onto something but I think that '23 will be a bad year for Trump and many of his lackeys.
2016-2020 he was president and nearly broke our democracy.
these last two years he's not and the DOJ and various states are gunning for him.
Our democracy still hasn't healed and it definitely isn't going to be repaired until he is held to account.
what evidence you have of that?
Sinema and Manchin have long been on the record against filibuster reform, you think Schumer just snaps his fingers and they flip?
