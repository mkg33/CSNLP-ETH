They arent trying.
Why the fuck does the COP meetings allow a wing of 600 oil and coal lobbyists to go there.
You can have industry experts who are not lobbists.
Have COP have a wing of 600 climate scientists who are not on the payroll of OPEC and friends.
That way you get actual science based answers to questions on things like how fast can we move to better forms of energy.
Your definition of expert here is "if they don't work in the industry, they don't count".
At that point, lets let Chevron write our energy policy.
I'm not suggesting Chevron write oil policy, either.
These politicians, are they so unscrupulous that you can't trust them being in the same room as the lobbyists during the conference?
What happens in places that aren't the conference?
I've not suggested that industry leaders are the only form of expertise, but nice fetish, I guess.
I'm just saying the people doing the multi billion dollar projects, yeah, might be nice to hear from them about this stuff, seems like they might be able to illuminate some things to some people.
Yeesh.
You damn justice warriors should chill your persecution complexes and try to be objective once in a while...
