I would agree with that, with the exception that corps are still acting immorally.
Yes, theyre encouraged to do so by the system, in fact being legally required in some circumstances, but theyre still choosing to be immoral bastards, and while the system is to blame, dont let them off the hook because their cruelty helped out the shareholders.
These fucking companies warp our laws, ruin our kids future, manipulate our media, pay off our politicians and wal away with earning everything and contributing nothing.
These fucking companies pay no tax, get massive subsidies to offset infrastructure, lobby against clean competitors to cement their destruction of the planet, are responsible for massive atmospheric, biodiversity and heritage damage.
Worse when you realise that these absolute fucking cunts turned massive profits, again, this time $20BILLION, last QUARTER.
And these fucking companies boast net profits, year on year, of billions.
Indecent profits in each geographic profit centre.
With minor aberrations.
