I actually think that's an interesting question.
It's possible to trademark very common words, you can probably trademark very common symbols as well in the right context.
I mean for what it's worth the answer is almost certainly "yes" just like you can trademark words like "Apple" and "Windows".
It's just that a trademark has to be for a specific purpose.
If he wanted to release Rigged Election Brand Steaks or open the Rigged Election Casino he could absolutely use trademark law to stop people also marketing their own knock-off steaks and casinos under that name.
If that was a thing he was concerned people would want to do.
Yes he could try to sue for that reason.
He could try to sue anybody for any reason.
But there'd be no actual legal basis for it.
Nothing about that stops anybody saying elections are rigged at a rally, or saying their election was rigged.
Then any other GOPer who wanted to claim their election was rigged could never say so in a rally-like setting without first paying Trump for rights to the slogan.
And he could even probably sue them if they said on TV that their election was rigged, because he could make some connection between a TV appearance and a rally.
