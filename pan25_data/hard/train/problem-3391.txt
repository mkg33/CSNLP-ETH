You have to understand a lot of people gave him and the process the benefit of the doubt in 2016 and his tenure as president did away with any scope for doubt for a lot of people.
Imagine the absolute crap they could run under "Is this the real reason Democrats dumped Joe...chatter is, anonymous sources suggest, many are speculating" alone.
You can insert any scandalous thing you feel like into that format again and again and again on the premise there's no way a party would just dump an incumbent president if there wasn't something huge they were worried would come out.
FFS.
My first comment in this thread "He'll lose.
And before you ask, no I didn't say that in 2016 and actually refused to watch the electoral results come in because I was so anxious he'd win.
".
Wow.
Thank you for the 500 word essay on over analyzing a Reddit comment.
I completely understand the benefits of incumbency but thank you for assuming I do not.
Literally the only take away from my comment was donâ€™t get complacent and not everyone thinks Biden is doing as great as the press makes it sound.
He is still 100% better than the entire Republican Party but there are other options.
