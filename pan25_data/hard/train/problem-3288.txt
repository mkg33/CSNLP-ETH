... And then he goes and has no issues in supporting Israel due to its race, religion and political views.
Basically, it comes down to the Israel-Palestine issue, and all the problems therein.
Some Zionists readily move to equate criticizing Israel as being antisemitic, but that's a false equivalency.
They can be, but usually when I see someone winning whining about being called anti-semitic for "criticizing Israel" it's because they have in fact been being grossly anti-semitic.
The "you can't critize Israel without being called anti-semitic!"
line is the typical defense of left wing Anti-semites.
This is why you get accused of antisemitism.
This is not an article about Israel, why should we be talking about it in this thread?
This is true, but what do you call it when you cannot call out Israel for how it’s treating Palestinians?
Chances are I’ll get banned here for advocating for violence or some crap when all I’m mentioning are Israeli atrocities but whatever.
That's true, but we also shouldn't let this get in the way of legitimate discourse about Israel's policies.
EDIT: The reason antisemites bring up Israel in every thread about American Jews is because they can't stand the narrative that some Jews are victims.
But innocents on both sides are being caught in between here, and in this aspect Israel is found wanting, especially towards the treatment of the Palestinian population.
Antisemites can't resist bringing up iSrAeL in threads about American Jews, despite American Jews having no say in Israeli politics.
They do it because they can't stand Jews being viewed as victims and want to shift the narrative to Jews as aggressors and therefore deserving of hate.
