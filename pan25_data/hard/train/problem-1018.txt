Nobody in Russia is buying cars because they about doubled in price and only the middle class could afford them to begin with and that's the class of people that most of the emigrees are from and the ones that stayed are just sitting around thinking the whole thing will blow over in 2 to 3 years and go back to normal in time for them to need a new car.
So Putin now has the old Soviet choice: Let the market drive up prices so cars are only affordable to the rich, or enact a price control so a lot of people can afford a car but will have to wait years to get one.
And that money can no longer buy you a car... because all the guys who used to build cars are now dying in Ukraine.
Russian car production is down about half since start of the war, in part due to sanctions affecting their supply of parts and tools and in part due to mobilisation.
Yeah I also don't think that he's "trying" to reconstruct the system.
He's just naturally falling back to it because they're internationally isolated enough that they basically have to run a war economy.
They have to increasingly dictate prices to keep things running, and assume direct command over the distribution of raw resources and important tools rather than "letting the market handle it".
