I'm sure if a janitor at the drone factory broke his toe the Iranians would say something like 'high ranking Iranian logistics commander greviously wounded!'
or somesuch.
Well yeah.
On one hand they probably love a chance to fuck with Iran, on the other hand, they probably wouldn't be doing this if they hadn't been criticized for lack of action.
You know, as much as the west likes to pretend Iran is some kind of existential threat to world peace, this reaction is all you really need to know to see it isn't true.
Israel, quite calmly and openly just attacked multiple sites in their country, and Iran has no response but to make some vague threats about possible reprisals.
The only reason the US and Israel feel confident about attacking Iran like this is because they know Iran can't respond.
Iran has been sanctioned, military sites attacked, scientists killed, and they've had virtually no response for decades because they just don't have any ability to hurt Israel or the United States.
But when it comes to the moral high ground in an Iranian-Israeli conflict specifically, in my mind Iran has even less - not least because Israel didn't really do anything to Iran to instigate Iran's hated of it other than just being a Jewish state trying to exist in the middle east.
Idk if there's a more specific reason than this but the Iranian government does constantly threaten to destroy Israel entirely, so it's not as though Israel is entirely devoid of justification when it comes to Iran.
It also just so happens that people don't like the Iranian government more than usual right now cos they're being shitheads to their own people and supporting Russia against Ukraine.
