The only enforcement mechanism for Medicaid rights violations is patients suing for having their rights violated or the Feds taking away funding.
I am not familiar with Medicare or how plaintiffs are trying to enforce their rights, but if they are relying on claims that they simply have been denied a benefit of Medicare (which based on this article is sounds like they are), rather than language in the statute giving clear authority by Congress to create a right to take action, this could be a huge case.
There is a concept of an "implied cause of action," but it can be a steep hill to claim with statutes where the Federal government hands over funds to the state who are giving authority to take action in enforcing it---it suggests Congress didn't intend a private right but rather that the State would take action.
The author passes over the Armstrong case too quickly.
The following is a gross over simplification:
Edit: the 7th Circuit decision which was appealed is with a read for those of you who went a more fleshed out respone:
An example is FERPA.
It protects students, but the enforcement mechanism is from the state withholding funds to the violating organization.
The statute needs to have very clear 'rights creating language.'
Title VI, and other Civil Right Act statutes are good example as they clearly and simply say what that right it.
