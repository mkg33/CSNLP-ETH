There is a reason it took the invocation of the EA to end the convoy.
Because the police didn't want to have to enforce the law on their family, friends and co-workers.
Even when the EA was enforced the clownvoy was given 24 hours notice to vacate and told when the police were coming.
Of course, now during the hearings on the convoy, it is coming out that police at all levels were in contact with convoy leaders, giving them intelligence on police actions so they could respond to them.
That is a joke.
It is rather amusing.
If the other commenters are anything like my IRL friend group, I suspect many of those against the truckers have used some sort of rhetoric in the past that supported the working class rising up in a general strike.
Similarly, I keep seeing the term "violent" used, but to the best of my knowledge, there wasn't any real violence - just a lot of air horns at all hours.
Seems kind of double standardy when the same crowd seemingly gave the 2020 riots (and I am specifically meaning the riots, not the daytime protests) a pass even though there were people that died.
Edit: I should mention I am not a Canadian, so there very well could be aspects of Honkageddon I am not aware of.
