You'd think all the claims Ukraine made about destroying most of the Russian artillery would mean there'd be a lot less destruction in Ukrainian cities but maybe Ukraine was just saying those things to boost their soldiers' morale.
Reading the headline brought about thoughts of Russian troops attacking buildings with blunt weapons, which honestly isn't that far from reality after reading about how badly equipped they are.
in Russian society it's simply consensus reality that there are neo-Nazi irregular troops in Ukraine, who have been bombing civilians for years, and they're getting their weapons from NATO (now indirectly, since Congress banned sale of weapons to them).
How much NATO condones or even orders those attacks is up for debate, but yes, a Russian would totally agree that if you let terrorists have missiles they will bomb civilians.
Depending on how truthful it is (I doubt it's 100% lies, there's people with family members in Donetsk).
And just to be clear, I'm not a sociopath.
I just play one online.
The indiscriminate bombing of a civilian building, even if there were a few military troops inside, is an atrocity and whoever is responsible should be brought to justice.
No, you're not getting it.
Read the comment I'm replying to again.
Better to get it on your own than have it explained to you.
But if you insist.
