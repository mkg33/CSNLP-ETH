Being neutral also avoid stupidities like joining a warmonger nation into invading Afghanistan and Iraq, ask the Brits how much they enjoy having sent their youth to die for American lies .
Or maybe people here in Sweden just don't like wars and shit and it's worked for 200+ years, even during WW2?
...but Sweden wasn't neutral if they supported the Allies with all the examples you gave.
So stop saying they were neutral.
Helped Allies, did not help Nazis.
How is that Neutral to you?
Or anyone?
If they did what you just said, then I guess they HAVE NOT remained neutral for 200 years.
I'm guessing they didn't help the Nazis like they did the Allies.
That isn't neutral.
It's supporting one side of the war without officially declaring war.
There's no ignorance here and you can't win the argument now.
You just lost it.
Now scram....
Nobody likes wars.
People do like other people defending themselves so they don't have to do it themselves.
Nobody likes war.
It worked for 200 years while you did things like "not helping in WW2 to fight Hitler as he exterminated millions of people.
Yup...it has worked for 200 years-for Sweden.
Selfish.
Can't fight for what's right when the situations happen.
Do ya know what-stay neutral buddy...just learn how to speak Russian.
You're going to want to do that.
Mr.
Neutral .
"Neutral'.....In this case, it means they don't know right from wrong, or don't want to be inconvenienced.
They are too scared to stand up for what's just and good, because it may throw off their way of living.
I say tell'em to pound salt.
