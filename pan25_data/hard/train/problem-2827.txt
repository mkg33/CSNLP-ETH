It's a constitutional amendment, that means what it says: Oregonians are entitled to affordable, cost effective and appropriate healthcare.
The details about how that will be achieved as well as the interpretation of that will be a matter of legal debate and legislation going forward, but Oregonians are now constitutionally entitled to "affordable" healthcare.
And they are the first state in the nation to make healthcare a right.
If people want to buy guns there will be demand for classes, and if there is demand for classes then the market will create supply over time.
Mandatory safety training is something that responsible gun owners should be glad about.
There are no police anything setup for firearm approvals.
This will take at least a year to get setup which means the people of Oregon will no be able to buy 2A firearms.
This is an attack on the 2A and if you cant see past the lies youre basically a shell.
If the intent was to instill firearms training courses before selling you a gun then then Constitution should be ammended.
This is BS and Im surprised Oregon fell for this BS.
Background checks are already a thing nationwide, it’s dumb for Oregon to be like “oh yea, me too!”.
3 day waiting period as well, already in place.
