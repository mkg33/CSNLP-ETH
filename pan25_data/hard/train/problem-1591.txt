So by me choosing not to align as a Democrat then I must be a Republican?
What kind of ass backward logic is that?
I am a moderate and I'll vote for whichever candidate reflects my values most.
Sometimes that is a Democrat and sometimes that is a Republican.
I would agree that the only right choice at the state and national level are Democrats.
Local politicians I had two Republicans I backed for council positions.
I literally just told you I voted for two Republicans in my local election today.
If Romney ran for president again I'd also vote for him again.
Happy?
Don't even look at it tonight.
It'll look like the GOP ran away with it but early and mail in votes won't be counted until after midnight so the numbers will be massively skewed before those actually get counted.
Read the article- Mailed-in ballots take longer to count, donâ€™t always arrive at election offices before Election Day, and often are put at the back of the line.
The idea of accepting mail ballots after election day is an unnecessary delay IMO.
If it's within a week of the election, just use a drop box - you had weeks to mail it if that was important to you.
And thus back to my point of results taking a week is due to piss poor election management by some states in the modern era.
That's why it's dumb to encourage people to use mail during the last week of the election.
Colorado makes it extremely clear that November 1st is the last day to safely mail your ballot and that you need to use a drop box after that.
