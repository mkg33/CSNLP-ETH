It isn't per se to be a winning message, but it allow them to 'both sides' it, because they basically accuse Biden of everything that could also be charged against Trump in the near future.
And secondly, once they wrap up their 'investigation', they can refer charges to the DOJ (who will probs ignore it).
And then they will claim it proofs the political prosecution about any charges against Trump.
And that just Trump and his children.
That list could be extended to many many GOP politicians and indeed also (some) Dem's too.
And that means just to hurt Biden and/or prevent the fallout damage from Trump losing the NY cases about fraud very hard, in addition to the documents scandal etc.
So at the moment, this seems like just a Benghazi 2.0 (or should that be 10.0 because god knows how many they've done on that).
This sounds a bit too much like Benghazi all over again, grasping at straws to find something, anything, to investigate.
If there's anything monetary to be investigated, how about looking into how much money Ivanka and Jared made from foreign business deals while they were actually employed in the White House?
Or the legality of the GOP and Secret Service being billed through the nose by the President's businesses?
