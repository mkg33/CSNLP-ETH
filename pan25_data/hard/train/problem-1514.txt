Except for fighting both China and NK we would concentrate on China and NK would be more of an annoyance.
Kinda like ww2, the us was putting the majority of manpower and war materials in to the European front and most of the pacific war was the us swatting at N annoying bug.
SK has F-35As.
B is the variant for vertical takoff and landing for forces like the us marines.
C is the variant for the navy witch is reenforced landing gear for catpult launching and a tailhook for landing.
Depending on what happened to the SK aircraft it could just be bad luck.
Hell a few years ago in Belgium a mechanic accidentally trigged the gun on one f16 and destroyed one parked nearby.
And if you're in aviation circles which I am to an extremely small degree you will hear with some frequency of military aircraft haveing issues.
I guess you’ve missed the news over the years of drones flying over sensitive us installations without knowing who was flying them.
Just because we are starting to take them seriously does not mean we have a lot of anti drone infrastructure and procedures in place.
Since when did anyone think NK couldn’t kill civilians in SK?
We all know this.
We also know the response to NK would be absolutely devastating for North Korea.
What point are you trying to make?
