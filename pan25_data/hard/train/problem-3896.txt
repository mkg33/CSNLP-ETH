Corporate Democrats and Republicans joined hands to fuck them over.
Biden allowed his party to fuck the little guy in the name of maintaining Warren Buffet’s record profits.
Want to know what a class war looks like?
This is what a class war looks like.
When neoliberals and neofascists can agree to put aside their “culture war differences” to do the bidding of the ultra rich.
Where they can agree wholeheartedly that working class should not be allowed even a few days of unpaid sick leave, for fear of the precedent that it may set in the labor force.
huh, maybe they shouldn't have voted to make striking illegal, perhaps give the workers leverage to actually get the sick leave they want rather than give the Republicans another W.
I mean the thing I'm pissed about more than anything is making it illegal for workers to strike, which was the 80-15 bill voted by an overwhelming amount of Democrats.
Dems voted to fuck the workers and separated the bill, knowing it wouldn't pass, to give themselves covers because it somehow convinces dipshits like you that don't understand the political process.
Of course none of this is possible unless the Republican party up and fucking dies, at least in national politics, because they will never support reforms and can step into party divisions to cleave off supporters in a first-past-the-post system.
The solution is electoral reform, but in order to get electoral reform progressives either need to win or convince centrists to vote for it.
It's a sucky catch 22.
The sad part is that the Labor unions probably won't be able to reasonable challenge this for six years, although they may be able to sneak something in depending on how 2024 goes.
Given that Biden will be running for the Democrats in 2024 and is going in with a huge advantage, we'll likely see a centrist democrat party until 2028.
