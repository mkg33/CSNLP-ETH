'In related news, the former president said earlier this week that, as president, he was right to trust Putin more than the “lowlifes” at the FBI.'
Lol, dude would give ukraine to putler in 24 hrs if he could.
That's how to him ending the war would be so quick.
It's very black and white.
And if you can't understand it, maybe read up on what russia did to polish people and ukrainians.
Fuck off, do you understand what living under russia is like?
Corruption etc but ukraine was fighting it and wanted out of russia, just like what poland did.
Russia is indeed very corrupt but so is Ukraine.
Ukrainian politicians even bought mansions and spent fortunes on personal luxuries after American aid money was sent to them.
The insult wasn’t necessary.
I specifically pointed out how Putin isn’t a good guy either.
I’m merely saying it’s a grey war, it isn’t so black and white as people believe.
No, an insult only shows you’re hateful of those with different views, and instead of discussing reasonably, you’d rather push people away from your own ideals by vilifying.
Remember the media doesn’t always tell the truth.
Putin isn’t a good guy but neither is Zelensky, however public opinion of Zelensky is incredibly high because of the media.
Ukraine is one of the most corrupt nations in the world before the war.
And going by your logic, how corrupt is russia?
Much more than ukraine and they're not changing and haven't even tried to change.
Just because ukraine that is still under so much of russia's past, doesn't mean they don't want to change.
