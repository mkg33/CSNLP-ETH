Because you tell this stuff to the public and it helps keep your real agenda and operations secret.
Nothing better than putting your own equipment in small quantities up against a “peer” in a real theatre of war without risking your own troops first of all as a litmus test.
Anyone else get the impression there is more to this.
This feels as though this is NATO indirectly lining up their equipment against the Russians to see what the Russians actually have.
No better way to gage whether peer to peer conflict is feasible for NATO against Russia.
And the last thing NATO wants is peer to peer conflict.
Stopping the Russians here is to make sure they don't continue on to Poland or Estonia - actual NATO members.
I have been extremely critical of all NATO countries for their hesitancy in sending the weapons that Ukraine needs.
Unfortunately for Ukraine it is necessary to try and prevent worse.
The choice of Russia to again try to genocide Ukraine was so very pointless and stupid, just to fuel ego and tickle the Nationalism spot.
