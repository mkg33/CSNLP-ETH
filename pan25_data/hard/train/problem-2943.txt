So you think that whether someone has money, not their crimes, criminal history, and flight risk, should determine whether they're free pending trial?
Some violent psycho with money is free to go, but shoplift and you should spend a year in prison and have your life destroyed when it's normally a probation offense, simply for lack of money?
Also, why is crime up everywhere regardless of whether they have a progressive DA (what I assume you mean) and/or bail reform?
You realize not everywhere has those right?
Why is crime worse in red states with harsher policies?
I cannot speak for red states since I have not studied their crime trends.
I can speak for LA and SF.
It is well established that homeless people can steal up to $950 in merchandise from a store and the AG will not hold them on bail.
Thefts and burglary are thru the ceiling as a result.
There are basically no repercussions for stealing right now.
Also itâ€™s not just homeless people stealing from stores.
There are crime rings hitting luxury stores, and they arent being prosecuted aggressively to deter it.
