America can never thank Nancy enough for ALL of the work she has done for the good of the working people in this country She has been an amazing asset for the Democratic party and hopefully the next generation of leaders that succeed her and others who are stepping down (Clyburn, Hoyer, etc...) will seek her guidance to carry on with the massive framework she has created over the years.
My favorite single remembrance of her will always be standing behind Trump and tearing up her copy of one of his State of the Union speeches, on camera, live for all the world to see.
Nancy is fearless and has balls like no one else.
She is fearless.
I loved her “applauding” Trump’s idiocy to his face, to the cameras, to the nation.
All said with not one derogatory remark.
That was class.
Surely you jest.
Have you not seen the pushback by the Republican Party?
I will be very surprised if they put him forward.
The midterms very much humbled them.
I also would not be very surprised if Trump, as a result of not being selected by the Republicans, creates his own little party.
But the flipside was a political cartoon that I saw that showed that close to 50% of people STILL voted for election deniers.
That is very sobering.
Who was it the other night who said in 2016 if Trump became president there would be rioting?
Perhaps on Colbert when Michelle Obama was on?
I can’t remember.
But somebody clearly predicted it during the debates with Trump in 2016.
Help me out, folks.
