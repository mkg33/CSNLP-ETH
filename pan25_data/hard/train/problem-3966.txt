Thankfully we never got into a real fight like that.
Hopefully never will.
Most likely a response would require confirmation from multiple sources of undeniable intention of the enemy to inflict crippling damage (i.e.
nukes are many, clearly flying towards strategic targets, and the leader of the opposing state is not on the phone saying it’s a mistake - no, it’s not sarcasm, that’s what direct lines are for).
It will sure have HUGE political consequences but not the immediate doomsday.
That, and most countries have very strict protocols of what nukes can be used for, essentially only allowing their launch in the event of a similarly dangerous event already underway.
That’s not something exactly easy to miss.
For Russia specifically, the alleged Dead Man Hand also requires a command from the Kremlin NOT to launch the missiles should it register multiple disturbances consistent with nuclear strikes.
Russia doesn't dare launch any of their rusting land-based missiles as decades of corruption and lack of maintenance has led to the risk of the missiles failing to achieve flight and landing on Russian territory, and likely in a fully armed state because, Russia be dumb.
