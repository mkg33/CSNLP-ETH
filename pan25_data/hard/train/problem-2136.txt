It's pretty hard to tell the difference these days.
I appreciate you not shooting the messenger but the reality is that anything you read in the papers, on the internet, or watch on the news, has been altered to fit the direction and views of the association they represent.
That or they are so small that it is hard to respect their article as anything other than opinion because of the lack of credibility that not being with a known publication brings.
So, enlighten me.
If I want to find a reliable source for information in the media, where should I be looking and why should I trust their articles?
Considering the damage they do to the world on a regular basis, only telling half truth or outright lying in order to sell subscriptions, I have zero sympathy for anyone in the media.
No one who actually reads these sources on a regular basis forms the opinion that they're altering their reportingâ€”because they crank out hundreds of factual news stories every fucking day, and they lose their fucking jobs if they get it wrong.
I'm not talking about the Opinion pages, so don't start with that.
Bias exists everywhere, and there are plenty of sites (like ) that now exist to evaluate bias at various outlets.
If you can't be bothered to think critically and instead just spout off this anti-journalist, borderline fascist propaganda that "the papers are all lying to you," then I have no faith you're actually willing to read it and learn.
You're confusing pundits and propagandists with actual journalists, but that's not really surprising, considering how easy it is to fall down that hole.
