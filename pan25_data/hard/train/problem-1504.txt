Based on projects I've worked on (I'm an environmental chemist), the solution will probably involve digging up contaminated soil and dredging nearby river sediment, then monitoring water quality for a couple decades.
I'm not sure about that, most of the water treatment I've focused on is related to industrial water purification.
Keep in mind that your consumption of PFAS through drinking water is only one of many exposure routes - they're found in a lot of food packaging and fabrics which are ubiquitous in our lives.
Water quality standards are quite rigorous and you can check your state's website for limits and exceedances in your municipal water supply.
Oh absolutely, water issues are a huge longer term concern, it's just a matter of timescale and point source control with respect to contaminant migration.
Generally speaking it's ground and water contamination that is the concern.

You can evac a town easier than you can dig up a town or stop a river from flowing or import water for the next 500 years.
