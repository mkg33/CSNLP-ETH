But it matches up.
100 years before ww1 you had Napoleon running across Europe and Russia, and before that you had the French and English nigh constant bickering, before that the Swedish...
If by that you mean the Armenian Genocide by the Ottomans being repeated by Erdogan against the Kurdish, yeah.
So it would be quite weird for Erdogan to have turned into a Turkish nationalist and decided to genocide kurds in random countries all of a sudden.
Of course there is also a more islamist portion of nationalists but they are more aligned with Erdogan and seem to be in the minority these days.
I agree Erdogan PROBABLY isn't personally racist to Kurds and (20 years ago) did a lot to advance Kurds' position in society.
That doesnt change the fact that Turkey has historically tried to erase Kurdish identity, and right now Erdogan is in a coalition with MHP—many of whom believe in the same interpretation of Kemalism that has and continues to lead to actions against Kurds and their culture.
You can't tell me MHP aren't overtly racist as fuck to Kurds, or I'll assume you've never heard Bahçeli open his mouth.
