I just hope China learns that flattening neighboring regions is not the way to integrate with them.
Around 2008 - 2010 it really looked like China was going to integrate with the world and be brought 'into the fold'.
Xi got into power and he had spent time living in the US during his college days.
But then China fell back into their old ways.
The legitimacy of the CCP is based on improving the lives of their people.
That party is over and I don't think the CCP will survive past 2030.
By 2030 they will have more retired persons than workers.
The leaders of China can read demographic tables as well as anyone else so they knew what was coming.
China had a very advantageous demographic for decades.
Everything went well for them and made them look like geniuses.
Now those demographic has reversed and things are beginning to go wrong everywhere.
They will not be successful in reversing the trend.
It's a myth that China plays "the long game".
The longest they have had a continuous government is 75 years (now).
What happened over the last 40 years is they had advantageous demographics with 4 workers for every retired person.
They brought farmers in from the rural areas as workers and that bought them another 15 years.
They did everything quickly because they were in a race to expand and try to create a domestic consumer economy.
They were unsuccessful.
