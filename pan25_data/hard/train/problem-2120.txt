I hope this is all tongue-in-cheek because all this "limit people from doing things and access to the internet because I don't like their ideas" stuff is pretty wild to me.
(For the record I'd probably be considered further left than your average liberal in conventional parlay.

They believe this will work because Democrats already allow Republicans to "cheat" so much.
Clinton won the popular vote, and Trump took office; do you think if the situation were reversed and Trump won the popular vote by three million votes and Hillary took office the Republicans would accept it?
Also gerrymandering, voter purges, cases to throw out drive-through voting, voter ID requirements, closing ID stations, closing polling places, limiting voting hours, etc.
Republicans know Democrats are used to getting screwed over in elections.
Why not just screw over Democrats a little bit more by not allowing any of their candidates to take office?
They simply can’t imagine people voting on policy, and decorum, over “who gets the most attention, they deserve to win!”.
The whole “how can biden win, he doesn’t even have huge rally’s and flags etc” sentiment is so telling.
These people can’t even fathom, how someone can win without a cult following, without merch and without fanboy rallies and religious tier conventions surrounding these candidates.
This is exactly why all these candidates lost, and the GOP audibly knows it.
Now these people are doubling down on the shit that made them lose in the first place?
Do you remember any other president having a themed hat?
One that has basically become a symbol of right wing aggression/malice?
It’s a modern day klan hood, albeit with less horrible connotations but it’s still a symbol of fandom for Fascism.
