I understand your sentiment but this is also some “I don’t see color” kind of nonsense.
The republicans are breaking the law.
It’s not everyone.
It’s the republicans.
This is a story about a Republicans corruption.
Again, what do Dems have to do with anything?
I’m not saying Dems can’t be a corrupt, but this isn’t a story about that - save those comments for THAT article because they’re completely unrelated to this one….
Once again, no the article is NOT about political corruption across all political parties in general.
That is factually incorrect and the fact you’d even try to use that as a reason says you didn’t even read it and jumped in to ‘both sides!’ an issue where it doesn’t belong.
Which is precisely what I originally said.
Nobody assumed that other commentator wasn’t in favor of law being applied to both sides.
They came out of nowhere with it by saying both sides on and article about one side doing something….
Because Your comment didn’t actually explain anything, that was my point.
And you haven’t answered why the Dems were brought up at all on an article about what a republican did.
Other than muddying the waters and comparing them, what’s the point.
