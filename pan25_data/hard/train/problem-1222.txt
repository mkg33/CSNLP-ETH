No.
Even if you disregard the current widespread military service of the Druze community as cultural (Druze as a community have historically strongly supported the state they are part of as a pro-active measure to prevent it from becoming hostile to them) history very clearly says otherwise.
The local Druze (and Bedouin) communities largely supported and fought alongside Israeli militia during the civil war/first Arab Israeli War/Israeli War of Independence (whatever you want to call it).
Reasons being the usual reasons ethnic minorities fear irredentist movements - a movement trying to reclaim all of Israel/Palestine and re-establish a Levantine Arab (Palestinian) identity throughout is inherently a threat to all ethnic minorities, not just Jews.
Therefore the Druze community (and most of the Bedouin community who fought) fought on the Israeli side.
Obviously there is far more to both of those communities and to their relations with the Israeli State than just the conflict, but I wanted to make it clear that such an ethnic conflict has permeated to other ethnic groups (as is typical in those types of conflicts).
The Bedouin have had more strained/deteriorating relations with the Israeli state (to be blunt - mostly due to anti-arab racism and being lumped in with Palestinians by Jews, but there are other problems).
But much of the Palestinian-nationalist movement still rejects the existence of Bedouin west of the river and claims they are Levantine/Palestinians who lost their identity when they became nomadic.
Today, the only people who claim Yemeni Jews are Arabs are the non-Jews who want to deny the existence of a Jewish ethnicity, in order to deny their national rights.
The enemies of the Jews don't get to define who the Jews are.
