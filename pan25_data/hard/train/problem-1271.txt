But the judge specifically channeled the will of our founding fathers, you know those revolutionaries who fought for change and progress to improve the lives of US citizens, and decided they would have been conservatively against change and progress.
The judge, appointed by Donald Trump, said that from a historical perspective the ban was "an outlier that our ancestors would never have accepted.
".
Right.
And if you look at the last two amendments out of ten, it's a ratified reminder that the Constitution is not a Magna Carta, literally because those debating the Bill of Rights were worried that people would make exactly the error you're making.
They went out of their way to try to stop you from making that error, but unfortunately, in order to work, it still does require that you both read and understand the entire Bill of Rights at a minimum.
Ideally, you'd also have a decent civics education.
Nobody gets away with actual murder by pleading the 2nd in court.
Nobody.
It has never happened.
Not once.
This is one of those areas of the law where the plain text and meaning of the Constitution simply cannot coexist in any coherent, consistent way with the state's desire to make people safer.
One of the two has to give, and a shocking number of people on this one issue will suggest that, not only should it be the Constitution, but that it should be the Constitution without a formal amendment having to be ratified.
What leg do any of those people have to stand on when the Court waves its hand and unilaterally amends the Constitution in some other way that they don't like?
Now, if they're willing to abandon that complaint completely, okay.
Then it's all just politics anyway.
Stop complaining that the Court is political and doesn't care about the law, because you're fine with the Court being political and you don't care about the law either.
