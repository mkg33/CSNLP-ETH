Yes the dollar is mighty and who knows, maybe printing howmuch you want wont de-stabilize your economy.
While it's true that it's hard to fix inflation, things will be a lot better when they decide to stop shooting themselves in the foot.
It's not that hard to imagine a scenario where this turns into a showdown.
Fast forward a bit where we aren't dealing with the politics of right-now.
Brazil might say that they don't have the money to protect the Amazon and that the US should foot the bill.
Absent money from the US, they will not enforce efforts to stop deforestation.
The US might be in a place where it is not politically feasible to pay Brazil to protect the Amazon.
It's not unimaginable that the US responds with threats of sanctions to compel Brazil to fund the protection of the Amazon itself.
While that seems like a clear abuse of sanctions today and would be unimaginable today, what's to say that it won't be seen that way in a few years?
There is a lot of mistrust between LATAM and the US right now.
One of Lula's big priorities is to get the US to pay to help Brazil to protect the Amazon.
It's a well justified priority and I'm generally inclined to agree with it.
