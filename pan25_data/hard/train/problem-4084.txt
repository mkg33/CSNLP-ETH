i feel that it also undermines the bill for it to include an accusation that Russia did something that (this time) they didn't actually do.
Then going on about 'if they get nuclear weapons, they'll do the same thing as Russia' further confounds your baseless accusations into conspiracy-level speculation.
Hungary and Poland goes way back.
The two countries saw each other as like 'brothers from another mother' sort of thing.
But the moment Orban started supporting Russia in their war efforts, Poland distanced themselves from Hungary in the EU and did not support anything they were saying.
Poland (their government) claims to oppose Russia but for years has spent helping anti-EU pro-Russia groups and parties all over Europe, because they care more about them being anti-EU than are worried about them being pro-Russia.
They spent years helping Orban's regime with things like vetoing EU actions against them, despite knowing of Orban's ties to Russia, and even now as Orban is actively committing treason against the EU, NATO, and by extension Poland, they still are hesitant to let the EU take action against Poland.
