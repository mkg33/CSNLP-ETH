the fact that DeSantis won by almost 20 points while running a campaign rich in bigotry and full of promises that he will work to make sure the right people die(trans kids, PoC, the unvaxxed) should be a horrific wake up call.
The state is more or less a 50/50 purple state according to polling, the Democratic party might want to try to craft a policy message that actually lands with the the average voters in FL.
as crazy as that sounds it just might work.
i'm completely on board with this.
it's why i have never been a supporter of Sanders as presidential candidate.
while i love what he's saying i know even if he won he wouldn't have a constituency in congress and there's no way any of the things he runs on would happen.
if we want a more progressive country we need more progressive local, state and national candidates elected first.
As I wrote in another comment for this article, if progressives believe they're the future, then start in the state which elected Sanders.
Oust Phil Scott with a progressive.
Flip side: if progressives can't accomplish that in Vermont, perhaps they should consider ceasing to dream about doing it in Florida.
