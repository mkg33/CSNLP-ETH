If they thought it was intentional then yes.
I think Russian violence crossing border was not an accident.
What are the chances it will happen again?
10o% Putin is laughing that we do not act.
You really think Russia did not do this on purpose to probe NATO’s response?
And who cares if it was an “accident” they must see consequence for carelessness.
And NATO must ensure this does not happen again.
I know people will say this will lead to end of the world if NATO retaliates.
But the must, if Rusdia realizes they can land bombs in a NATO country without a response, Putin will know he can get away with even more and escalate on his end.
The side effect may be that towns like Zabolottya in Ukraine may gain anti-missile coverage, just because of their proximity to Poland, but I guess Russia wants to play that game.
Also I suspect prior to now they were refraining from firing anti-missile systems into Ukraine, even if they were projected to land very near the border.
I wouldn't be surprised if the stance will change to "take the shot even if it's projected to hit near the Ukrainian side of the border, just in case".
But I imagine Poland is going to insist on some better (edit: coverage by) interdiction systems be setup next to the border, and will be a lot more likely to pull the trigger if they even look like they might come near the border.
