That phrasing he used is something folks are doing to focus on for the wrong reason.
All conventional firearm training I'm aware of is to treat all firearms as deadly, as loaded unless opened and likely with one of those "chamber is clear" flags.
To never point at anything you don't intend to kill.
That shooting is to be deadly.
If a gun is drawn, then it's become a deadly force scenario.
I really don't see the point in shooting to injure, there is already less lethal devices for that purpose.
Besides, shooting a torso is easier than an arm or leg.
So I don't see the point.
You either use less lethal means or shoot to kill, because once guns are drawn there usually is no going back.
That's why officers should be trained to properly be able to assess the need for deadly force use.
If an officer is drawing a gun, then it's deadly force.
I would expect that prior to drawing a weapon, de escalation was at least attempted, but the scenario dictates.
They escalate immdiately with firearms, and the only way to then escalate further is to pull the trigger.
Firearms should be the last resort, they should be trained to de-escalate (like most police in other countries) instead of being trained to just go straight to the max.
