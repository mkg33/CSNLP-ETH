To the people downvoting, why?
All nations solely care about their self interest, the state department aligning the interest of the US and India will be useful in the future, especially in regards to China.
Negative.
Russia has already lost in Ukraine.
NATO is expanding, they're sanctioned and have been made a pariah state in the west, their military is being degraded.
They haven't lost militarily in Ukraine yet but I think its obvious that Ukrainian identity and government isn't going anywhere even if Russia manages to hold some land in the east.
Russias war is a huge net loss for them and they've been made and are now seen as a second rate power.
China is now.
The spy ballon, new US bases in the Philippines, the tech war on microchips, Biden saying 3 times he'll defend Taiwan if they attack, Pelosi's visit.
The US and China cold war is here and its only gonna heat up from here.
"That wouldn't benefit India at all.
I feel like I've read a bunch of comments like these and I don't get why people think India is some sort of client state for Russia.
Why would India willing share info with Russia if they think it will impede them from getting more tech transfers from America?
".
Vice versa.
Don’t forget that India aligned with Soviet Union because of the US’s continued support of Pakistan as well as threats and sanctions against India.
