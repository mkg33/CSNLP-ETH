The Germans bombed London in retaliation for allied bombing of Berlin.
Hitlers retaliation against civilians instead of focusing on destroying RAF airfields and radar instalations was a big reason the British were able to go on to win the battle of Britain.
So in the end it was a clever gambit and knowing your enemy.
USA is still supplying weapons to the Saudis to bomb Yemeni children.
Not to mention what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan in the last 20 years.
Hanoi and Haiphong were carpet bombed 50 years ago too.
Not saying Russia is any better, but i think if we want to achieve peace, understanding history and realizing nobody has a moral high ground is important.
Or it shows that he has a history of insisting that Russia's neighbors give up large chunks of their sovereignty and bend yo Moscow's will lest they invite invasion.
You mean like what happened 8 years ago when russia took "some territory" and they then moved on and invaded anyway?
Like that?
Or do you mean "absolutely different" to last time?
