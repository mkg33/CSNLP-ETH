Deforestation wipes out entire species all the time.
The main purpose of deforestation is to make room to graze farm animals, or grow feed for farm animals.
By buying animal foods you also cause extinction.
Yeah, we respect the animals we kill by using them to nourish ourselves.
We also farm them.
They’re domesticated.
Chinese poachers go into the wild and kill endangered animals to be used in fake pseudoscientific medicine.
We are not the same.
You can have a tantrum about “racism” all you want but it doesn’t change the fact that their practices are far more barbaric, cruel, and POINTLESS.
Are you seriously defending hunting endangered species for made up magical Chinese medicine, as if that’s somehow comparable to farming pork for nutrition?
The false belief that the average person needs to eat animals and their byproducts in order to survive and healthy, because without it they’d get sick and die, boarders on pseudoscientific medicine.
Animal agriculture is responsible for and because people falsely believe that that eating certain animals and their byproducts is necessary.
It kind of is, the results are the same; the animals are endangered and dead, it’s just not done for the same reason and is more destructive than poaching.
And loggers go in and destroy the rainforest, which leads to displacing, killing, and endangering thousands of animals, so farmers can raise their animals and grow food for the animals there instead.
There are tons of American poachers and legal ways to own endangered animals in certain states, but when’s the last time you’ve heard someone say ‘Fuck America’ when they’re brought up?
