Because they're lying.
They believe the government should exist.
For everyone who is not them/doesn't hold their beliefs.
The fall of Roe v Wade is the most prominent and proximate example, but there are others.
No I definitely am.
And they are.
Liberals would be wise to cotton to that basic fact of observable reality.
That is the natural endpoint of American conservative ideology.
I'm not sure what point you're arguing here.
Are you simply saying that GOP voters must be rubes with no understanding of what they're supporting or....?
If you’re saying the GOP is lying, I generally agree.
If you mean all people who vote Republican are lying about wanting less government and are actually authoritarian fascists, you’re vastly oversimplifying it.
I don’t think anyone has ever said ALL conservatives are fascists but to say you can’t see the fascist tendencies in the American Republican Party (especially in the past few years) is being academically dishonest at best.
“Small government” means a lot of things to a lot of people.
Many conservatives I know conflate “big government” with that time they had to wait 30min to get their photo taken at the DMV.
Unless it happened to them personally or one of their own, they have difficulty empathizing with folks even if their economic interest align.
For example, obviously I don’t want to lump all Latino people together but generally speaking as a group they tend to be very Catholic and pretty conservative.
You would think the GOP would be all over that but I’m assuming leaders made a calculation and figure it wasn’t worth risking the 1/4-1/3 of GOP who can’t let go of their racism and xenophobia.
