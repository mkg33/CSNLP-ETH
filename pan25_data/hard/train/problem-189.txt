You don't have to actually blow up the economy.
A general strike would last all of 3 days before we either saw corporations give in or they brought out the national guard, in that case showing their true colors.
The capitalist class cannot finction without labor.
Liberals have never understood that.
Why is it leftists who demand fighting for worker rights that are blamed as being terrorists and not the goddamn corporate overlords?
The whole country should be willing to go on a general strike if republicans let the economy shut down because they don't believe workers fundamentally deserve paid time off and reasonably flexible schedules.
They should be threatening to veto that bill until republicans agree that workers deserve sick days and encouraging workers across the country to join in the strike against the corporations who can't fucking manage a schedule or stomach workers with leave.
Are you actually putting the whole potential rail strike on rail workers wanting sick days and not like a dozen billionaires who have been slashing the workforce for years and reinvesting their earning into stock buybacks instead of the business?
Incredible!
