Well my grandfather, god rest his cantankerous soul, used to sit around with his buddies and scheme about how to take back Transylvania from Romania just for shits and giggles.
But I mean he was old enough to remember bombs falling on Budapest for the 2.0, so it wasn't surprising.
The hyper-nationalistic political elements that want to position the EU as an adversary within the Hungarian political climate basically have no pushback there.
The issue I have is that US still has an independent media and access to sources on just about any topic they want written in English from around the world.
If you only speak Hungarian, your sources of information are very limited indeed.
You’re learning history is Hungary, written by Hungarians.
I imagine it’s a lot like how Americans teach the history of chattel slavery in the United States.
I encourage you to look more into Hungary’s role in WWII because while it’s dark and hard to imagine, there were so many brave Hungarians who did the right thing and our culture and history is richer for their stories alongside our mistakes.
