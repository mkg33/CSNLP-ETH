None of the people you've replied to were incorrect.
All of the bits they listed fall within the rules of the constitution.
Isn't there a law for if you go to fight for an enemy country or not an ally, you're considered a traitor and are no longer wanted by your own country, and thus you'll have no diplomatic protection?
I'm sure there has to be one.
Joining a foreign military from a country hostile to the US is/can be a voluntary action, therefore your US citizenship can be revoked by the government by order of the constitution.
“You might lose your U.S. citizenship in specific cases, including if you: Run for public office in a foreign country (under certain conditions) Enter military service in a foreign country (under certain conditions) Apply for citizenship in a foreign country with the intention of giving up U.S. citizenship.”.
A person who is a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by voluntarily performing any of the following acts with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality.
Such employment, however, will result in one's expatriation only if done voluntarily with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship.
