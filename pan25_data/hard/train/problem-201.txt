My general position is that religion should be kept out of schools.
If instead of a smudging ceremony, it was a catholic priest baptizing kids at school, then I'd be just as outraged as most of you all would certainly be.
if a Christian group wanted to come into a school and, say perform a baptism while kids watched and then cleanse the classroom of demons by waving around some incense as a demonstration Iâ€™d tell them to get fucked.
If they had some Christian ceremony where kids were forced to participate people would be up in arms.
This seems no different.
See, this is where we differ.
Because you're seeing a bunch of children being forced to engage in MaGiC sPeLLs and I see an acknowledgement of another culture's hokum, as opposed to Christian (or Jewish) hokum.
Who the fuck are you to tell me what I think??
And "He GoT mE"?
What the happy fuck are you talking about?
?
Well, yeah?
I mean, obviously?!
Coexisting in this world means learning about the people in it.
I only have a problem when teachers or school administrators start leading prayers or otherwise pushing religion on children who don't have any choice about being there in the first place.
I'd be more concerned about crazy Christians trying to worm into public institutions, but I don't think it's weird to not want any spiritual or religious ceremonies done in schools.
I also wonder what kinds of crazy are going to try to use this as a precedent to get their religious practices into schools.
Honestly, I would have no problem with this being part of a field trip, but it's inappropriate for taxpayer funded schools to be hosting religious ceremonies.
With this ruling, every religion has a legal argument for coming to schools and proselytizing under the guise of pedagogy.
