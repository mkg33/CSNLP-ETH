No, they didnâ€™t.
2017 to 2019 show charitable contributions on his tax returns.
In 2020, he wasnâ€™t allowed to deduct charitable contributions because he had negative income.
That doesnâ€™t mean he didnâ€™t donate though.
Don't tell ME I'm making up stuff when the best YOU can do is state "it doesn't mean he didn't donate".
Go ahead tough guy, prove he DID donate one thin dime I just like saying "tough guy" ðŸ˜‚ just playin'.
It's really about this newest nutjob.
What the actual hell?
Of course Santos stays, McCarthy needs his vote Once we find out he misused campaign money, he'll be gone.
Not sure that will happen any time soon.
However, now that some of his taxes have finally been released (after yrs of lying about audits), he didn't donate SH!
â€¦you realize that tax returns donâ€™t show charitable contributions broken out by source?
Itâ€™s just an aggregate figure, but 2017-2019 show donations in excess of his salary for those years.
His income for 2020 was negative $4 million, and you canâ€™t claim deductions for charity if you donâ€™t have income.
That doesnâ€™t mean that he didnâ€™t donate though.
If he said Iâ€™m not going to donate any of my money I would actually believe he is donating his money.
He lies constantly and does the complete opposite of what he says he will do.
