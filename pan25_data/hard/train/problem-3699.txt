It's a fair statement.
It's part of why we have struggled with the ethics behind brain enhancement drugs.
If it's fully legalized it offers a unique advantage with terrible side effects for some workers to be more competitive.
At some point everyone will be on it just to stay in the game.
That's an awful dystopia.
But if left to populace to choose we probably end up in the same spot anyways.
Only in the sense that voluntary enhancement can and often does trend to the point of becoming a norm.
If that's the case then the impact can be exclusive to minorities or low income or sick people thus violating the constitution.
If employers are hiring people ata higher rate, people who voluntarily enhance themselves, then it creates that discrepancy.
Ultimately, society has to draw a zig zag line somewhere between "I don't sleep and therefore I get more done so I'm more valuable to my employer" and "my 12th injection of microchips and cancer giving supplements makes me a better employee.
".
Ah, yes.
The area of the country that was absolutely terrified about the microchips in the vaccine now need the Democrats to save them from actual microchipping...
Republicans that screamed about microchips in vaccines will reflexively start loving chips at the first sign of Democrats trying to legislate against them.
Republicans before Democrats try to ban microchipping people: Bill Gates is going to give you the Mark of the Beast via microchips hidden in Covid Vaccines.
Republicans after Democrats try to ban microchipping people: It's American's God-given right to get the Mark of the Beast.
