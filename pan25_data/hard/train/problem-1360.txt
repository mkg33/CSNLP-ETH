It's not like this is a complicated.
Show how gerrymandering is undemocratic and constantly go at them for being undemocratic until as many voters as possible associate the Republicans with not supporting democracy.
Right - the question is whether that is happening here, or whether - due to gerrymandering - the majority is voting for (or would vote for) the governor and representatives of one party, but nevertheless the other party is winning a supermajority of seats.
And going back to the original quote; if a majority of people elect a governor, but that governor isn't able to govern due to an opposing supermajority, then the people aren't getting the representative they voted for.
If the Governor is elected by a majority, but has no actual power because the minority of votes leads to a supermajority of seats, then doesn't that mean people aren't getting the representatives they voted for?
How you know your state is gerrymandered, statewide elections are democrats elected, super majority in both houses of state legislature for republicans.
It says a lot about how the system is rigged when you can have enough Democrats in the state to elect a Dem governor, but somehow Republicans can have a supermajority in the state congress.
Something is very broken.
