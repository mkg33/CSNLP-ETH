Yes you can.
Most national football associations are more corrupt, which is how they're all so easily bribed.
FIFA on the other hand, are corruption.
They are made by it, they exude it, they smell of it, every room they walk into is tainted by their greasy fat fingers sneaking their way into pockets.
They don't care.
They're FIFA, essentially the 'owners' of the most popular game in the history of the planet.
What are you gonna do, not watch football?
Not play?
Not buy jerseys, or tickets, or pints in a pub that has Sky Sports?\ Cause in some way, those aforementioned greasy fingers get a cut of all of that, because of how the sports world is set up.
It was one of the most depressing things I have experienced related to getting older, realising that the people in charge of pro sports do not "love the beautiful game" or care about participation at all, unlike the grassroots members.
They just want money, and they'll literally cover up fucking mass murder and slavery on an industrial scale to get more for themselves.
\Sky sports is by far the number 1 sports channel in the UK and Ireland.
For a pub to carry it, they have to pay a steep installation fee and then their yearly bill is actually based off how profitable they are.
So the more beer you drink in a pub with sky (basically all of them), the more money flows back up to teams and in turn FIFA.
You can't really buy an Olympics as far we I know.
Obviously you need vast amounts of money to bother applying in the first place, but it's still down to the strenh of your application.
