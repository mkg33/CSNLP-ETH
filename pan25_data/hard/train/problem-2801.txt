The UN is a diplomatic forum for representaties of all the world's nations, it was created because so future world wars could be prevented, not to install a new world order.
The UN was created to build a new world order that placed the victors of the war in the 5 permanent security council seats, something that hasn't changed despite being obsolete...it has nothing to do with preventing nuclear war.
The UN was created in 1945, a decade before before thermonuclear weapons were invented and at a time when only a handful of atomic bombs existed, all of them American.

I mean at that point it was quite obvious that the guys america needed to help make the bombs as well as less friendly would be making their own bombs, and thermonuclear bombs had already been invented as a concept and it was known that they would work and that it was just a matter of time to overcome the engineering issues.
