They passed a massive voter suppression law, gifted massive tax giveaways to corporations, authorized the mowing down of protestors, stopped trans kids from participating in school sports, put a ban on schools teaching “critical race theory” (history that might hurt white kids' feelings), don't say gay, teachers without degrees and something about being woke.

Bread and circuses is a general term, it doesn't mean literal bread or circuses.
It means anything that keeps the people happy.

You can see that in other recently posted stories like Florida book burning / Fahrenheit 451 (targeted books have the subject of diversity and inclusion), or the proposed rule that public universities in FL have to teach a certain Western history class / cannot teach minority history.
