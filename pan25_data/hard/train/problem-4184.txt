How does this resolve what happened in Ohio where the court did Part B basically exactly as you described multiple times but the legislature kept submitting maps just as gerrymandered until the court just said "Eff it, voting is next week" essentially and just used a blatantly gerrymandered map?
Oh!
Or how Ohio is trying to end ballot initiatives so the voters can never add another anti-gerrymandering clause to our state laws?
Ohio recently had a voter referendum that made it unconstitutional at the state level.
So it's both gerrymandered and unconstitutional at the state level.
Was the map ruled unconstitutional (state or federal)?
Or just that it was gerrymandered?
HUGE difference there.
A bunch of idots in the state decided that they could simply do a referendum with the citizens to create a non-partisan redistricting committee and set the rules for creating the boundaries.
Utah's constitution gives that authority to only the legislature.
Once the citizen initive passed there were two choices.
A) it would have gone to the state courts and found in violation of the constitution.
B) Legislature could amend the new "law" to make it an advisory committee ONLY.
That's what the legislature did.
Went to the state courts because the group behind the initiative got their feelings hurt that the legislature passed a new law amending the one passed to make it constitutional.
Part A) State courts have a constitutional duty to see if the law (redistricting) violates the state constitution or other state laws.
Federal Courts have a constitutional duty to see if the law (redistricting) violates the Federal Constitution.
