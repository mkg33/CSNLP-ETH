RTPCR should be taken 5 to 7 days after exposure.
Surely some of them have false negative results.
The positive results are probably those who already have the virus before the flight.
So in summary; you want to try to make sure no virus ever enters your body?
Cool!
Let us know if and when you figure that shit out.
In the meantime you can live in a plastic bubble like Bubble Boy or make a giant condom to wear every day.
Or you can give your body the instructions on how to fight and destroy certain viruses (vaccines).
Or just roll the dice and hope you don’t die if you think it’s worth not being vaccinated.
Now imagine that you never got the vaccine.
So one day a virus is going to enter your body but the guards have never seen such a thing before and therefore has no idea to sound the alarm so quickly.
Once the guards do come “face to face” and realize it’s an enemy, they set the alarm off.
Lol Or like my body where contact with majority of condoms leads to “I don’t like the feel of this, SEND IN THE RASHES We must now battle this material that’s obviously trying to kill us”.
