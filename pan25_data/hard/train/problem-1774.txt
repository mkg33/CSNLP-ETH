Why on earth would you make this about the Russian "national character"?
All regimes through history justify their conquest and imperialism with the language of defense and victimization.
This is just propaganda 101.
Portraying millions of Russians as fundamentally having inferiority complexes is lazy stereotyping.
Blame Putin, his regime, and their actions, not the "Russian national character" for Ukraine.
At this point, nothing the Russian Leadership says or does has anything to do with us in this context.
Okay, bohemian Russian-bot, but why not make good on such a deal, when instead, you have alluded to “control” over European energy, and/or open war on the land you intend to claim?
Well maybe they could get out of Ukraine and return to the pre-2014 borders and stop invading their neighbors and start acting like a normal responsible country instead of an aggressive wannabe empire.
At some point I think there will eventually be a peace deal that gets Ukraine crimea and the Donbas back, but to prevent Russia from being an asshole in the future, the terms will not include reparations or accountability for actions.
The reason I think this might be okay is that Russia will crumble even without needing to pay reparations or hold its officials accountable.
If they get kicked out of Donbas and crimea, Russia is going to implode as the strong man illusion of its leadership disintegrates.
