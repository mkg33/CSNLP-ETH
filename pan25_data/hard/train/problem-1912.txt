Speaking of the survey, there's been a long-running academic dispute between Kleck, one of its co-authors, of his survey and its methods.
One of the ?
The past nearly thirty years since Kleck's survey was originally published should have provided overwhelming empirical evidence in support of his conclusions if they were accurate.
Even without more aggressive research into defensive gun use, police reports alone should provide at least some support of his claims, even if only at a broad level.
They don't.
There's a very significant difference between "deleting data" and "deleting" a reference to a specific study in a fact sheet.
The letter you linked and the original article it references from The Reload both refer to it as deleting a reference to the Kleck survey from the early 90s (the study in question).
Even if you want to criticize that decision--and there is a perfectly valid criticism that can at least be argued--framing it as deleting data is a blatantly misleading framing of the matter.
If an agency supposedly driven by science and not politics is actively deleting information because of politics they suck and should be replaced with people who actually believe in presenting all the data.
I'd love to see the evidence that collecting defensive gun use stats would have been considered a violation of that amdnment.
Republicans specifically told them that gun violence statistics gathering would be in violation of the law.
In 2018 Congress finally cleared the way for them to do it but they didn't get the money for it until 2020.
