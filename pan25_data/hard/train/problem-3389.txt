After he was elected in 2016, I remember talking to my dad about how this will all end with him representing himself at his criminal trials, after his presidency.
I predict he'll unambiguously call for violence the day before he gets arrested, and the fallout will be so disgusting to everyone in the country that he'll have trouble finding lawyers.
Or, he'll refuse to hire anyone permanently as one-by-one they explain how fucked he is because he's admitted to all his crimes and intentions in public.
No, they can't, not unless he's already been involuntarily committed or agrees to testing (he won't if he knows they're looking for incompetence).
"He can never accept reality that is unacceptable for him.
Normal people, we all have losses.
Trump doesn't have losses.
So he denies it.
When it comes down to it, if you push him hard enough, which is what has happened, then you see the delusional core of it.
It has all the qualities of a delusion.
".

I had to read the article because I was sure a Harvard law professor wouldn't be seriously suggesting he do this.
He wasn't.
It was just them being as perplexed as all of us at his bizarre behavior.
Not only would he not go along with that and it wouldn't work (it would result in him being placed in a mental institution if successful), but every time he opens his mouth or tweets to try to spin it, he only proves that he is very aware of the reality of the situation and what he did.
