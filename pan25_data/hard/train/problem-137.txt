It's pretty convenient and not a big deal.
If you want to travel internationally and are concerned about the government taking a picture of your face, wait until you learn about passports.
If you have a passport/driving licence your photo and personal details are already on a govt database.
If you bought an airline ticket they don't need an airport photo to find out what flight you left on and where you arrived.
You give your passport to the officer and they run the bar code on your passport through their computer system, you then have your finger prints taken digitally, then they take a photo of your face.
A photo that is already in their database.
For those worried about being tracked, ditch your smart phone and delete all social media accounts and the internet.
Those companies have far, far more data on you than any govt agency in the US and they are much better at using it.
I have been travelling to the US for many years and all of the major airports in the US have had this stuff for years at passport control.
Like showing my passport 3 TIMES at the airport (after having to show my passport twice in Costa Rica before the plane ride).
The invasion of privacy and waste of time is ridiculous.
