Yep and many people say this is why Russia was so hasty about the war in Ukraine, every 6 months they dont act is another half year of a plummeting population of young people that could fight.
Those Russians fleeing now would of course not want to come back to Russia as long as the war is still ongoing, but people are commenting here as if that was the only scenario possible, thus making the ban of course useless.
This ban threat is aimed at people still living in Russia, to make them think that, in the future, they might regret their decision, even if/when the war ends.
Imagine the war ends tomorrow, and for the next 25 years Russia coexists peacefully with their neighbors, but those Russians are still not allowed to come back.
Russia had 30 years to learn to coexist peacefully, but decided not to.
Instead, went back to their old ways from previous centuries.
Unlikely they'd become a civilised country in the next couple of decades.
I don't get the idea of lumping "western people" all together.
The difference between cocky American exceptionalism and German post war introspection is vast.
It seems that the term "western" has become a tool used by Putin managed special interests to create an enemy at the gate and siege mentality in order to mobilize and control the Russian population with fear.
