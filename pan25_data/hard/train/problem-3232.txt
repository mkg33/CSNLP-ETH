The change in the district made OR-5 a hard hold for Dems: If you look at the totals most of the pop resides in Clackamas and Deschutes Counties which are rural/suburban areas.
If you look right now its roughly 190K votes in those two counties counted with 70% counted in Clackamas and 90% counted in Deschutes.
Both were divided pro-dem but about 2% in Clackamas and 5% in Deschutes.
The tiny bit of Multnomah County (the one actual urban area) went for the Dem by +60% but only contained 24,000 votes tallied so far.
This doesn't offset Linn and Marion counties with 76,000K (both rural areas) which both went Rep by 36 and 27 percent.
Linn County and Marion County which are the heavy red areas are at 90% and 80% respectively and if you look at the total votes there it's smaller than the blue areas left.
The tiny section of Multnomah County is going for McLeod Skinner by 80% right now and it has 20% left to count.
McLeod-Skinner is currently winning what's left to count of Deschutes which is about 11% of Bend by 53%.
