It's not just a haven for Brazilians.
It's also a tax haven for a lot of rich and wealthy politicians and other major figures from across Central and South America.
(More recently, it's also became a haven for Russians hiding their ill-gotten assets.

Because of Lava Jato’s corruption that Lula can’t be trialed again.
Lula didn’t create any law, and didn’t destroy due process.
If impartial judges and prosecutors were doing their work, maybe Lula would have being sentenced.
Maybe, but we’ll never know because they unjustifiable tried to convict him before he could be a candidate in 2018.
They acted politically and created this mess, not Lula.
It was political persecution so Lula would not be able to run for president in 2018.
The judge of the case conspired with the prosecution, and after Lula was arrested and Bolsonaro won, the judge became Bolsonaro's justice Minister.
Lula's conviction was reverted later and if you're Brazilian, you know that.
It's hard to believe it came to that in the election, but the previous president Dilma Rousseff was involved in Lula's crimes too.
Maybe you can't even find a candidate that isn't knee deep in corruption.
There is no good guy, you either pick an extreme right wing corrupt politician which issues are very recent and fresh in everyone's memory, or a leftist corrupt politician that accepted bribes, laundered money, peddled influence and tried to shield himself with political positions.
