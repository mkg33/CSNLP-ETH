Problem with an underground bunker is it will have stationary weak points called an entrance.. and I'm going to put money on the locations of these are known by US/Israel.
Meant to and actually doing it are two different things.
Hiding in a hole isn't much of a counter as you think it is.
Subterranean warfighting has been a thing since the 80's and even earlier in a smaller capacity.
Subterranean Warfare has been a thing sense before the Great War, however the US has now trained over half their Brigades to do such.
Their construction is underground and often top secret, the Pentagon admits there are plenty of these bunkers that they donâ€™t know about.
The grand opening doesn't make sense unless it was basically obvious to other militaries that there's a bunker airbase there.
Bunkers by themselves honestly are not as impenetrable as they once were and gain a decent amount of protection today based on secrecy rather than actual protection.
This is because once using bunkers to store key equipment became commonplace, bunker busters were extensively researched to the point that most nuclear bunkers even aren't able to withstand modern munitions, especially against an enemy that knows where your base is and concentrates on it.
In all, this is more for show as a country like the U.S. could either destroy it or simply damage it to the point it no longer can serve as an airbase and only smaller regional powers that have poor militaries would be threatened by it.
