Even though so people would dislike me to hell for saying this,I don't think these protests will actually topple the regime unless protesters militarize.Those POSes at top would rather murder everyone who defies them and destroy the country then actually step down from their power and wealth.
Even if these executions "work" and the protests stop, the protestors aren't going to forget their grievances or the hundreds of martyrs the regime created while trying to reestablish dominance.
They'd lick their wounds and wait for their next window (probably when Khamenei dies and power transfers to his successor).
The ONLY reason the Kims are still in power is because a different autocratic regime is propping them up.
If the CCP didn't have a use for them as a buffer state or feared what millions of uneducated refugees will do when they flood into the country, North Korea would have collapsed by now.
And they almost certainly will in the future if China's own problems with protesting and disgruntled citizens are anything to go off of.
It doesn't truly work though.
It just kicks the can down the road.
You can't prop up an inherently unbalanced system through brutality and sheer force of will forever.
Until the protesters are willing to match or exceed the violence put forth from the clerics, this wonâ€™t succeed.
People will change (relinquish power) when forced to, nothing else.
