That said, I've actually gone through the process of getting citizenship in an EU country, which gives me the right to live and work both in that country and anywhere else in the EU.
In particular, if you have an ancestor from Hungary, Italy, Ireland or Poland, then you might have the right to reclaim your ancestor's citizenship from that country.
Most of those countries have a cutoff date that your ancestor had to immigrate after; Hungary has no such limit and you can trace your ancestry back as far as is needed to prove you have a Hungarian ancestor.
For people thinking, "Fuck this, I'll just move abroad," it's not as easy as it sounds.
Most countries where you'd actually want to live make it pretty hard to get legal residency there, let alone citizenship.
So the people most likely to be unsatisfied in the US are the people least likely to be able to find a country willing to allow them to move there.
Outside of that, chances are that other countries have little interest in whether or not you want to live there.
As an American that has lived overseas on and off for over 10 years, starting in the 1980s, here’s a bit of reality, the rest of the world probably doesn’t want you.
I’m also a part of several expat groups and I almost laugh when I see the daily post, “I’ve decided to leave America.”.
Hell, I'm an "elder millenial," and I thought about leaving the country when I was in college in the late 2000's.
As a first generation in USA and a millenial, I've had this sentiment for a long time now.
The USA that my parents immigrated too isn't the one that is now...and I've been wanting to leave as the benefits of living here feel so miniscule and it feels like this entire country is just bleeding you dry.
