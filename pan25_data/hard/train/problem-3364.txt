He's saying that because people criticized police officers and pointed out a need for better police officers we can't have better police officers because the people who would be better police officers won't want to join while people want better police officers.
If you're deterred from being a cop solely because of the rational criticisms of and reactions to the modern police state, then you might not be a good person...
Yeah people rightfully condemning and despising cops is the problem and not the whole justice system being rotten to the core.
exactly, there are a lot of people out there, like my family, that think when cops lose their shit it's always justified.
i was watching the news with my parents a few years ago.
they live in texas.
a story came on about a couple of customs agents in Laredo that got busted for taking $10K per semi full of drugs they waved through.
my step mother started defending the customs agents because "who could turn down that kind of money" and on the other hand wants drug dealers summarily executed.
as long as those in authority are abusing the correct people there's nothing to excuse, they're just doing their job.
/s.
this is why i've begun to feel that the cops that stand by and watch, who do nothing when this shit is going on, are actually worse than the ones actually doing shit.
it's the cops standing by watching that enables these mother fuckers to get away with murder.
if the "good" cops actually got involved and stopped something i might agree that there is such a thing as a good cops, but until that day they are all the same.
thanks!
this should be it's own thread.
I've read it.
it's fucked.
And what a shock that former LA and OC sheriffs are in prison.
and I think the OC Sheriff's wife went down too.
