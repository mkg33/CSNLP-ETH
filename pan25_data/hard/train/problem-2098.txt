Like I’ve always said.
Ain’t shit would’ve happened if NATO or the US put troops down in Ukraine as soon as Russia started their “training missions” at the border.
But lets keep in mind, Ukraine was for the most part extremely fringe as a country prior to the invasion.
They were by no means anywhere near mainstream Euro in their policies and would never have asked for outside help due to fear of what it would make them look.
The invasion changed that outward stance.
But lets not forget while the invasion of Ukraine was unwarranted, they are most definitely not politically or socially close to the Euro or America zone countries in their policies.
I disagree.
There has been 75 years of fighting and war, by nuclear powers, that has not kead to a single use of nuclear weapons during that time.
If someone got back into a corner, thats one thing but theres a reason why MAD has successfully kept them from being deployed since 1945.
There is a reason why America has so many “bases” in countries around the world.
Those countries understand there is zero risk of invasion if a US military base is sitting in their country.
