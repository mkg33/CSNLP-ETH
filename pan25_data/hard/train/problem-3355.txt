The fact they aren't important States is the whole point.
It gives every candidate a shot.
If the first State was California, or New York, only billionaires could run.
The whole point of the first four is low population States, in different parts of the US, spaced a week apart, to give time to narrow and scale campaigns.
Although I am glad they ditched Iowa.
I literally said it should be rotated.
And the fact that the State is conservative is largely meaningless.
It's a primary.
Republicans don't really vote in the democratic primary.
Which again.
Makes it easier for candidates to campaign.
It's a feature, not a bug.
The low population of democratic voters make it easier for a fair race where you have ideas brought to the surface instead of how much cash you have in your coffer.
This allows candidates to pitch their ideas where they don't have to be rich to campaign.
And it lets the field narrow before Super Tuesday.
That being said, I'm glad Iowa isn't going first because of the 2020 fiasco.
Iowa isn't the absolute worst state to be 1st, but its absolutely far from the best.
West of Des Moines and yeah, its basically Nebraska/South Dakota.
But the tech corridor of University of Iowa with its educational hospital, aerospace companies (BAE and Collins Aerospace), etc.
Its not all bad.
Iowa city is one of the most liberal and educated cities (town more like) in the Country.
But those are tiny specks of bright shining blue in an ocean of racist, backward-ass rural good ole boys.
I'll be glad to see Iowa knocked down a peg (or two) in the political gamesmanship.
As an Iowa Dem who loves and never misses a primary: GOOD.
We have proven we do not deserve it anymore.
I was so proud of us when we nominated Obama :').
