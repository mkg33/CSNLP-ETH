Is the proposed text available anywhere or is this what's being reported?
The thing I'd like to see is what this actually triggers.
Does it mean one member can raise their hand, the Speaker position is vacated, and there needs to be another vote where the (new) Speaker needs to receive the majority of votes among those cast?
Or does it mean that one member can call for a vote of no confidence that needs to receive a majority of votes cast to remove the speaker and then the House would be in the position it's in today.
Also, is the ability to call for a vote restricited to members of the Speaker's party?
At that point all he would need is five Republican house members to vote not to vacay, actually four because he won't vote against himself.
If Kevin wants to keep the speakership bad enough he may give the Democrats enough so they don't vote against him on vacay votes.
Why don’t the democrats vote for him now so McCarthy doesn’t have to give up those powerful spots to the lunatics?
Really wish the Dems could peel off a few Republicans to vote for someone other than McCarthy - or at least a small group of Republicans could vote for someone reasonable to attract the Dems.
