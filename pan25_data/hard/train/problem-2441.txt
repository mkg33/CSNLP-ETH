Actually it's quite the opposite.
As countries become richer the fertility drops dramatically.
Fertility rates in poor African countries are much higher than comparatively rich Western countries.
If you look at the current world map for total fertility rate, only portions of Africa (+ Afghanistan) still have very high fertility rates.
A 2020 study published by The Lancet from researchers funded by the Global Burden of Disease Study promotes a lower growth scenario, projecting that world population will peak in 2064 at 9.7 billion and then decline to 8.8 billion in 2100.
This projection assumes further advancement of women's rights globally.
In this case TFR is assumed to decline more rapidly than the UN's projection, to reach 1.7 in 2100.
An analysis from the Wittgenstein Center IIASA predicts global population to peak in 2070 at 9.4 billion and then decline to 9.0 billion in 2100.
The UN Population Division report of 2019 projects world population to continue growing, although at a steadily decreasing rate, and to reach 10.9 billion in 2100 with a growth rate at that time of close to zero.
Right, the idea that it's bad that our population isn't going to grow past 9 or 10 billion is just confusing to me.
That's so many people.
The only way we can even get feed our current population is by making tons of synthetic fertilizer out of natural gas and atmospheric nitrogen.
I really doubt that that's infinitely scalable.
Dropping down to 6 or 7 billion would probably be a good thing for the planet.
