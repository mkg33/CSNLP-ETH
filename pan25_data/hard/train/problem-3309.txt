"At first we were skeptical, but then it turns out we found that it's constitutional to set up permanent conservative minority rule in America!
Good thing we, the conservative voting majority on the supreme court, were able to come to a balanced and reasonable solution to this case.
".
This.
I'm expecting something along the lines of "the SCONC was within their rights to reject the proposed map, but overstepped their authority in redrawing the map independently of the legislature."
Which is a moot point because the map was temporary anyway.
I'd like to see Wasserman or someone dissect what a fully maxed out gerrymandered map would look like.
A lot of GOP controlled states are already close to the max, so I'd have to assume that it would end up favoring Dems.
But I would still want to see numbers before I jump to that conclusion.
Even that still isn't a great result.
We'd probably end up in 2030 dealing with a bunch of legislatures doing what Ohio did: running out the clock by repeatedly submitting unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps and getting them struck down over and over again until it reaches the point that it's too late for a new map and the election goes ahead with a gerrymandered one.
