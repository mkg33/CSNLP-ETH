If you only drive a few dozen miles a day, having your max range drop from 300 to 100 miles in the cold doesn't really matter to most people.
They can just charge it overnight.
I would imagine a smaller more urbanized country like Norway or most of Europe would make EV battery life in the cold easier to deal with.
In these places paying for a 60kWh hour battery you use 10% of on most days isn't super popular compared to 2-4 2kWh batteries you can swap.
Very little so far, because the batteries are lasting longer than expected.
That's why EV battery recycling isn't a big industry yet - so little feedstock to make it economically viable.
Like I said, there's minimal demand for battery recycling.
That's probably 5-10 years off yet.
Although if it could be expanded to do laptop and phone battery recycling that would be useful.
Yes for sure.
The standalone infrastructure still needs to improve, OR battery technology to improve to the point they either have enough charge for a full 10-12 hour drive, or they can be recharged in the same amount of time it takes to gas up a fossil vehicle.
But you have to remember we are extremely early in the EV technology cycle.
Same as the earliest petrol vehicles, I would guess there were issues getting them fuelled up too.
Who looks after gasoline and diesel?
Where did that infrastructure come from?
What is the difference?
Government uses subsidies to incentivize business and that is how you grow and stay relevant as the worldâ€™s tech changes.
That is sort of their point.
