I know it won’t happen in my life time but hopefully some day the world will be able to leave this barbaric behaviour behind.
To sit back and think about all the people around the world being tortured, raped etc right at this very moment is enough to make a person despair for humanity.
The lack of empathy here is mind boggling.
How one human can do this to another is so hard to understand….
Religion and religious brainwashing has so much to answer for around the world.
This sounds like some religious whitewashing trying to imply that religion was somehow more reasonable than non religious people.
Whereas AT BEST it was crazy religious people vs somewhat less religious nuts.
People are pretty good at spontaneously building belief systems that look an awful lot like religion.
It seems to be basically wired in to our brains to look for patterns, build up symbolic meanings, form in groups, and be distrustful of outsiders.
But you’re right it is also a social technology the allows lots of disparate people to engage on a common ground.
