Also, Russia is making an offer to buy back their Aircraft Carrier that was sold to China for a ridiculous underpriced amount.
Like $22 million.
The company that bought it allegedly implied it was for scrap, but sold it to China giving them their first aircraft carrier.
China has now just built their first aircraft carrier that holds about half as much as a Ford class carrier.
Actually, pretty scary that it can make it through a ship's air defense.
Especially the big missile destroyer the pride of the Russian fleet that got sunk by the Ukrainians.
A total of 18 Russian warships and other vessels have been destroyed by the Ukrainian military since the war began on February 23.
According to the Ukrainian navy, on Tuesday there were 12 Russian ships were in the Black Sea on standby for combat operations.
Three of the ships were armed with Kalibr sea-to-land missiles, which the Black Sea Fleet has sporadically used to bombard Ukrainian positions.
They targeted the Russian Black Sea flagship the Admiral Makarov.
They were not targeting “nothing of military significance”, I’m not sure what’s confusing about that?
