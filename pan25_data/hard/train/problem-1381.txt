Traditionally Iowa and New Hampshire go first, then we have a couple of weeks before super Tuesday.
Then the presidential pack starts thinning out quickly.
The real problem is that Iowa and New Hampshire are not as diverse as other states.
That matters to democrats more than republicans.
Itâ€™s farther from the median Democrat voter profile.
As I already detailed with actual statistics.
If you have different statistics to show it is closer, I would love to see it.
I've seen you also comment on the nation v the Democratic Party voter mix.
I and others responding to you have already accounted for that.
You've just dug a hole for yourself factually and keep digging deeper.
That's now how statistics work.
A 19% voting group nationally representing a majority in South Carolina represents a lack of representative diversity.
To take your example even further, under your rationale, a 99% black state would be "diverse".
You're just using diversity to mean more of a single group of people.
Thus inverting what diversity even means.
