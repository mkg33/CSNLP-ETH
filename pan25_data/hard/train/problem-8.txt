Do you think that anyone whos not convinced that climate change is real after 25 years of climate change protests in all shapes and sizes would have been convinced tommorow that he does need to do something?
The time for convincing is sadly over and anybody who is still debating wether climate change is real is largely immune to facts.
Edit: And if your question is "why paintings and not oil tankers, fuel stations or something like that?"
Then I have the answer right there if you just search for "climate activist" plus whatever you want them to demonstrate against.
They've done the lot but those protests don't gather any attention.
For anyone who thinks these aren't effective protests.
You clicked on it.
You're reading about it.
You're commenting on it.
Wait... so they aren't even destroying anything?
They're trying to gain attention to save the world.
Destroying nothing and everyone's pissed at them.
Explain?
Why aren't they just putting a sheet of protective glass infront of the paintings and making this a non-problem?
In another thread from one of the past stunts I read that they know specifically that the paintings have glass and won't be harmed.
They don't want to harm the paintings, they just want the attention.
