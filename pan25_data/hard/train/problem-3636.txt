Literally any countries would've done the same.
It's like coming to Germany trade expo but then tell everyone to reduce reliance on Germany.
I guess you have bad reading comprehension?
I'm talking about how there's no proper or rational discussion on this sub.
Because anyone who disagree with many of the narratives on this sub would either get you banned, that comments removed, or just get downvoted.
Lmao "criticize", you aren't even allowed to disagree with many of the narratives on this sub without being banned or you posts being deleted.
Seriously this sub is such a echo chamber.
No logic, only the ""correct narratives"" allowed.there's no proper or rational discussion on here.
If you even have a reasonable non anti-china/anti-Russia takes, you would either get banned or downvoted.
Even slightly defend China/Russia with reasonable takes = posts removed, banned, or downvoted to hell.
Maybe here, but try criticising the government publicly in the West vs in Russia or China.
Big difference.
