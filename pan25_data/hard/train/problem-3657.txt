The problem with the s-300 isn't the system itself or its capabilities, it's the fact that everybody on the planet who has any and was willing to give some to Ukraine already has.
Pretty much just Russia, Belarus, and China have stockpiles of compatible missiles and they sure as fuck aren't going to give Ukraine any free reloads.
For all the shit talk about Russian weapons, Ukraine uses those same s-300 systems with deadly accuracy, and high rates of interception.
The S-300 systems have single handedly held off the Russian air force for a year now...
They fly so low to the ground because they are afraid of the S-300 systems... Not to mention those systems are also what's been intercepting the Russian cruise missiles.
Well they're basically the same system... S-400's are what they say are more advanced, as they claim they are capable of targeting stealth planes.
Yes, but does the added cost give you significant benefits to make it worth it to buy one Patriot system, instead of 6 S-300 systems?
Well yeah, but a Patriot system costs $1billion per system, while the S-300 is only $150million.
So you can have 6 S-300 systems for the price of one Patriot.... That's not to mention that each Patriot missile costs $4 million per shot.
The only reason the US is sending the Patriot systems is because Ukraine is running out of missiles for their S-300 systems, and NATO doesn't have any left to send.
Only former Soviet block countries would have stocks of such missiles, since they are Russian made, and most have already sent their stocks.
It goes further than that, the only producer of the missiles is Russia.
Anyone who has missiles left (Greece/Bulgaria iirc) and gives them to Ukraine isnâ€™t getting replacements.
