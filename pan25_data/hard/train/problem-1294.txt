People have money there because it’s a neutral place, it’s a neutral place because it’s hard to invade.
They seem to be giving up on Russia and when a neutral agent decides to antagonize you, it means you are no longer a going concern...
There's no such thing as neutrality in a war of genocide, if you aren't helping Ukraine, you're with Russia.
Switzerland has made it abundantly clear that they dont give a fuck about Ukraine.
They will vote in a symbolic, non binding gathering in the UN, but when it comes down to actual physical impact, they put the brakes on any third party weapons supply that ever involved Switzerland, and screech neutrality.
All while a fascist genocidal campaign not seen since 1945 is unfolding on the continent.
They talk a big game with their irregular UN voting but at the end of the day, Switzerland still repeatedly put the brakes on third party ammunition transfers intended to help Ukraine defend itself.
Its Switzerland, the same country that hoarded Nazi gold and put the brakes on Ukrainian ammo transfers.
It'll take them a while to find the Russian assets under their piles of drug lord and African dictator jewels or Nazi gold.
