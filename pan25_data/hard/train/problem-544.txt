Active shooter situations in order to protect civilians.
A couple companies are building really sophisticated robots and these conversations need to be discussed.
Drone warfare is here and robots armed with guns are going to happen so we need to discuss how they should be deployed legally.
To be clear, the robot is not going to use deadly force to protect itself (at least, that's the way the official regulations will be drawn).
It'll be used to neutralize (shoot) a human who is harming or threatening one of more other humans.
But hey, instead of doing something to reduce the need for deadly force, let's just ratchet up the arms race one more level.
It's the American Way.
And why would a robot encounter a situation that requires its operator to use deadly force?
Because we have TOO FUCKING MANY GUNS in this country.
I still maintain that the root of the problem is the easy availability of guns, but there's something to be said for removing the cop from the line of fire.
If things work well, this will give the cop time to assess the situation before opening fire and we'll have fewer Breonna Taylors caused by the "shoot them before they shoot you" reaction on the part of the cops.
