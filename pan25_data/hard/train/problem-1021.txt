Did I say he would sell weapons to Russia?
I said "a conflict".
I don't imagine there is a lot stopping him from obtaining more and selling them to whoever needs them.
Plenty of fighting going on around the world and plenty of groups looking for weapons.
Watch Lord of War, he pits two groups of warlords against each other while selling weapons to both sides.
Before he was captured this guy was responsible for a lot of the conflict in Africa.
He's basically out there making money for Putin loyalists who had their assets frozen(thanks to sanctions) people who can potentially turn on Putin would continue to back him since they are getting a piece of the weapons sales in conflict regions.
This is what he is good at, making people in the top echelon of the Russian government rich.
As long as the money is coming into for Putin's loyalists this war can go on forever even if in the end it bankrupts Russia.
He's probably going to restart the civil wars in places like Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda, etc.
This would allow Russia to get badly needed funding for their war efforts.
The US never cared about him before.
