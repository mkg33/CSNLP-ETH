I mean, on the one hand that Iranian drones did have consequences, on the other hand I'm sure donating stuff like long-range, high precision missiles will be treated very differently than buying 2nd class weapons from a country of which you are a major shareholder.
They not only asked, but straight up refuse to give them stuff you could easily fire far beyond borders.
If they equipped Ukraine with such weapons this is almost guaranteed to cause further escalation, because the Kremlin can frame it as if the west was using Ukraine to attack Russian territory.
They aren’t bothered about Ukraine escalating their war with Russia, they are worried about Ukraine dragging NATO directly into the the war via use of NATO weapons and risk backing putin into a nuclear response corner.
Basically, Ukraine can’t use US or NATO weapons to blast Russia, but if they use their own stuff or stuff from an unnamed country, Putin can’t play his favorite pastime of Mental Olympics to blame the west of using Ukraine to attack Russia, or so I suppose.
Can someone explain to me why the US purposefully crippled HIMARS so they can’t reach Russia, but are comfortable with Ukraine doing this?
I thought the intention was not to escalate.
