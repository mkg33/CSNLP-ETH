I don't hate the country at all, I've been there between 10-15 times.
I do hate Orban though, and my point might have been a little inelegant, but Hungary is a landlocked country surrounded by EU countries, plus Serbia and war-torn Ukraine without the EU membership that has propelled the economy forward over the last couple of decades, Hungary would be in terrible shape.
Funding is not the issue.
Even if Hungary got zero net funding, there would be huge issues.
I know quite a bit about this issue as I have been in international trade for 20 years.
The biggest benefit of being in the EU is the access to the massive single market, not a few extra Florints thrown into Budapest by the EU.
If Hungary goes from the EU, it won't be due to the EU being unreasonable, it would be due to Orban reaching the point where he is undermining the functioning of the entire union.
If Germany could find solutions so can Hungary but let's face it there's no secret Orban is riding on Putin's icbm ., he was against any and all sanctions against Russia..
Hungary: The sanctions are the cause of all of our economic woes Brussel's war-mongering strategy will brake Europe We will veto all sanctions to stop this madness!
And sanctions mean just that, if Russia stops another trade that's on them not on the EU for imposing sanctions for war crimes..
It's pretty much the same case as Germany, "you support our genocide or we stop gas and you freeze, haha stupid europeans".
Pls cut all EU funding from Hungary, the fact that a single corrupt country can veto stuff of such significance is mindboggling.
