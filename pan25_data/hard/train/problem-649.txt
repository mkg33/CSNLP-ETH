There is no urgency.
Powerful NATO countries like the US and UK have already given Finland and Sweden defence guarantees, and the countries have enough friends (Hungary and Turkey should try that, friends), that they will get plenty of support if something happens.
Especially for turkey, they have no reason to believe Sweden and/or Finland won't work to undermine Turkish interests, and arm and aid groups that attack turkey and Turkish citizens after they join since many NATO members have and still do those things.
If Finland or Sweden is invaded and they aren't in NATO precisely 0 Turkish or Hungarian soldiers will die for their sake.
Finland being attacked and NATO defending them is more probable then somebody not deciding to attack a NATO member because they are scared of the might of Finland.
Some country, lets say a country that borders Finland, might delude themselves into thinking NATO won't protect Finland and attack, not really an impossible scenario.
I think youre underestimating the military strenh of Finland and Sweden, and I'm not just worried about Russia, I'm more worried about a scenario where China, Russia, and their allies all attack the west.
Finland and Sweden provide a large area from which to attack Russia if they ever did attack NATO, Russia's NW is an important strategic region, I would say that adds to the deterrent significantly and they lock down the Baltic sea.
NATO is militarily far superior to Russia as is and the Danish and Turkish straits already block all ocean access.
Finland and Sweden's membership would only mean they would be protected, they aren't crucial in shifting the balance of power.
In that scenario Finland and Sweden aren't big enough to tip the scales either way.
They aren't even military powers let alone on the level of the US or China.
