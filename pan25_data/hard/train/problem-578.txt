Calling them "high capacity" or "large capacity" is such a nauseating misleading term.
It's suggesting they're referring to magazines with unusually high capacity, larger than average, when the reality is they're demanding 99% of existing magazines be banned and all guns have new ones that are smaller than the typical number and didn't exist for most guns until they were forced to by these laws.
In a 25-page opinion, he ruled that the measure’s regulation restricting magazine capacity would “dramatically change the rules on law abiding citizens,” noting that the “vast majority of gun owners are responsible, careful citizens with a great deal of respect and care for their firearms and only use them for law purposes including self-defense.”.
Can you explain to me how this is a neutral description of a group the judge knows nothing about, “Responsible, careful citizens with a great deal of respect and care for their firearms.”.
”Secretly paid by the gun lobby” I never said it was secret.
But yes In my experience everyone I’ve talked to that spends time defending guns has some sort of vested interested in them whether emotional or financial.
I wonder how much he’s invested or has been paid by the gun lobby because one things I’ve noticed, people who repeat these talking points always have a personal or financial interest in keeping the sales of an object legal.
It’s like Tobacco.
(After all I’m not saying he’s in the lobbyist’s pocket because he ruled in their favor I’m saying he’s in the lobbyists pocket because he repeated their words unquestioningly in his ruling.
).
Yep.
They're also the same guys who will claim an AR is the best home defense choice cuz accuracy and ballistics, but for some reason they need 30 rounds.
