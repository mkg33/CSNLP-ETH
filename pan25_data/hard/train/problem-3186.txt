They have nukes, and invading them or whatnot is a bit over the line.
So everyone is hoping Putin will decide the price is too high, and bring everyone home.
There aren't a lot of viable options other than grinding it out.
Unless one considers a Ukrainian surrender a viable option, and I don't think Ukraine is currently cool with that one.
Nor is the rest of Europe eager for Russia to win and then start to regroup for the next invasion.
firing into russia from ukraine should be ok to do, as long as they don't cross the border, putin can't call it an invasion.
Don't ask questions, if you do you'll get called a Russia supporter, only trust articles that say good things about Ukraine.
I mean next to stories about Russia anything said about Ukraine would seem good.
A firm and uncompromising stance against Russia is the only rational one here, anything short of that is the result of false equivalence and whataboutism, which are, along as heavy handed attempts at sowing confusion among the public's opinion, the main propaganda tactics used by pro Russian lost souls, which is why anything even remotely negative about Ukraine posted here gets compulsively down voted, since how are we supposed to tell the difference between a genuine question and an insidious attempt at bluring the line to try and manufacture apathy and neutrality ?
Also I'll add that I routinely see people ask for sources for pro Ukraine informations, albeit they often give out a "virtue signaling" vibe.
