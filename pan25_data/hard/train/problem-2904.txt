You've just outlined why North Korea will never invade at all, not why they're going to feel compelled to launch some suicidal nukes to cap a suicide attack.
The moment North Korea launches a nuke, the USA will step in, meaning the outcome of the war wonâ€™t change, its just that millions of additional people will die.
If the war somehow starts, I doubt North Korea would not use nukes, because like mentioned above otherwise South Korea would defeat them and overthrow regime, which is a death sentence for Kim anyway.
Actually launch nukes against SK and I am not sure if even China of all places wouldn't respond realizing their buffer zone has gone rogue and is now waging a nuclear war right next to their own borders.
And in every potential outcome there is no Kim family afterwards and it's honestly more up to US, SK and China on how to carve up the country.
This is also even assuming SK does not hoard some nukes of their own.
I mean - they had 950 of these in the 1960s belonging to Americans and they have recently asked for a redeployment (and you can't hide mobilization of the entire country which takes months so everyone is aware that you are preparing for a conflict so a logical step would be to deliver some warheads to SK as a retaliation/warning measure).
