Well yeah, of course they all voted.
People need to remember they didn’t have to wait in line.
The lines that built at some polling places built for the tabulator machines that had printing issue and people wanting to wait for them to come back online.
Meaning there was little to no line to actually get your ballot and fill it out.
When you were done you had an option:
Now, I’m aware they successfully ran the disinformation campaign to have their voters believe they can’t trust secure drop boxes (oops) so they had an unusual amount at some locations that wanted to stand in line.
Buuut let’s say you had no time for that and had to get back to work or wherever what are you going to do with your ballot you’ve already filled out?
Drop it in the secure box or trash bin?
Obviously secure box.
Even if you don’t trust them to count it, what’s it going to hurt to drop it in the box just in the off chance that your crazy conspiracy theory is wrong and they do count it?
This is why they all voted and had their votes confirmed and she can’t find the thousands of voters she’s claiming who were “disenfranchised”.
Well it matters because her voters are contradicting what she’s saying.
They’re saying that they were still able to cast their vote, which contradicts Lake’s bullshit theory that she lost because her voters were disenfranchised.
Her voters were disenfranchised because the person that they voted for received less votes than they were able to submit.
