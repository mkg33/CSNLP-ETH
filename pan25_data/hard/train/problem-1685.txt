No, most people just have an own interest in voting VVD.
Especially if they are a “ZZP’er”.
Most people in the Netherlands vote for themselves, not for others.
The average Dutch voter has no idea what they're voting for.
"Oh this Rutte guy looks friendly and smiles all the time, surely he'd make a good PM."
or "I've always voted VVD, I'll just do the same this year.
".
Yup.
Unilever isn't even a dutch company.
It's not a US company.
It's not a north american company.
It considers itself a global multinational company with a strong presence in almost every modern economy.
Because that's what happens when corporate charters stop being for the common good of the public.
Not always.
Many of the production centers that actually make the product aren't owner owned by the big contract (legally).
They're 100% around because of the big company and are frequently priced out of business because of what they demand, but they aren't owned by them.
It's the same reason Amazon started to franchise out it's last mile delivery - you let small business owners take the risk and then reap a disproportionate amount of the profit because of how one sided the negotiating power is.
