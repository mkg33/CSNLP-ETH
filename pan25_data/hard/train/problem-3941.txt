"Fine"?
Ok. Until you have to defend your home; having to frantically reload magazines while taking fire ... 10 rounds isn't much my friend.
And I'm a liberal gun owner.
My handgun can hold more rounds (17+1).
What is the point in capping rifles at fewer rounds than handguns?
To gun owners, so much of this seems completely arbitrary, and I seriously doubt any of this will make anyone any safer, it just seems like these types of laws serve two purposes: 1. to put a thumb in the eye of gun owners, and 2. to pay lip service to liberals who are upset about children being killed and need SOMETHING to be done, even if it won't help the issue they're mad about.
There is definitely a big chunk of “liberals” who don’t own guns and for some inexplicable reason don’t want anyone except the cops they don’t trust to own them.
Recent Illinois AWB for reference.
Whoever has the most guns isn’t necessarily going to win, but the side that’s preemptively and unilaterally disarming itself is probably the side that’s going to lose.
