Didn't the same happened in 1979, when the bazaar traders were angry enough to the Shah?
I hope they might be able to fund opposition activities inside Iran.
I can also direct you to the Iranian activists and accounts to follow if you want to stay informed.
Instagram and social media is how we are primarily spreading information.
People to follow are Tara Grammy, Nazanin Nour, Nazanin Boniadi, and Masih Alinejad.
Accounts to follow are @middleeastmatters , @iraniandiasporacollective, and @from_iran .
I know it seems silly to think a social media post can help, but this is the one movement where that is absolutely true.
Consistently for over a month that’s what I’ve been hearing from the people of Iran, talk about this and share what is happening on social media.
It creates awareness and doesn’t allow the regime to commit their atrocities in the dark.
There are also protests every weekend in dozens of cities all over the world.
They usually occur Saturdays and Sundays.
If you need help finding one, let me know or PM me where you are and I’ll find one for you.
