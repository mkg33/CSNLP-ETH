Honestly, it’s not even just attracting British workers.
Crop harvesting is serious skilled labor.
The speed, strenh, muscle memory, and attention to detail you need is nuts, and the conditions are hazardous at best.
Many folks would love to pretend otherwise, but you want skilled, seasoned workers for the gig.
A lot of these guys are highly skilled, see it as a trade and are perfectly happy with the work.
The U.K. is just another location before they work some places on mainland Europe.
He had guys who would come back to work on his harvests year after year from Eastern Europe.
They didn’t live in refugee camps for the rest of the year!
They would travel round Europe working on different crops throughout the year.
They were so, so much faster (and aware of how the equipment worked and how a farm runs etc.)
than students, convicts, the unemployed, remain voters, or whoever the Daily Mail suggests next.
There simply isn’t a world where a farmer is putting up a dozen people full time with benefits and pensions to help with a harvest.
