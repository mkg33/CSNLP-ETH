Clearly, we have wildly different definitions of what cop worship is if you actually believe that.
Cop worship is when people start talking about cops being infallible like god beings and needing no outside accountability for misdeeds, like a church.
Honoring people for doing a good thing in a time of incredible crisis is not that.
Like police officers who gave their bodies and lives in defense of a coup attempt.
The famous coup attempt where the media has to count suicide and heart attacks as murder because the only murder came from a trigger happy cop shooting a unarmed person.
Watching the dems become the party of "we love cops, the MIC and free speech needs to be curtailed' is wild.
people wanted accountability until the cops shot the right people.
Thats why this sub loves capitol police and no other cops.
Its not that they dislike unarmed people being shot, its that they want the right people to be shot.
I would say all this talk is "gaslighting" but its pointless here lmao.
I know you didnt even touch on free speech btw.
Good call lol.
Good.
Do this more often.
Leave 'em standing there like they have each other's dick in their hands.
Spineless cowards.
Like the lady said, they'd be on a plane to mar a lago to kiss trump's ring hand.
Good for them.
Good.
McConnell and McCarthy were complicit.
If either one had a spine January 6th would have NEVER happened.
