During vietnamese war,america bombed Cambodia to stop the northern vietnams supply route,there was no consequences for usa,so yeah it's Russia's fault,but as person whose country is leaning more toward east,it's annoying that west is judging russia mostly about things that can easily be proven that west also did recently.There are still many things that they can judge Russia for,but decide to be hypocrates,most of the time.
NO, you just essentially gave justification for Ukraine to bomb another country and try to blame it on Russia in hopes it incites war with NATO which would probably expand into a world war most likely the last war to ever be.
If Russia does bomb another country purposely fine go to war otherwise avoid if possible.
I sympathize with Ukraine but there is a line.
They are receiving Billions from us already.
I mean if it was Ukraine then they just killed a lot of their credibility but trying to blame Russia and bring nato into this.
I understand that Russia started it but drawing others into a war that they are not responsible for through devious means is gross.
