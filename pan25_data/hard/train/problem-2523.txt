Funny thing is his companies aren't really profitable.
They bleed more money than they make, if it weren't for subsidies they'd be dead.
Elon is more a salesman than an engineer.
He hypes things and doesn't deliver.
The only one that's successful is tesla, but I wouldn't say it's profitable.
He was the richest from speculation, not from actually earnings.
His other companies were scams at best.
Boring, solar city, Neurolink are scams like theranos.
People should really review the numbers before believing anything he says.
What has he delivered on?
Fsd, tesla semi?
His semi was delivered to a potato chip company, sounds like it can't handle real loads and will only be a niche truck for low payloads.
Musk just wants you to believe he's a genius, but it's like sbf and ftx under the hood.
Musk proves one again he's a far right nut job, who calls out a leading scientist who knows 101% more than Musk knows about health science.
Musk doesn't care that comments like this only embolden threats against respected scientist who's only goal is the health and welfare of Americans.
Glad I deleted my Twitter account.
Wish Musk would move to Moscow where he belongs.
Leave Twitter to the far right and find another social media outlet (like Reddit!
).
Right.
He’s a baron.
His greatest fear is that the government will regulate his businesses and, in the future, break up his launch provider monopoly, so he’s got to keep popular with the loud and angry libertarian wing.
