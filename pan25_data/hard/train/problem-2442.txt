No, you call it what it is.
Election denial conspiracies pushed by far right propaganda to create chaos within our democracy that has resulted in violence and coup attempts.
Election denial is a weaponized conspiracy to degrade democracy so that far right authoritarian movements can seize power and never give it up.
Many people and political leaders and propaganda media know its BS but still use it and push it as end game strategy of dismantling democracy in America.
You don't sit down at the table as equals with delusional, violent conspiracy nuts and let them spew out their delusions like they are one side of a legitimate debate with sound arguments and good faith.
Don't ask me to sit down at a round table with any of this madness to discuss ideas like civil, reasonable people, because ALL of these people have abandoned civility or reason or both and don't belong at said table, period.
There are some ideologies and political stances for which disdain is the only reasonable response.
To respond otherwise is to set aside reasonableness and willingly enable the shift of the Overton Window.
