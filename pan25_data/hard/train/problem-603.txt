What I said is that in absence of natural pollination in the field, farmers will have to depend on whatever solution Monsanto offers.
Including many of their agricultural products that don't need pollination.
It wouldn't be a surprise if Bayer is doing this.
After all, this is the company that knowingly sold HIV tainted medicine to people rather than lose money by destroying the batch.
Farmers have to buy seeds every season from Monsanto for whatever crops they want to grow.
Even if you use seeds from your own cultivation, the yield will drop.
By continuing their push on questionable insecticides and similar chemicals, they gain by wiping out farms that are not in their own system.
What I was referring to was the export of pesticides that are banned for use in Europe, because they are harmful to humans and useful insects like bees.
I would understand the outcry if they were exporting those pesticides to their colonies... but they are independent countries.
Why don't they just ban the importing of the harmful pesticides?
I mean, if you are given freedom, you are also given responsibility, right?
