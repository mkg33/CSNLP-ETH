Or our guns.
Or our Bibles.
Or our children.
Or our beef.
Or our gas HVAC systems.
Or our wealth.
Or our ability to speak out on social media.
Or our means of transportation.
Or our right to take or not take whatever vaccine we want to put in our bodies.
Could you apply this same logic to other things in life as well?
Like say deciding whether or not to take a vaccine if ALL the information is released to the public(and dissenting opinions not suppressed on social media sites by intelligence communities) and letting people decide what to do, and not punishing them, ostracizing them, or letting them participate in social activities of they decide not to take said vaccine?
I'm glad you said that.
Cuz I actually agree with you.
Let people make their own informed decision on what's best for them and their families.
I am a conservative and I don't want to destroy anyone.
In fact I mostly want to be left alone by both society and govt (whoever is in charge).
Is this mentality what you consider "a threat to democracy"?
I mean, it has nothing to do with trusting the science, and everything to do with letting people choose for themselves.
It has nothing to do with not trusting the science.
You can simultaneously believe that gas stoves contribute to increased risk of childhood asthma without agreeing that an outright ban is necessary.
The Inflation Reduction Act last year includes incentives for consumers to replace their existing gas stoves.
Maybe they believe informing the public , letting them decide what to do, and assisting those who want to change was sufficient.
