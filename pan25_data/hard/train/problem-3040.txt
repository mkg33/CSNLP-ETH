Because the vaccine he's keeping the rights to are hard to manufacture, and so he can withhold sharing until the manufacturer can show their facilities and training meet the standards needed to safely produce the vaccines as a precautionary form of quality control.
It's not a matter of "stupid and dirty" it's a matter of biting off more than one can chew and keep the public safe.
For example, there story of the brand new pharmaceutical plant in India that asked publicly if they could manufacture the vaccines shortly after the MRNA vaccine was developed.
That facility had the equipment and training to manufacture chemical medicines and (probably) conventional vaccines, but the equipment for the MRNA vaccines were basically prototypes that were custom made, so there was no way they could purchase, install, train and get verified for safety standards in a reasonable time frame (with respect to when they made the request).
For the MRA vaccines specifically, there were only a very VERY small amount of facilities in the world that were properly equipped to make them.
If Bill had shared the patent to other facilities, there would have been a flood of infective or even poisonous bootleg vaccines that would have made the situation worse and eroded trust in COVID vaccines as a whole.
he is quite literally singlehandedly responsible for the privatization of the covid vaccines so maybe work a little smarter next time at not doing that thanks.
I’m old enough to remember when he fought against waiving intellectual property protections for the vaccine so it could be produced en masse for countries that needed it.
It wasn’t even 2 years ago.
