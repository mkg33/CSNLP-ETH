Israel is an apartheid.
Palestinians in the West Bank get sentenced by an Israeli military court; while Israeli settlers get sentenced by Israeli civilian court.
It's needless to say that there's no equality in how Jews and Palestinians are sentenced.
Not to mention that Israel is enforcing its racist apartheid laws outside its borders and on Palestinian territories.
Not to mention the mass amount of destruction, horror and murder Israel does pretty much yearly in Gaza with impunity.
Gazaâ€™s Palestinians are oppressed by Hamas, and thousands of them go to Israel for work, with the Israeli approval, even if it costs a little in security for Israel.
I'm sure Israel would be more progressive if Palestinians did not elect terrorist groups like Hamas who want to take all aid money to launch rockets at innocent Israelis.
And they chose Hamas to be their autonomy, so Israel kinda controls what goes in, because otherwise Israel would have to deal with much more advanced missiles.
And Gaza is controlled by Hamas a terror group... Not controlling what goes in and out makes Hamas a huge threat for security.
Israel made Gaza a prison, controlling EVERYTHING that goes in and out.
Gazans can't leave Gaza without Israeli permission.
That means if a Gazan wants to travel abroad, well too fucking bad he can't.
