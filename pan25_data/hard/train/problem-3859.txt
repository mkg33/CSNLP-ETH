I recall reading about a case of transmission of CJD from a cornea transplant, from one human to another.
I am not an expert on this disease, but considering its severity, i would err on the side of caution and not take chances with blood donation.
We have to keep in mind that people receiving the blood are not healthy to begin with so anything that gets transmitted could very likely be lethal.
Worst case scenario, the test fails to catch it and someone receives HIV tainted blood.
All tests fail.
Current estimates are about 1 in a million blood transfusions in the US are with HIV tainted blood.
Which might not sound like a lot but given how many blood transfusions happen each year, it’s definitely still causing tragedies.
No, but if you’re a gay man your odds of having HIV are around 30x higher than the general populace.
These policies aren’t based on individuals they’re based on group data.
And in cases like this, virtue signaling literally trumping medical risk.
Of course they test it.
They test it in large batches, and then have to discard large batches when they fail the test.
The main problem is that no test is perfect.
False negatives happen.
Even today, about 1 in a million blood transfusions lead to HIV infections in the US.
Which might not sound like a lot, but there are a lot of blood transfusions happening.
blood tests are done in batches and in some cases not done at all ( at least where I am), there was a huge issue in the 90s with people getting hep from blood transfusions.
so, if you allow a high risk demographic to donate ((gay males being the highest), you will have to waste large amounts of donated blood.
