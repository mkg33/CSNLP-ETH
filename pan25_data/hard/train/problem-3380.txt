Land isn't capital and should be treated differently anyways.
Intellectually, capitalist ideologists used to be big against monopolies, and land is the most obvious monopoly we have.
There is no social benefit to be derived from private land ownership.
I feel like private ownership should be allowed, but just limit how much land one person or entity can own.
Limit how many commercial parcels one business may own, or how many residential parcels one person can own.
On the basic level, there needs to be some kind of private land ownership, or else business can't have any fixed offices/shops/factories/warehouses/etc.
But yeah I agree that it should be done via leases from the government, not freehold private ownership.
While I agree with the first part, there is no way any government would allow house prices to go down.
Both the government and its people have too much money invested into real-estate, and letting the house market crash nowadays would cause ridiculous effects on a country's economy.
