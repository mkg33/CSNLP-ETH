Oh boy, I’m going to have to disagree with your cancerous title, because Republicans looking the other way when other Republicans commit violence is just as bad.
Well, you’ll get downvotes from others, but you’ll get an award from me.
Thank you for standing up for sanity.
I had a similar path—I left the Republican Party—and while I still have a few conservative viewpoints, I’m now a “blue no matter who” guy.
So, I’ll take the downvotes for sticking with my party affiliation, but I won’t be lumped in with those traitorous assholes.
I’m a Republican and I was never with Trump.
I used to be the guy going door to door, hand out flyers, stood there to get petition signatures, got people registered, put out signs, do the grunt work.
The day MAGA showed up, I was Fucking gone.
Hell, I started checking out when Romney showed up in 2012.
Ive never been quiet about that and it lost me friends because they all ate up that MAGA bullshit.
I will admit, I can’t bring myself to say “blue no matter what” because it feels like swinging too hard in the other direction.
However, I have no problem voting blue at all.
Did with Obama in ‘12, Hillary in ‘16, and Biden in ‘20.
Most f my state was blue this year as well.
Glad to see my House Rep district flipped blue.
Even though that guy was the least problematic of the Republican Representatives Arizona has: Biggs, Gosar, and Lesko.
BTW, the latter two only won because nobody ran against them.
That’s a whole other issue.
