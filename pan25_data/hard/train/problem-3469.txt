As far as consequences, what consequences?
China knows we arenâ€™t going to sanction them.
So what are we going to do exactly?
China is committing what has been acknowledged as genocide in Xinjiang and literally nothing has happened to them.
So what consequences do they have to be afraid of?
The chances of the US imposing any significant sanctions on China are close to zero.
Our economies are much too intertwined.
We know this, and China knows this.
China has every reason to help Russia, they can make money selling weapons to the Russians and keep poking the US and Europe in the eye.
Plus a victory for Russia in Ukraine would open the door for China to invade Taiwan.
Though unlike Ukraine, my guess would would be that other nations would be far more willing to get directly involved in the fighting if Taiwan was invaded.
The USA will intervene if Taiwan is invaded.
I have no doubts.
Taiwan is just too damn important, strategically and symbolically.
Losing Taiwan would mean an open challenge to the American led world order and economy.
Letting this go without any military consequences would be a HUGE sign of weakness by the USA.
