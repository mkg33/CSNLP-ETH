My name is Ilya Yashin, a Russian opposition politician, whom the Kremlin has kept in prison since the middle of last summer.
I’ve been sentenced to 8.5 years of incarceration, because I publicly spoke out against the war in Ukraine.
But today I want to say a few words in defense of my nation.
Soon it’ll be a year since the start of the war that the Kremlin unleashed against Ukraine.
It has taken thousands of human lives, destroyed entire cities, and turned millions of families into refugees.
Vladimir Putin, as the one responsible for this tragedy, has become a true symbol of evil, cursed around the world.
But it also seems that, more and more often, the Russian people are treated as enemies.
The main claim against the Russians: You did not resist the aggressive policies of your government, and that makes you accomplices to crimes of war.
Of course there is no leaders or support because russian people widely support this atrocity.
As long as the person in question does not get mobilized he supports strong leaders actions.
