They’ve gotten high on their own supply.
Polls show that Dobbs isn’t even popular among Republicans and while the GOP voter base might not be willing to punish elected officials over that yet, others are.
They probably could run a progressive candidate to skim off some votes and win that way, but there really isn't anything stopping Dems from doing the same with a moderate Republican.
Centre right conservatism isn't even that unpopular with the electorate at large and could still win elections.
Only, the crazies they had in harness all these years finally switched places and bite their hand every time they try to reassert control.
Plus crazy contagion keeps eating away at the right's middle-minded voters - those who didn't do the sensible thing and vote against their general inclination to keep crazy out of power.
And that does not seem remotely logical given that republicans won every other election in the state, so clearly there were a lot of Republican voters who were refusing to vote for that man.
So they voted libertarian, but if they had been forced to rank they would have probably went ahead and held their nose and voted for Warnock 2nd.
Yeah, everyone who thinks that this will benefit republicans seem to be insisting that everyone who voted for the libertarian candidate in the last sign of election would have voted for Walker 2nd.
And they almost certainly will not go through with it because even the most casual examination of the data would show that it would not actually benefit them.
