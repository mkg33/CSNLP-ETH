Ukraine was also stashing weapons, ammunition and armed vehicles in the salt mines as well.. so obviously it does have strategic value and logistical value.
The Iraq invasion did have similarities to the Ukraine invasion in terms of geopolitical and geostrategic motives as well as breaking international law.
War crimes as well as humanitarian crisis happened in both wars.
Make no mistake, both sides of this war are suffering tremendous casualties, but it's for very different reasons.
Ukraine is fighting a much larger country, while Russia is constantly suffering from its own incompetence.
I can only assume all this Russian propaganda is meant for internal consumption because on the world stage is falls flat.
I notice ever since Russia got 600ish soldiers deleted at once there's been big news about the Ukrainians "losing" 500-600 at once.
There was an extremely embarrassing attempt right after they lost all those soldiers, claiming they killed the same number of Ukrainian troops in a dormitory.
