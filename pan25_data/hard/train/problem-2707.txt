Pew polling in May had <20% of the country in favor of a total abortion ban with no exceptions.
Which Republicans are going for.
Republicans will probably be over Trump, centering their party for Desantis.
Who even now polls very well against Biden.
Imo the nomination is Biden's if Biden wants it.
And he will have the benefit of incumbency advantage against any nominee the Republicans put up, unlike any new wildcard nominee.
The problem is, a generic centrist Republican is very unlikely to win the primary in today’s Republican Party.
True, but I really think this election cycle for republicans is an anomaly.
It’s something we have never seen before, but I’m willing to bet it’s either Trump (who has already announced his run) bullying people into not running or another Republican (most likely DeSantis) challenging him.
Either way, I don’t think a Republican can win this election cycle.
The midterms are more anti Republican than pro democratic, yeah.
I think it's just remarkable that voters still did that during high inflation and a rocky economy.
