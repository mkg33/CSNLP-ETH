You're not really disagreeing with me.
Yes, China produces a lot of CO2, a lot from making stuff for other countries, so that's our fault in a sense.
But they are also building big solar farms.
Yes, the Chinese could and should have better environmental controls.
But the USA was happy to turn the clock back on pollution and emissions in the Trump era, being reversed now, so isn't it hypocritical to demand China maintains standards?
The thing is, that all of those emission are just going to move somewhere else once China finishes the same economic shift that Western countries already went thorough in the 70s - 90s.
It shouldn't be: Hey you need to quit using coal NOW!
It should be: Hey you need to quit using coal now, so we'll sell you, or help you buy, solar panels and windmill turbines (or train nuclear engineers & plant operators) at a heavy discount so they become cheap enough to compete with coal.
We've proven that emissions aren't directly tied to economic gain, like previously thought, but many of the renewable technologies that are now widely feasible in wealthy nations are still prohibitively expensive elsewhere.
You've got to consider their wants and needs, alongside basic human nature, before you just demand they shut something off.
