I don't see much of a 180.
China has always been singing this song.
Ã€ la "Ukraine's territorial integrity must be respected, but NATO should stay out of the conflict and let Ukraine and Russia solve the conflict at the negotiation table", yadda yadda.
>One Year Into Ukraine War, China Says Sending Weapons Will Not Bring Peace Sitting on the fence and watching Russia abuse it's power to murder, terrorize and torture its neighbors is the best option for peace...
They dont want Russia to win, however they do want Russia to hold on for a while longer, they are hoping a drawn out conflict will bleed the west enough that they will loose there palate for similar endeavours and not react the same way if someone would hypothetically invade Taiwan.
I don't think it's paranoia to think China was watching the world's reaction to Russia invading Ukraine, due to Chinese desire to crush Taiwan's sovereignty.
The only peace that assholes like Putin and Xi Jinping care about, is one where they can seize land uncontested and murder anyone who stands up to their bullying.
