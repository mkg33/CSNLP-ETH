You are welcome to protest Congress, but Congress can also put reasonable limits on that expression.
I can talk about how our whole government needs to change; I cannot do it by running in front of traffic on the highway.
I am free to say I hate Biden’s guts, that he’s a moron, and that his policies are destroying us all; I don’t get to walk into the White House to tell him.
I am free to say that Justice Kavanaugh is a sexual predator and has no place on the court; we cannot have protests in courtrooms.
Literally nothing would ever get done.
Which, if you look at the next 240 years of Supreme Court decisions, that has been taken to mean, Congress shall make no unreasonable law regulating freedom of speech or free exercise thereof.
Reasonable regulation is totally fine.
Sincerely, -The Court.
I mean, it’s a court.
Don’t compare it against congress, compare it against other courts.
Congress is a body for representing the people and for discussion.
Courts are not.
The Supreme Court is somewhat harsher than lesser courts but it’s in the same vein.
Didn’t need an article for that.
If you think you can’t change the law (which is what protest is designed to do) then I don’t know why we are even talking about this.
And none of what you’re talking about here involves courtroom protests.
Those have always been a no-go.
