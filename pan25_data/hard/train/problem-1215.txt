Ironically, the Liberal party in Australia are conservatives.
Not a patch on the fucked-up shitty mess like in 'Murica, but still a bunch of bigots stuck in the dark ages.
Basically, there's going to be an indigenous person on the note rather than an irrelevant monarch from the other side of the world and a whole lot of racists are going to be bent out of shape.
No, people who object to the aboriginal flag being a part of the Australian flag once we become a republic, and as mentioned by someone else, people who will object to an indigenous person on the note.
Wait, so if it went to a poll and the majority of people didn't want the aboriginal flag incorporated, they are all racists and should be overruled?
My understanding is Aboriginal people are not keen on having their flag appropriated in this way (and also there are two flags that would need to be included this way, the Torres Straight Islanders).
It would be a totally new design.
If there was enough interest to really push it, which doesn't seem to be.
