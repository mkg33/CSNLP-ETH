These exports halted in October and their resumption/end of scheduled blackouts would be a major loss of face for the Russian military to war hawks at home.
"From my point of view, there is a line missing that would say: there should also be a withdrawal of Russian troops.

Yep.
China uses those semiconductor factories more than anybody today.
“Made in China” stickers should usually include “using Taiwanese microchips”.
“Capturing” a Taiwanese chip factory wouldn’t change who their clients are.
There’s simply no point in even trying.
Huge risk, zero reward.
And the second it might look like Taiwan might fall to a Chinese invasion, the Taiwanese would blow up those factories themselves, and the owners would re-build new ones somewhere else out of their reach.
Taiwan has the advantage of being an island, any attempt by the chinese would likely turn the chinese invasion fleet into hundreds of Moskvas fucking themselves to the bottom of the Taiwan Straits and thats before the economic and diplomatic damage they'd suffer too.
