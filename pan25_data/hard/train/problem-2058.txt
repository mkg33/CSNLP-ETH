If a couple has children, and only one of them works, or they work different schedules where one of them can always watch the children, they don't need paid caregivers.
Or if one of them has a sibling, a parent, etc, who helps provide care for free, or at a reduced cost.
If one of those parents dies, or the child's aunt/uncle, grandparent, etc, who helps care for them, dies, the child will now require paid care where before they did not.
A secondary caregiver is basically a grandparent or second parent who gives care to kids without being paid.
