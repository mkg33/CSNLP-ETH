Trump will try the old hits: childish nicknames of opponents, outrageous statements - but it won't be like 2016.
His MAGA slogans that tentposted the rallies - "Lock her up", "her emails" - land differently after actual espionage act violations in his resort basement.
Border threats to national security don't mean the same after an army of red-capped MAGAs tried to overthrow the government.
Some balloons pop with a bang after the birthday party.
Others lose their hot air slowly, limp and deflated in the corner of the room.
That'll be Trump.
Trump is done, alot can happen in 2 years.
It's going to be quite a Rollercoaster of failure as we all get to watch orange gargoyle destroy himself with his own hands.
The best part: they could read what im saying right now and it won't change a goddam thing.
They will do it regardless.
It's their nature.
We can all sit back now and just let them kill themselves.
It's literally what everyone has waited for over the past 5 years.
Full circle.
When that new person (Ronny D) can't match what Trump did and trump is dead and eaten, they will turn on eachother like the selfish sharks they are.
The "feast" ðŸ˜€ its already begun.
The richest people who funneled money and power to protect him are all leaving.
He's being thrown under the bus for someone new.
This is a historic and great turn of events for democracy.
