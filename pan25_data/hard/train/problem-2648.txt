It's also worth remembering that the House does play an active role in the presidential election.
We've already crossed the line where we can't just assume that they'll treat that as a sacrosanct function of government, political and nasty though said function may get.
There is a clear and present danger that a GOP House majority will abuse that role and do stuff that's straight-up tyrannical.
I know you’ll never have the capacity to understand but this is how tyranny begins and you proudly casted your votes for these maniacs.
Do you know how embarrassing it is to share a land mass with people who are as poorly informed and delusional as Trump’s zombie voting base is?
Congrats Republicans and dopey independents.
This is what 2 decades of reality TV did to your brains and your kid’s brains.
And please feel free to remind me about the time Democratic voters stormed a government building, hunted down lawmakers, brutalized law enforcement for 4 hours and smeared feces on the walls because I seem to be having a hard time recollecting that day.
