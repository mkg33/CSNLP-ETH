This is the most important part.
A lot of European countries' Transgender laws still have this stipulation, and - for example in Germany - there's a law in the making that would pay reparations to trans people that had to be chemically sterilized before being able to change their birth certificate, i.e.
name & sex.
I guess it depends on the importance you place on sex.
For general life, the only relevant distinction is creating children (and medicine, see later).
(There’s no real logic behind putting clothing/behavioral patterns stemming from socialization behind a ‘sex’/‘gender’ based differentiation).
Forgive me if I misunderstood the journal article you linked, but doesn’t it still formulate that there are two distinct sexes?
First up as you note yourself you have been incorrectly referring to it as biological sex.
Secondly the idea of bigotry comes form you suddenly bringing chromosomes into the conversation.
What does it matter, what business of yours is it what they keep in the nuclei of their cells?
Do you bring up sex chromosomes with cis-gendered people too?
Trans people have a much higher above average % of the population with "opposite sex" chromosomes compared to cis people.
Saying its down to chromosomes, when a large proportion of trans people have the correct chromosomes they identify with, doesn't make sense.
Trans people are well aware that their gender identity doesn't match their chromosomal sex, that's pretty much the essence of being trans.
And transphobes are incapable of defining what they mean by "sex" or "woman" that doesn't include some trans women and exclude some cis women.
