Would you call it a rousing success with Iran/Russia/Nk?
They’re still building missiles made of us/eu parts and they’re about to launch an invasion of over 300k troops.
They just made a deal with India to produce more guns and ammo and of course we’re going to do jack shit to India.
Sanctions cause pain and but eventually they adjust to it and it becomes the new normal.
Iran has been sanctioned since 1979 brother and they’re still being shit heads.
Sanctions were never going to make Russia withdraw from Ukraine especially since they can still trade with India and China.
Never said they wouldn’t be worse the parent comment is said to make Russia withdraw.
Sanctions will never make Russia withdraw nor do they make rogue nations behave.
No one thought Putin was going to cower in fear at the sanctions and order a full withdrawal.
What it does do is make this continued war a lot less economically sustainable and creates more internal pressure from the people who are pissed at both the economy going to shit and all their money and friends being blown up in Ukraine.
