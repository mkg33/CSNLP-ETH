Fair maps may not be enough to completely flip the legislature blue like in Michigan, WI is still very purple, but at least it'll give us far more accurate representation and make the Republicans actually have to do their damn jobs.
The GOP doesn't care about trying to win people over, they just want their people in power.
That mindset led to the blue wave last year.
They feel like they HAVE to appeal to the extremists, and the average Wisconsin voter just does not want that.
If there was ever a time to convince young and/or uninformed Wisconsinites to vote, NOW IS THE TIME.
My family is moderately conservative (if you can fairly call it that anymore) but have slowly been becoming more progressive over the years.
When the topic of abortion comes up, they always say there’s no way it’ll go away… until it did and is in many places.
Now that they know what’s at stake, they are all asking questions and are starting to realizing that the people they’ve historically voted for actually don’t have their (or most anyone’s) best interest in mind.
Please, please, PLEASE don’t let us go further back than we already have, Wisconsin.
This may very well be our last chance to protect democracy in our state.
