First time I heard about covid was during Hong king protests where there was a side note of hospitals getting more patients catching new infection and struggle ing to treat protesters too.
Still hear people say ‘just recovered from covid guess I’m more immune now’ and I have to break it to them it can make you weaker to the next infection or get long covid.
There’s been studies on risk of reinfection it’s still being studied and cause being looked at.
Purely anecdotal I got covid once and six months later I felt it still and getting mildly sick knocks me out.
It might not be same for everyone but it’s a risk.
There’s more evidence for some that reinfection rises risk of hospitalisation which doesn’t mean your bodies adapted.
Nah we can have this population and find alternatives to resource it more safely.
But industrial scale farming and logging industries make more money even if it has risk of unleashing pandemics.
If you have contact with farmers, and money, you can basically guarantee yourself a supply of foods even in the case of an apocalypse.
Shortages are due to people panic stocking (what happened with Covid, as supplies actually came in just as they always did).
