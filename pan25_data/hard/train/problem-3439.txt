Don't kid yourself into thinking he just came up with the idea.
I'm sure he came up with the idea of reinstating Trump milliseconds after considering the idea of buying Twitter.
Trump is getting reinstated on Twitter, we shouldn’t pretend that we have a choice in the matter, regardless of whether you click yes or no on that poll.
Also Musk: A poll on Twitter is a perfect way to understand public sentiment, and whether I should reinstate a threat to American democracy.
Musk: Twitter is filled with mostly bots so I shouldn’t have to pay the absurd price I myself suggested.
The only time Twitter has been profitable was 2018 and 2019 when Trump was at his wackiest, but wasn’t getting people killed like in 2020.
They made $1.2B and $1.4B respectively in profit.
Of course Trump is coming back, the poll is just a distraction to make it seem like it’s what the people want.
For those playing along at home, that’s almost enough to service the $1.5B in yearly interest that Musk has to pay on the giant loan he has for the site.
