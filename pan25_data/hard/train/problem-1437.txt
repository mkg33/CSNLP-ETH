As a Finn I would say that I'm not surprised that the flag burning episode happened.
But I can't imagine Finnish authorities obeying Russia in this situation.
I wonder, can't Russia really tolerate this?
They are after all burning one country right now.
No, this flag thing is just Finnish culture.
This is not some oppression thing, because all nations have some kind of culture.
That is not oppression.
Existence of a culture.
But cultures are what they are.
Why should we be like the others in this thing?
Who says that they are right and we are wrong?
Who can be the judge?
I personally like it, that people are forced to show some respect at least in some situations.
And this is not a big thing for me.
I just can't see any real reason to change anything, because people will survive even if they are not allowed to burn a flag.
ðŸ˜Š.
Well, well, well...
They don't have resources to attack us, so I'm not worried.
But this is a long problematic tradition.
That's how Russia has always behaved.
They are very sensitive about everything happening in Finland.
I wonder if Russia remembers how Finland has handled their interference in the past.
Maybe Russia should keep to themselves.
They need all the help they can get considering the west is handing them their ass in Ukraine.
