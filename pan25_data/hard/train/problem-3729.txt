“The complete collapse of the Thwaites itself could lead to sea level rise of more than two feet (70 centimeters), which would be enough to devastate coastal communities around the world.
But the Thwaites is also acting like a natural dam to the surrounding ice in West Antarctica, and scientists have estimated global sea level could ultimately rise around 10 feet if the Thwaites collapsed.”.
>“A 2021 study found the ice shelf could shatter within the next five years, and last year scientists said the Thwaites Glacier is hanging on "by its fingernails" as the planet warms, with the potential for rapid retreat in the coming years”.
“While it could take hundreds or thousands of years, the ice shelf could disintegrate much sooner, triggering a retreat of the glacier which is both unstable and potentially irreversible.”.
Over the time-scale of 500-2000 years (or sooner, depending on emission, melting, and warming trajectories), if the west Antarctic ice sheet were to completely melt away, it alone would contribute around 3.3m of water to global sea levels.
The portion of that 3.3m increase which would be contributed by the Thwaites glacier is thought to lie somewhere in the region of 1-1.6m.
The Thwaites glacier is part of the western Antarctic ice sheet, the melting of which is one of the defined 'tipping points' in the climate system.
Because the ice sheet is separated from bedrock by a layer of warming seawater, once the melting starts, it will be very difficult to reverse.
In the short-term, the collapse of this glacier would decrease albedo and probably increase the melt-rate of the newly ocean-bound portion of the glacier.
The melt rate of the rest of the remaining ice sheet would also increase.
It is unknown at what rate these would occur.
