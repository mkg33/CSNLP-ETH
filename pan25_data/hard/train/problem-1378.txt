Then you didn’t read my comment.
From the downvotes on this article, I surmise nothing but good news is acceptable.
HuffPost’s coverage of this is shit and needed to be called out.
Fuck me for trying.
Here’s the last sentence of the article, which I am criticizing in my comment.
But I guess subtly is too hard for people who only read headlines and not the articles: “Doctors said he was recovering well, cognitively healthy and capable of serving, but the campaign of rival Mehmet Oz turned his health into an issue and aides to Oz outright mocked Fetterman over it.”.
It was a cruel, stupid argument from “Dr.” Oz/Republicans trying to capitalize on another candidate’s (Fetterman’s) untimely health issues.
Glad the voters of PA didn’t fall for it.
That “unfit to serve” nonsense never made sense to me.
If I were a Democrat voter in PA, I’d never vote for Oz because of Fetterman’s health.
Either way, I get the representation and votes for Democrat policies.
No way voting for Oz would have ever done that.
