They are more likely to destroy TSMC in the process.
Which is still not too bad because it would force shifting to China for alternatives, such as they are.
It would also cause a major depression in global economy as supply chains collapse but China is willing to risk that (maybe).
That's why people are talking about globalism dying.
The reason "we" have all our eggs in one basket is that globalism promotes this as it is more efficient.
If they take TSMC, then they effectively has a leverage over the global economy that they can politically utilize.
Except China invested the money it got from this into becoming a superpower who is (potentially) willing to fuck up the global supply chain to get what it wants.
That's what is really dumb from China to complain, when they put a ton but a ton of its and buts for every company that wants to do business in China.
Here's a hint China; if you're dependent on the US, don't start grandstanding like you're the new big boy on the block.
The US was happy to play nice until China started eyeing Taiwan.
