- I don't know if Santos has a drug dealing history, but Trump's company, "Trump Special Services" (for high rollers at his casinos) was caught with 1500 kilos of coke in his helicopter.
- I don't know if Santos was ever destitute, but Trump has said his net worth was less than zero at times during the 1990s (until he perpetrated a massive stock fraud, where he issued worthless stock to his creditors).
- Both Trump and Santos have lied about their maximum net worth, exaggerating by about a factor of ten in each case.
A lot of Trump's lies are gross exaggerations with grounding in reality, whereas Santos' are entirely made up.
Actually, looking at the list of accusations, all backed up by evidence against both persons, I wound have to say that Trump takes the prize for breadth of lies.
There is plenty of evidence that shows that Republican voters are more than willing to elect liars/frauds, even with damning evidence of it being the case.
They vote Party purity over values, all the damn time.
