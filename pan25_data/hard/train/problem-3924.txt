No kidding.
I had to wait over 30 hours in the ER to get a room because they were full to the brim with unvaccinated rednecks dying of covid.
They were at such high capacity that they had hospital beds in the hallway.
And this was the largest hospital in the area.
Needless to say, we didn't have unions (at-will state let the company sniff out any union threats).
Last heard they were still desperate for help but hr refuses to walk back that policy.
I used to work in a hospital, last spring they changed it from "you get Covid on the job so you're out for 10 days paid".
I got sick shortly after they changed the policy to "you get sick you're out 5 days paid, better be here on day 6."
To the policy before I left that changed it to "you get Covid that's your own fault, we'll deduct it from your sick time and if you aren't salaried/don't have enough saved up you better not get more than 3 consecutive sick days if you are scheduled or else you're out."
The last is shit for everyone, but was particularly weaponized against the working class scrubs (custodial/transport/food) who often don't have that time saved up because it was fucking hard to get working part-time or even full-time if you are in the company for less than a few years.
