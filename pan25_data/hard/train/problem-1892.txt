They’re doing it ALL the time for years and decades.
They launch rockets and hide weapons in schools and hospitals in order to prevent IDF from striking there.
They’re are using their kids and the sick people as a human shield.
The IDF are doing the maximum they can to prevent hurting innocent people, but that’s exactly why it’s almost impossible when Hamas and Jihad use their own innocent people in such way.
LOL it’s so funny to see all the surprised people here.
“Why would the Palestinians put their children at risk?” “That should be condemned”.
So your point is the people setting up rocket launchers around schools and hospitals are not Palestinians?
You are blaming Israel for Hamas putting rocket launchers next to schools?
In what way has Israel forced Hamas to do this?
Because that would mean bad press for Israel when they "destroy a school" or children die, and that means more power for Hamas.
I’m talking about Hamas and Jihad of course, they are the ones in charge in Gaza.
They don’t give a shit about their kids.
Heck, they would prefer kids to get injured and die for their shallow, stupid and cheap propaganda.
