Food sanction would end this massacre really quick.
No Russians will support the government that can’t feed its own people.
Edit: btw I don’t mean wait and watch people starve until Russian leadership begs.
I mean send the ultimatum.
Russian leadership will realize they will be overthrown in a matter of days should that be the case.
Then bring them to the negotiating table.
Foreign aid/continuation of medical and food stuffs in return for xyz.
We can agree to disagree.
If the country is Russia right now I don’t see moral qualms with limiting drug exports aside from specifics which are not produced in Russia at all or with a sufficient alternative.
The west right now is trying to, rightfully, destroy Russian industry and economy.
That directly hurts individual Russians.
So does limiting medicine imports.
Just because you don’t have to acknowledge that poorer areas of Russia are seeing malnutrition and worse life conditions right now from the other sanctions doesn’t mean it’s not what we are causing (tbh Putin causing it all through unjustified aggression and slaughter).
That’s because individual Russian make up the Russian economy and therefore the war machine.
It’s the whole point of sanctions.
Did y’all really think this wasn’t hurting Russian citizens and causing some to skip or miss meals?
Everyone freaking out over this but have no problem with sanctions that reduce the food in the mouths of the youth i affected countries.
It’s the same thing and still the most peaceful path.
