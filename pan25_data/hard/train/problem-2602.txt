At some point we need to build momentum for the actual nominee though.
By this time in 2019 we had multiple potential candidates already campaigning.
We probably don't need to start that early, but we do need some time to select a nominee that people actually choose (not Biden declining nomination in April 2024 and just bequeathing it to Harris).
biden doesn't need to win a primary in 2024 (unless he's earned himself a progressive primary challenger), he needs to win a general.
against a republican with actual party support/enthusiasm.
the most-generous and most-recent figure i can find is 37% in favor.
makes running again decidedly not a winning move.
buttigieg & harris are nowhere near viable candidates either.
the party would have a viable candidate if it was willing to give up on running boomers into the ground.
Let us have 4 more years of a damn good politician and progress and we’ll talk in 2028 about a younger, Democrat president.
I would like a younger president with more modern views who hasn’t been corrupted by decades in politics.
