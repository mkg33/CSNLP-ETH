Seems to me like people don't understand sanctions.
Sanctions don't make it impossible for a country to obtain banned goods, they make it more expensive and time consuming.
There will always be a way around sanctions in a complex, global economy, but that doesn't mean they're not working.
Well, yes apparently on this sanctions regime, but you see very effective solutions out there.
Take NAFTA import duty-free terms and conditions (I'm a career functionary) as an example.
You have a penalties associated with breaches of the trade rules, and the income from the penalties are respendable revenue to bolster the auditing programs.
So catching these guys is not just a slap on the wrist, it's a slap on the wrist, a hit to the pocket, and a guarantee that they'll be back for more.
Those assholes wanting to risk making a quick buck end up paying the enforcement cost.
Ask a Canadian or American about cross-border purchasing.
If they do it, they know the rules, and they follow them.
Okay, it's the least we could do, but can we do more?
Seems to me like this would just be a never-ending game of whack-a-mole, and stupid expensive to administer too.
