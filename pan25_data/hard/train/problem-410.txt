Please be honest here, are you part of a Chinese propaganda machine?
Or are you saying Taiwan specifically should shrink its borders because these islands aren't mainland?
And what are your thoughts on all the other countries that claim territory far from the mainland?
It is up to indigenous populations to determine whether they conform or rebel.
To single Taiwan out in a world dominated by multinational imperialism is just strange to me.
The term Taiwan is a geographical and not a political.
It only includes the main island.
Although in media the whole whole territory controlled by the ROC government is referred to as Taiwan doesn't mean it's correct.
It's like calling UK England or calling Scottish people English.
What media calls Taiwan includes two provinces: Taiwan and Fujian, which includes Taiwan.
The Kinmenese don't identify themselves as Fujianese and not Taiwanese.
It won't change who rules over them or where their government sits.
You don't call every American Washinonian do you?
Why?
China=/= Chinese mainland.
Taiwan=Taiwan.
What is so difficult to understand?
Like UK=/= England, but England= England.
