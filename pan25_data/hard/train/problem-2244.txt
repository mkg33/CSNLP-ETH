They're in a tough spot.
Bannon's strategy of "flood the zone with sht" carried over into 2022 polls, with a lot of new right-wing pollsters forecasting bigger GOP gains.
They met criteria and were not way outside other polls - its not like non-partisans were polling a blue wave - so they couldn't exclude them, so it weighed down their model.
Their defense was bad - they said Dems could do the same thing but aren't as if that validated the bad GOP polls - but ultimately fixing the model is going to be hard when polling has become a bad-faith activity for one party.
I'm sick of people EXPECTING close to 100% of us to support democrats, and then blaming us if democrats lose, because 10% of us voted republican a few times.
Republicans had worse results than expected but in overall mid term votes they beat Dems by 3 million — they just weren’t in places that affected the results.
Overall very sad because the Democrats are the only sane option even if they aren’t awesome in absolute terms.
Of course the Republicans don’t really have anything to offer black and Hispanic voters besides racism and further exploitation, but the Democrats— once again— tend to shoot themselves in the foot on messaging.
It is your attitude that the Democratic Party advances the careers of black people instead of black people advancing themselves that more and more black peoples are finding repugnant.
