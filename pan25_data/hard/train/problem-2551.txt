Funny you're oblivious to democracy being under attack around the world.
It's already happened in Europe - see Hungary.
The US just saw an attempt to overthrow the Constitution.
Democracy in Brazil has been under constant attack.
None were by left leaning people.
Does it happen?
Of course.
It's just far more likely and is happening with right leaning people.
We are talking about nations that overwhelmingly support democracy and have been democratic for a long time being manipulated with propaganda to erode the systems that have made their country very successful.
Your comment makes no sense.
Quite bluntly, fair as considered by you.
The people who did not vote are not voters, so it is fair to say the majority of voters wanted it.
Part of free democratic governance is allowing people to make the decision not to vote.
You're quite literally being anti-democratic by parroting that arsehurt nonsense (N.B.
This argument was never seriously made until a bunch of pseudo-intellectuals realised the above while furiously grasping at straws).
The alternative to a huge abstainment number is compulstory voting, and the places which tend to have that are lovely '''democracies''' like the DPRK, USSR, and a good chunk of South America (yes, there are a few exceptions, but very few).
If you lump in 'people who didn't vote' with 'opposition', then there's basically never been a democratically elected government anywhere in history, as everywhere with free elections has a huge abstainment number.
And this is completely normal and fine.
