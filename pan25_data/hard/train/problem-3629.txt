>PFEIFFER: Yes, it was.
To qualify for a loan, you just had to say you thought you needed it and to get it forgiven, you did not have to prove the money was necessary.
I know it's tempting to draw the comparison because they're both loans and one is being forgiven while the other is not.
But PPP is basically a loan in name only.
It's really a grant program which borrows a loan structure.
The main reason it was done this way is to get the money out quickly while leaving the due diligence to be done on the backend by the SBA upon application for forgiveness, and providing a simple mechanism to claw back "grants" which the applicant was not truly eligible for, by simply keeping it as a loan.
Note the way I phrased it: "an incentive not to fire."
Because one of the very few ways to fuck up your PPP forgiveness prospects was to not keep your payroll going.
There was a lot of abuse of the PPP loan, what is sad is for some it was a lifeboat.
Where I work, a non profit, got 2 loans.
The first was while we were closed down for 6 months due to state regulations and could not be open as usual.
Nearly all that money went to pay staff to "work from home" and the rest went to pay utilities.
That ate up 100% of our loan.
During this time we were able to provide some services that the state allowed such as free childcare for essential workers/medical workers, hosted 5-6 Red Cross blood drives, did numerous critical supply drives for families that could not get out of their homes and had a program taking supplies to elderly people.
Meanwhile our income went down about $600k in 2020.
