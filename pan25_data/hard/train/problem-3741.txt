Not necessarily.
There were plenty of "almost nuclear war due to a misunderstanding" during the Cold War.
Having the UN as a glorified meeting table for the entire world has done wonders for the logistics of modern diplomacy.
Yes, in an ideal world, we can keep global "peace" without having to deal with 3 countries that have agendas that they would prioritize over peace.
The UN is not perfect but it does work to promote peace and human rights; it does a lot of good in this world.
It's not ideal but we have to work with something.
The issue people seem to not understand is that the countries in the security council would simply not be in the UN if they couldn't be in the security council.
There's literally 0 reasons for them to be in the UN without it, yes even for the US, because no sane world power would limit their own sovereignty.
The reality at the end of the day is that these are great powers with sovereignity, they aren't going to do anything they don't want to unless they are forced to.
In our own lives, laws and judges only have meaning because the police enforce their will, and they have a monopoly on violence.
If the police could only advice and request that people follow the law, the law would be meaningless.
The veto is not an issue, simply because without it there wouldn't even be a meaningful UN.
Countries like China, the US, Russia etc aren't going to join a diplomatic body with the ability to censure them.
