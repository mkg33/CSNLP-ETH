Had he taken out the US flag that they handed him and waved it, Putin may have gone full Strangelove then and there.
Of course Putin wouldn’t have gone Strangelove then and there, but it’s kind of how extreme those symbols are.
Washinon has basically beat Moscow, and it’s not because it forced it, but because Slavic people did.
Arguably, the Slavs closest to Russians and the ancient homeland of the Russians themselves, Kyiv, has picked Washinon over Moscow, and Russia can’t do anything about it.
Ukrainian flag safely in Washinon would be pretty fucking historic.
Ukraine is THE Russian satellite state.
Even more than Poland and Belarus, because Russia’s nationalist ideology holds that Ukraine as a nation doesn’t even make sense.
People who call ukranian nazis can't even explain who exactly ukranians are underminining.
They say "russian speaking people", but I AM a russian speaking ukranian living in Kiev, and the only ones who ever tried to take away my life and freedom were russians themselves.
