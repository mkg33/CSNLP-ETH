No German political figure will hesitate to condemn the German actions in WW2.
Japan dances around this issue instead of using simple, direct language condemning Japan's actions in WW2 over and over again.
I see no reason to dictate to Japan on what to do, but they are aware every time they push the "WWII was like this" button, China/Korea(s) will react the way they been reacting.
But then there were some cooperation between ROC and Japan near the end of the war--they both hated the communists so ROC actually requested Japanese troops to maintain order until ROC troops can take over...an act that may forever doomed ROC control of China.
Japan offered but the ROC refused, and later the PRC refused war reparations in exchange for accepting a massive amount of infrastructure funding poured in from Japan, and a formal declaration to not recognize the ROC in a Joint Communique held in 1972 in beijing.
It was refused because Japan instead poured a ton of money into Chinas infrastructure and a formal declaration from Japan to not acknowledge the ROC and the rightful rulers of China.
Read up on the 1972 Joint Communique between Japan and China.

There has been a series of studies at Stanford on East-Asian textbooks, they fairly explicitly said that Japanese textbooks were by some margin the most honest and least nationalistic.
