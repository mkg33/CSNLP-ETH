Israel makes most of it's stuff including some of the best weapons in the world from the TAR rifle to the Merkava tank to drones, etc.
Also it's ridiculous to think Israel needs the US support in regards to weapons and it will have any effect whatsoever.
Israel also develops weapons and weapons systems the US depends on, contrary to Reddit fantasies it’s a functional alliance.
“Israel should be told that, while the United States will continue to support its ally’s legitimate security requirements, it will not provide offensive weapons or other assistance for malign Israeli actions in Jerusalem or the occupied territories,” the pair wrote in the Washinon Post.
Daniel Kurtzer, a former US ambassador to Israel under George W Bush, and Aaron David Miller, a US Middle East peace negotiator during several administrations, have called for what they described as an “unprecedented and controversial” break from America’s largely unconditional military and diplomatic support for Israel if “the most extreme government in the history of the state” pursues the stated aims of some of its members.
Two former senior US diplomats have made a highly unusual call for the Biden administration to cut weapons supplies to Israel if the incoming far-right government uses them to annex Palestinian land, expel Arabs or finally kill off the diminishing possibility of a Palestinian state.
