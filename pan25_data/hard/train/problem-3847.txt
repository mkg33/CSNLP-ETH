Exactly, I am a shook, that so few Russian, caught on.
Like, they must know at some level, that all the things they accuse Ukrainians and West of, are happening in Russia.
Pretty weird to state that when Putin's own words during the televised part when he declared war on Ukraine was saying he is going to solve "The Ukrainian Question".
>Using Ukraine as a proxy, he said, "they we are waging war against our their country with the same task: the 'final solution' of the Russian Ukrainian question".
This is actually a comparison for the Russian war in Ukraine.
Democracy in Ukraine is destabilizing to the Russian regime.
Ukraine flexing their sovereignty is a threat to there military bases and control of the black sea.
Just like the US fights the regimes in Iraq/libya/Nicaragua/serbia/etc to maintain their power and vision, Russia wants to do the same with ukraine/syria/georgia/etc.
While Russias wealth and standard of living increased post 1991 with open markets they quickly faded in international relevance.
This has been quite the hit to Russian pride.
The Ukraine war is Russia's way of saying we don't want the west to tell us what to do.
We have the right to force our system on our area of influence.
