Exactly.
They can pat themselves on the back all they want to.
I'll believe things have changed in Memphis (or everywhere else) when cops stop doing crap like this or when they do WHITE cops are immediately fired and charged.
When we start seeing the shift to white officers getting charged immediately after and then fired... then I think your comment will really start to apply.
Not until then.
Same, I don't see them being fired immediately for something like this, or charged if they were white.
Well let's see the video tomorrow I think it's being released?
If the video is insanely clear cut, then it will be a little bit easier to see but I'd still have some doubts.
I agree in a lot of ways, the only thing that gives me any doubt is the video.
If it's as bad as it sounds and all the warnings and shit?
Then maybe if they were white?
Maybe shit would be at least somewhat similar?
It's hard to really know, but my guess based on what has happened previously is the cops suspended with pay then maybe get charged later.
