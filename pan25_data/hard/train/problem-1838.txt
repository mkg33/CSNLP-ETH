Also it is hard to draw this line, since USA, France and some other Western countries invaded and bombed regimes they disliked, and nobody banned them from anything.
And if Russia had as much global influence as USA has, nobody would dare to ban it.
Because might is the only international law that matters.
It matters, because when everyone calls to ban Russia from everything, and everyone is silent when USA and its allies do the same things, it looks very hypocritical.
Russia has nukes, we can not attack them and an offensive war against Russia is an impossibility, morally and practically.We are sanctioning them as a result of that, cutting off all ties that can be cut off.
It seems that not allowing russians into games would fit that idea of balance between our opportunities and the moral implications of the war.
Should we allow Putin to show the athletes on national TV, tell the russians and his soldiers that russians are being accepted and perhaps winning medals out in the world?
Ignoring that they don't have the russian flag on their uniforms?
