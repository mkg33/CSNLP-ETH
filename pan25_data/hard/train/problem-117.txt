Just take a look at the Netherlands.
VVD is the conservative liberal party, while D66 is the progressive liberal party.
Fun thing about using "progressive" instead of "liberal" is that in many European countries you can use both to describe a party.
"Progressive" is a word Americans use to describe themself when they're left-leaning.
AOC is progressive.
Bernie Sanders is a progressive.
Their supporters are progressive, their ideals are progressive.
Tucker Carlson would never, EVER, use the word "progressive" in a positive light.
He would hate the idea of anyone perceiving the entire American population as embracing the word.
People started using it in the U.S. as an alternative to "liberal" because Republicans successfully gave them the idea that it was a word that people are afraid of.
The sort of Americans that you're referring to that loathe things like Universal Healthcare, though?
They HATE "progressives.
".
So, it's not true that "Americans" think of themselves as progressive.
The chunk of the population that wanted Bernie Sanders to be president thinks of themselves as progressive.
It is NOT a word that you would see someone with a red MAGA hat being proud to adopt.
To be fair, it's possible to evolve in a bad direction (Hell, we were doing it ourselves up until Tuesday, and may yet still be) ... if this country went all-out MAGA, I would be the one advocating for a change "back," but the truth of the matter is that the reasons for wanting to hold onto the past are \usually\ more emotional than rational.
