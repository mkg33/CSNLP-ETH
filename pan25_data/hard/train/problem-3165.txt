- Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 separate times to permanently raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit â€“ 49 times under Republican presidents and 29 times under Democratic presidents.
The debt ceiling was raised 3 times under Trump.
- The debt in question is debt we already owe.
That's why it would be a default.
The GOP is hoping a majority of Americans are unable to realize this simple fact.
Dems shouldn't budge an inch on this if it comes to it.
There's no basis, and there's nothing to stop the GOP from asking for more concessions if given any.
Maybe some republicans will go independent and caucus with dems to prevent it, but that is no guarantee.
Biden is doing the same thing as past dems by reducing the debt and moving towards a surplus, republicans are looking to disrupt it again.
This is a repeating pattern where dems balance the budget and pay down debt and republicans skyrocket the debt any way they can the second they have the power to do it.
With the debt ceiling never being an issue when a Republican is in the office... Then being a reason to drag every cycle to a halt when it's not a republican president.
Why would a democrat even bring it up in a conversation.
It's a mythical fear tactic at this point.
