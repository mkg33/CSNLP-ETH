“Plenty” is an overstatement.
He has incredibly high support for a world leader.
I know Reddit likes to think that Russian people all despise him and want peace, but that is largely not the case.
I kind of like reason three the most as it shows how bad things are in russia.
There is no talent left, as everyone with a half a brain has left the country.
The real reason could be something very different.
With sanctions, and western and russian professionals no longer working (left the country) at various jobs the real reason could simply the lack of proper maintenance and work safety.
Fires and "odd" explosions could be the work of russians who are against the regime, or by Ukrainian infiltrators.
Both of these are quite the obvious as a reason why things blow up all the time in russia.
Either way, we can probably expect lots of these explosions and fires in the coming weeks and months.
While it won't always be so explosive, I expect to see this a lot in the coming years.
This is what a collapsing state looks like.
Could also just be insufficient resources.
No amount of competency can get 100% out of 86%.
As more people, materials and logistic lines funnel into the war effort, the resources to keep things working simply aren't there.
