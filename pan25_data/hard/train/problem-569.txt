Funny that the right wing media, Hannity included, never asked Kemp to recuse himself in 2018 when he was secretary of state and ran against Abram for governor of Georgia.
Just like the right wing media and Republicans said you can't seat a SCOTUS judge in an election year and then proceeded to ram Amy Coney Barett through to the SCOTUS a few months before the 2020 election.
If you watch the video, Hannity said Hobbs should have recused herself because she is the secretary of state.
Lmao Sean Hannity whining about how Katie Hobbs should have recused herself from her Secretary of State job to run for Governor.
Yeah, because he made the same demand of Brian Kemp.
Because he’s been making the same demand of Clarence Thomas who repeatedly votes against cases to investigate a coup involving his own wife.
That’s why this Supreme Court as its made up will never be legitimate and why people see it.
Republicans manufactured an arbitrary standard to deny a sitting President so much as an up or down vote on his nominee almost a year out from an election, claiming it was too soon; only to completely go back on their new rule and ram Barrett through days before Election Day, after early voting had already started.
Fucking pukes.
