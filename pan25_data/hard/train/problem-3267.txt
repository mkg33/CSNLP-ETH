If we didn't send them our overstock, we would have to spend a ton of money carefully disabling and destroying it after 2025.
This is actually saving the US military money because we just need to pay airfare to get it to Ukraine and the AFU will safely dispose of it for us for free by delivering it directly to Russian positions.
Most of what's in Ukraine is old stuff that the US military can afford to release from their stocks because it's either going to expire or about to be replaced with something better.
For example, a big chunk of the HIMARS rockets that we are sending them are due to be decommissioned by 2025 and replaced with much longer range versions.
People don't realize Russia and China are only this obsessed with hypersonics because US missile defense has progressed to the point that it has seriously degraded their nuclear deterrent.
Most of Russia’s big birds are toast at this point, and Patriot has the added complication of being an anti-nuclear system that could represent a very real defensive escalation (and not just the Russia-said-so variety of “escalation”).
Realistically speaking Patriot systems will likely be used in a pinch to defend against drones and cruise missiles as most of Russia's ballistic missiles have already been expended, and Ukraine would likely use every means possible to defend every air attack.
Those don't really exist, as you've seen earlier in the war, countries are only giving Ukraine air defense systems after other, safer, NATO countries loan them their own air defense systems or promises to patrol their skies more often with fighter jets.
