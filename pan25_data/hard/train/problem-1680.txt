It's important to remember that it isn't solely a fight for women's rights.
It's a fight for so many things such as freedom of religion, freedom of political expression, and the list goes on.
The women are honestly the spark that lit this fire, and they've shown how strong they are.
The protests aren't solely about women's rights by any means.
Western media is kind of messing up on this.
Women though importantly have had a huge role in this, and I think many anti-Islamic Regime Iranian men would agree.
what your saying makes absolute no sense , the woman have far less rights then men in Iran, men are more free their and if you want to speak about deaths , I would say you could debate a lot of children died, but they rape the women.
So then those who are protesting with them and dying in far greater numbers had less reason to be out there and yet are far more willing to die for these women?
Wow, sounds like they should be honored even more...you know instead of just the protestors in iran.
Bc ppl from iran are celebrating this.
They are not agreeing with this western take.
This did start with a single issue the death of a woman for not wearing a headscarf.
And it grew the women of iran started the protests and men showed up to cheer them on.
Now it is bigger and they are all striking for change.
women of Iran deserved this award for this year.
If you watch videos on newiran youd see it is the men standing up for the women that is actually the point chanting women freedom life etc.
supporting when women do their protests.
In a society where men are in control, it is surprising to say the least that the men stood up for and supported when women started protesting and when a woman died in custody.
It is started by feminist and the men are feminists too.
