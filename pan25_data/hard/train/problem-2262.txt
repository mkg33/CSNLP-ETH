From a military perspective the invasions were resounding, fast successes.
Even in Iraq, which had an organized military, Baghdad fell in less than a month.
The "nation building" part was the debacle that went on for years.
Ukraine on the other hand is still fighting Russia on relatively equal terms almost a year in with no indication that that is going to change anytime soon.
This is great for everyone short term because we want ukraine to win the war swiftly but in the long term thebworld will have to deal with a Russian humanitarian crisis.
If they tried to make a quick attack, like 1 month preparation with the best they had, going quickly to Kyiv through Belarus in a surprise blitzkrieg-like effort, I think they would have won.
Hell, they almost had Kyiv in their hands even with all their fails.
At the end, Russia gets to “stabilise” the Crimea annexation (all countries would start to recognise it if even a new Ukraine gov recognised it), gets new non-peninsula territory and connections to Crimea (territory also rich in resources as far as I know), Putin gets a enormous amount of popularity (hero, to the history books) and oligarchs and army people would get what corruption gets them in this winning scenario.
So, at the end, I don’t know why, but I think Putin/Russia plan were to really really not attack and start a war, but maybe try to make something else?
They were that deluded to think that with their threats they were going to get Zelenskyy to disappear and put a more Russian-like government in Kyiv?
That European nations would be OK with Russia demanding things if they threaten war?
Also, Russia played bad their cards: they were screaming “we are ready to attack” for almost 3 months with all their army getting to the Ukraine border.
