I am very anti-US wars, but at least they didnâ€™t claim the territory as theirs, as far as I remember.
You would have to go very deep to history to find one.
If US joins some war, I have no problem with that.
If US initiates any new war, I am fully for same sanctions as Russia has, or worse.
If Europe upped its military spending it would absolutely roflstomp Russia.
Nazi Germany alone almost did it -- add France, the UK, Poland, etc.
and it isn't even close.
Not really.
It's not like he's Trump on National Television announcing the capabilities of the US military.
Then directly comparing them to countries he thinks are inferior to his while declaring an act of war.
It's just some guy on the internet talking theoretical logistics.
Because NATO can't bring down Russia even without nukes that quickly and there would be much more notable resistance.
They fell for the Russian propaganda somehow.
History has always been my favorite subject and I've always been fascinated by military might as well... Anyways the point is if they had paid attention and did a just a little bit research and listened to what our history teachers were saying at even the basic level.
They would have known Russia was more bark than bite.
Nukes are the only real deterrent they've got for NATO.
They aren't "looking down" on Africa.
They are using them as a baseline because they are one of the only countries with military might of noteworth.
That meets said specific baseline in the theoretical deduction.
