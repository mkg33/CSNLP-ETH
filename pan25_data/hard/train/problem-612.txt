Thanks then I'll die when it's my time .
Just like all the other people who have died before me .
Stop trying ride your fear of the unknown.
Death is the most natural thing in the world .
Trying to reverse or slow it down just shows how scared you are.
You realize I have zero affect on your life right ?
My making a statement is entirely my prerogative.
Just because you wanted to get emotional in the first place is the only reason this conversation is even still happening.
Just because you can't accept natural courses of existence is your own problem.
Getting irate at an opinion just proves the smallness of your emotional perception and regulation.
The world is not a fairly tale bad things will and do happen .
We can mitigate some of these issues but we will never escape them.
Death is one of these things.
And further than that people will still die because of disease, accidents and choice.
You guys are acting like we solved mortality.
To show you how ridiculous your statement is: we shouldn't try to cure diseases because we die when it's our time to go.
