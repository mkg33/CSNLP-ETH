Yeah, I get that.
Im a light-skinned Latino.
I also think you would have to be a moron to be a white supremacist, particularly in a country that does not consider us white.
It’s interesting since you hear both Irish-Americans (which I am) often refer to not being considered white in much of the same way white Latinos do.
It’s often a deflection from reflection - “if I can weave a narrative where I’m also one of the victims, I do not have to be responsible for the inequities of my society.”.
True, but that’s also something white Latinos sometimes say to try to lump themselves in with indigenous peoples in the struggle against colonialism.
Not necessarily in a cynical way, but in a way that shields themselves from reckoning with their privilege within Latino societies.
That is also why it arose with the Irish - dehumanization by saying “they aren’t like us” is a coping mechanism that oppressors often use that allows them to continue their exploitation without killing themselves out of shame.
This allowed for pretty horrid treatment and exploitation of the Irish.
Same with the Spanish and indigenous peoples of the Americas.
The issues are long lasting and ongoing, and so we must still decide how to address and repair the damages.
