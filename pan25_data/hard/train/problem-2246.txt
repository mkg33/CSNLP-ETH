What other legitimate concerns do you make up conspiracy theories for?
You probably still say Trump was working with the Russians.
Or Hunter Biden’s laptop was fake.
If Fox News covering the legitimate questions about the possibility of lab leak is bad then you’re the conspiracy nut.
It’s crazy that people care more about their perceived political adversaries being right about something than the cause of a global pandemic that killed millions.
Correct it is unimportant.
They have no impact on anything.
The lab leak isn’t a conspiracy theory anyway.
I’m sorry the truth made you lose points in your red team vs blue team political football match you base your entire personality on.
I guess you should have been a little more open minded and used some critical thinking before labeling everything a “conspiracy theory”.
It was never conspiracy theorist who suggested it.
I was always a VERY plausible theory put fourth by credible people from day 1.
But many dogmatic leftists associated it with Trump, so it was immediately mischaracterized as a conspiracy theory.
