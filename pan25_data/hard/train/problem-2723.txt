It wasn't a straight line from the Rebellions of 1837-38 to responsible government.
In any case, the first colony in British North America (now Canada) to receive responsible government was Nova Scotia in January 1848 due to the efforts of the journalist Joseph Howe.
After Nova Scotia was New Brunswick and the Province of Canada that same year.
Westminster ≠ England.
At least not legally.
There is no devolved English government that only represent the English.
The Scottish Parliament is not sovereign.
It's only existed since 1999 due to Westminster deciding to devolve some of its powers regarding Scotland to Holyrood under the Scotland Act 1998.
But ultimately the Scottish Parliament derives all its powers and legitimacy to an act of the UK Parliament.
The UK Parliament can repeal the Scotland Act if they had enough votes.
It kinda makes sense Scotland can re-vote since U.K. left EU and Spain and others said they’d not block Scottish independence.
That would help their economy early on into independence.
I think SNP won their last election in the basis of a post Brexit referendum by Scottish voters.
This means there will be no legitimate referendum on Scottish independence again for a while.
The SNP's best hope now is that Labour becomes the biggest party in the next election in England, but need the SNP in a coalition in order to form a government.
That way they can force the issue back on the agenda in Westminster.
Just means convincing Westminster to hold one like they did for the first one.
Which will probably be after the next GE, with a supply deal by the SNP with Labour.
