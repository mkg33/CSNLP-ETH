This balloon has nothing to do with spying.
If they wanted to spy, they already have satellites for that.
This is the era of satellites where anything on the ground can be assumed to have been imaged from space.
If this is a Chinese spy balloon imaging US soil, then the US has nothing to worry about because anything the spy balloon images the Chinese could already see with their satellites.

The UK started a military balloon project last year for spying as well ( so now we know China, US, UK and have tried and experimented with spy balloons.
Pretty fascinating stuff.
