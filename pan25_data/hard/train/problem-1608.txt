he does what his constituents want, whether thats the coal industry or bumkins in WV.
if constituents are leaning left, he's not going to push harder right, he's and a-hole but he's not stupid.
His constituents aren't leaning left, though, so I don't see why he would vote any differently.
He's still representing WV.
It's as red as it ever was.
I don't expect he'll push harder right, but I don't see him suddenly siding with the Dems on harder left legislation.
Because the government really wanted businesses to take those loans out and spend them on payroll so that the government didn't have to deal with a giant unemployment crisis when businesses laid off everybody due to COVID and so that people would still have their jobs afterwards, so they designed those loans from the beginning to be forgiven if they were mostly spent on payroll.
The loans were taken out by the businesses with the understanding that they would be forgiven.
Congress specifically authorized them to work that way.
The same can't be said for student loans.
