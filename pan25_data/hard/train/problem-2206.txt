As bad as Trump was he wasn't as bad as the previous Republican president, whose lies to congress and the American people caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not over a million people.
But don't forget that Trump era regulatory roll backs, public health policies in general and then his covid response led to the unnecessary death of hundreds of thousands of people too.
True.
All I'm saying though is that Trump is also responsible for the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, he even admitted that he lied when he told Bob Woodward that he "deliberately downplayed the threat of COVID-19 because he didn't want to cause a panic."
Yeah it may not have been as many deaths as the previous Republican president but Trump is still responsible for hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths too.
Some would say the last president was less bad because the majority of those deaths weren't Americans.
Considering Trump and his ilk are either directly or indirectly responsible for the majority of the covid deaths in America because of their misinformation campaign.
Not only that but we can also include the seating of multiple right wing conservative supreme court justices who will absolutely make decisions that cause death ( see Roe V Wade).
Not only that they will be in their seats for decades so we can't even measure it.
