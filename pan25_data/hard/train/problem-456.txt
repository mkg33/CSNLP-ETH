Zelensky advisor Oleksiy Arestovych: “The Russian army is not leaving Kherson.
It was KNOCKED out of Kherson by the Defense Forces of Ukraine.
It was knocked out with heavy battles, with losses… \[and we\] methodically gnawed through the enemy’s defenses.”.
Russian High Command has issued a general retreat to all surviving Russian forces at the Western bank of the Dnipro River.
Around 40,000 Russian troops are now officially running.
> We estimate the number of Russian troops occupying Kherson to be 30,000-50,000.
Therefore, it will take some time for the Ukrainian military to recapture the city.
They are, but once Ukraine retakes the city, the worry is that the Russians will just indiscriminately shell the city, which still has civilians in it.
Don't believe the withdrawal too much yet, not until Ukrainian troops enter the city and liberate it.
It could be some sort of attempt at deception.
Like Ukraine did to Russia by claiming to attack Kherson when they actually advanced in Kharkiv, Russia in its typical fashion might be trying a ruble-store version of something similar.
That said, let's also remember that shooting at reterating troops is not a war crime.
Retreating troops are not surrendered troops, despite what propaganda about the "Highway of Death" and such would claim.
