Have traveled by Qatar once to Seattle.
And these people even have to shove their religion on the planes itself by showing direction to Mecca in the maps.
Never traveled in Qatar again.
Hopefully we have Air India capturing the market so that we can all stop giving money to these religious mediaval cunts.
Its time to undercut the Middle-eastern airlines who have been banking off Indian passengers, who travel between India and West.
I would prefer a good quality Indian airlines direct flight from NY to Major India cities instead of stopping over in Dubai or other gulf cities which are just glorified shopping malls labelled as airport and then squeezing into a smaller plan and boarding disruptions for a short journey.
I would want my travel money to be spent on either American or Indian airlines.
Indian Airlines can be competitive in price with Middle east due to the sheer volume.
May be government should look at charging foreign airlines flying the same route as Air India and subsidies AI, Those nations use their oil wealth to play dirty, we can certainly use laws without being too protectionist.
May be allow them to operate on shorter routes with smaller margins.
There is a general pride in flying in your nation's airline because of the comfort and closeness to its passengers.
Besides, I don't understand how making a stop, taking a parking bay spot, unloading passengers and re-loading them with luggage is more economical than carrying 3hrs extra worth of fuel.
Its not like the connecting plane flies without any jet fuel.
Most people traveling from West pay over $1000 in ticket and spend atleast $100 getting to airport, its not much an issue paying additional $50 or $100 for a direct flight which takes you home 14hrs instead of 22hr.
