I think the Simpsons were probably making an older complaint that would be similar to problems you see in police unions.
Just that the unions protect bad teachers and a usually unfounded belief that the teachers union had enough power to get the teachers huge salaries or something.
So, mostly just standard anti-union rhetoric that is such a common belief in the US that the Simpsons could joke about it.
Pompeo is making a cultural attack about how the teachers union is pushing types of education he does like: actual US history, supporting LGBTQ students, etc.
There is hatred for public education and public school teachers being actively promoted by Christian Nationalists, I mean deep violent hatred, spurred on by ludicrous accusations of teachers "grooming" children etc.
And since unions protect members against abuse and false accusations (among other things) they hate teachers unions.
This is on top of a general trend towards hating unions in general.
People cling to the fantasy that if an item they want costs more than their salary can accommodate, it's because "unions" drove prices up by ensuring a living wage for the workers who produced/packaged/delivered the product so unions are bad.
Sad that these people never consider that if THEIR job would have union representation, they might be able to afford the basics without struggling.
