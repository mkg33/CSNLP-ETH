This is the problem with the Democratic party.
People often make fun of GOP supporters because they vote GOP automatically.
But for the Dems that should be the goal.
The Dems should have a policy brand that stands for something so that no matter who you are votng for you are voting for a set of policies.
That way they can find candidates that are outgoing and personable, what really counts for the electorate, and people that care about policy will know what it is.
Personally I think there's a gap between what they claim to want to hear and what actually sways their opinions, but Democratic candidates typically stick to what the polling tells them to do.
Has it occurred to you that there could be a sizable voting population that prefers these republicans and no amount of “messaging” will change their minds?
I think the voters wanted to send a message of dissatisfaction, but whatever that message was it wasn't ours.
Yup I was waiting for the full results, before replying, I along with many other conservatives got it really wrong.
For the record Trump was 100% wrong in denying the election result in 2020, he made a dick of himself.
