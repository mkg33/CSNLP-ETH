Only point I would ask is how many subs are there vs aircraft’s Carriers.
So makes sense more subs have gone down.
Other than that I really don’t know anything about the russian so was actually curious.
This is what the US does everywhere in the world every single day.
South China Sea, Arabian gulf, Mediterranean, etc.
China just did this to Guam.
It literally means nothing.
International waters is just that… international waters.
I was under the impression this is what made russias navy powerful.
The fact that they use subs instead of aircraft carriers which are probably growing obsolete as technology and ease to hit them advance.
Unlike the average redditor I'm not a military genius, but to me it seems that aircraft carriers have a lot more uses than submarines.
And also I don't know how effective subs are after their first shot/volley, I know that stealth is an important of a submarine.
But to when it come to russia submarines it seems that some prankster has installed a self sink feature as a joke but unfortunately for them it works a little too well.
