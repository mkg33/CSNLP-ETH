But where are the statements of "this war needs to stop"?
All I see is "our weapons are rusty and our command is shit".
Both of these statements are going to get them in trouble, so why are the saying only the second?
That's actually an example of smart tough choices.
Leaving the country and if it is impossible - run, hide, change your location.
Your half-brother has much higher chances of survival, not to mention a clear conscience and absence of crippling PTSD.
Due to the lack of good medicine and evacuation services the ratio of killed to wounded was reported as much worse than usual 1:3.
Different sources give different ratios but all of them agree that it is worse than 1:3.
They can always flee to a town 500 miles from their official registration, no one is going to look for them.
Remote village near Mongolia or Syberia in the worst case.
Beats being dead or becoming a killer.
Kill the zealot.
Then surrender.
Fratricide over certain death is preferable.
No more excuses for Russia.
The Russian army has been getting bitch slapped for 9 straight months.
The Russian people know it.
Enough is enough.
A deployment to Ukraine is a death sentence.
If you want to live, extreme measures need to be taken.
