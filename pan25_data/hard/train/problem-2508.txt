Given that Israel has shown very few qualms about assassinating the leaders of their foreign enemies that might not be the best idea.
Unlike Russia they don't need to be seen making assassination attempts on foreign enemies; Their interests are better served by success in silence rather than clumsy, noisy Russian failures.
Russia let’s them because they couldn’t stop them, if Russia tried to prevent Israel from hitting those supplies, they’d shoot down Russias aircraft and attack their few bases in Syria.
Russia is already pumping tons of money into Iran (and likely a lot of other hostile nations) so uh... What incentive does Israel have to listen to Russia?
Iran has been trying to get the S-300 // S-400 // Russian jets, which would make things a lot more dangerous for Israel.
It wasn't long ago that an Israeli F-16 was downed by an S-300.
Israel likes being able to target Iranian weapons shipments heading through Syria to hostile militias and terrorist groups.
Russia allows them to act with impunity.
