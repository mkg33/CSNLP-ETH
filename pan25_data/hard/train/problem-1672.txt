If we can get this guy convicted of financial fraud connected to his campaign, securities fraud, possible election fraud, passing bad checks, identity theft, petty theft and shoplifting, as well as him facing 7 years in Brasil after he gets out of American prisons, it might, just might, get a few security checks added to the process of getting elected to Federal office.

The recall election would work by ranked choice voting, so that if no opposing candidate has enough time to work up a majority, if there is enough disgust with the congress person, an opponent who is the second choice of many people would be able to displace him/her.
Both give power to the electorate as political parties have something to fear - citizens aren't locked into voting for a major to avoid the risk of "wasting" their vote, and every citizen must be considered in every strategy, since every citizen will be voting.
It would be remiss of me to not mention alternatives that could've been taken, but they aren't even popular amongst many of the US voting public: mandatory voting and ranked preference.
Both have arguments against them that have solid basis in the constitution (or at least solid enough to power on the naysayers).
