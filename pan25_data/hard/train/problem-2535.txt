I don't disagree with your points, my point is mainly that universal basic income, with a capital U, is always, ALWAYS proposed in conjunction with gutting all or most welfare and is commonly championed by Libertarians.
Pure UBI is just a libertarian wet dream and usually proposed as an excuse to dismantle most, if not all, welfare.
Doing things like free universal health care, free higher education, expanding EITC to cover most of middle income America, tax credits for child care, etc.
These would be more effective programs over UBI.
I think programs like this are good, even if they’re just baby steps towards UBI.
But it’s saddening to think how little $1K/mo is.
That amount might help you keep housing if you’re struggling, or help you get housing if you have other resources you can add it to, but it can’t take someone who is homeless and put them in housing.
And once you’re homeless, I’m sure there are all kinds of money sinks that will drain that $1k away much faster than if you already had housing.
