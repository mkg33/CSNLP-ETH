Appeasement failed.
Treating them like they were acting in good faith failed.
Believing they “won’t go that far”, such as murder their opponents, failed.
Third, disrupt their little games that distract from the above real issues.
That means not responding to a subpoena when it is in bad faith and just for their dog and pony hate show, and declaring it such, out loud, publicly.
Remember how Republicans said little or nothing at all when they dodged subpoenas?
Do this, and they not only lose their show, but they get a public slap across the face for it as well.
Do it.
Do it and point out all the times Republicans did it, and the legal, reasonable reasons they were subpoenaed, and then call out the nonsense reasons they want Biden subpoenaed.
For all the comments saying Biden's ignoring these subpoenas would "normalize" ignoring House subpoenas, you've got it backwards.
On the other what’s good for the goose… and I’d love to see the Biden administration respond with “Trump administration ignored House subpoenas, and so shall mine”.
Make no mistake: If Biden answers one subpoena from this stupid GOP House Party, they will just keep doing it.
Republicans would see Biden responding to the subpoena and say "he must be guilty".
Then they'll tell you that Trump didn't respond to the subpoenas because he wasn't guilty of anything.
