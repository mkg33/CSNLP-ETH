Realistically, it is to teach discipline, which is believed to come useful in adult life.
After all, your future employer will not care for your feelings on the uniforms they require their employees to wear.
The belief is that forcing people to wear a uniform will teach them discipline, same way how a military does it.
Which is actually where school uniforms came from, so... more food for thought.
As for skirts specifically, the only justification I can think of, is that if a woman works in a place she is expected to wear a skirt in, she may also be expected to shave her legs, so it would make sense that if you want to prepare kids for employment, girls should deal with having to wear skirts, since that may be required of them some day.
(I am not sure about this part — I am a male, and I have never worn a skirt, so I have no idea how skirts work, much less leg hair — may be totally wrong, just trying to come up with something).
Skirts should be optional for either sex then, I don’t know where you live, but there is no mandate anywhere a girl has to wear a skirt, or shave legs….
