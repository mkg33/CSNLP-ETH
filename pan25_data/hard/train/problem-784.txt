Turks can vote all they want for whoever they want, but the outcome will always be the Erdogan.
Did you forget the coo?
Is everyone’s Turkey info like 20 years old?
Turkey is a good country with a bad dictator.
The Turkish government is a foul entity.
The Turkish people on the other hand are kind hearted folks who deserve none of this and I wish them the best.
Despite facing total genocide and being rejected of our pain, I am proud of Armenia lending support with open arms.
What’s not being talked about is the PM of Armenia ready to provide aid to Turkey, a relationship that needs no introduction.
Turkey always sent aid to all the countries in need and Greece was also part of it, I would have lost faith in humanity if after all the helps Turkey provided not a single country pledge to do the same when it's Turkey's turn to be the one in the need.
