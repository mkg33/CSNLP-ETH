the irony is by defunding the IRS the smaller unrecorded incomes like said people from the rural areas are more subject to audit.
This is the reality of defunding the IRS….
I am a divorced working parent and they kept my money in limbo.
They can’t even get through their current caseload let alone the wealthy using back door tax codes and cheating as their form of white collar welfare….While people like me sat and waited.
When I called once per month for an update, the agents were nasty saying things like, “if I’m talking to you on the phone, I’m not working on your case.” Aholes.
It was sorted out in ten minutes once I finally got an agent on the line, but it took three+ months to get someone on the phone due to staffing issues.
It was bad enough for me, I can't imagine what that would have been like for someone who isn't used to writing letters, keeping records, and dealing with bureaucracy.
I have had the IRS pull me into a Kafkaesque bureaucratic nightmare for several months because of a $150 discrepancy between the 1099 a client sent me and the one they sent the IRS.
