Which is exactly why the warheads would be removed and switched with conventional warheads weeks before ever being given to the front.
No one is going to be like “hey here’s a nuke” plops it down off truck “mind taking the nuke off and switching it for me?” To anyone near the front.
What would be the point of a nuke if it's the same yield as a tomahawk missile?
That's just nonsense.
Those warheads are likely 5-20KT, the typical yield of a tactical nuclear warhead.
This missile wasn't just a nuclear-capable missile with a normal warhead.
This missile had no warhead, unless you count a lump of concrete ballast as a warhead.
That's what made this so weird, Russia either launched a Kh-55 as a kinetic missile (+ whatever fuel is left behind), which would be really pathetic if true.
Or they launched it as a test for how an actual nuclear armed one might go.
This really seems like either a test, to see what the performance of the Kh-55 against Ukraine is like for a nuclear attack.
Might be as a feint, or just training and decided to point it at Ukraine because why not (this is sadly the most hopeful), or worst of all because they might launch a nuclear attack soon.
Or what I think might be most likely, perhaps this was a training exercise for the pilot, and they thought "why not fire it at Ukraine anyway".
Which is still dangerous because they still got the data.
