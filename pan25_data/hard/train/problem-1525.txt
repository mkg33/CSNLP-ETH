You'll note that by and large it's conservatives that compare relatively benign things to the Holocaust.
This is to dilute the phrase and lessen the impact of the comparison, so when they do things that are actually like the Holocaust, people just shrug and say "everything is like the Holocaust nowadays".
If you think making the holocaust comparison is acceptable, you're either incredibly tone deaf, in denial about the true extent of the nazis' crimes, have very very white and low key racist/anti-semitic friends, and/or no one feels safe enough to mention being related to a holocaust survivor in your presence.
The Holocaust was a right-wing massacre, so many in the right will subconsciously think the holocaust was less bad than it was, and find it easier to compare with lesser events… not to mention that part of the far right is still openly anti-semitic (not sure it that’s this guy’s case).
The really stupid thing here is not him feeling that there is something as evil as the Holocaust but that there are people being offended by someone feeling something is as bad as the Holocaust.
