And I think the reliance on Twitter for these things is actually a detriment to humanity, not a benefit.
There are plenty of Twitter competitors that can easily replace it as well.
The only thing Twitter has is critical mass.
The technology isn't impressive or even difficult to rebuild.
And the damage that companies like Facebook and Twitter have done to society is monumental.
Now, I don't blame Musk for the issues around social media, but he's thrown himself into the fires of it.
And I don't see a world where he reduces the issues that exist on these platforms.
Tesla did its job, there's nothing left for Tesla to do.
EVs are now a thing and that trend isn't going anywhere.
Twitter isn't critical to humanity.
SpaceX is cool, sure but not critical to humanity.
So when you ask "at what cost?"
you're implying that these things are needed and Musk or his companies failing somehow hurts us all.
It doesn't.
So, no cost at all.
Perhaps, but at what cost?
It's like people hoping Tesla fails.
Tesla has, almost single-handedly, pushed the EV into the mainstream.
The amount of anti-Musk astroturfing is incredible in this sub.
Musk is an assclown in regard to his personal behavior, but he obviously pissed off some deep pockets.
Personally I was getting very annoyed and angry at Musk before this latest fiasco but I've become more outspoken against him.
It's not this one thing that he did but the continuous bullshit that he keeps pulling.
It feels like Trump-level narcissism.
I'm really fucking annoyed at his "I'm the genius main character" trope.
He's not fucking smart, he's a trust fund baby that is addicted to attention.
