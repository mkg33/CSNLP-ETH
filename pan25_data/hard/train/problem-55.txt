It's funny though how we assess "intent".
For "our guy" he gets the benefit of the doubt, their guy meant it.
I mean, how can you so certain that Biden had no intent to not disclose he had these documents but Trump did?
This is just an be example of tribal thinking.
We have no way of knowing Biden's intent or if it was just an accident.
It's been reported some of the classifed docs related to Ukraine, where his son was working?
Relevant ?
Who knows.
I think there's a reasonable chance this story was intended to hurt Biden because he's insisting on seeking re-election and there are those within the Democratic establishment that don't want him to run again.
But even though this is still “wrong,” I don’t think you’ll find many on the left who defend Biden tooth and nail the way the right circled the wagons and defended Trump despite a multitude of transgressions.
I think Biden is doing great so far in his presidency, and I believe this was an honest mistake in his case, but if Trump going to jail means Biden needs to go too, so be it.
Sorry, Joe.
Should have been more careful.
