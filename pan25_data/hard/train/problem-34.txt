When they say "sovereignty of all countries" they probably mean Russia too, which supports the false argument that Russia is somehow on the defense here and threatened by the expansion of NATO.
While I think China is considering directly aiding the Russian war effort first and foremost because they are both anti-west pariah states who see each other as the only major ally they each have left...
They are also probably at least marginally coming from a genuine position of not wanting the conflict to spiral 'out of control'.
Along the lines of seeing Russia losing the war conventionally resulting in them using the only weapons they have left in a last ditch effort to force a victory or at the very least force concessions, nukes...
Thus they justify helping Russia as a means of staving off their conventional defeat, which staves off the possibility of them resorting to using nukes.
Not saying that is correct, or moral, or anything like that... Just pointing out where they might be (marginally) coming from; nobody wants Russia using nukes.
I think China wants a weaker Russia and that has been “mission accomplished “ but they don’t want a Russia that collapses….
China doesn't have the power to stop the war through sanctions, Russia relies less on them than they did on the west (before the war).
China also wants Russia to win (or at least not lose) more than they want the microchip sanctions lifted.
Sure they're very much not friends, but China still wants Russia to win as they want to weaken the US and NATO.
A Russian loss would put a hamper on Chinese imperial ambitions in the long run.
