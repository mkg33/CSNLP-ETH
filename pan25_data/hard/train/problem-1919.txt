Sounds like the answer to that is "lol, what military readiness?"
Everyone seems to only have enough stuff for a few months.
Where would Europe be without Uncle Sam?
Zaporizhye campaign should be interesting.
Whole lot of steppe, hard to defend, hard to hide from the air forces.
There is some reason why Ukrainians have not attacked there before despite that front's vulnerability however.
So, instead of helping Ukraine win, and stopping Russia alltogether, and making sure that there will never be a "future" fight with Russia, US is holding back, while readying to "fight" with Russia.
I wonder if Ukraine is blowing up Zaporizhzhia and Crimea right now to force Russia to send reinforcements there from Donetsk and Luhansk.
Then they're launch an offensive operation in Donetsk and Luhansk instead of Zaporizhzhia.
Another aspect of NATO that the drivers of the "NATO is a threat to Russia and that is why they invaded Ukraine" narrative don't see is how NATO is holding back Poland.
Poland is like the K9 German Shepard, NATO is it's handler, and Russia is the thief.
Poland would have steamrolled through Belarus and be on the doorsteps of the Kremlin by April if their military wasn't integrated with NATO command.
They want to help their Ukrainian brothers and dish some payback on Russia so badly.
NATO is actually protecting Russia from being destroyed when you realize this.
Since I just read Morocco might send tank parts to Ukraine, I guess Medvedev will label them unfriendly now.
Which country will he root for now to make it to the World Cup final?
