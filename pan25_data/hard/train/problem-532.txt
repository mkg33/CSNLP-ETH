Messianic Jews will claim to be Jewish all day long.
One of the biggest core tenets of Judaism is the rejection of Jesus Christ as messiah, son of god, etc.
If you follow Christ your not part of the Jewish religion.
If you are going around claiming you are "Jewish" and you really are not then there is an issue with me.
She is calling herself "Jews for Jesus" which in no way makes her Jewish.
She's a Messianic Jew.
That whole sect is just a shitty marketing ploy to pretend Jews endorse Jesus.
They try to claim they are faithful Jews who just believe Jesus is the Messiah.
So basically she admits Jesus was a Jew and she just stands by Jesus being what Jews say he isn't - The messiah.
So yes, 99.9% of Jews fundamentally disagree with the portrayal of/notion that Jesus as messiah, but that's more a function of their belief system than an explicit belief in itself.
While I understand what you're getting at, no component of the Jewish faith or teachings reject Jesus as the Messiah: the teachings and scripture are older than Jesus.
Remember, Jesus was a Jew.
Yes they do the Jewish belief is that the Messiah is someone who is yet to be born.
That invalidates Jesus Christ being the Messiah.
