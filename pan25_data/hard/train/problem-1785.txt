Ignition was achieved a few years ago, this was ignition with an energy output greater than the laser energy, a first ever.
Laser confinement is not considered a viable energy source however, it is not turning into electricity, rather they measured the heat energy released (or some other similar method).
The point is that reliable, repeatable fusion reactions can give a lot of insight into how to get successful conditions for this and other fusion reactions.
Scholarly or mass media articles?
We already knew it wasn’t a pipe dream, but this result doesn’t prove industrial viability, as the method used isn’t really scalable.
It is a very important milestone, without a doubt, but until you can start a “fire” and keep it going you’re not going to be able to extract energy.
Fuck yeah This is something scientists have been trying to achieve for over half a century I know its still just a small step towards a limitless energy future, but its an important one.
It proves it can be done.
I hope with this achievement, comes greater funding for fusion.
Its nice to hear some good news for once.
