Nothing about this is pro forma.
The speaker is elected and not given.
Democracy at work.
I don't agree with the platform as a whole, but I don't think he should've just been given the Speakership.
I don't think Mccarthy should have just been given the speakership.
He should have withdrawn and a new candidate should have been put forward.
One that could have been elected without making the concessions.
I think that decision should have been made MONTHS ago when the Never Kevin's had made their positions known.
I'm saying the party should have dealt with these extremist when they were given the numerous off ramps to do so.
It's a failure because the party did not expel these extremists when they could have.
They let them fester in the party and hijack a pro forma vote.
They could have coalesced around another candidate.
I just watched the GOP fail the easiest house vote 14 times in one week.
That failure hasn't occurred since the 1800s.
Only the GOP is negotiating with known insurrectionist and trafficking in extremism.
Only the GOP is propping up a man who is respected so little by his conference that we had to watch him beg for a votes on the house floor on live TV.
They have no interest in governing.
They had months to figure this vote out.
They are unserious.
They had no party platform.
