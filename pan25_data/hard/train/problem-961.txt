The argument is so fucking weird and it's actually more sexist than you probably first think from the title.
So a man can drink through their early 20s and be fine, but if a young women does the same they will be an alcoholic.
And if they become an alcoholic they won't mature into a women.
And if that happens they won't have children.
It seems to imply that men will stop drinking because they won't be an alcoholic, but the women will be, so men won't want to have kids with them.
Maybe it turns out that people, once they are in control of their own reproduction, also just want to have fewer children (or no children).
Yeah id suggest its fair to think lower birthrates might be an unintended consequence of the enfranchisement of women.
Not too long ago the population of the planet was growing out of control.
It may have been regarded as a bonus side effect.
Now though, national policy people across the planet are looking at a looming demographic crisis within a couple generations.
By end of century it could get very bad.
I see no solutions.
You're right, no one wants to regress on civil rights or free choice.
We need to incentivize larger families.
Thus far all attempts to do so have failed across the board in all countries.
Moreover as youre alluding to, its a dual income world now, so incomes take a nosedive for the family as the women's career takes a backseat to have children.
In articles written on declining birth rates, the second most powerful factor seems to be women are deciding to delay having children to finish their educations and establish themselves in their careers.
Women who delay having children are more prone to have less children or opt on not having any.
