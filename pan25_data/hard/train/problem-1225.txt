The long road strategy of failing to conquer a tiny neighbouring country while throwing billions of dollars worth of their elite equipment and soldiers to burn, as well as their economy.
And as the final brilliant strategy, to convince any rich or educated citizens to leave Russia?
I mean, itâ€™s not like Putin is just murdering oligarchs and selling russias oil reserves for pennies on the dollar to make up for pulling out the world wide economy, right?
...but, like, I have a hard time believing that Russia is providing anything meaningful/new to Iran right now, more like they're paying back with equipment they can't really use in Ukraine because it'd get shot down anyway.
Is this about the Su35 deal with Russia, Russia doesn't seem to be in a state to mass produce their own jet, i doubt they'll be able to produce in russia and sell it to Iran.
There might be an existing relationship between Iran and Russia, but Russia wasn't giving Iran modern fighter jets.
Iran newest fighter jets are 50 years old F-4s.
If Iran is now getting modern fighter jets and it's a big change in threat level of Iran toward country like Saudi Arabia.
