So much pain, misery, and death are looming on the horizon and no one who has power gives a single flying fuck.
Lethality really means jack and shit until the RO is high enough for it actually be a pandemic.
This flu has been around since 1996 and still no significant outbreaks or signs of high RO in humans.
If a high RO 50% lethality virus comes through we will be hiding in our homes, not going out to attack people and get the flu.
Then we will get a vaccine and be immune for life.. if we didn't die and if we survive we would also be immune for life.
It would take years to work through the population and we would have a vaccine rolling out in a few months, so NO.. half of people won't die.
It won't be a long struggle getting a vaccine like with COVID, but we won't get it right away either, and in the mean time it won't be pretty if the mortality rate among mammals stays consistent when it moves human to human.
COVID is still around, will likely be a seasonal thing we worry about but I don't envision the response to the next immediate pandemic being anything like COVID unless it's killing folks in droves.
