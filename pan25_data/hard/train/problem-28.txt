If he was wrong there would have been investigations by the DOJ.
If the DOJ can go after an ex president they can go after a Supreme Court Justice for ethic/legal violations.
The Supreme Court was given the Judicial power, that is the ability to settle disputes in matters of law.
When Congress passes an act that is lacks the authority to do so and the Federal Government ends up in a dispute with a citizen, it is up to the Court to settle that matter.
Impeachment.
That is the tool for holding officials accountable for misconduct.
An arrested and convicted Justice of the Supreme Court is still a Justice of the Supreme Court.
Only upon being convicted of impeachment is their office lost (or resignation).
To avoid having to remove him from office Republicans didn't allow evidence and refused some witnesses at his 2nd impeachment.
If they had they would have had no choice but to remove him, they couldn't deny the evidence.
They also worked with him on his defense, that's the jury colluding with the defendant.
That's why I was dead set against the 2nd impeachment, I knew it would go nowhere and waste time and money.
I knew he'd become even more brazen having gotten off twice, I didn't quite see the insurrection coming though, but I knew he'd think he's untouchable.
The point of impeachment is political, it's like a mark on your soul, it doesn't work on someone without a soul or shame.
It has the exact opposite effect on Trump.
