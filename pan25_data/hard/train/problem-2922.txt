Actually it’s starting to happen.
A neighbor up the street has had a Trump flag up FOREVER; drove by the other day and it has been replaced with a Wofford college flag!
I did drive past a house Friday that had a massive piece of plywood with "THIS IS REPUBLICAN COUNTRY!"
but Republican was crossed out and TRUMP was written just below it.
I go by that house like once a week or so and that wasn't there 2 weeks ago.
I'm seeing fewer of them but the ones I see now are the biggest/loudest.
Most of the people I know that were Trump supporters are either outright hating on the guy now or are at least avoiding the subject.
No by all means fucking vote.
Please for love of everything vote.
If anything I think the majority that are taking down their flags and removing their MAGA hats are hiding it and because they don't want to be seen as losers.
Where I work is predominantly very conservative and most of them are not outwardly supporting him anymore and a good chunk, if not most, have verbally stated that he is to blame for the recent election.
Make no mistake though I doubt few won't dust off their hats and flags if he gets the nomination.
Plus, let’s not act like these very same Republicans won’t be back on the Trump train if he wins the nomination.
The exact same thing happened in 2016.
