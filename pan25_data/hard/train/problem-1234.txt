PAY ATTENTION to your local races.
There is a whole movement via groups like Moms for Liberty whose end goal is to kill public schools.
This is happening all over the country.
Equity policies make sure kids who have issues like social problems, economic disparities, learning disabilities, minority students, esl students, etc., get accommodations within the schools to help them achieve.
An example might be ensuring kids from poorer families have access to school computers and/or internet access to do homework after school as they may not have access at home on their own.
Another would be integrating kids with learning disabilities into mainstream classes for part or all of the day to help get them integrated better socially.
It also includes having resources for esl kids (a big problem for some Americans) or maybe a non-binary bathroom option for kids exploring gender so they have a safe place to use the toilet or change for gym class (people really freak out about this one ðŸ™„).
Itâ€™s not just school boards - itâ€™s boards of supervisors, election boards, etc., anywhere the crazy can get a foothold in local government.
There is a lot of political division between school boards, teachers, and parents.
And these topics have been very heated at times.
Florida schools have become a political war zone.
This is the result of a DeSantis-lead parent revolt across the state.
Many school boards across the state flipped conservative and now taking action against superintendents, administrators and even teachers.
Candidates backed by DeSantis and Moms For Liberty taking over school boards and immediately ousting superintendents.
