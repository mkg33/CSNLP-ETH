Republicans who claim they are going to compromise get voted out of office or suddenly find some reason to vote against anything Democrats propose, even if it means many of their own constituents lose out.
Americans "want compromise" but keep voting for politicians on the political fringes that attack other groups causing more alienation, fear and hate crimes and then wonder why people can't compromise.
Until Republicans participate in political discussion in good faith with the goal of affecting positive general change, instead of with the goal of consolidating power around a radicalized minority and hurting those they view as "other", compromise is impossible.
It's impossible, not because the Democrats are unwilling to compromise, but rather because the definition of "compromise" differs greatly between parties.
Democrats understand compromise to mean "human limitations mean that we can't all have everything- let's find a division of resources that leads to maximum satisfaction", while republicans view compromise as "Give us what we want, and we'll consider not hurting you as badly as we want to".
"Compromises" which undermine the social structure on which those compromises are built are not compromises at all- rather, they are simply cessions to those acting against the very things compromise is supposed to promote.
Honestly if you ask a question about compromise in the abstract without following up on how people want their political leaders to compromise in concrete terms, you're just measuring positive association with the word 'compromise', not anything real about voters' opinions.
NPR commissioned this poll, and it really seems like their political team is just using this as a push poll to make a point about how they think politics should be.
They were pretty happy to talk up Warnock's win in Georgia as an ideal example of a candidate moderating their politics and enticing split-ticket voting to win, without really grappling with whether that works when your opponent isn't Hershel Walker.
