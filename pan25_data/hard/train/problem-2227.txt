The funny thing is there were plenty of off-amps early on and even before it started (remember the US raising alarms that Russia was going to invade?
That was an exit ramp that would have given Russia a definite PR win over the US).
Those ramps went away as Putin kept ignoring them, and any "safe" off-ramp for him disappeared once he announced the annexation of territories.
Now Putin's options are to take an L off ramp that'll lead to either his death or losing power or keep doubling down in hopes to win something.
When they talk about exit ramps they mean resolutions to the war where Putin gets to save face and spin it as some sort of victory or draw.
He's talking about an exit ramp for Putin personally, which admittedly, there isn't.
At least not one that doesn't lead to him being dead or in prison within months.
If he backs down now and fully exits Ukraine, he'll have to answer to his own people asking: "Why are my children dead and you have nothing to show for it?"
Even his most ardent supporters won't be able to justify this was if he backs out now.
Putin's hope seems to be some major shift in NATO support, or breaking the Ukranian people.
Both seem unlikely at this point, so he's basically just trying to tread water until some major geopolitical event lets him find a new way out.
For instance, Trump (or some other Russian simp) gaining the US presidency, that's be a nice grenade being thrown into the west's support for Ukraine.
The issue with WMDs is MAD.
Most people do not want to die.
Most Russian politicians (including Putin) know that the moment they fire off a WMD the Kremlin will get levelled.
We'll all get levelled.
They want that just as little as you or I do.
Personally, I hope he puts a gun to his own head and pulls the trigger.
Whatever idiot takes the throne next gets to push all the blame on him, pull out of Ukraine, and start reparations.
