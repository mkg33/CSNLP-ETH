I would say that this is wishful thinking, that there will be inevitable hiccups and lead-time-delays and so forth...
"I shall have such revenges on you... That the world shall - I will do such things - what they are, yet I know not, but they shall be...
The terrors of the Earth!
".
Edit: folks you’re reading too much into this.
I was making a hypothetical where the US somehow was _forced_ to enter the conflict and a scenario where Russia isn’t stupid enough to engage with nukes.
And I was being hyperbolic when I said a weekend.
This isn’t supposed to be a thought experiment where I’m trying to analyze and break down the logistics and the likelihood of certain events in the potential involvement of the US in the Russia-Ukraine war.
We keep joking about stuff like this but the reality _really is_ that if Russia were to drag the US into direct involvement in Ukraine and if they kept fighting the way they have been, Russia would get absolutely rekt.
I think the US could retake the whole of Ukraine in a weekend with things as they currently stand.
