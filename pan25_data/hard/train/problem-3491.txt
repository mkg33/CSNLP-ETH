Some of my PhD research was on the effects of sea level rise on groundwater resources in those nations.
They're not just going to lose their land.
They're going to lose their water before that.
And it's going to be a big fucking problem.
The world's wealthy countries need to decide whether it's going to be a "spend some money now" type of big fucking problem or a "sudden massive waves of people who literally don't have anywhere to go" type of big fucking problem.
Not really.
The atoll and coral island communities in question are far from wealthy: many of the nations of Oceania have lower than $5,000 GDP per capita, and several of those countries are poorer than the likes of Uganda.
Their groundwater also occurs as fragile and transient freshwater lenses, and even if they could afford tidal barriers and desalination plants, hydraulic pressure from rising seas would displace the freshwater in those lenses and eventually percolate through to the land surface.
Desalination plants also necessarily create hypersaline waste that devastates the marine ecosystems that many of these countries' small economies rely on.
This isn't a problem we can engineer our way out of.
The only just and practicable solution is to cut emissions before entire nations disappear.
India, though a top emitter, has per capita emissions that are significantly lower than the world average.
Per capita is the only real way to effectively measure it else China, India and the USA could just all split up into a bunch of smaller countries and technically have lower total emissions for each while keeping the same emissions per capita.
On the topic at hand, of course, West pollutes the most per capita and indirectly causes pollution in many others, Cumulatively these emissions also dwarf those of India and China.
These are basic facts.
