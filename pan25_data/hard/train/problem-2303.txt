This is a revolution.
It takes time.
There is so much complexity that you can’t just make it happen overnight.
There is no turning back at this point.
Ppl might not be on the streets every day but the movement is alive.
The world leaders need to side with the ppl of Iran and stop negotiating with this fucking regime.
I think you should read more about this.
They are actually doing a lot.
And this is a revolution, calling it anything else is undermining the actions the people inside of iran are doing.
The guy directly below this comment talking about how this movement has supposedly been “squashed” when Iran literally saw a resurgence in protest activity today?
I think, in part, the Administration is trying to distance itself as much as possible from the protests so the Iranian government doesn't have more material to claim "the US is attempting another coup See Shah Biden said 'Iran?'"
Mossad and the CIA are certainly embedded in Iran and involved in some way, but it's obvious that the CIA (and US as an extension) can't openly involve themselves.
I definitely think that if America (and the rest of The West) steps in purely to offer help and support after Iranians retake their country from Islamist scum that it would go a long way.
I just hope there's a Democrat in the White House because the Republicans desperately want to continue inflicting harm on Iran.
Even if it means more disasters like abandoning the nuclear deal.
Ohio is another thing like the balloon that the news can scare our parents and grandparents with and chum the political waters.
