Truly, before Russia invaded Ukraine, the White House’s constant airing of their intel was brilliant.
Russia would continually try something and then the White House would say what they were doing and Russia would go, “nuh uh!”.
I’m thinking that the world may have been slightly less unified against Russia when the invasion started if Biden hadn’t been so up front about what was happening.
Biden was saying for weeks before the invasion that Russia was going to invade, but Zelensky didn't believe it and it was he who dropped the ball in preparations.
Even so, Zelensky still managed to protect Kyiv, destroyed Russia's elite troops and push them out of the area while he stood his ground, but the lack of preparation in the South is why Kherson and Mariupol was lost.
Also you can't supply an army in a week or two even if congress gave Biden the go-ahead to do so because of the logistics involved.
As it is, Ukraine did pretty well with the minimal support we gave them over eight years given that they were total pushovers when Russia annexed Crimea.
Don't get me wrong, Russia shouldn't have invaded Ukraine, and they deserve condemnation, but the involvement now is getting a little bit silly.
