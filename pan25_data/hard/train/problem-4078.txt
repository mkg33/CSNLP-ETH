Pretty sure Biden said something like “any negotiations are between Ukraine and Russia.
The US won’t dictate peace talks for a conflict we’re not actively fighting in”.
Edit: Biden’s exact words were at the G20 Summit and they were, “I've been very clear that we're going to continue to provide the capability for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves – and we are not going to engage in any negotiation.
There's nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, this is a decision Ukraine has to make.” [emphasis mine].
When will these people realize that Russia needs to negotiate with Ukraine, a sovereign nation.
The US cannot speak for Ukraine, nor should it.
Sure, get out of Ukraine and then they can talk.
It truly is that simple.
Russia trying to pretend they actually have any juice to make demands is silly at this point.
The argument here is that the fact remains that Russia got its ass kicked despite having much superior numbers and weapons at the start.
It was truly only after Russia's 40-mile-long convoy to attack Kyiv got defeated that the serious weapons showed up.
But that is how the world works.
If you support a country that is being bullied by a much more powerful one, you help them.
What this war has proven more than anything is that if Nukes are off the table Russia is nothing but a Paper Tiger.
They have been brutally exposed.
