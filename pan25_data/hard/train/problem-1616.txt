You don’t understand the reality of the war, only what you see in flashy clips online.
Trenches are used by both sides because they are effective at protecting you from constant mortar and arty attacks.
You only see Ukrainian footage because Reddit is generally pro Ukrainian and most subs don’t want footage of them dying.
Ukrainian troops are unfortunately suffering just as much as the Russians.
If I'm not mistaken you were praising he Ukrainian soldiers for being able to control themselves by simply capturing the Russians.
The second part of the video proves you partially wrong about that.
This is not the complete video.
At least do your research.
Shortly after this the Ukrainians start throwing grenades into the wholes where the remaining Russians are sitting.
This is the complete vid, with Ukrainians throwing nades into the trenches after the remaining Russians wouldn't come out.
It's just the form of propaganda used by the West.
Russia twists reality and tells its citizens made up news, the West doesn't make anything up but rather cherrypicks what is presentable to the population.
This is one way of doing it.
