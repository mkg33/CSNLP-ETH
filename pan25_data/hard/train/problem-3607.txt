This is just an example for the U.S. commitment, which agrees with the actual figure "sent in that time span":
The quoted figures within the AP tool are for "pledged" (promised) figures, not total commitment amounts "sent in that time span."
In other words, the amounts are not a representation of the total commitments disbursed between those dates.
It says: "What countries have pledged to Ukraine...Total military, financial and humanitarian aid promised by governments to Ukraine, Jan. 24, 2022 through Nov. 20, excluding loans.
".
Ah yes.
The 50 billion wasn’t enough to make people mad so now its 200 billion.
Source: who cares.
Cherry on top: ‘we must suspend all foreign aid for the war and everyone can hug it out’.
Ok, but whats their evidence?
They have no link.
My evidence is the US government, EU governments, Fox’s own reporting from last year where they constantly reference ‘100 billion’ (promised not supplied), almost every other monitoring organization and news outlet.
Heres just one source out of dozens:
edit: actually their source is ‘we straight up lied and didn’t link the thing we’re quoting because it shows we’re lying’.
They even say this exact link is their own source but didn’t link it themselves, probably because it shows they’re lying.
