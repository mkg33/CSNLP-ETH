That’s not a great metric to use.
Way more German kids died than American kids in WW2.
Does that mean the Germans are the good guys?
No one made Palestinians use their own children as suicide bombers.
No one made Palestinians target Israeli children on school buses.
That’s not an eye for an eye, that’s despicable.
No one made the Arabs reject the original partition plan.
What are the hard numbers on how many children would have been saved if they just decided they could live peacefully with their Jewish neighbors?
Does the real data include children used by Palestinians as human shields or enlisted as suicide bombers?
Can you pull up how many children have died in comparison between Israel and Palestine due to actions and hands of the "other" side?
Palestinian have a hard time under Israel's occupation but they also have it bad under Hamas' Gaza.
Some of the resolutions are submitted by Hamas itself which is ironic and despicable,and many including the latest one denouncing Israel are submitted by the PA while they themselves are guilty of corruption and oppressing any political opposition and critics.
