Actual question I don't know an answer to, not a political attack on anyone: are there any countries that are accepting significant numbers of Palestinian immigrants?
Entirely separate from any questions of "should," is any country providing a place to go for Palestinians who want to just leave?
Well, since they still officially do not recognize Israel's right to exist and I would argue that a 1 state solution is just the end of Israel.
So let's go with 2SS.
Edit: Also regarding the leaving of Gaza strip, I suggest looking up how much 1 rocket interception costs to us to understand why it doesn't make any financial sense to give them autonomy.
I guess I would contend that Israel left the Gaza strip because it was too costly for them to protect the few settlers that were actually there and Sharon could use it as a point of saying how moral he was (omitting how quickly military actions increased once Israeli citizens were out.
).
Yes.
But they don't have a right to hold an entire people in bondage while slowly erasing them from existence.
There are bad actors on both sides.
But as momentum77 said, the solution is to give Palestinians rights.
That can be a two state solution.
Or a one state solution where Palestinians are full and equal citizens with proportional control.
Fundamentally, though, there is a difference in power dynamics between Israel and the US and Palestinians.
The first two are some of the most powerful forces in the world with democratically elected governments.
The latter are a nearly stateless people who have been living as such since a colonialist movement was granted statehood in the middle east because of European anti semitism.
