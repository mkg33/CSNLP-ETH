Well, given the sorry state of Sinovax and the low uptake of even that mediocre vaccine by the sick and elderly in China, I’d say that they’re pretty well screwed.
The vaccination rate among the Chinese elderly is low to begin with — around half is unvaccinated iirc because they didn’t want to take the vaccine.
(It is much higher among the younger population).
Uptake of boosters is low.
With this sort of vaccination rates, lots of the elderly will end up dying regardless.
Western mRNA vaccines might’ve helped, but the core issue isn’t that.
Resources were spent on strict lockdown surveillance and Covid test booths and what not, instead of additional ICUs and a better vaccination drive.
The opening up was also too sudden.
Three years of initially successful zero Covid could have bought China time for more ICU beds and stockpiled medicine.
Even as recent as last month, the government could’ve opened up more carefully and only do it where they had stockpiled resources.
Instead they just pretended zero Covid never happened overnight.
