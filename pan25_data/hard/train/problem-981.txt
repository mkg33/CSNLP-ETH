What to "suppress" and what to allow to remain: The election was verified by the societies proper institutions as legitimate.
All those who are petulantly kicking and screaming and trying to delegitimize the election are doing so cynically.
We have institutions made up of citizens, those institutions are either trusted or we don't have a democracy and we can devolve in to China's one party distopia or russia's siloviki feudal system.
There needs to be a common respect for the rule of law and the processes of democracy or we are fked.
People are generally stupid.
that is not a recent revelation, it has been a common observation since the greeks.
Social media allows populists to prey upon the stupidity and abject ignorance of the masses to aggregate power.
Democracies need to have a shared understanding of norms and decency.
Social media platforms should not broadcast the ramblings of the degenerate grifters and cynical opportunists.
yeah, its a brave new world.
But government oversight might come in the form of a bipartisan committee on social media moderation?
i dunno.
Right now i think social media companies are trying their best.
The cynical lying and purposeful disinformation is dangerous as it eats at the heart of what allows democracies to function.
If every election cycle is an existential fight with avalanches of cynical disinformation being spread because they are playing politics as some zero-sum game where injuring your opponent is always the goal, then we will not have democracy for very much longer.
this is a fair question and one that has no clear answer.
Facebook and twitter have been powder-kegs for many years now.
Facebook is becoming a real political powder-keg.
Not saying itâ€™s the wrong move but who decides what to suppress and what to let grow?
Should they be in charge?
Not advocating allowing hate to flourish, just looking for thought-provoking dialogue on this matter.
