Sorry!
Another fan beat you to these tickets, so they're no longer available.
Please select another listing, or adjust your criteria and try again.
This happened to me in Minneapolis too, what is even the point of the room?
When you try to buy tickets and a fraction of a second later they say.
It’s not just tickets.
Ticket Master has setup a multi-way exclusivity that locks up the whole industry: a venue that uses TM is required to exclusively use TM and an artist that use TM is required to exclusively use TM.
TM either owns directly or has this exclusively lockup with every giant venue.
So if you are a venue who wants to get major artists or a major artist who wants to be in a venue you have to use TM.
The only way I can see the go it alone approach maybe working is building a Taylor Swift venue for her exclusive use and not doing a traveling tour, like some shows in Vegas are run.
How many venues in the US can fit a Taylor Swift crowd that aren’t TM exclusive?
Are there any?
TM isn’t hurting for shows to sell they’d just say goodbye.
Yeah just look at what they are paying in face value for some of these seats in the giant venue!
But that small show would be a show only the very well off could go to.
Few people could spend multiples of the median household yearly income for a single show seat.
