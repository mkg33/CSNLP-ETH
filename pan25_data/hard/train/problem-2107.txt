Does it truly claim that Russia is not the aggressor?
Russia is behaving wretchedly, but it is doing so because, \in the Russian mindset,\ it did not have enough security guarantees.
We might like Russia to share our mindset, but if that is what is required for the war to end, then the war will not end, not unless Russia is completely conquered, and we know for a fact that they will use nukes if that happens.
The best and most realistic option is to end the war, and as bad as Russia looks in this war, they can never lose it in the long-term.
They have so much more money and people and technology.
So either NATO attacks Russia in earnest, starting a nuclear apocalypse, or peace is made, and Russia will never agree to a peace that does not give them more security agreements.
In a \just\ world, they would, but we live in \this\ world, and Russia has nukes, and the will and ability to use them.
Look at Ukraine if you want an example of what happens when a country is convinced give up their nukes.
Security concerns...wasn't that that thing that both the US and Russia gave Ukraine as a condition of handing over the nukes they got stuck with after the Soviet Union fell?
Because it's not about security, the whole NATO thing is a pretext that Russia can use to pretend they're the victims.
The real reason has always been a land grab and the belief that anything that belonged to the USSR should belong to Russia.
