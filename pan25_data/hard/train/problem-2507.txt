I mean it's definitely fair in certain contexts.
In a public context like where he was documented using Anthony Devolder, I can see someone not wanting to use their real name.
As far as I know there is no formally agreed upon confirmation that George Santo's is that man's real name.
Well, yes, quite frankly.
Obama proved his critics wrong (no matter the legitimacy of the basis for their claims), now this man gets to do the same.
He used Anthony Devolder and George Zabrovsky as possible aliases at least in the past - these are documented and well known about.
What paperwork did he submit besides his signature that he is who he says he is?
The issue is that this comes into question now that he has been caught lying about almost literally everything else.
I mean, you don't give people a reason to question your name, and they won't question it.
When you are using different names, claiming education and personal backgrounds that are verifiably false, that's when it becomes a legitimate issue of "Ok, who the hell are you really?
".
So yeah.
The paywall isn’t some insurmountable barrier.
We as a society have just shifted our informational/media priorities.
Not a judgement on what we choose to do with our money (I pay for and enjoy streaming entertainment too, along with WaPo), just pointing out that paywalls aren’t some insurmountable barrier.
