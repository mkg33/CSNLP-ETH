US doctrine very explicitly states commanders should deviate from doctrine when the situation warrants, but they should be prepared to justify why they deviated -- and feed lessons learned back to higher commanders so they can consider adapting doctrine.
Ironically by preventing commanders from using creativity in doctrine they force the commanders to get hands on and try to be creative.
But by not providing commanders with the training and tools and frameworks for thinking creatively they are dooming their own commanders to fail.
Yeah, nothing to do with catastrophic lack of leadership, morale and training.
Those solders should just know how to behave professionally the second they get the draft papers.
I almost feel bad for Russian solders, they have been fucked over so hard by their leaders, but until they get the clue and overthrow said leaders they will have to keep suffering for their actions against people who would otherwise not have a quarrel with them.
HIMARS has got to be a freakin' nightmare for the Russians, and if they weren't such geopolitical assholes, I might almost feel sorry for them.
