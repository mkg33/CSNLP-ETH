This would be a best case scenario.
As long as he maintains a loyal base within the GOP that won't vote for other GOP but isn't big enough to win him the general election dems can carry.
Such “Forever Trumpers,” who say they won’t vote for anyone else, form the bedrock of Trump’s enduring power in the GOP — an implicit threat that the party can’t win without him.
In voter interviews, finding people like Upton who wouldn’t agree to supporting anyone else as the eventual Republican nominee was rare.
Still, Trump’s enduring strenh with a sizable chunk of the GOP base could be his best path to beating a crowded field of rivals — a scenario that his advisers privately say they’re rooting for.
“I and a lot of other Republicans who were supportive of President Trump are becoming less and less supportive,” Jaster said.
“Not because I’m a ‘Never Trumper.’ I just don’t believe Trump is the best person to move this party forward.”.
It’s not the first time that Trump supporters have admitted their misgivings.
But during his presidency, the only choices were to be with him or against him, so they stuck with him.
