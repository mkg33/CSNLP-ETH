I began the year in NE, moved to MO, but earned income in NE & KS.
Preparing forms this year was all sorts of fuckity.
But Iowa isn't salvageable from a political perspective.
It's staying red for the remainder of my lifetime.
(Note: I would love to be proven wrong by future Iowans I openly invite and encourage demonstrating that it can indeed be flipped But as a Nebraskan I know otherwise - I genuinely don't believe either IA or NE will recover from their self-inflicted damages.
).
I get it.
I’m glad the referendums failed.
But I don’t think I offered any misinformation.
Key politicians jumped on the cop-hate train.
They have been re-elected.
And Omar isn’t just a district rep, she’s THE district rep who serves the residents of the city that had the ballot measure.
Do you deny that activists called for the abolishment of the police following the murder of George Floyd?
I mean, I’m the capital, property taxes went up 15%; there’s a proposed sales tax increase of 1% and yet, our police force has been reduced by 20% while crime is exploding, the school budget has been cut and our roads are In horrendous shape.
I’m glad kids are getting free lunches, but honestly the living conditions in this city have been deteriorating significantly over the years, and I feel like residents are just getting nothing back on all the new taxes they are enacting.
Not MN, but my immigrant family in WA had free or reduced lunch cards and it honestly saved a ton as a little kid since at the time, the most my parents could work were part time janitorial or under the table cash jobs.
As a kid that didn't get money for lunch from my parents and was never made lunch for school, I would have benefited from this greatly if this program was around when I was a child.
I remember stressing out about who to borrow quarters from, "okay Jake always orders a slice of pizza and a milk, so that means he will have 25 cents of change from his $2 his mom gave him.." I will ask him..
