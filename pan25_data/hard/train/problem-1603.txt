We're now in a world where Mike Pence, the man who believes in conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ individuals, is going to run as the "sane" presidential option for Republicans.
TIL massive expansion of drone technology where we can carpet bomb the living fuck out of anyone we want on the planet is "meh.
".
YEAH.
SOMEONE needs to look into this guy before he bankrupts all his investors and flies a Space X into the side of the mountain to burn it all down.
He is obviously not well.
Oh, so PATRIOTIC of him.
But, actually, all his actions are classic, wall street sniffing cocaine 80s style takeovers.
Buy a company, gut it, use the existing infrastructure to absorb the old company, thereby basically ensuring a monopoly of money pumping companies for the shareholders, but nothing else of value is gained and a bunch of ppl lose their livlihoods.
No, Elon Musk is not a genius.
He's not an altruistic billionaire who is really some undercover Tony Stark.
He's good at employing really talented engineers.
His only gambit is to have the kind of brand that attracts top level engineers, and when he ruins that reputation, which is what he is doing, he will lose that asset too.
And all of us out here living in the real world are seeing Musk's chaos agent behavior, what it's doing to his employees (also his other company employees), to society, and we're like.
Once we stop making assumptions that people should want to act normal and look "good" and that money can fix you and make you seem 'normal' then a lot (although obviously not all) of criticisms of Musk fall apart.
People have been accusing Musk of being irrational and over confident and doomed to fail for decades now.
It's a shame, SpaceX and Tesla both could do some really great things for humanity, but Musk will completely destroy them because he's a fucking nutjob moron.
