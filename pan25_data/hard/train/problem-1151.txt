On the other hand a great deal of more serious charges require that Trump would have had Criminal intent.
That he intended to sell classified information or the intended to provide it to a foreign power.
That would be a potentially much more serious crime.
Some potential charges like violation of the presidential records Act or mishandling criminal information do not contain any significant intent element.
However, there is at least some possibility that Trump's lawyers could argue to the jury that this is all a misunderstanding over how certain documents were characterized as a defense.
I think that might just be an attempt to mislead the jury but a judge might still let them argue it.
So that gets into whether you trust the washinon post and their sources.
But IF the report is true, the FBI appears to believe that Trump didn't intend to sell the documents or had some nefarious plan.
They somehow thing that exonerates Trump but in reality it's evidence that he sold / gave / did something worse with what documents USED to be in those folders lol.
I shouldn't lol, that shit isn't funny.
That level of critical thinking is just sad as is there capacity to overlook anything that makes Republicans look bad.
