How is this any different than the inflation they were railing against a month ago?
"Vote for us, Democrats made your expenses go up by 10%.
We can do 30% in perpetuity instead!
".
How can a party that insists taxation is theft propose a brand new federal tax that would severely impact most households?
Do Republicans hate progressive policies so much they'd rather spend 30% on top of their 0-10% existing sales taxes just to prove they owned the libs?
Explanation: it's a horrible Libertarian idea that cuts taxes on the wealthy & increases them on the poor & middle class.
Nothing 'fair' about a fair tax.
Why do you think they call it "fair tax"?
They know it's not.
It's another giveaway for the rich at the expense of everyone else.
Tax revenue will drop and then they'll be like oh I guess we should cut social security then.
thanks "big pork Dems".
How are people so dumb.
SMH.
Let's say I make 500k a year.
Spent 50k on food somehow even though no one would.
15k sales tax.
I used to pay 142k in taxes so let's just say 150k for easy math.
So I just sent from 150k income tax to 15k sales tax.
Nice Im going to be saving a shit load of money on taxes.
And it only gets better the more money you make because now with a "fair" flat sales tax (which is inherently regressive).
Mostly no â€“ this is a sales tax, not a value-added tax, so it would apply to sales to consumers, but not to businesses.
There are already countries where you can go to get goods and services cheaper.
This proposal would make that gap a lot wider.
