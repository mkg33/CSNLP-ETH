Itâ€™s a major fucking deal though.
Any normalizing even in the tiniest degree of missiles infringing in foreign airspace will be taken advantage of by Russia.
Russia has been reliably crossing NATO airspace to test responsiveness for years in Canada, Turkey and even USA.
The missile was in transit and had no targets in Romania.
the missile landing in romania was never the question.
it landed in ukraine.
the dispute is whether it passed through romanian airspace to get there or not.
romania says it passed 35km away from its airspace, ukraine says it passed through it.
well first off, you can't know for sure ukraine is right on this.
romania might be correct, not just "denying it".
you need to remember ukraine is far from unbiased in this, even if understandably so.
second, it's the first time this happens in a year of conflict.
if it becomes a common theme, i agree romania should do something concrete about it but even then it will be in agreement with nato, not some unilateral knee jerk reaction.
for now tho, better surveillance and readiness is likely gonna be it.
sure, that's hardly a reason to risk nuclear war tho.
romania should take measures like intensifying surveillance of the area and be better prepared to shoot these things down but article 5 over this?
no.
Yes.
The best way to save lives is to end the war as quick as possible, in Ukraine's favor.
This saves Ukrainian and Russian lives.
