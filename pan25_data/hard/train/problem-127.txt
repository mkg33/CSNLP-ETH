That is, you no longer have to choose between voting for who you like best or voting against who you like least.
It’s still way better than first past the post or plurality winner voting!
But there’s a reason most lonerm democracy reform advocates have stopped pushing for IRV.
It also impacts people’s willingness to vote, as it makes the ballot a non trivial amount more complicated.
It's no more complicated than any other voting system except FPTP (which everyone agrees sucks) and Approval Voting (which is just silly for a general election).
You could satisfy the "later no harm" criterion, for example, just by drawing a name from a hat and ignoring voters entirely, if you didn't care about choosing the right winner, but that doesn't make that a good voting system.
You could satisfy the "consistency criterion" by always electing whichever candidate comes alphabetically first, and that also doesn't make for a good voting system.
These would be terrible choices because it's more important to choose the right winner than anything else you could possible be worried about.
Sure, there's not always a clear choice for the right winner.
When there is, though, and you don't pick it, that's hard to explain away by saying "but look at all these other random properties that our election system does satisfy!
".
Eh.
Instant runoff, which is what everyone means by ranked choice, is a start.
Better than what most of the country does now.
But don't set it up like some kind of ideal.
It's another broken system that's a little less broken than what we're doing already.
