McDonald v. Chicago wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't changed the scope of the 2nd Amendment from the community to the individual.
They effectively turned the State into the federal government and the individual into the State.
I'm worried they will do the same with open-carry laws which did exist in the colonies and post-Revolutionaty America.
This is where "deciding by history and customs" is extremely ambiguous.
Whose history and customs?
Pre or post 14th?
Does it afford unlimited access to unlimited guns?
Does the State get to decide how many guns and of what type is good enough for self-defense?
The gun does operate the same without these things, nothing prevents you from buying it, all from being a law abiding person and attaching them.
It is a law against law abiding citizens which does nothing to protect anyone.
As such, a government determines which “rights” are worthy of legal protection.
I consider the consumption of psychoactive substances to be a right, but the government does not.
As such, I am legally prevented from possessing PLANTS and could have my life and freedom destroyed by the DEA.
