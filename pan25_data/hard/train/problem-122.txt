Russia is getting help from all the regimes they've helped prop up, I think they realize that if Russia falls, so does a big part of the black market that supplies them.
So basically their hands are full, and Russia is literally the last thing they'd want to deal with along with a unstable economy and pissed off population.
No, their situation is just precarious due to a series of poor management.
The 1st was when they faced their own housing bubble crisis and suddenly millions couldn't get their investment back from real estate.
Unfortunately unlike the US, almost 80-90% invest in real estate because it was seen as "stable".
Unfortunately people began investing in apartments that basically never got built for YEARS .
People were so eager to get their money in real Estate, Devopers would basically take the money to pay off the previous debt and continue developing a new project before the previous even began.
You might know this as a "Ponzi Scheme".
The crisis was basically a giant Ponzi scheme the govt left unchecked.
This created an even more dire situation.
So thousands protested to get their money back due to frustration and caused civil unrest.
The result was massive lockdowns still 3 years in that hurt the economy, but also caused people to become extremely frustrated because it was also poorly done.
Doors to apartments and homes would literally be welded shut, trapping hundreds, sometimes thousands suddenly without warning.
Delivery of food to these places were supposed to happen, but again, that wasnt always the case, causing many to die from things like dehydration.
The reason they continued this policy is because they are too stubborn to accept better vaccines from the west.
