It's a lot more direct and obvious than voter suppression measures because, unlike voter ID laws, gerrymandering, and armed dudes camping around ballot dropoff locations in certain neighborhoods, it's entirely unambiguous and the only argument one could use to defend it is "well maybe those groups of people shouldn't be able to vote" (the fact that some people can argue in favor of the armed "poll watchers" is appalling in and of itself, but "repealing landmark civil rights legislation" is too overt for even that).
There's a reason you can find pictures from the 20's, 30's, 50's, and 60's saying things like "women's suffrage is socialism" or "interracial marriage is communism" - identity politics and propaganda have existed ever since ideas, identities, and ambitions have existed.
Abstracts and relative prosperity over a long enough period of time have simply concealed that from us.
That's how it works.
Politics is almost always identity politics and vice versa, and has been since time immemorial.
The idea of "identity-neutral" politics is itself an aberration resulting from the period of stability most of us here grew up in - even that kind of politics is identity politics under the surface because of the use of abstracts to appear "neutral" and "moderate".
Also, a constitutional republic can be democratic - the US is a representative democracy.
That "we're a republic, not a democracy" crap is intended to push the idea that it's fine if we lose the right to vote, and that is unacceptable.
The American people do not believe that democracy is on the ballot, they believe that what happened in 2020 was a fluke..a blip..and that there are not real risks to democracy.
I'm not saying they're right, I'm just saying that is their opinion.
