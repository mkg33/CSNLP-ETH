Yet, Millennials are becoming more Liberal with age.
The same will likely be true with the Zoomers.
The oldies can't maintain control if the constituents can't buy a home, pay for rent, afford the basics, or get time off for being sick, etc.
There will always be younger members but the social structure of our society has to support younger members being able to gain some sort of wealth that their parents were able to - yet now they are seemingly unable to.
This trend is important because it tells us the political landscape is actually changing from the status quo because the younger generations are unable to benefit from society like the older ones.
Meaning that as time goes on and as boomers and gen x die off, we will likely start seeing a huge shift in American politics as the older generation cannot maintain the status quo.

Responding to unfounded/manufactured outrage is nothing new.
The possible novelty is that they are just being explicit in saying “we don’t care if it’s not true” instead of pretending that it is true.
