Let's face it, the US has outsized power and will use it aggressively.
Sometimes for very good reasons.
Sometimes for really petty and emotional ones.
The US has the best military in the world and can put it anywhere they want, and they will do so for decades at a time even when that's not a good idea.
The US has the leading world economy and is so interwoven into so much of the global economy that the 20% or so GDP badly undersells the influence the US has economically.
The US also have a dizzying array of global alliances so that you're never facing off against just the US either.
Global warming is one of the big challenges, but it's also something that will unfold over decades and centuries and therefore something we have time to do things about.
Something like global climate change and the impending wave of climate refugees that we're all too busy with the infighting to do anything about?
Or global warming and the need to compete on a global stage making the first person to cut away from fossil fuels the loser of said global competition, which keeps us -as if on rails- on the course to absolute unmitigated catastrophe?
