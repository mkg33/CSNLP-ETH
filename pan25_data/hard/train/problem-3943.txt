Even if Biden helps East Palestine, none of the votes from that region for him in the next election will change.
That describes the Trump/GOP that the East Palestinians voted for.
Elections have consequences.
These people voted for uncontrolled toxic spills and they got what they voted for, are they not pleased?
Which had nothing to do with the current wreck or the lack of regulation the East Palestinians voted for and got, much to their dismay.
Which has nothing to do with East Palestinians voting to end EPA, end toxic chemical transportation regs, end FEMA and then crying about none of that being there for them.
Now that the Deep State East Palestinians get exactly the world they voted to get, they are complaining about not enough EPA protection, not enough toxic chemical transport regs, not enough FEMA help.
Good grief...the East Palestinians are near 100% Trump/Vance GOP'ers who voted to end the EPA, end toxic chemical transport regs, end FEMA disaster help and all the other normal activities a sane government would perform that the East Palestinians and their elected reps call a "Deep State Conspiracy".
As opposed to voting for Biden and O'Donnell and getting better EPA regs, better toxic chemical transport regs, better FEMA response...all the things the East Palestinians are complaining about NOT getting.
I am since they keep wanting to deny the help and the prevention to others, save the help for others who will need help from the GOP/East Palestinian decisions.
Im filing this incident under “elections have consequences” and losing sympathy for the people of east palestine.
