I'm not saying this to insinuate Poland should act in one day or another concerning jets to Ukraine ( although, I wish they would give them a squadron) just to point out that they would have whatever they need for defense of their people.
Also, it doesn't matter anyway.
pootin doesn't pick on countries that can fight back, he just made a grave miscalculation with the Ukrainians!
Anyway, for the poles' sake( and anyone else that would be involved) , let's hope this never happens.
But if it does, I damn sure hope there's as much footage as we're getting from Ukraine.
And we would send more if ever needed!
But, I'm sure there are thousands of soldiers from other countries as well.
Y'all certainly aren't alone , the West has your back and will defend it at all cost.
Poland could have 3 jets, and it wouldn't be that big of a deal.
They happen to have NATO, and NATO has plenty of jets to protect Poland.
Because Latvia is in NATO and the EU, both of which have strong defensive treaties, my guy.
The US invoked article 5 over 9/11 and we invaded Afghanistan, nobody is falling for Russia's 'I'm not touching you shit'.
If we just let it happen it wouldn't cost us anything, it's everything we're doing to support Ukraine that's expensive.
The reason to support Ukraine isn't to save money, it's because it's the right thing to do.
