All the issues Americans face on a day to day basis and our federal government plays games blocking SC nominees, investigating completely fabricated collusion stories (for years); dreaming up who is actually winning elections, literally fabricating lies and recruiting political likeminded intelligence actors to agree to try and regain power or divert bad press near elections, enrich generations of their families, fly planes for 6 figures and never show up to vote.
Any non biased observation of Joe Biden would be one of immediate concern for his lack of situational awareness, inability to speak (no, not stuttering, speaking, stop referring to the stuttering, it has nothing to do with zombily asking “where’s Jackie” and etc) and non chalant suggestions that he doesn’t even make decisions for himself.
We’re experiencing one of the most unavailable presidents in quite some time, and when he is available, he isn’t impressive.
"We’re experiencing one of the most unavailable presidents in quite some time, and when he is available, he isn’t impressive".
As far as Biden goes... he seems to be in office more then his predecessor.
So how is he "unavailable?
".
You're joking right?
Trump spent 285 days at golf course and you're talking about Biden being unavailable?
Dude wants to go home in Delaware and Fox News/Republicans complain, yet Trump gets a pass because he's "working" on the course when his primary focus is hitting a ball into a stupid hole at the time.
Hes not working on the course nor was he doing the job he was elected to do.
