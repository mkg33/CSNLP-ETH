That’s not the way it should work.
Twitter is or was a space used by millions, including independent journalists and activists who had used it to reach wider audiences.
The fact that it can be ruined so easily by just one man displays a huge weakness in the structure of modern web and society in general.
It was highly problematic but far from the dumpster fire it is becoming.
I was often frustrated with the way Twitter was before but I couldn’t imagine it was possible to fuck it up even more.
Things like that should keep twitter alive but as long as it's hemorrhaging money and showing the world what an asshole musk is that's not too bad eh?
It seems like that is the route Twitter is taking and I might be wrong but right now Twitter is on everyone's mind so the marketing is working.
It's all publicity and everyone is talking about Twitter.
It might be rough but individual user usage is up, interactions are up, the news and many media outlets are posting and talking about Twitter.
It's a gambit that may pay off in the long run.
Because we humans like people that change.
The villain that sees his evil ways and comes to the side of good.
