I mean, last I was in Russia, they celebrated Christmas on the 7th of January, as the orthodox church didnt adjust for the Julian calender, like the catholics back whenâ€¦.
TL:Rd The Russian Orthodox church and some other eastern Orthodox churches still use a "Traditional" calendar that doesn't account for the leap years so it is partially shifted and will become more shifted as time goes on..
This must be some mistranslation I don't think there are any western rite orthodox in Ukraine at least not in sizable numbers, also most western orthodox are under Antioch or Moscow.
There's been ecumenical dialogue between Eastern Orthodoxy & Oriental Orthodoxy since the 60's to mend the schism, but one of the big roadblocks to that is (unsurprisingly) the Russian Orthodox Church.
'New Calendarists' use Revised Julian: "leap year every 4 years, except not every 100, except yes on the 2nd & 6th century of a 900-year cycle" [365.24222...] (This is actually closer to the mean Tropical year lenh [365.24219]).
Secular calendars use Gregorian: "leap year every 4 years, except not every 100, except yes every 400" [365.2425].
