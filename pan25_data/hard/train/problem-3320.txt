If Germany balks, the US will benefit doubly.
German engineering has never been in doubt - I don’t blame them for wanting to be weary of a crazy Likashenko or Putin “stealing” it.
They literally had Hitler themselves.
But there’s more danger if Russia prevails by far!
And by all means, Russia isnt ALL in, they still have to keep something to defend their borders, but they could go "fuck it, Zergrush!
the Nato will never attack us" the Ukraine CANT stand a full invasion.
They simply do not have enough warm bodies and the West could not keep up the support without massive shifts in defensive spending, like Rheinmetall has to build 10 new Factories to just replenish the losses.
Technological Transfers.
In a War, gear gets blown up and captured.
Giving Russia access to current gen MBT Tech is something no country really likes, the same goes for nearly every piece of gear but an MBT is an easy capture, a Gepard?
fuck it, Iris T?
good luck getting close enough to one to get your hands on.
But a Tank, welp, those things WILL be lost.
And nobody wants to see "their" tanks to get blown apart.
In a few years we will talk about Chinese/Iranian Javelin/NLaws.
Escalation.
When the Rammstein Meeting is over and they announce that DE/PL/NW/USA/GB ectpp will send like 600 MBT's in total.
What will russia do?
Go to a fully fledged war state?
Mobilize 5 Millions, Open ALL Depots?
Drown Ukraine in warm bodies and blood until the West breaks apart over cost and the will to defend a NON Nato member?
I support helping Ukraine more than most, but they're not fighting an "un-solicited proxi war" for the west.
They're defending themselves from an invasion, and no, the Baltics or Alaska are not next if Ukraine loses.
