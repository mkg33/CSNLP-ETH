The thing is, he’s trying to get on the Israelis’ good side so hard, to the point where it’s just begging at this point.
Israel isn’t going to let Ukraine use weapons that will be used on the Russians, especially as it would put them in the crosshairs of the Russians in Syria.
Second, if the impossible happens and Ukraine invades Israel, it’d just get nuked in exchange.
Not that complex.
Israel would hold the logistical advantage relative to Ukraine, and certainly has a much more capable military anyway.
Israel’s most powerful enemies are not the Palestinians, but Hezbollah and Iran.
Since Russia controls Syrian skies, Israel would have a much easier time bombing Hezbollah and Iran.
Israel and Russia have an on-going deconfliction mechanism which enables Israel to continuously bomb Syria, which we have seen hundreds of times in the last years.
And sure, Russia has armed Iran to some extent.
However, the Iranian build-up of weapons in Syria is much more important, and Russian deliveries to Iran wouldn’t end if Israel supports Ukraine with weapons.
Zelenskyy is usually right and seems to have a silver tongue, but Israel won't want full-throated Russian support of the Palestinians, especially given the Russian butchers located just next-door in Syria.
For Israel, discretion is the better part of valour in this case.
