The same bolsheviks who threw the Ukrainians to the Germans after the revolution are also the same bolsheviks who managed to convince Ukrainians to put their trust into the Soviet system and inevitably Ukrainians died by famine.
Yet even after Holodomor it was apparent the bolsheviks could influence Ukrainians - the same bolsheviks who convinced Soviet Ukrainians to not only fight to retake Ukraine from Nazi Germany (After the dual Russian/German offensive on Poland) but to kill the revolutionaries who fought the German and Soviet regimes.
DailyMotion - Nine lives of Makhno details the ambush of Tsarist convoys and the Russian betrayal of Ukraine along with the general mood of Revolutionary Ukrainians to the bolshevik uprising and the ensuing oppression of peasantry by the Russian regime.
They (Ukraine) hated the Tsar yet many lived under agony willingly - yet when they were able to take action they did!
I mean sure they will have the Army but those are all dead, under trained or criminals, most of which are needed in Ukraine.
We are doing a lot, Ukraine would have fallen a long time ago without the support of the west, we are risking what you mention.
Having said that, now that war has come, it cannot end with anything less than every invader being expelled from Ukraine.
I want no Russian troll to misread my comments as being pacifistic.
Peace should always be tried for, but destruction can be the only outcome for the invader.
