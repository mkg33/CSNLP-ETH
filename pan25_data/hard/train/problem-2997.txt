...And the shattering or isolation of the people that keep showering the most divisive nutjobs in the country with millions or billions will do a lot to rein that in.
That's more of an economic/"cultural victory" thing than a land war/invasion style of take over.
If the Russian empire shatters, this version of things would see the territory basically divided up into "Western" and "Chineese" spheres of influence and then the beginning of a new cold war.

Yes, back in the days multiple parties and coalitions existed and had been necessary to form a government.
Coalition and compromises are a actually a good thing, because it favors the moderate center of society.

It promotes black and white thinking and spirals into deeper rivalries.
