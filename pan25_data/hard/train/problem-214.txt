That is tedious semantics; even if on another fault, one quake can trigger others - as is obviously the case here.
And is also obviously a common consideration after an initial quake.
Whether or not the actual quake is technically an aftershock or not is a distraction.
I might be wrong, but the way I heard it is that Aftershocks have to be some amount of magnitude lower than the first earthquake.
The second earthquake that happened was almost as strong as the first.
I guess if you want to get semantic you can say the second quake was a triggered earthquake.
But for all intents and purposes, it's basically an aftershock.
The fault line probably overlaps with the aftershock cloud.
It's one of the reasons sometimes an aftershock can be larger than the principal quake.
Aftershocks are never larger than the primary seismic event.
Any events related to the most energetic release are referred to as either foreshocks or aftershocks.
Also, it appears at this time that the 7.5 event is a separate rupture with its own set of aftershocks but that designation may change as the event is studied more thoroughly.
