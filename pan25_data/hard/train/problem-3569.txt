I don’t even think Spartz would do well in a Senate primary for Indiana in 2024.
Jim Banks seems to be the favorite.
Banks’ district is Fort Wayne and the surrounding areas (ie.
manufacturing and farms).
Spartz’s district is the Indianapolis suburbs.
Her district is actually among the wealthiest in the state of Indiana and in the country (ie.
traditional Republicans).
Banks also has more name recognition in the state as well.
Part of the reason she voted present a few times during the speaker vote was that she did not trust McCarthy on Ukraine.
Also realize that McCarthy has to have the votes in the room now.
Meaning the first act he did was doing away with remote voting.
He literally is the stupidest politician.
The point of them having 15 votes is because no one else stepped up to the be the Speaker.
It is a shit job - especially with only a 5+ vote majority.
Anyone who wants anything can now hold him over a barrel for these type of votes if there are a few tokens who actually say no on belief.
