My school loans are paid off but I’m all about student loan forgiveness.
It’s not right to send young people into adulthood in crippling debt simply for getting educated.
Forgiveness isn’t even the right word it’s passing the buck onto responsible Americans who choose to not go to college or paid their debt.
If so, you should understand why someone who has already paid off their loans would like to be included in this forgiveness (issued a tax credit at least).
Yes, it would be better for the 1% to pay their fair share, but it's not necessary for student loan forgiveness to pay dividends in the economy.
If everyone gets a check you create inflation.
You literally just move the bar up that amount of money.
Everyone in the 99% is taxed all the way down.
College kid buys a used car, there is tax on gas, sales (in many states), registration fees, inspection in some states.
Then the person the college kid bought the used car from buys a house and has it built, the carpenters, electricians, suppliers, etc all get paid and taxed - and they all buy things with that money.
They were included, they were just too dumb to realize.
What are all of those college kids going to do with that new disposable income now, put it in a mattress?
Fuck no, they're going to buy things they need and want.
That money goes back into the economy where people who make, and provide those goods and services are taxed on everything they do and buy then the money goes back into the government.
