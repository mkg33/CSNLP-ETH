Do you think the government has a secret construction department they are choosing not to use and are instead subcontracting the work?
You realize that pretty much all major infrastructure work is subcontracted, right?
You've completely ignored the massive brain drain that happened at several federal departments during the Trump administration that caused decades of niche experience and knowledge to walk out the door.
You're pretending the department was as well and competently staffed when Biden took office as when Trump took office.
People here who are complaining that Biden is taking the political hit for Trump's actions are missing the point.
Biden has had two full years to roll back Trump's treasonous rollback of safety regulations.
And he has done nothing, because he got pushback from the corporate sector.
Even now (!)
he is doing nothing, leaving it up to Congress, where he knows nothing will be done, because he and Buttigieg are goddam neoliberal corporate Democrats and they simply aren't up to doing what must be done.
For me, every time something like this happens - when the Democrats (according to me, and YMMV) are seen to sell out the poor working class and cooperate with the corporate bad guys, we don't lose an inch, we lose a yard.
How can you say democrats should be responsible for this but then cry and fight every time they try to pass laws to hold corporations accountable for their actions?
