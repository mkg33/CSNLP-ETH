The dialectic of “oh no you’re so essential to the economy and the country, you HAVE to work through the pandemic and economic turmoil” and “eh it’s jobs for dumb people or high schoolers” is a REALLY frustrating fixture in American politics from conservative and liberal spaces.
The first is made in bad faith, and the second shows the elitist and classist feathers of those who are okay exploiting labor.
The wealthy ruling class will never treat the labor workers better unless they force them too.
One of the ways labor could fight for better treatment would be through striking.
That option was taken away by the president and congress.
The First Amendment guarantees peaceful assembly, that is the right that allows Unions to collectively bargain.
Anyone who voted to end the strike voted to subvert the rail workers constitutional rights because profits were more important.
oh no what would we have done if the entire bill that was forcing the railroad workers to give in was dead in the senate, then they would've been able to continue striking for better working conditions oh nooooo.
ALSO: The railroad owners were willing to shut down America’s economy to avoid a few paid sick days BUT ALSO because the Dems senate majority is too small, to pass the sick days alone thy’d have needed a supermajority, the republicans filibustered the amended bill with the sick days, and the rail owners had already spoken with them to make sure they’d do just that.
Railroad owners don’t even think they’re going to win this fight, eventually they know they’re going to have to pay for some sick days, they just wanted to fuck the Dems in a way they had the option to do.
If a simple majority would’ve passed it, the Dems would’ve done it because they’re the ones who passed the same.
