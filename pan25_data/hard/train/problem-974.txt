A gay white man is almost the right’s favourite person so some of us come to believe if we can just be discreet about who we see in our “personal time” we get to be part of them instead of the undesirables, and for a few it actually works.
Does feel a little “telling on yourself” that he thinks of buttstuff first when he thinks of gay men, as if all of us even enjoy or participate in it, or as if it’s an integral part of the identity or something.
I really don’t see how openness to anal penetration and positive attitudes towards gay men have anything to do with each other, a decently strong correlation I guess.
But I’m 1000% sure there is a non-zero amount of homophobes out there getting pegged semi-regularly, so I’m not sure what he was even trying to do.
I don't know how you prove you're not a homophobe, that's not really a problem I've encountered in life, but I'm thinking if I did, then his solution wouldn't even likely make my list of ideas.
As you point out, it is very revealing that his mind went there.
