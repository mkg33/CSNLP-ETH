Deep down everyone knew that russians were incompetent even before the war, so I don't think anything changed that much...
This war showed how incompetent, ineffective and arrogant Russian forces were when they are put up with a challenge on a sudden notice.
Now with Russia gone as one of the three world powers in the world (USA, Russia and China) a spot is left to which plenty of countries are racing for.
Sooner or later China would be gone too as their butts are asking to be spanked with Indian batons during the border skirmishes and also to be bonked with Japanese and South Korean Navies.
In the near future when two seats would be empty (I am being optimistic), countries would like to fill it.
And any two other countries which would fill it would form a new world order.
This is my opinion, if you feel something is wrong, please do mention it.
The point about Democratic Russia sounds new to me.
Neither I have ever encountered this point nor thought about this.
I feel if a democratic Russia where protests are allowed existed, war wouldn't have been an option.
I agree with you.
IMO he means the manufacturing and processing industries will now reconsider where to put up with its industries after the losses they have accumulated from COVID to this war currently.
The current layoffs, inflation and unemployment are all lagging indicators of a recession sooner or later to come due the total effects of current war and COVID.
Any country which has the capability of surviving the recession would be a preferable spot for building up industries.
China's public is in a tumultuous state due to its stringent COVID laws and a foreign source is assisting them too.
