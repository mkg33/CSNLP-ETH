The majority of those rich people would not be able to maintain their standard of living elsewhere and likely wouldn't be able to continue making as much money many other places either.
Yeah, people like Joe Rogan can fuck off to the Austin suburbs living out their childhood fantasies of manhood with Alex Jones to keep them stupidly drunk, but most rich people can't make a hundred million dollars getting high in their garage.
They generally have to do some form of work for a living.
So they have to live where the experienced and educated workers earning the highest salaries live.
Doesn't like 90% of California's population live within an hour of the coast?
I have no idea how the other 10% lives beyond being seasonal workers and likely not having much any other option.
I'm not sure on the population %, but i'm not talking about the working poor without options to leave.
I'm confused about the UMC/MC in areas like Fresno/Riverside/Bakersfield/Modesto/Inland Empire/Chino.
There are plenty of faceless suburbs and legitimately nice neighborhoods in each of those places...I just don't understand the thought process.
I grew up in Laguna Beach and have lived in LA for the past 15 years.
Everyone complains about COL and taxes (and they're not wrong), but most people I know who decided to leave for those reasons were back within 2yrs.
