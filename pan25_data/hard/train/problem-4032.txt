He never ever mentions how he beat Chris Christie in a round or how he broke the record on hole 11 or whatever.
If DT was even remotely good at golf at any point in his life, he would never stop showing clips of him teeing off and putting and such.
Even if he was just slightly above average for the 65+ age range he would boast about it every day.
He basically never talks about golf as a sport.
For someone who loves owning courses you'd think he'd use golf analogies all the time.
EDIT - I guess there is real evidence that he has been good at golf and yet still cheats and falsifies records.
I admit it has not crossed my particular leftist news feed.
I am still amazed he doesn't use more visuals of him golfing, but I guess I am not in the right demographic to see them.
These type of golf outing are not uncommon for him and I do not believe any of them are coincidental.
DJT learned a lot of his tactics early in his career from mafia lawyers.
Two mafia people travel out to the pine forest, an abandoned warehouse district or other secluded area for privacy...
It raises all sorts of red flags.
DJT goes out for a round of golf on his course with Lindsay Graham, he can say whatever he wants without repercussions or fear of it getting out.
Suddenly the next day Lindsay Graham flips to full support of DJT.
Or when he met with about 10 people for a round of golf earlier this year, but they just walked around talking and no one had golf clubs.
