I get it.
You know the truth and can’t share the truth because the truth will make you look ridiculous.
But what is implied by your posts is there is something wrong for a Black woman to achieve prestigious positions like District Attorney of one of America’s great cities, or getting elected Attorney General of America’s largest state.
Reading people like you, who ignore the complexities of the job and reduce it to “she sent ns to jail for weed” without giving any deets or actually providing any contextual info on it.
Not even explaining if you mean her tenure as AG where she wouldn’t deal with local marijuana cases, or her tenure as a DA where she ran the office that would be was in a city where the population wasn’t all that black (it’s not like she was DA in Oakland).
