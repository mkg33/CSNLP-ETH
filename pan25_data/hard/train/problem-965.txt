Its also not something as simple as "Oh just put an electric engine in it!".
The electric motors aren't small and you need 2 or 4 of them, 1 or 2 at the position where each axle would usually be, then you also need the space for the battery bank, which you need a lot of to make any meaningful mileage, and a computer to manage literally every aspect of the car.
Brother, even Tesla's have 2 engines, its not some novel idea just exclusively for "sports cars", its entirely normal, even from the link you posted 2/5 of those have 2 engines, and 2 of those that are single motor driven are extremely small and light cars, not sedans or muscle cars.
Battery packs are bigger than fuel tanks, so you'd need to put them somewhere else, which you can't do without ruining the chassis and bodywork.
Edit: Also, I'm not disagreeing with whether these cars should be allowed to be in the city center or not, but you don't understand classic cars and classic car owners at all.
Nobody says you have to dispose of your car, just that you won't enter the city center..seems reasonable and some cities already do that.
You'll still be able to drive your car, disposing of property working cars would be idiotic and nobody in their right mind (i hope) should suggest.
