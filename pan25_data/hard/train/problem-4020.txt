Probably stuff like ion engines and sensors.
You know, things that you want to run continuously for years.
If you were building that kind of stuff, wouldn’t you want them to be tested on something like the X-35?
They need some in situ way to test that stuff now that there’s no space shuttle.
The problem is that they have to launch it, deploy it properly, make sure it gets into a proper place and is able to maintain orbit.
That doesn't sound like something North Korea will be able to keep up with.
North Korea's all about trying to sell itself as a threat.
As far as the west goes, it's... not a huge enough force multiplier to give a shit about, but as far as North Korea thinks and reports to its leadership, it's a big fucking deal.
They're developing it because they don't have the choices of other nations wanting intelligence.
Russia's becoming unreliable, China's tightening its belt.
If they want to pretend to be the threat they think they are, they need satellite imagery... and everyone capable of providing that is sanctioned to the hilt or barred from doing business with North Korea.
Nah, it's Russia telling everyone that it is helping North Korea build a spy satellite.
Just like with the missile program.
This is their way of hitting back against western sanctions and support of Ukraine.
