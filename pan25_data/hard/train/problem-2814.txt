It's hilarious that Republicans claim that the FBI is run by Lefty Democrats.
I believe the FBI has never been run by a Democrat.
I'm pretty sure they start jailing Democrats just because they're Democrats.
It's kind of like the impeach Biden thing.
Just to prove that they're better at it.
No facts necessary!
They can jump from Biden impeachment.
To Benghazi to Afghanistan withdrawal.
Seeing as the Senate only meets I believe 3 days a week.
From Tuesday afternoon ending Thursday at noon.
They can just go all three issues everyday week after week after week.
All the way to election day 2024.
Maybe slide through an abortion ban.
A tax cut or 2 for the rich.
And you've got yourself an agenda.
Well paying job with great bennies after only 4 years too.
Wait until to hear about their retirement!
Money for offices and pak money you can spend like it's your own.
It's a great gig.
It's understandable so many criminals want one.
Honestly you can't blame anybody for taking the cash.
It's such a corrupt system.
They have to make any 3 letter organization that might go after Trump look corrupt.
It's just maneuvers and if it gets a republican off their butt to vote just for the possibility to see this all go down, all the better.
