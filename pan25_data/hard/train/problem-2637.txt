The bottom line is it WAS about free labor and economics, not human rights.
Well not about the human rights of the slaves.
I think they see that more and more people could not fucking care less about tradition and care far more about FACTS and a culture that matters to them rather than following something dead people followed.
The bottom line is this, the rest of the nation's colleges are not going to accept some home grown test that tows the party line for DeSantis and his band of merry Fascists.
They are looking for specific bodies of knowledge that serve a purpose to employers.
Your sincerely held beliefs and traditions are not worth a mouth full of cold spit in the work place.
math, science, biology, computer skills...those are worth something.
That you read the bible 20 times while growing up and believe that you eat the body and drank the blood of a fictional dude literally means nothing to most people these days.
As an educated person myself I'd argue that the civil war was about the economic disadvantage that Southern slavery put the north at.
It make seem a mere nuance but it is more truthful than saying it was just about slavery.
As an also educated person, it was about slavery.
You were taught that it was more nuanced but it really wasn’t.
You can say it was economics, but the economic advantage you’re referencing is the advantage of having free labor vs having to pay people for labor.
AKA slavery.
