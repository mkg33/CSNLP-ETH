Better yet, they can accelerate aging as well, so if you go broke and don't pay your cell rebooting subscription, Then you get on the fast track to the grave.
There are so many potential problems (and a few benefits I suppose) if we find a way to stop aging or massively extend our life spans, especially if it's en masse and easily affordable.
See, I don’t really want to live longer (just the population problem alone puts me off that), but being healthier up until the end would be great.
Like if I could be basically an 80 year old with the general health of a 45 year old and then kick the bucket?
I’m down.
I dunno, and I’m not saying anyone should agree with me, but I’m fine with shorter life.
This isn’t something that I recently started feeling.
My mom sent me to therapy when I was 10 for saying this sort of thing and that was 35 years ago.
I don’t think it’s sad and I’m not a depressed person.
The fact that it’s a limited run makes me appreciate it all the more.
If I hadn’t had a child I might already have checked out, but I would never do that to her.
If I happen to live longer, I won’t complain.
I have already had a very full rich life and look forward to whatever comes.
I guess in part because I don’t have any sort of “bucket list” or grand plan, I don’t really mind whenever the end happens to come (as long as it isn’t traumatic for those I love).
I have spent most of my life making things, music, art, businesses, etc and truly do love life.
I don’t view its ending as a sad thing, just an inevitability that I’d better be cool with.
I guess it sort of feels like when you’re on a long vacation; it’s all great (with, as you said, ups and downs) and it will end at some point.
Adding a few days is fine but as long as you’ve enjoyed it, it doesn’t feel like it really matters if it’s 30 days or 34 days.
I also don’t believe there is anything else, so I know I won’t be bummed out after.
