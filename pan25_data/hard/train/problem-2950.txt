It's like the people who glue themselves to our streets: they are only hurting the average Joe and not the people whose minds they actually need to change.
I do sometimes wonder at the fact that the Greens basically created their own demand: by doing their best to get rid of nuclear power and block its expansion, they are one of the main players who are responsible for the fact that Germany still needs to burn this much coal and gas.
Oh but make no mistake, german companies managing the coal extraction ARE smart and were very smart when they made everyone believe that getting rid of big bad nuclear plants was only for green energy.
Not only gas but most of their nuclear plants as well, that's what you get when you capitulate to the hard left and now they're complaining about coal...the irony isn't lost on me.
If those dipshits hadn't sabotaged renewables, there wouldn't be that much of a "demand" for coal today.
Demand of today for coal was "created" in the 2010s.
Now I am against energy production using coal.
It's messing up our air, environment and has caused my generation to grow up with a multitude of respiratory problems.
It should be stopped immediately and replaced by other sources.
But I can't help feeling that these demonstrators are not targeting the right people/situations or that they just want to do "something", as they are nowhere to be seen when all these developments are put into motion but show up when it's already been decided and execution time is right around the corner.
