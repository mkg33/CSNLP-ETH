Why should I accept giving land my people have owned for centuries just because some people who came maybe 10-20 years ago want to create a country there?
So why exactly do people who came to Palestine while it was being colonized get to establish a state there when the locals disapprove?
You can try to claim that Jews have always been mistreated in Arab countries and have never been part of the Arab communities but that is simply not true.
The creation of the Israeli state created hostility between Jews and Arabs and Jews left because they predicted that they would be driven out.
Modern Israel as a state is openly reviled by most Muslim and Arab states, even if the governments start to become friendly the population does not hold this sentiment.
The west does respect Jews as a people now although this is a result Holocaust not Israel becoming a state.
The Holocaust and the treatment of Jews in the immediate aftermath proved the need for a Jewish homeland.
Regarding the another people's land -- nothing guaranteed Palestinian collective ownership of the land.
Palestinians resided here, Jews have resided here as well alongside them, but none of them, until the creation of Israel managed to secure recognition and sovereignty.
I grew up in a town that was founded in 1937, before the creation of Israel, on land that was purchased from the non-Palestinian Arab previous owners.
Do Palestinians have a legitimate claim to the territory of my hometown?
As for whether or not the Palestinians have a claim on your hometown or not I have a quick question for you.
If during the British Colonization of Africa a large group of White settlers bought up land and cultivated it while also building cities to live in what would we call that?
(Hint it starts with C) and letâ€™s say during decolonization these people refused to leave and declared a independent state would you recognize their claim to independence?
