Depends how.
If you tax fossils and subsidy renewables with that money, government is left with a net zero.
But the effect is, that fossils are now more expensive and renewables are cheaper.
So both people and companies now have an interest to buy more in the renewables section and less in the fossil section, as it's better value.
Or there could be an incentive in place that taxes are reduced if those fossil fuel companies start transitioning to renewable type business.
How does further enriching governments reduce fuel prices, reduce fossil fuel emissions and stop climate change?
Well we will find out soon if there is any chance of a sensible federal government.
Probably too little too late at the expense of everything government as usual.
Pay down their thirty trillion dollar debt they built up by burning fossil fuels, stop burning fossil fuels fighting wars over fossil fuels and stop requiring the public to burn fossil fuels to pay for their folly might be a start.
Increase is literaly the opposite of decrease.
More revenue literally gives governments the ability to spend more.
You have no idea how any of it works.
