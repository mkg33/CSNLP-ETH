Everything that does not align with these guys is 'fascism', kills every discussion every fucking time.
I dont agree with what South Korea is trying to do or what Norway did, but to just call it fascism is just so fucking dumb and makes sure that you can't say anything about it.
I don't agree with calling the country fascist off the get-go but saying that it's "just a forced dumb policy" is extremely reductive and dumb.
People view fascism as this boogeyman that's dead and can't come back when in reality we have a lot of countries slowly getting more and more fascist-akin policies and people of power but they keep getting glossed over because "it's not fascism yet so no need to worry".
Maybe one could argue it just needs fewer not-fascist-like things than fascist-like things, but, that leaves room for lots of fascism.
Fascism is more a broad category of "fascist-like" things; not a particular thing, or set of things, right?
Calling the country itself fascist is downright absurd, but a certain policy alone can be fascist.
Forcing people to work against their will for the good of society instead of caring about their individual rights to strike?
Sounds pretty fucking fascist.
Edit: I guess another argument someone might have is, "it's not fascist, just despotic."
Or something.
But is that any better?
We should oppose despotism and fascism in equal measure.
They are functionally interchangeable, when it comes to "things we should oppose.
".
