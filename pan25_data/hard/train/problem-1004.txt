There are different types of filibusters.
Where one senator stands up and reads is one thing, requiring supermajorities to pass anything in a country that is split evenly down the middle effectively shuts down congress.
I’m talking about the requirement for 60 votes to force a vote, and the existence of the 2-track system allowing the Senate to move on to other matters rather than having to vote on an issue before moving on to another issue.
If they want to filibuster that’s fine, make them stand there and read Dr. Seuss and actually be in any way accountable.
It’s absurd that they just decided to completely break the Senate because they were lazy, and now they stick to it because “if we eliminate the filibuster rule it’ll come back to bite us when the GOP is in the majority.”.
I disagree that the Dems are that gullible, but without 52 votes they can't kill the filibuster.
Right now they have 50 votes and if they get Warnock they'll have 51 votes....still one vote short.
Vote every time.
In every election.
When we do that, the GOP will be as influential as the Green party.
