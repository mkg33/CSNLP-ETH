This is actually false.
They were as efficient for the time period in giving light in all directions compared to LEDs, but advancements in LEDs and the changes in designs mean that LEDs are actually much more efficient than CFLs.
However, they are both significantly more efficient than incandescent lights.
That makes sense.
I don't get headaches and I rarely have sleep issues.
I also really hate yellow lighting as it comes across as overly fake.
Personally, if it is time for bed, I just switch lights off and usually I am asleep very quickly.
But when I'm coming home from a night shift at work under 6500K lights I want 2700k-3500k lights to quickly induce my my need to sleep.
The solution is to have multiple light sources in your home to change throughout the day, or have two/three-tone LEDs that dim like traditional incandescents.
Yes, I found adding more lights fixes the issue, but somwthing i did have ro think through as replacing just a handful of bulbs reduced the regular lighht output.
I have lots of lightstrips too, behind TVs, inside glass cabinets, under kitchen cabinets etc that really add to the overall light and make it even and consistent throughout the spaces.
