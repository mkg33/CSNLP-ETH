Yeah, shops carry zero-nicotine versions of most products, like it's the same exact thing without any nicotine.
I'm not clear on the law but I think (in my state at least) they're required to.
Yes, and that is exactly, EXACTLY what this legislation is doing.
It is not prohibiting people from getting the addictive and harmful drug.
It is regulating how that drug can be sold.
There was already an active black market for tobacco products in that region due to differences in tax rates among those small states.
The strongest wording on the issue of flavored tobacco products in that report is "The increase in seizures of flavored ENDS products and menthol cigarettes combined with the decrease in revenue for cigarettes and OTP likely indicates increased cross-border smuggling of these products.
".
The idea that this law is going to generate some terrible black market crime spiral for fucking MENTHOL CIGARETTES is just so silly that it barely seems worth responding to.
I believe that the ban in MA has increased the amount that those products are being smuggled into the state.
That will probably happen in CA too.
But there is already a black market for highly-taxed items everywhere that the taxes are lower nearby.
That is what created that black market.
The smugglers are just now taking advantage of the new flavoring ban to feed what will be a dwindling customer base.
This will shake out over time as new smokers get hooked on non-flavored tobacco.
Again menthol has been in cigarettes since nearly the beginning.
Where is this new found concern coming from that mint is what is increasing kids to smoke?
When I started smoking at 16 I hated menthol, same with all my friends.
I was stupid and smoked in high school.
Menthols weren't exactly extra popular with all the young teen smokers.
Is there any data showing menthol availability increases youth smoking rates?
