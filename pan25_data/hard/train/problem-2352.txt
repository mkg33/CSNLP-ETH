Education is a right guaranteed by the United States.
But, that’s upheld through the federal judiciary and state constitutions.
It is not enumerated in the US Constitution.
And the 1st Amendment, on matters of religion, only explicitly applies to acts of Congress.
The model I’ve come to understand: public schools must enforce the 1st Amendment because much of their funding is through the legislatures- state and federal.
The legislatures, by the 1st Amendment, can’t grant money to an establishment promoting a particular religion.
So, public schools, to get funding, abide by the 1st.
That’s the main reason why public school teachers can’t preach.
Whereas private schools can express more religiosity.
As far as I am aware, for so long as said religious schools do not receive federal funds through Congress, the U.S. Constitution doesn’t prohibit this.
So, unless there is a federal law on the matter, this is a matter of Oklahoma state law.
That said, I’m not a fan of the idea of state funds going toward teaching religious doctrine.
So what qualifies as a religion that needs funding?
Can I create a religion where my core tenet is that I get $1,000,000 of government funding to eat Chinese food, pizza and take a Caribbean vacation when I ever I feel?
It’s my right.
