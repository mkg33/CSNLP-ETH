This is what's broken.
This shouldn't be possible.
The consequences for ignoring the court's ruling were not severe enough.
Every one of those defiant members should have been held in contempt of court and thrown in jail until they followed the order of the court if that's what it took to get fair maps.
But when the sitting governor is on the redistricting board and the governor's son is a Supreme Court justice, this is the kind of corruption that happens.
The difference was that in NY, the officials actually obeyed the court's decision.
In Ohio, the redistricting committee just ignored the court and did what they wanted to anyway.
Ohio the state that refused to change said maps that VOTERS VOTED to draw up new maps .. Ohio that 4-5 times ignored the Ohio supreme courts ruling.
Right, but that only happened because the state GOP just ignored the state Supreme Court for so long that we had to use the old maps in order to have an election at all.
Contrast this to places like NY, where they listened to the federal courts and redrew less gerrymandered maps, basically throwing control of the House to republicans.
Gotta love this countryâ€¦.
