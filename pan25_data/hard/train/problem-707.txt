Before the revolution and the end of the civil war you're looking at a society in which i) The vast majority of people cannot read or write and ii) Legal systems are literally medieval, if you were a bastard you were prohibited from participating in numerous professions, if you were a farmer you still effectively lived in an aristocrats demense and either they or the local church would have total control over the local courts.
