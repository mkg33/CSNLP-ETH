Life expectancy is coming down though, especially with the drastic increase in cardiac arrest and heart attacks in 20s to 40s year olds, and of course Covid, both directly and indirectly.
I also expect “deaths of despair” to sharply increase following increased poverty due to inflation, we haven’t seen that yet.
Gen. Z will bear the brunt on this.
So I think life expectancy will approach early 20th century levels by the time we’re old, and that far fewer of us will make it to old age than we realize.
If life expectancy grew to 100, would you expect to still be able to retire at 62 and spend almost as long being supported in retirement as you did working?
In short: the relative amount of retirement you get as a portion your life increases, the amount of work you have to do decreases all while fewer people pay in and more people get the payout.
Ideally everyone who wanted to would retire young, but it's not reasonable to expect a smaller cohort of working people to support a growing number of retirees for more and more years.
I'd be much more in favour of lowering social taxes, raising retirement age a bit, and telling people to invest the difference in a tax shelter which they can use to retire early if they want to.
Personal responsibility and all that.
Another interesting tidbit I picked up is that there are a lot of people in their late 50s who are unemployed.
Very hard to get a new job if you lose it in your 50s.
And so, what will happen if they raise the retirement age?
There will just be more people on chômage instead of on their retraite.
So not much saving for the government there...
