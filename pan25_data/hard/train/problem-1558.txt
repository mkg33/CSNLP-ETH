It feels bizarre that we had a reclusive drunk for a president for ten years, now Pavel hasn't even been sworn in and he's already in major international news every single day.
With Milo≈° Zeman leaving the office, some of the final remnants of our East-aligned past are finally fading out.
I really hope that in some time, Czechia will become a true Western liberal democracy.
As a side tangent, I hope one of the first things Pavel does is change it back to Czech Republic.
This was basically unilateral by Zeman.
It is so embarrassing - Czechia only works if there is such a thing as "Czechians".
Think about it.
That's typical inferiority complex.
It IS a successful western liberal democracy and one of the nicest places to live in Europe now.
It is hardly just Czechs democracy that has struggled with populism - even the US/UK have seen successful ignorance campaigns.
Nope - it was an official change with significant political implications.
Here's a good summary for English speakers:
Here's the history.
It was basically a unilateral decision by Zeman.
Many, myself included perceived it as a general pro-Russian stance and attempt to distance Czechs from Europe - make it sound more "Eastern".
Toomas Hendrik Ilves has stated that the Baltics' only goal post USSR was to join NATO, but NATO wouldn't have them, the British, French, and Germans at the time were too Russophilic.
Imho: Don't know about deserving, but joining would make sense given the whole purpose of the NATO was protection from the Soviet Union / Russia.
When Ukraine will start rebuilding their society and economy things would be better without the fear of a return by their murderous neighbors.
Plus it would give the world some peace of mind about all the military hardware left there (being NATO would go a long way preventing Russia from trying to obtain it).
