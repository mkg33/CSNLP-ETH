Worse, they know what the response will be if they try to move on Taiwan.
I mean, it's good knowing so they can incorporate it in their strategic planning, but bad that their ambitions are so obviously checked now.
China, despite its bluster, is even less prepared for an assault across the roughly 100km of Taiwan Strait.
They can't build up a big enough invasion force or increase airfield operations along the coast ahead of time without the US noticing.
Extending your argument: from a strategic point of view, the best thing to happen to the US and the world was the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese.
Not only did it bring the US into the war and make it a superpower, it drove openly fascist and Nazi movements in the US mostly underground for almost three generations.
Of course they were still working behind the scenes, giving us our current problems, but it greatly diminished their influence until recently.
As unprepared as Russia turned out to be for a ground invasion, they at least amassed a bunch of troops for a "training exercise" along the Ukrainian border.
Similar to the propaganda about how terrifying and effective the Russian Army was supposed to be until they invaded Ukraine.
But didn’t all our Allie’s all get similar briefings from the US about the imminent invasion and everyone didn’t believe it including Ukraine itself, which left it less than ideally prepared the first few days of war….
