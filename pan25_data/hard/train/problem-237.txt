Of course.
It's always this card.
Every time it will be "b-but she's black and gay!"
It's still a very shit trade.
One of the most notorious and deadly arms dealers in the world for a shit-tier "celebrity"?
What about Whelan?
exchanged one of the deadliest arms dealers of all time, nicknamed The Merchant of Death, who planned to sell weapons to kill Americans.
(they really do care about their people, setting free one of the most notorious terrorists of all time).
All that for a fucking basketball player who is also a domestic abuser.
But hey, she's black and gay so it's worth it to trade a guy responsible for 1000+ deaths for some ass-tier "celebrity" WNBA player.
And used specifically because she's a black lesbian.
Mentioned in the article in the second paragraph, for some reason.

As far as the prison complex in the US goes, that's a drop in the bucket - but it's something at least, and it'll mean a potentially-lifechanging-lot to those few thousand who benefit from it.
Yeah.
If it's the only felony on their record, it's effectively giving them a clean legal slate - and an estimated 6.5 thousand US citizens'll benefit from it in that regard.
