Who didn't see that coming when June HI:MA:RS got going.
Plenty of cope on Russia's supposedly unlimited ammo stocks and how cheap/easy to make shells - ignoring logistics of supply and use.
And then disparage everyone as sheep / echo chamber / can't handle negative news / disconnected from reality i.e.
the one that they just made up to push.
Ukraine doesn't have to beat the entirety of Russia.
Just carve them out of their country one slice at a time.
And then feign concern about Ukrainians, backpedal, declare support for more UA weapons, and foster really genuine concern cause ya know "we" are all on the same team right?
"I have said many times since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine: I believe that Ukraine should get all the necessary weapons that they need to be able to cope with the defense of their homeland.
Ukraine (and all of the neighboring countries of Russia who don't want to get gobbled up) needs a military large and strong enough so that Russia won't even contemplate attacking them again.
But if any NATO nation blocks Ukraine from joining NATO then Ukraine will very quickly build nuclear weapons as a deterrent against Russia.
NATO and the EU have vowed to bolster their backing for Ukraine to fight off Russia's invasion, and ramp up cooperation between Europe and the US-led alliance.
⚡️The EU promises sanctions against Belarus and Iran for supporting the Russian war against Ukraine.
And then whoever blocked Ukraine from joining NATO \cough Hungary\ will then have a nuclear armed neighbour.
It's either Ukraine joins NATO or Ukraine builds a nuclear deterrent.
Those are the choices.
Russian word is worth fuck all.
