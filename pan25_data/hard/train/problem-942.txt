But since we recently found out about China floating their balloons all over the place and one being shot down last week, it seems more likely that this is connected to that and not something from outer space.
And what the pilots allegedly said sounds super creepy out of context, but when you think about it, what can hover in the air, is unmanned, has no visible propulsion and can mess with a plane's electronics?
A balloon loaded with antennas and surveillance equipment.
These balloons have been detected previously.
I personally believe they where largely responsible for the majority of the UAP sightings reported by the US navy in the past 10 years.
It's like straight batshit crazy conspiracy but I'd argue it's less crazy than aircraft's that are so technologically advanced we can't even follow them.
I think they purposefully decided to leak all the information regarding tic tac's and UAP's essentially playing dumb to the public to further the idea that they had no clue what it could possibly be.
"This is mundane but the military is hiding what they know" is much less crazy conspiracy than any other conspiracy related to UAP, honestly.
It's almost just a given.
We know they have been doing that for decades upon decades.
