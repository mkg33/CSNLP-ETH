this is literally what made me regret my city planning master's degree and decide to get into business.
it was 2011 and people were asking warren buffet about bike sharing.
he very candidly replied, "i have no idea".
eh- there are buses now, do you take the bus?
the reason rails typically have higher ridership is precisely because they're inflexible.
the train goes on the tracks, so you know where to catch the train.
on december 20th, the NYC subway did 3.5 million trips in a day.
(not including, bus, ferry, long island rail road, metro north rail road, nj transit railroad, or port authority trans hudson PATH serivce).
so yeah i guess having a zillion bus routes with half a dozen people on each would mean a half a dozen zillion trips.
The problem is there are different situations where buses make more sense than street cars and there are a few situations where street cars make more sense than buses.
But yeah, there are ways to make buses better, & lots of situations where they end up the best option.
So he's saying that they should put money in a bus system because it's cheaper and more flexible than a streetcar system.
A smoother rides is probably true, and investment due to infrastructure is a valid point, but bang for the buck I still think buses are a better choice, in part because I've seen the failures of poorly thought-out street cars.
even low or no cost public transportation but I don't support badly designed, overly costly, ineffective public transportation when better options exist.
