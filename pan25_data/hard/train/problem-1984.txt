Much worse whoever succeeds Hitler probably won't micromanage German military strategy and the axis may end up doing better.
At the end of the war Stalin was quoted in saying Soviet's best general was Adolf Hitler because his hold or die orders did most of the work for the red army to encircle German divisions.
Its a faulty assumption that whoever takes over after Putin will want peace because there are hardliners within the Putin regime that want to escalate and use bigger weapons in Ukraine.
That Chechen warlord is openly calling for the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.
To me, a total Ukrainian victory means Russia will bring out the nukes.
Why is everyone pretending they don't have the largest (I think they have more than the US) nuclear arsenal in the world.
Putin clearly has no regard for Ukrainian or even Russian lives.
If ukraine wins, especially if they move past Crimea and into Russia, I bet he would do it.
It'd be great to see the narrative shift to ending this war without nuclear annihilation.
Unfortunately that means sitting down and negotiating.
God help us all.
