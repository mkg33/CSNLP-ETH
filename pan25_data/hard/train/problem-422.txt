Sigh.
Your own source actually shows you're incorrect on this.
Mathematical literacy is a thing you should brush up on.
You might also want to view more than the most recent year's numbers.
It might become more obvious to you.
From what sources?
This is the issue my friend.
A few billionaires able to pave the way or (hundreds of) thousands of citizens wanting a better life.
Which sounds like a proper source of funds for electioneering.
Yes there are billionaires that donate to Democrats and spend for Democrats; not even close to the amount involved with the Republicans.
What does Sanders have to say about billionaires giving money to Democrats?
What does Sanders have to say about Democrats who willingly take money from these billionaires?
Does that negate that Republicans got 3x as much from billionaires?
That they get twice as much from corporations every year going back 20+ years?
Neither party could take the money if it wasn't for McConnells "greatest achievement" (his words) of Citizens United.
