I used to work at a place that had insurance through them.
I needed to get a blood test done, and verified in advance that UH would cover it.
Had the test done, the bill came out to like $20 for me.
All was well.
Yea.
That's the thing about even listing some of the 'insured' statistics.
Just because someone has monthly medical insurance doesn't mean they can actually afford prescriptions on that plan, doctor's visits on that plans, etc...
That number is MUCH MUCH less than the actual number of Americans who are listed as having 'medical insurance'.
All sorts of studies showing 70,000 or more Americans die every year because of unaffordable insurance plans.
And other studies showing hundreds of thousands dies in covid because of our for-profit plans.
Studies showing that lowering Medicare eligibility age would increase life expectancy especially in minority communities.
Until people understand the role of corporate media in normalizing the brutality of our existence we are left with nothing to do but stack bodies to the sky waiting in the name of profits to multi national corporations.
But of course corporate media which is owned by the same people who own for-profit healthcare will never cover this issue in a way where the politicians beholden to healthcare lobbyists are radical or extreme or racist or mass murderers.
