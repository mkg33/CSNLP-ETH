I remember my dad telling me about when he was on a cargo plane helping drop off supplies in a jungle.
They dropped a coil of but the parachute didn't open.
As it hit the ground the metal clips which held the coil broke.
It rapidly uncoiled like an angry homicidal spring and shredded everything it touched.
It cleared quite an area of the jungle.
He mentioned that at the time he wondered if dropping something like that (not specifically razor wire!)
on a mine field would clear any of them.
When people have suggested anything but a total conquest some of those people who have really taken the propaganda to heart have branded such people as traitors to Russia and Putin, as cowards, Nazi supporters, as being weak and in league with the West.
For Mr. Putin, the symbolism is a central trope in his messaging to Russians to push them to support his war in Ukraine, with the Kremlinâ€™s propaganda falsely describing the Ukrainians as modern-day Nazis and twisting reality to describe the Russian invasion as a defensive war.
Those that do fall to authoritarianism will likely not have the same imperial aspirations as Russia does, as they are not empires and their nationalist streak would not be about restoring the former Russian empire.
More about internal affairs and retaining power.
