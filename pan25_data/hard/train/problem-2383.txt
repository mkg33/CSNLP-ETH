Among the other prominent accounts suspended were the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, an antifascist group that provides armed security for LGBTQ+ events in North Texas, and CrimethInc, an anarchist collective that has published and distributed anarchist and anti-authoritarian zines, books, posters, and podcasts since the mid-1990s.
>“What I believe happened is that I and other accounts have been mass reported for the last few weeks by a dedicated group of far-right extremists who want to erase archived evidence of their past misdeeds and to neutralize our ability to expose them in the future,” Loder said.
“What I suspect happened is that Twitter’s automatic systems flagged my account for some reason and no human being is reviewing these.”.
I've seen people claiming that they haven't noticed any changes with Twitter, and it just signals to everyone that they've long ago gotten sucked into this rabbit hole.
They will - eventually - as more and more people catch on to what Twitter is morphing into which is yet another rightwing propaganda rag.
Wow, the right is really determined to turn Twitter into another right-wing rag site that no sane, reasonable person would want to spend a nano-second on.
At the least I'd like to believe that there are still far more normies (rational, reasonable folks) than there are right wing crazies in the world.
I don't follow any extreme right wingers but my home feed is nothing but right wing extremism.
Guess I'm not the only one.
I've cut my twitter significantly the last 3 weeks.
I'm pretty moderate politically and if I feel this way it's probably only a matter of time before advertisers take notice.
