"Such loans are largely reported on an honor system because the U.S. Office of Government Ethics has neither the resources nor the power to delve into a president's assets.

Here's the thing.
Why would the people who make the laws and regulations regulate their own forms of income?
Whatre we the people going to do about it?
We still have to vote one of them into office.
There's ZERO incentive for them to ever regulate lobbyist contributions.

$600?
I could see maybe if it was something like several thousand to weed out casual sellers like yourself over pros.
But $600 is just ridiculous.
A lot of online sellers like you are insisting people pay them under friends and family to get around this.
But buyers donâ€™t want to do that because it means no buyer protection.
Maybe they should send over some of those 80,000 new IRS agents who are looking into people getting over $600 on Venmo to the ethics office to work then.
Technically you can deduct the expenses you had to get those sales.
So that means you need to have the receipts of the original purchase and then do a depreciation against that to come up with value you can deduct.
