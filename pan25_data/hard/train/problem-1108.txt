What’s most ridiculous about that (to me anyways) is that it’s the kids who don’t learn about sex or safe sex who are more likely to have a teenage pregnancy and/or practice unsafe sex.
Say the parent doesn't want their child to have comprehensive sex education because they're worried about their kid having sex and getting pregnant.
Well, studies have shown that teaching children "never have sex" is completely ineffectual and doesn't affect teenage pregnancies.
They have shown on the other hand though that comprehensive sex education reduces the numbers of teenage pregnancies, and then has a weak correlation with them having less sex.
What is the right thing to do here?
Do you override the parent, because they have no idea that what they want is counterproductive?
Or do you allow them to do as they wish, and achieve nothing at all?
Regarding gender, there's a simple apolitical way to handle it.
"Some people identify with a different gender than they are born with.
Some people like girls regardless of their own gender, some little like boys, and some like both or neither.
It's all normal.
".
I mean.
There’s a difference right?
I don’t agree with my kid being taught creationism because it’s an unproven idea someone had that has no bearing on reality.
A girl raised her hand and asked "But what if our family doesn't think evolution is real, and doesn't want us learning about it?
".
