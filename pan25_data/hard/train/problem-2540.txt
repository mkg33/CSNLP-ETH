It's more important than ever that we get a third party candidate for this reason--even if it ends up being Trump.
Checks and balances are desperately needed in these debates, only the appearance of a 3rd party candidate can call bullshit on this and force an actual debate to happen.
What would be glorious is if whoever does debate practice with the Democratic candidate comes on stage, too, wearing a cheap paper mask of the Republican's face, and spouts the Republican lines for the candidate to respond to.
I think a happy medium is to let the Democratic nominee answer the question, and then when the Republican nominee WOULD get to answer just have the moderator say "as a reminder, the Republican nominee has declined to participate in this debate" every time.
Even if they did do the debate with no Republican, fox would just do their own debate, invite the democrat but put outrageous demands on their appearance like having to declare gay people are a threat to children, everyone should own a machine gun, and Hilary Clinton is a paedophile, and when the democrat refused those conditions, have the debate with only the Republican and say the democrat wouldnâ€™t come because they refused perfectly reasonable debate rules.
