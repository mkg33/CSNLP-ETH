US MIC certainly has benefited along the way too.
I would caution the thought process that the US gov is basically just using debt spending to directly produce huge US MIC windfalls.
Seeing the way individual loans or grants are structured would shed light on this.
Is said money dog-eared to procure a specific system from a specific company, potentially at a specific price.
I believe the loans are and the grants are open ended as we likely don’t have the best option for whatever specific need Ukraine has that we want to help.
That could be cases like generators, basic ammunition, food, fuel.
The cash let’s them procure the optimal deal in time and logistical constraints for things that would have many potential suppliers.
As far as I am aware very little is being given to ukraine right off a production line / active procurement program.
Therefore any money going back to defense corps should be from orders placed by Ukraine using their own defense budget, to some extent bolstered by US loans/grants.
I'm not really sure Ukraine is getting actual money to spend, I think it's mostly supplies and weapons.
I really would like to see a balance sheet from the United States with details about where the money is going but I think I already know... Raytheon, Boeing, Northrup, etc...
