George Santos was not rich before.
He chose to do all the things he did while being openly gay and then manipulated the corrupt system into becoming rich.
It's identity politics clouding your judgement.
The website is LGBTQ nation.
I think it's entirely appropriate.
Too many folks see sexual identity as a personality trait and political tool.
It blatantly points out that just because a person is out and LGBTQ, it does not mean they are any better to represent you.
It does, because it lays bare the hypocrisy of anyone claiming to be a gay Republican.
Republicans hate gays.
They'd make their existence illegal if they could.
A gay Republican championing a party that wants to oppress them, harm them, destroy them is ... something else.
When one party constantly votes to harm LGBTQ people and the other does not, the term 'identity politics' becomes completely meaningless.
How is it not?
I mean sure, in a better world those shouldn't be things.
In this world, however, one party straight up hates LGBTQ people and constantly tries to legislate their rights away.
Does this mean all LGBTQ people vote for democrats?
No, there are people whose wealth makes rights meaningless for them personally, like Peter Thiel.
