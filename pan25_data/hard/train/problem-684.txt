Edited to add: if they had even a whiff of a liberal justice or one of their clerks being even tangentially involved, they would have fingered that person.
Right-wing media would be blasting it from the rooftops.
Things like this inevitably have a paper trail.
Either was a conservative justice who leaked it, or the investigation was handled incompetently.
Sure seems like it was leaked by one of the conservative justices to make the story the outrage over the leak rather than the terrible judicial decision but whatever.
Here's an ultraconservative commenting on the WSJ editorial at the time and wondering if it is the result of a leak:
They didn't even look at any of the justices.
But the so-called liberal media is out there gaslighting us yet again by quoting the maga party member, Michael Chertoff, calling it a "thorough" investigation.
FWIW â€” scrotus leaks are good, they shouldn't be a black box, they are a political body and we deserve more insight into how they operate.
So lets get more of them, especially the ones that reveal how lawless they really are.
