But it could make for a terrific "out" for Putin: "Drugs from the West tricked me into a war to destroy Russia I am pulling back all Russian forces now, and remember: NEVER TRUST THE WEST".
Sadly, I doubt this will happen.
Even if drugs did warp his judgement, he probably really did want to invade Ukraine in the first place.
Certainly he's had an eye on invading Ukraine for years.
But one could argue he might not have chosen this geopolitical moment, and this cack-handed approach, if a particular convergence of things hadn't influenced his decision-making (which can be any mix of rumour-mill favourites like medication, fear of impending mortality, Covid isolation, dementia, etc.
).
Meh.
Given Russia essentially being a pretro state, Ukraine overthrowing their Russian puppet government, developing their own oil and gas industry with western help, and enough proven reserves to threaten Russias oil dominance in Europe, it's all pretty straightforward.
What Putin has done is morally indefensible, but not totally illogical.
All the propaganda out of the kremlin justifying the invasion is total nonsense, but even that is likely just to keep their own from realizing it's just an oil war.
Sure it will require incredible amounts of backtracking and gaslighting from all the war supporters aside from Putin, but I'm sure he doesn't care about them.
