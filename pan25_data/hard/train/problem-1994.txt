Honestly the approach should be as harsh as against companies still operating in Russia.
If people are so outraged at what the Russians are doing they SHOULD be outraged at this fucking disgusting world cup.
It isn't only the Russians corrupting and buying shit with tons of money.
I mean, who the fuck cares about Qatar or do they even have a football history?
Qatar does bad shit, no doubt about it.
But at least they've improved a little in the last 10 years.
FIFA is corrupt and always will be quite frankly.
They don't give a fuck, they're just as corrupt as FIFA.
This goes for every single player who plays in this tournament.
People excusing them because oh nooo it might be the only chance they get to play in the world cup are pathetic.
No way dude, I think you are overestimating how well educated the average person watching the world cup is.
People that don't even have highschool education are watching this on the national television of their own country, do you understand that?
Soccer is fucking huge.
It goes all the way into the deep parts of every third world country.
