I really do not think this is an issue.
Or why it is even getting any coverage at all.
These documents are from when Biden was VP.
What is any relevance here?
And Who cares?
Point 1) this doesn't matter.
Just because it's fewer doesn't mean they have less sensitive information.
EVERYTHING ELSE you said was 100% true though.
It is an entirely different scenario.
Obviously the cases are completely different.
That being said, this fucking sucks.
The Republicans will blow this up, and use it as cover for Trump, and/or use it to attack Biden.
It also lends credence to Trump’s argument that “everyone does it.” Again, this is knowing full-well that the two cases are different.
