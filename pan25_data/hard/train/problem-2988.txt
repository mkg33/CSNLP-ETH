3) Flip the script around and deny any challenge to actual election fraud while your base now believes that to only allow their party to win is just and fair.
Goodbye democracy.
2) Elect saboteurs to rig elections from the inside, then have a corrupt SCOTUS vote on Moore v. Harper.
It’s so ironic that the party of voter integrity is not only pulling this shit but doing it and shoving it in our faces.
Politics has always been nasty business.
But not like this.
There were “rules” in place.
You bullshitted your way through but it was like kids ripping on each other.
You say something nasty and you get nasty back.
So when “we the people” find that our “leaders” have bastardized the entire system and have removed our votes from OUR system of government what do they think is our only remaining option?
In the final analysis, if the US loses its democracy and its looking like there is a fair chance of that, it will take years if ever to reestablish anything resembling it, after the tyranny and stupidity is dealt with.
To quote a phrase from Steve Bannon...” you have to kill this “authoritarian thinking and governance,”(paraphrasing here) in the crib.
If not, a wave of political and social violence will sweep the states, after a GOP win and welcome to the next new “Nazi” regime...don’t think it’s possible?
