Misinformation was already pretty bad in 2016, and arguably made the election that year way more contentious than it would've been otherwise.
Unless we had gotten a clamp on misinformation shortly after, we'd still have a huge population of people willing to buy into anything that would've fed their anti-Hillary bias.
And the right-wing would'be absolutely tried to capitalize off of that...
Cynically, it would've still been bad on US shores, but instead of it being due to negligence from the administration, it would've been via malicous protest from the opposition.
Less damage would've been done from the Oval Office, absolutely, but part of me feels we would've maintained our pre-2016 naivet√© had things gone down differently.
Though even with the hindsight, I still would've taken a reality where Trump was never president.
Had Trump taken a more serious tone with covid, he likely would have been re-elected.
Getting folks into masks, driving demand for vaccination, etc?
All would have appealed to those on the fence, easily.
