There isn't any saving them.
I gave up trying with some of my family members.
Some people don't care about truth they just want to be apart of the group think they associate with on Facebook and friends at church.
Well to be fair alot of Democrat voters attack Republicans if they don't get their way and also threaten violence if they lose..... checks notes.
Meanwhile, those think tanks have been telling right wing voters that if they don't take control of the government from Democrats, life as they know it will end.
Non-republican voters don't understand how important local, mid-term, or municipal elections are, for decades now billionaire funded right wing think tanks have been pushing rhetoric equating municipal elections with voting for a dog catcher, and left wing people have just adopted the conclusion that these elections or offices don't matter.
The voters have to do that part, and people who believe they could put in a good faith effort to make a difference need to throw their name in the hat.
They can't just "piCk A gOoD cAnDiDaTe1!"
and they can't put in the ground work to build up a candidate or get them on tickets for the voters.
Meanwhile, left wingers lives are at stake, but they've been convinced that the basic civic actions that would secure durable progress in a matter of a couple cycles are not important.
