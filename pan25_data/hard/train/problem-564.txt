All joking aside, I got Pfizer x2.
Then Pfizer boosted.
Then actual Covid in July.
Then the new booster October.
Exactly.
Pre vaccine I had a 40 year old healthy guy hospitalized for months, with complication after complication from Covid who passed away.
It was really terrible.
My child had the pre 5 year old shot at just before 5.
Then the booster.
Then Covid with me.
Then the new booster recently.
But I also accept that at this point, people can make their decisions and if you end up very sick, well don’t say I didn’t warn you.
But the problem with a pandemic is other people’s decisions still affect me.
So I would prefer if everyone was Vax’ed and boosted because while it’s not a sterilizing vaccine, it does reduce the spreading of covid and any reduction is helpful to everyone.
I want more people to get the vaccine to start with, and as long as it proves beneficial against the spread of omicron, I want people to get the BA4/5 specific Pfizer bivariant booster.
The vaccines are very helpful for reducing severity, but they don’t stop you from getting it.
I’m young, healthy, careful, and fully vaccinated… still got Covid last month.
In fact everyone in my house got it even though we’re all up to date on boosters.
