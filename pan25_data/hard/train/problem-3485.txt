Moving from staunch Russian allies to sitting the fence is a strictly good thing.
If they are willing to do things expressly for self interest without geopolitical concern then the US has more than enough capital to bribe them with.
It is just another sign of how far Russia has fallen that Iran has little concern for their opinion.
Taiwan's defense is substantial and they are rapidly expanding their antiship missile capability.
On the other side, China would need a significantly larger navy to perform the amphibious assault necessary to take it.
It'll be interesting because we'll know when China is planning on invading Taiwan because it'll be years worth of build up in order to create that many landing ships, let alone the logistics of sending that many troops to the ports.
I'd also like to mention how Taiwan has been expecting (and therefore preparing) that China will invade them at some point.
Ironically in some ways, China's best time to attack Taiwan is now, but Taiwan and the US are quickly getting ready.
China itself isn't quite ready though either, they still need to essentially double or even triple their current supply of amphibious vehicles, and the time it will take will be more than enough for the Defenders to be ready.
Also Korea and Japan have agreed to aid Taiwan, and I wouldn't be surprised if other nations contribute some as well.
Vietnam hates the Chinese almost as much as they hate the French.
Normandy was a fluke of really good luck and it still was extremely difficult.
If the Nazis did t think it was a feint, and didn't hold a lot back for reserves, then it probably would have failed.
No one on the mainland would have expected the Allied engineers to create a floating harbor on a beach that bought supplies in for months, even after the captured the main harbor.
