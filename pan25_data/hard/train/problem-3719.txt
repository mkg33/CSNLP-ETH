CCW permit holders are vetted by the local sheriff department in my state and receive training from the local police after a psych interview etc.
IMO, they are the only citizens/ regular people who should be allowed to carry a gun.
this headline is misleading because the term “Concealed Carry” in this situation refers to someone concealed carrying with a special permit; it’s always illegal to conceal a firearm without a permit.
While West Virginia is a Constitutional Carry state, meaning there is no requirement to obtain a concealed carry permit to carry in general, but this specifically requires someone to obtain a concealed carry permit prior to carrying on campus.
In addition, Constitutional Carry only applies to people over the age of 21 in WV.
There is a provisional concealed carry permit available to those under the age of 21, but the law does not appear to allow provisional carry licenses to carry on campus (provisional licenses have greater restrictions on them than the normal permits available in WV).
Don’t you understand though?
