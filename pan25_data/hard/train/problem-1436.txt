Could have been a pig slaughtering scheme.
A lot of old lonely ppl fall for it.
If he's been giving money to someone overseas who was promising him they'd come to visit him once they had enough cash there's nothing you can do.
I've seen accounts of children having to get their parent delcared financially incompetent to stop tiem from sending all their money to some dude in Asia pretending to be a 30-something woman even when it was blatantly obvious.
Hopefully it isn't that.
I don't think it is something like that.
He is pretty vocal about women he's in relationships with.
Also he lives in a senior community but he sees family pretty regularly.
He is just now about to lose his driving after he got covid his memory just suddenly got super bad.
My grandpa has started to get dementia and as everyone suddenly realized it it turns out he is completely broke.
All of his retirement, all of his assets are gone.
They are trying to get power of attorney to help him sort it out and they all think his identity was stolen.
I think he gave it to Trump.
Everyone thinks I'm being silly but I keep saying, read the emails they send.
They are meant to trick old people with dementia.
That's their target..
They are barely different from foreign scammers helping someone get rid of a virus.
