I don't think the Germans have a choice or anyone else for that matter but especially the Germans in their current situation of being cut off from russian gas, which is what fueled their entire economy and kept everyone warm in winter.
I don't think renewables will help Germany much more than it already does, its not a region known for sunshine and same for wind, sure they can generate some but I think Germany is a perfect example of how renewables aren't always the solution.
I could be wrong but I believe Germany is 1 of the world leaders in renewables and it's clearly not worked for them, so I think wasting more time and money on this is suicidal for Germany at this point.
Try telling that the Greta activist's with their Marxist hyperbole climate change narrative.
Keep in mind that Greta is not the first climate activist to be anti-nuclear, not by a long shot, and that people with that belief are a major reason why we still burn coal.
Secondly only a fucking lunatic burns lignite coal, one of the dirtiest fuels around, which does far more than it's fair share to hasten the collapse of our climate.
Yea, destroying less villages than were signed off on years ago and ending coal earlier than planned before, certainly is going back to coal.
