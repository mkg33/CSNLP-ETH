It's such a beautiful sight to see!
I'd be even more funny if Jeffries managed to somehow convince 5 moderate Republicans to come over for it even though it would most likely never happen.
Yeah I keep hearing people talk about these "moderate Republicans" in congress that could side with Democrats, and I'm trying to figure out who the hell they are.
Kinzinger and Herrera-Butler both could have counted but they got primaried for... being too moderate.
In theory that's true, but in practice I don't think there would be unity among the Dems on that.
I have to think there are a lot of Democrats who would never support anyone for speaker who wiffled-waffled on the Jan. 6 insurrection, and that disqualifies almost all Republican congressmen at this point.
If something like that happened I think it would be more 125ish more moderate Republicans and 125ish moderate Democrats, and large numbers of defections on the ones farther to the right and left.
I highly doubt someone more extreme would get elected, moderate Republicans in swing districts still exist and they know they’ll get wiped off the map in 2024 if they elect an extremist.
There’s a reason almost if not all of the holdouts are either Freedom Caucus members or far right members.
So with all that in mind, the fact Pelosi was able to delay Republicans on their tax bill speaks volumes to her political prowess.
That’s not uncommon for the incoming House Majority Leader to do, even Pelosi and Hoyer would split leading the caucus in this manner.
Some of the responsibilities of the majority leader include scheduling legislation to be considered on the House floor, organizing daily, weekly, and yearly legislative plans and of course consulting with members of their party.
Scalise announcing the GOP’s legislative agenda is just him doing his job.
