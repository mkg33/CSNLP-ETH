I used to say when Obama was president is to suddenly agree with everything the Republicans want and watch them break.
(or to get what you want by having them do the opposite.
).
It really is.
The even more odd thing is that he grew up in a good sized city; Tampa.
Yet this inherent distrust of gov’t, except a gop run one, is all they ever care about.
Well the party has it established, regardless of the rando outliers.
So ya, you could put a D by your name and it wouldn’t matter b/c it’s be the similar of manchin/sinema.
This is the similar issue in Texas.
Beto ran a great campaign, laid out some solid plans and still lost.
I knew he would.
Why?
B/c once upon a time, in Texas, he said he would take some guns.
You CANNOT walk that back, and you cannot say that in Texas.
Have some solidly intelligent friends, and they will never break with GOP b/c of these two issues: guns and abortion.
Religion is a blight upon the existence of humanity.
It’s still odd b/c he was anti-trump from the beginning but couldn’t break from party for those reasons, and gave the “muh both sides” arguments.
We don’t talk very much anymore, tho.
More of an acquaintance now.
