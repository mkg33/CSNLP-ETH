Also: I am not for one damn instant suggesting TRUMP did any of this by accident.
The guy had 300+ classified documents from just four years in office.
Biden's stem from his 8 years as VP as well as his years in the senate and so far the numbers are unlikely to be that high (so far).
It's more believable to have that many misplaced documents over that many years versus 4 years as POTUS at 300+ documents.
Plus Trump had ignored requests for the return of the documents, lied about them, impeded searching, lied some more when his team didn't return all of the documents and then had the audacity to demand the documents he shouldn't have had be returned to him.
Trump on the other deliberately kept the documents, lied about not having them, then he handed over only some, actively hid the rest, and again lied about those documents as well.
People point out Trump's handling of classified docs because he intentionally stole documents and refused to give them back to the point that the feds had no choice but to raid his home and seize them.
It's really odd that you're willfully ignoring this distinction.
Not really.
Millions of classified docs get created, many of them hard copies that have the potential to be misplaced.
People who work in the Oval are constantly being given hard copies of classified materials and receive the bare minimum in training on handling them.
It's honestly a wonder that more of these docs are not leaked.
