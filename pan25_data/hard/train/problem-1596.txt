I remember watching a documentary on what lead up to the first nuclear bombings of another nation, and I recall that the Imperialist Japanese government was training every citizen in Kamikaze techniques.
Pretty sure the bullied country in question here is Japan, which had virtually no modern military spending up until now, who also had missiles lobbed at them for years from North Korea.
Are any of those countries (other than North Korea) talking about invading or forcibly "reunifying" their neighbors (other than China-Taiwan)?
Do any of them have any believable interest in attacking or invading N. Korea?
Is N. Korea's military build up notably defensive or offensive?
Could the US and or ROK have successfully invaded N. Korea and deposed the hereditary and cultish regime?
Have they?
Have they ever in word or deed suggested an interest in doing so?
Which country in the region has developed nukes?
Nk and Russia have large potential armies and nukes.
If we invaded Iran the country would unify like it did during the Iran-Iraq war and it would be very slow with a lot of guerilla warfare.
