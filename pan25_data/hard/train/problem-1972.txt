Wouldn't it be really simple?
Barrel wall needs to be 5 cm thick to contain the pressure, so you make it 6 cm and can afford to be off by up to 1 cm (resulting in a barrel that's 5 cm thick on one side and 7 cm on the other).
It's not the same process, but oil well casing needs to withstand similarly high pressure, and it is assumed that wall thickness is at least 87.5% of nominal to account for the thinnest possible wall that wouldn't be rejected during QC.
I cannot imagine a modern western army accepting cannon barrels that are almost 40% thicker on one side.
Hell, they probably had stricter QC during World War 1.
I mean, this is something that has been done since WW1.
The issue, however is that Ukraine is able to both find and destroy your stockpiles.
The fact it hasn't been so bitterly cold is making the winter pause before the Spring offensive that much harder for Russian logistics.
Russia is preparing a large offensive for late winter/spring, and they're probably saving whatever ammo they have left for this moment.
It's going to be a very tough time for both sides and Ukrainians are going to need every bit of help western countries can offer.
