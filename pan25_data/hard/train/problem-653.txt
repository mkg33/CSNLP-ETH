I’ve got a family member who got a felony when he was 18.
His legal debt to society was fulfilled decades ago.
He got a trade and became very successful in his profession.
He’s now a business owner.
You’d think that there should have been a federal lawsuit ages ago to standardize voting for people with felony convictions that have fulfilled their sentences in federal elections.
It’s ridiculous states have different election standards and someone can just move to a different state to get their rights back to vote for president.
You can't let the incarcerated vote, you're denying their rights on purpose and they are subject to coercion in a way that other voters are not.
Unless you're currently incarcerated, we're a democracy and it should be one person, one vote.
Innocent until proven guilty at the polls as well as the courts.
This is a terrible perversion of our system - and the areas that have prisons often count those non-voters against their gerrymandering power, which is also a perversion of democracy.
The real shitty thing is a lot of super mega prisons that are overwhelming in poor GOP led states still count that population that are incarcerated in their census and electorate.
Essentially committing fraud.
