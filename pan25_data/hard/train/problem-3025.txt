It’s all business to business transactions.
For someone who yells about First Amendment rights, Darth Santis doesn’t seem to understand that Apple can choose to allow any app it wants or ban any of them on its own whims.
Uh, wouldn’t use the force of government to make Apple carry Twitter in the App Store be a violation of their free speech?
1) Apple should ban Twitter from its platform because there is too much hate speech unmonitored on their platform.
2) Apple has too much control over material on the platform it sells.
I hate to think of what would happen if someone like Musk got control of the Apple or Android platform.
Ultimately, if Musk isn’t happy how he can promote his company on someone’s platform.
He’s welcome to invent his own smartphone, create his own App Store, create an ecosystem (user base), and then he decide which apps are allowed on his platform.
Wouldn’t people still be able to access twitter via the internet or the google play store?
So how is it a monopoly or how is Apple stopping them from running their business?
Why does Apple need to provide a platform to twitter if Musk doesn’t want to adhere to Apples term of service or promotes certain ideologies that perhaps doesn’t align with Apples culture?
