e; Also, the fact that it isn't Raffensberger advocating for ranked choice voting here and it's just some spokesperson who wasn't even willing to put their name on the record just throwing this out is a pretty big tell they're not serious.
Given the fairly huge difference between those processes, it seems pretty clear that they're not looking for the best process to fairly represent voters, they're trying to figure out the most PR friendly way to steal power for themselves.
I get his point about the extra hassle and expense of runoff elections, but frankly, it's still better than plurality winner elections.
A ranked choice system would be best, but my guess is that Republicans will ram through a change to just require a plurality, and then advance a bunch of fake "liberal" third party candidates to split the vote on the left.
The runoff election was supposed to favor Republicans this time it didn't, so the system needs to be adjusted so the will of the people does not contradict the will of the party.
