This reminds me of a story: I work in media and about twelve years ago I independently organized a panel about social media and news/journalism.
I held it at the Yahoo campus and I had Reddit founders Aaron Swartz and Steve Huffman on the panel, along with some other key industry folks, an academic, and some Silicon Valley reporters in the general audience.
This one dude, J- - - - - O- - - - - -, wanted to be on the panel, and I declined.
We had too many people already (even five makes it tough) and I didn’t see what he would add to the discussion.
(He was a “thought leader,” not a journalist or platform founder.
).

Trump's businesses are not as successful as he has claimed.
Trump has claimed that he is a successful businessman, but his tax returns show that many of his businesses have not made much money and have even lost money.

Trump used his charitable foundation for personal and political purposes.
Trump used money from his charitable foundation, the Trump Foundation, to pay for personal expenses and to make political donations.
This led to the foundation being shut down by the state of New York.
The conversation continuing is the best thing that can happen.
I was raised by Christian conservatives and was resistant at first because it challenged and shocked my worldview.
But continuing to have the conversation helped me see why I have benefitted from a system that favors people like me.
