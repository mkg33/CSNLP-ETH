Iâ€™m not denying itâ€™s scary.
When I was in JHB during a home invasion I watched my dads skull get caved in by a group of intruders with bricks.
Bricks my dude.
Half his face is plastic and metal now.
Miracle he survived -itâ€™s like a rebar beating except it leaves bits of brick and sand in your skull and brain cavity- they wanted the tv and vcr player and maybe to rape my mother, maybe.
First donâ€™t be so racist.
Second learn some history.
Third classic Greek democracy requires only citizens vote that know whatâ€™s happening.
Have you seen how America votes for things ?
Lol I think you might be one of those people that doesnâ€™t understand how the world works.
The fact you donâ€™t know this nor the fact that Zuma was educated in Russia.
Just shows how racist and disconnected you are with your world view of South Africa - please stay in AUS we donâ€™t need your kind of closed mind asshole who makes these negative statements from across the ocean.
Not to say that there are no political issues affecting whites that are ignored/exacerbated by the government but it's delusional to compare it to apartheid South Africa.
Some friends who visited from South Africa described it as apartheid turned up side down, another words the whites are now being treated like the blacks were treated pre Mandela but now itâ€™s not safe to be white and in South Africa, also said the place is riddled with corruption at every level.
I wonder is that why they are getting on so well with the Russians ðŸ«¢.
But Russia is.
Hence people not being happy with countries doing things with the country.
I mean when Russia needs to cosy up to North Korea, perhaps not best to be counted as their friends.
