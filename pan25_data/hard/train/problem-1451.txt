South Korea will probably be fine for a long time but guess we can see what kind of bs NK can cook up.
But make no mistake, if many people of the South understand one thing, is that the Kim Dynasty would be no good over South Korea.
Besides, unlike the North, the people are more likely to be armed and capable of resisting them.
The North Korean war machine is antiquated and more than likely hopelessly inept.
Well thats propaganda too, but unlike Russia, the fact is most of the country in NK is poor and ruled by a continous line of manchildren thinking their gods with most of the country barely having the infrastructure or healthcare to support themselves.
No one is immune to propaganda, but if you know what propaganda is you can at least take a stance against it.
Are you saying the right is how they are because of propaganda alone?
Sure there are irrationalist sheeps but there are much more "rational" reasons.
Yes those reasons are utterly selfish and partisan but they are still rational, in the sense that it's humanly understandable.
An SKn supporting NK is irrational to the extreme.
It's not even like someone believing in tarot or shamanism for personal benefit.
There is no benefit.
