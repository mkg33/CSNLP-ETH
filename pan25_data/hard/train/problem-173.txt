Hmmmm...
Unlikely.
We do t have many, they are mostly in the Baltic nations backfilling for Soviet tanks already forwarded to Ukraine.
And they don't use NATO standard ammo or barrels.
But that still gives them a much larger window to operate safely, and with AESA radar lob long range AA missiles at Ukrainian jets.
They will certainly be able to operate closer to Ukraine's air defence without detection, and relay data back to other aircraft, but they can't get as close as F-22/35 etc.
Ukraine has apparently been able to protect the air force they currently have so far, so I don't think that's a big issue.
Paratroopers will only work if they don't face real resistance, like we saw in Ukraine with the VDV at Hostomel airport.
Even with supplies from supporters inside Taiwan, they simply wont be able to hold ground or break an organized military without armoured reinforcements.
Artillery... just sounds like a bad plan, if Ukraine has shown anything, it is that military extortion aint well received from both those sympathetic to their side and those opposing them.
If they try it, it might forever destroy political influence they have inside Taiwan.
