In Georgia this fall, early in-person voting started out well above 2018 levels before more closely matching the last midterm.
In all, 2.5 million early votes were cast in person and by mail in Georgia as of Saturday, up from 2.1 million in 2018.
On Saturday, the number of ballots submitted surpassed 39.1 million, the number cast in 2018, according to data maintained by the United States Elections Project.
This yearâ€™s total will grow because election officials are still receiving ballots through the mail and some states allow in-person early voting through the weekend.
As of Sunday morning, voters had cast more than 39.2 million early votes.
For this cycle, nearly 20 million votes have been cast in 19 states that have voter registration by party identification, providing insight into who is voting early.
In those states, 43 percent of the early votes so far have come from voters registered as Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans and 23 percent from those who are unaffiliated or belong to a third party.
Although it is mostly older voters, he points out how the majority of these 75+ are actually democrats!
