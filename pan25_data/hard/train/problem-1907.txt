Please explain how that is at all parallel to Russia today with Ukraine.
Set aside whether you like it or not.
Explain how retaking territory that was taken via a genocidal and illegal war against Israel makes Israel like Russia.
And no.
Those houses are not illegal under Israeli law.
That’s just the stuff people say when they try to take snippets of history out of context or when they falsely equate something that happens a very small amount of times (like people building without housing permits or on disputed land, which both Palestinians and Israelis do) with the far more common legally built homes.
Same as how they pretend the settlements are all built on land Palestinians were evicted from, even though almost all of them are built on land that’s been empty and was owned by the Ottoman state, then the British, then Israel, and has been state-owned land for hundreds of years.
Of course - 'they pretend all settlements are built on land Palestinians are evicted from' naturally, this means that 'NO settlements are built on land Palestinians are evicted from', right?
You didn’t explain how isolated or small outposts that don’t make up even 10% of settlements are somehow proof that settlements are illegal under Israeli law as you claimed.
You didn’t explain how Israel building houses on land stolen from Israel illegally in 1948 is somehow the same as Russia invading Ukraine.
If you can't answer the facts I laid out about the history, or Zelensky explicitly saying Israel is like Ukraine and vice-versa, I suggest you rethink the issue.
Then explain it to Zelensky, who explicitly has said that Ukraine’s situation reminds him of Israel’s.
