so why should we believe china if they say they won't / don't?
china isn't known for saying the truth.
more the opposite.
look at what they did in hongkong etc.
- not to forget all the camps and other stuff.
look at the mess we have & had with russia and the dependency lots of countries had on them.
makes this 100x more and we have the issue on hand with china.
china is already in a mindset of wanting to do the same shit russia does with another country.
what makes you think they wouldn't try to support russia to pave their way in the future to do the same?
i mean look at the agressions china is spurting out.
i doubt they think "oh thats too much we shouldn't do that".
thats the issue i think.
everything in our world depends to parts on china or products & work of them.
the issue here is that the whole world depends on china to certain parts (and reverse).
if you punish china for something too hard, you punish yourself in some cases a lot more than probably china.
but if you punish china not hard enough, they won't learn.
Why would you think China would do something so stupid?
They don't have a Mad King at the helm trying to solidify legacy at the expense of his own country.
