Saturn V weighed 3000 tons.
Newsweek is a pile of crap and I'm not giving them the click.
Run of the mill old school H-bombs we2re way bigger than 12 times Hiroshima and they are dialed back because you are planning on precision strikes.
Most nuclear bombs these days are at least 12 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima.
Those were pretty low-powered nukes by today’s standard.
That’s not a headline, that’s an aggressively average sized nuke by today’s standards.
There’s been nukes literally thousands of times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.
Nuclear weapons have been far more powerful than Hiroshima for decades, and Russia is neither prepping nor priming one.
The video in question shows a missile being loaded into a silo (which is where most ICBMs are stored), and includes some specifications about it.
The actual article describes a Russian social media post, which consisted of a short video of them putting the missile into a silo and some statistics about the missile itself.
No, my initial comment is more in regards to the sensationalist title of the article, which describes a Russian video and social media post.
It's scaremongering for clicks.
