You have to keep in mind this isn't a one time thing.
This is a monthly or even weekly thing.
Different groups buy shit to encourage votes to go a specific way.
Some may not like this but this happens.
It happens with a lot of the big authors and pretty much every celebrity who writes a book.
Politicians do it to get supporters to buy books and other products and line their pockets.
A friend of mine drives a truck for a publishing house.
His whole job is taking books they printed to a recycling plant.
People buy them to have them recycled.
Him and his brother took 8 truck loads each of Michelle Obama's first book.
Agents and authors will buy a ton of books just to destroy.
They all do the shit to get that coveted best-seller mark.
Almost every best seller does this.
It's very rare for a book to be on the NYT best seller list today without the author or publisher buying a ton of their own books.
The New York Times puts a dagger icon next to certain books on their bestseller list, to indicate a high volume of sales were through sketchy bulk purchases.
Conservative books appear on the best seller list briefly, during the period some organization is bulk buying the books to juice the numbers.
Liberal books stay on the list longer, because there is organic purchasing patterns and gained momentum.
But let's not discount the shocking number of barely literate Republicans that buy copies of these books to "stick it to the libs!
".
