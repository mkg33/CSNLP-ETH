Did anyone here read the actual statement?
He wants congress to adopt the plan approved by the majority of unions.
24% raises, sick leave and more.
He's not asking congress to force rail workers back to work.
If anything, he should be asking Congress to force the railroads to give the workers paid sick days.
This is not what I expect from the "most pro-union president you've ever seen".
This is Biden's "which side are you on?"
moment, and he's chose.
A strike is labor's leverage against the railroads and Congressional action would take that away.
Preventing the rail strike by adopting this plan would prevent potentially catastrophic economic damage, but hurt the cause for workerâ€™s rights in the short term.
He wants Congress to force the tentative agreement that 4 unions comprising around 50% of the entire rail employment voted down.
After our union voted the agreement down they submitted the paid sick leave proposal in line with federal contractor guidelines which railroads fall under.
The railroads said they wouldn't even consider bargaining for paid sick leave and that was the end of it.
No paid sick days was the central issue being negotiated and the agreement they'd be forced to accept doesn't remedy that.
It's 2022 and rail workers are still having to beg for paid sick days and right to strike?
Come on.
