Jim Jordan is a complete asshole as is much of the new majority roster on the committees.
But oversight is basically whatever the Congress we elect decides it wants oversight to look like.
That being said.
The executive branch as a co-equal branch of course gets to push back on what it deems as inappropriate, as it’s doing here.
Which is consistent with precedent, DoJ never comments on ongoing investigations, which is appropriate.
In a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan responding to a flurry of document requests, the DOJ said that “any oversight requests must be weighed against the department’s interests in protecting the integrity of its work.”.
The letter added: “The Department’s mission to independently and impartially uphold the rule of law requires us to maintain the integrity of our investigations, prosecutions, and civil actions, and to avoid even a perception that our efforts are influenced by anything but the law and the facts.”.
The Justice Department signaled Friday it’s unlikely to share information about ongoing criminal investigations with the new GOP-controlled House, in a move that’s certain to frustrate Republicans in the chamber.
Basically the DoJ policy is that if Congress requests information that its revelation could jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation then they will advise the President to exert executive privilege to block the release.
So it actually is an executive privilege claim at its heart.
