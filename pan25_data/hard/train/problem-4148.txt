The historical context is that throughout the existence of the journalism profession, the “objective” headline would be “former president trump is running for reelection”.
The headline specifying the specific thing that everyone (the media) is mad at Trump for lately, that’s the subjective part.
And the interpretation that the relevant piece of information is the election fraud stuff is specific to what the media class and the democrats think.
Maybe it’s right.
But it is very specifically subjective.
If there's no subjective statement, then it isn't subjective journalism.
If objective facts reflect negatively on a subject, that's a reflection that the subject might want to alter the sort of objective facts that they produce.
Doesn't make an objective fact suddenly subjective though.
The only reason why "it is easy to see why people suspected criminal activity" is if you reduce that entire segment to being raving ignorants.
Which I would not say is untrue at all, but I would also say it's more accurate to say "it's easy to see how the voluntarily ignorant were hoodwinked into thinking there must be criminal activity".
Big difference.
