Because Turkiye isn't a Western country.
They're "allied" as far as NATO goes, that's it.
They're not in the EU and they've been shifting East lately.
They're shifting East like you're shifting goalposts.
This discussion didn't involve EU or East/West until you brought it up.
Yes they have tremendous leverage, but they're using it to the detriment of NATO and ultimately themselves as well.
Or Sweden can pressure the other countries in NATO to pressure Turkey, because as joining NATO isn't a right, being in good standing with your ostensible allies isn't either.
If the rest of NATO thinks Sweden has done enough for Turkey and Turkey disagrees, it is likely Turkey won't get anything more the longer it drags things on.
Carrots from Sweden will become sticks from the rest of NATO the more the rest of NATO sees Turkey as the problem not Sweden.
Now if other NATO nations aren't convinced its different story.
I think that would work for something like the EU but isn't going to work for a defensive pact.
If a country is refusing to ratify the inclusion of another country, they're never going to put their soldiers in harm's way.
It weakens the alliance.
In terms of accession, they don't have a choice.
But you're right in the sense that they're working around Erdogan by signing specific security guarantees in the meantime.
EDIT: Because I know how argumentative shit can get on the internet, let me clarify that I'm not trying for some kind of "gotcha" question.
I was seriously asking, because I can't think of much and NATO forces were there for 20 years.
Afghan government forces yes, NATO forces I wasn't coming up with.
Hence the question.

?
They are not allies of Sweden.
And after Syria, it's debatable whether or not NATO ever stood with them to begin with.
