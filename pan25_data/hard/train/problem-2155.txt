I mean not really, it's a bit tone deaf to consider trying to ban nuclear arms and deterrents at the moment given Russia invading Ukraine who gave up theirs and now is sabre rattling about using them almost every other day.
If Ukraine hadn't handed their nukes over in good faith maybe Russia wouldn't have invaded them twice this century.
If russia didn't have nukes ukraine might have had some actual allies in this war... One of the big reasons support has been so limited is to avoid nuclear war.
yeah, the situation really was "give them up or go to war with russia, with no assistance, and probably end up in a nuclear war.
OR give them up and we'll all sign this peice of paper that says we will guarantee you from invasion..." more than anything.
part of the usa's soft power however is our benevolance.
we can suck, and be assholes sure.
but we use our hegemony with a softer hand than any other hegemony i've ever heard of/read about.
and thats part of the reason countries like australia would rather work with the usa over china.
