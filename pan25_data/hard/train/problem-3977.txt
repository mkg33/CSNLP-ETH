Democrats have a real succession problem.
Biden may beat Trump but I think would likely lose to a younger, more popular candidate.
Kamala Harris was a bad VP choice from a deep blue state.
There are a lot of high up Democratic Party or government admin jobs Kamala would have been good for and I’ll never understand why Biden invited her to be VP, it doesn’t make sense on so many levels.
Reality check - it's not Biden's job to run the Democratic Party - it's not a dictatorship and in any case the guy is busy presidenting.
It doesn't matter whether or not someone else could, in theory do the job, it matters that in reality, no one else is likely to defeat the Republican candidate while Biden will more than likely win if he runs.
No, in reality, Biden will almost certainly win if he runs while the Republican candidate will almost certainly lose if Democrats don't run Biden.
Actually we need a Republican to not win the presidency in 2024, and Biden is the best prospect for beating out the GOP candidate, regardless of your ageism.
If they push Biden for 2024, anybody that half pays attention to politics will vote for the younger candidate (aka DeSantis).
DNC needs to put a 50-60yo up.
