There are strict rules that prevent much of the intelligence community from looking at US persons - and thanks to republicans US companies count as “US persons”.
And seeing as how much of the right/the Republican Party is tied up with Russia and act adversarially towards the United States, I’m really wishing things were different.
So (pardon my naivete) the Russians want Republicans to win because they are easier to influence?

I've seen it creep into left leaning regional subreddits too.
It was all over the Ontario subreddit before their election.

They were pushing propaganda downplaying how bad the Holocaust was recently and deleting any comments calling out the post.
Maybe it's debatable, and there were many highly upvoted comments on the post trying to criticize and debate it, but they were then all deleted.
Effectively allowing the post to seem uncontroversial and the talking point to be successfully spread.
