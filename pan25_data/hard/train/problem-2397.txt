Russia has more than enough spare troops to assist just over a third of their overall force is tied up in Ukraine, but a situation like that would be dealt with by their security forces as they did in Kazakstan.
What I was getting at is military Russia has something like 1.3 million active personnel with 500k in Ukraine currently so they would have the military manpower to deal with a power struggle Belarus, but that task wouldn’t fall down to the Military it would fall on Russias many internal security agencies which are all essentially military forces.
Population wies nothing will change as the Russians have pretty much just done as their leaders have told them for centuries, thousands more will go to their deaths in Ukraine and in the end the Russian people will celebrate it as some second patriotic war against fascism.
I’ve had many great friends from Russia over the years but their mindset is just something else, it’s like an acceptance that they will do as they are told when they are told and there is no other way.
"Population wies nothing will change as the Russians have pretty much just done as their leaders have told them for centuries".
They are already signs of internal issues with a mere 0.4% mobilization and that will get worse with time.
Not really.
There have been a few revolutions, including one that wiped out the entire family of Tsar.
And I'd wager that Putin has less authority than a Tsar with "Divine ancestry".
That kind of unbridled emperor-like god syndrome is familiar to russia.
Everything that has happened to them is like a trickle-down of abuse that seems to perpetuate itself, from one generation to the next.
Since every war it has fought seems to be a human meat-wave of satisfying results, little needs be changed other than the equipment.
Hence, why you are correct: "Russia has yet to come to this realization".
