Yeah I think it just kinda leaves the door open for China to attack nuclear armed nations with conventional arms and not start a nuclear war, the reason the U.S. doesn't codify the NFU is because of those possibilities.
This didn’t really answer my question… you’re just saying “nuclear posturing” like that’s a meaningful statement, and pointing to a list of countries the USA had war or conflict with.
Here maybe bold will help your reading comprehension: "The US used nuclear posturing and threats" And if you don't know remotely any history about those conflicts, you can't just say "it didn't happen."
You just don't know what you're talking about.
Which is why i recommended a book you could read that describes it well AND then you would know what you're talking about!
The united states regularly uses nuclear posturing and first strike threats in geopolitical negotiation.
A NFU policy would take the fangs out of the threat.
That is why it isn't codified.
Eisenhow had secret directives to prepare nuclear weapons in 1958 to prevent Iraq from invading Kuwait, the same year nukes were prepared to use against china if they invade Quemoy,.
There's the 1958 and 61 Berlin crises, the JCS advised Johnson on using nuclear weapons near Khe Sanh in 19678, Nixon threatened the Soviets to deter an attack on Chinese nuclear capabilities, North Vietnam 1969 was Nixon stroking nukes again, and an SAC mobilization to keep the soviets out of the Arab Israeli War, and secret nuclear warnings against the Soviets in 1980 to deter an invasion of Iran, George Bush threatening Iraq in Desert Storm against "unconscionable actions" and the Clinton admin threatening nuclear strikes on North Korea in 1995 over their nuclear REACTOR program and a public warning of a nuclear option by William Perry against Libya's underground chemical weapons facility in 1996.
