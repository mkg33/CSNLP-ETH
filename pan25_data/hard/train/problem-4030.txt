A lot of Palestinians were murdered during the Nabka, so you might have a hard time saying "this is 100% how this particular family was murdered", but make no mistake the Nabka was a horrible, deadly thing.
A portion of the Palestinian population of Israel got mad at the nation being formed, attacked the Jewish population, lost the fight and rather than executing all of them, some of whom had family who'd be neighbors to the people who would be killed, they were exiled to preserve the peace.
Yes Palestinians also killed many Zionists in the 1948 War but there's no historical doubt that the new Israeli government was guilty of ethnic cleansing.
People claiming the nabka is ethnic cleansing are the ones trying to justify ethnic cleansing of Jewish people in the middle east in 1948 and on.
The ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians started even before the 1948 war.
It began in December of 1947 and continued through the spring 1948 war.
When the ethnic cleansing began, Arabs made up 2/3rds of what was called mandate Palestine.
Almost all of the cultivated land at the time was held by Arabs and only about 5.8% was held by Jews.
On the land that was allocated for the Jewish community, the population size of the Arabs and the Jews was about 450,000 people each.
The land allocated for the Arabs had about 800,000 Arabs.
This presented a problem for Jewish leadership, since the population of the Arabs and the Jews was about equal in their future state.
Some smaller attacks were carried out in December 1947 on Arab villages and successfully displaced about 75,000 Arabs.
Five Palestinian villages were emptied out in February of 1948.
