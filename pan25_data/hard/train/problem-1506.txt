No joke I think only one of our challenger 2 has been destroyed in combat, Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but it took 3 anti tank missiles and 14 Rpg rockets and was back in service after 12 hours of repair.
A tank can be destroyed by an anti-tank missile (depending on the situation), but so can just about anything else.
Tanks are actually pretty damn hard to destroy though.
This is quite useful in a war zone.
And then there is the tactical deployment of such weapons.
On their own these are nearly useless without support.
Needs to be combined with infantry, other fighting vehicles, support and a command that knows what its capabilities are.
Tanks can potentially lead break-thrus of enemy lines, when protected by infantry, and with combined arms artillery and planes.
With logistics.
Ukraine feinted a massive attack in the south along the Black Sea coast.
Russia overreacted, shifted TOO MANY resources to meet the threat, then Ukraine attacked in the East where the defenses had been thinned, made weak.
"Thunder runs" behind the Russian rear areas, cutting off supply lines.
