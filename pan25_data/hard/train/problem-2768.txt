That's when it all made sense.
So what you're saying is Biden is at fault for the tax cuts made by the Republicans that haven't been repealed despite the deficit (that went way up under Trump) going down under Biden?
So, yes, what Biden and the Democrats are doing is good, but it still isn't reducing the debt.
We have to stop deficit spending completely so we can start paying down the debt.
It's no different than citizens living outside their means and charging everything to maintain that lifestyle.. aka creating debt.
deficit and debt are not the same thing.
deficit spending is spending excess of revenue.Reducing it means that we are still creating debt, as we are spending money we still do not have, we are just not increasing our debt as much or as fast as before.
Am I wrong, or is cutting future spending not directly related to the current debt ceiling crisis?
This current issue is for spending that already happened, but cutting spending may curb accruing future debt.
Did I get that right?
Right?
What'll happen is that the people that already have it will get to keep it while it'll be "phased out" for the rest of us, this'll be regardless of the fact that many of us have been paying into it for years already.
I'd say it's just one last fuck you from the Karen generation to screw over Millenials and Gen Z but, like the locusts they are, they're also determined to destroy the environment and potentially ruin things for every generation from here on out.
