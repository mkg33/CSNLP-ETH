Mariners have similar requirements as dictated by the USCG.
For similar reasons, don't want a sleeping sailer driving a ship into another ship or an engineer dosing of and pumping fuel into the ocean..
"The minimum 10-hour rest period may be reduced to not less than 6 consecutive hours as long as no reduction extends beyond 2 days and not less than 70 hours of rest are provided in each 7-day period.
e. The minimum period of rest required may not be devoted to watchkeeping or other duties.

This.
Even if we accept that Congress had an obligation to step in and avert a strike to promote the social good, why is it always the working class who has to bear that social burden.
Why isn't it the railroads posting record profits burden?
Congress easily could have passed a bill imposing the worker's demands on the railroad, but instead -choose- to impose the railroad's demands on the workers.
If congress wouldn’t have passed anti labor legislation the rail companies would have capitulated.
They knew they didn’t have to capitulate because the senate hates workers, and you’re defending this hate.
If the dems hadn’t passed this bill negoations would continue and they could continue to fight for unpaid sick time.
Republicans didn’t have the power to force a contract on the workers unless the dems went along with it.
If you make the majority of your money via your labor, you’re dumb as hell for supporting this practice.
The republicans always claim to be anti worker, dems pretend their pro worker then stab them in the back time after time.
With what we actually got, they act like democrats failed the workers even though it was Republicans that blocked their demands.
