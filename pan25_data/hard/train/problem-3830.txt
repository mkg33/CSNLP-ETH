They do absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but much of that will be released via decomposition once the tree dies.
Back in the day, though, microbes that decay wood hadn’t yet evolved, so that organic material and its CO2 became sequestered underground, removed from the global carbon cycle as it became coal.
This is why CO2 from burned coal can never be put back in the earth and why trees don’t actually sequester carbon anymore (only temporarily), it’s impossible.
The trees that don’t burn will now just be broken down by fungi.
Not really.
It’s a matter of energy in vs. energy out.
You would have to burn the trees to make the coal without giving off any carbon, transport it without releasing any carbon, strip mine down about a thousand feet without releasing any carbon, and then bury it, again without releasing carbon.
What Plzbanmebrony is suggesting is that we turn an area of forest into charcoal, hide it away like the fossil-fuels originally were, then regrow the trees in said area so they'll drain out more of the carbon in the air to grow.
This would in theory work as long as the process (including storing it) doesn't produce more emissions through fossil fuels than it stores (albeit be a bit inefficient).
The biggest challenge would be making sure that we don't also store away inorganic nutrients.
