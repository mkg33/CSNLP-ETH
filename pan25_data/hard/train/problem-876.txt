There are very many issues to consider with this kind of concentration of power, and that ain't the smallest.
Maybe the smile was saying "Go ahead and make it a national security issue and find out what happens to your private property.
".
This.
Tesla, SpaceX and the Boring Company are potentially legitimate national security risks with Musk at the head or on the board of these companies.
Putin and the Kremlin may have kompromat on him and could potentially get Musk to give them insider info on NASA and the Artemis Program, or on the Falcon rocket family and Dragon and Starship spacecraft proprietary info and designs, like a certain character in For All Mankind.
Maybe to help the Russian and Chinese manned lunar programs, and/or to sabotage the US one.
They could get him to hand over information about US auto manufacturing and transportation grid, or proprietary info on Tesla and Hyperloop, etc.
Or even clientele data or metadata from Tesla cars' cameras, computers and chargers.
Not even just the Russians.
Possibly the Chinese and Saudis too.
SpaceX launches secret military payloads for the DoD, Space Force, Air Force and Navy.
I'm quite sure Putin would like his good friend Elon to give him some info about what those payloads might be and what they can do.
