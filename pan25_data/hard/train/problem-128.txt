It's really too bad that Republicans choose to not distinguish between common bolt action hunting rifles like the ones I used as a kid and semi-automatic weapons that differ only slightly from those used by the US military.
/cue all the "responsible gun owners" pretending that there is no difference between a bolt action .30-06 and an AR-15 loaded with .223.
a semi auto .30-06 with a traditional rifle stock has a few benefits, though I think I prefer bolt action to be honest.
I have a lever action .308 that is sick, but the lever action tends to be too much if you need to take multiple shots, I find with a bolt action you can rack it and be back on target pretty quickly.
A semi-auto kinda takes me longer to get used to.
I can't for the life of me think of anything besides ferrel hogs that an AR/.223 would be better for.
I feel like the 2A folk always talk about things being "cosmetics", but a pistol grip semi auto rifle takes things to a different level.
The small recoil from those .223s means you can really do some damage.
I still preferred my time with the kalashnakov, that's real power, but those AR guns are dangerous.
They are fun, but hearing about people buying them at walmart (I'm from California) blows my mind.
They are straight up illegal here.
