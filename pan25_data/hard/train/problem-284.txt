Attributing any of this to mental health issues is not only a scapegoat but further stigmatizes people with actual issues.
Just because YOUR mental health issues don’t render you susceptible to propaganda, doesn’t mean you can be dismissive towards the very real weaponization of mental illness by the far right.
Put another way, if this were the result of untreated mental health issues, it would stand to reason that at least ONE person who isn’t a right wing extremist would have been participating in J6, but there wasn’t.
Because this has nothing to do with mental health.
Nowhere did I say or imply that none of them were mentally ill, my issue is with the hasty generalization that all of them are mentally ill and that it is the specific reason why they did what they did.
The poster literally says “they ALL have mental health issues.”.
I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past and my mental health has never been responsible for making me do anything even remotely close to participating in a violent insurrection.
