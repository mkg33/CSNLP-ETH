I once had to get a background check to work third shift at a gas station.
When I later worked for a multinational fortune 50 company, when I asked about a drug test they said “oh no, we don’t do that here” and they didn’t.
I’m really only in favor of drug testing for inherently dangerous jobs, like heavy machinery, factory work etc etc, even then my conviction isn’t strong.
Drug testing doesn’t catch the stuff that I think would be problematic for the most part.
It really only catches marijuana which stays in your system long enough that you can use at one point, be sober and still test positive.
Which makes it pointless if you’re trying to find out if someone is going to be a danger to themselves or co-workers.
Which is the point of drug testing for dangerous jobs.
Is drug testing really weeding out the worst offenders?
Addicts are a smart bunch, they know how to skirt a test.
Most jobs don’t continue to test.
They only have to skirt the one.
It is an old, archaic form of control and is not actually “catching” the right people.
The entire system should be abolished.
