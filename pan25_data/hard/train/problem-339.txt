I think people are forgetting it’s a coup and laws and rules aren’t going to fucking matter.
Say next time they have the presidency and even a tiny majority in congress and just decide not to leave.
Who is going to nut up and do anything about it?
The minority congress and the military?
Lol.
I don’t see anyone really doing shit to be honest.
SCOTUS says it’s illegal?
Cool we don’t abide by them anymore, who is going to stop us?
Any cops have the balls to raid the White House?
Fuck no.
Yeah, nah.
I think you underestimate how close they got.
The entire plan was to delay Congress certifying the results so that a contingent election is called as specified in Article 2, Section 1, Clause 3 of the Constitution.
For the POTUS, a contingent election works by the House of Representatives voting en bloc with state delegations.
This means that instead of each individual representative voting, the voting is done by 1 vote per state.
It's important to note that under normal circumstances, this is a completely legal and lawful way of the POTUS being elected, and has been done before.
The only reason it's bad in this case is because it's citizens coercing Congress into performing a contingent election for the wrong reasons \[it's supposed to be done when the normal election can't properly determine a victor, which was obviously not the case here\].
Basically, if Pence didn't call the National Guard (something he technically can't do, but the Guard obeyed), and if Pence didn't stand his ground to cast the vote and refuse the USSS trying to escort him into a vehicle to who knows where, the contingent election would have been called and the House of Representatives would have elected Donald Trump.
