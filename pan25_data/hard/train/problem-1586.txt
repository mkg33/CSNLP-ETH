I don't know, but i'm sure Ukraine must have some kind of plan because this battle has been almost as costly for them as it has the Russians in terms of men lost.
One of Ukraine's strategies this whole conflict has been to make Russia pay for every bit of ground taken.
Attacking traditionally spends many more resources than defending.
Last I saw, Bakhmut was pretty much leveled, so I doubt Ukraine is holding it just to hold it.
This is what the north looked like right before Ukraine's main counter-offensive took back a huge chunk of land.
I called it a strategy because it doesn't happen this way in all conflicts by a long shot.
It was a simple statement, but there is more behind it.
It isn't just that they are making them pay, they are slowly conceding ground while Russia pushes forward into their defensive lines.
For Ukraine, ultimately if Russia is trying to push through this point, they can either go for a tactical retreat, or hold their ground.
I assume they have concluded they can gain more by holding their ground (possibly inflict more damage on an attacking army while being well entrenched?
).
