So, just as I know there are teachers, currently in the Hillsborough system, that I wouldn't trust giving my kid an online PE class, I know there are a lot of veterans who would do very well in the classroom.
And to those who think only teachers who have gone to uni, specifically for education, are the best qualified to teach our children... how many of those teachers have been arrested for rape, assault, drugs, child pornography, etc... ?
How many of them can't put together a syllabus because they don't know how ?
How many of them constantly score the lowest on student progress/achievement?
How many of those teachers fail the children, everyday, because of their apathy and laziness?
I would not have one problem with many veterans teaching, provided they understand the subject, have the temperament for the job, and are willing to do the work.
With all due respect to the men and women who served in the military, that service is does not qualify one to teach children.
I was an Electricians Mate, that does not qualify me to teach history, science, or math to any child.
This silly program only serves to hurt the children.
