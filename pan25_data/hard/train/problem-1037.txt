It’s the fucking worst.
A friend of mine in high school was a pathological liar, it’s annoying as fuck.
Every time you have a story they have the same one but better, if they did something that weekend they’ll tell you a lie, if they didn’t do something that weekend they’ll tell you a lie, if there’s something you’re good at they’ll tell you they’re better at it but just can’t show you right now.
Their parents met so and so celebrity this past weekend and brought them to their house, but they couldn’t take any pictures because of their security guard.
Their uncle worked on the original Nintendo, but fell out with the other employees so they left his name off the credits.
They lie about every.
Single.
Fucking.
Thing.
You call it out and call it out, tell them they don’t need to lie to impress you and they just lie and lie and wear you down to either just nod your head while they’re talking or just stop talking to them all together.
Yeah, it’s truly exhausting.
Like I don’t understand how they don’t tire of it themselves.
I guess when you don’t care about keeping up the lies you’re less stressed?
I dunno, it just always amazed me how much effort they put into lying about things that no one on earth needs to lie about.
Like they would lie about what color shoe laces they had as a kid or something, like why would you lie about these little things that don’t matter at all??
?
"OH.
MY.
GOD.
WE LITERALLY HAD A BIRTHDAY PARTY AT CHUCK E CHEESE WITH A GIRL WE THOUGHT WAS YOU LOOK AT THESE PICTURES!
ARE WE LIVING IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE????
".
Same.
They used to go to a lot of protests, and over 15 years they went more and more to the far right.
It took way too long to realize they enjoyed being an agitator and likely never had much faith in what they protested against.
In a way, I think that’s why Antifa is such a boogeyman to many on the right.
If it’s all in bad faith, they’d have true reason to fear.
