I mean come on, this is bullshit.
Of course the politicians in Florida influenced the curriculum.
How could you possibly teach a course in African American history with no mention of systemic racism, Black Lives Matter, or critical race theory?
How can the word "reparations" not appear on the syllabus?
Why are authors like James Baldwin and Kimberle Crenshaw removed from the reading list?
"Nonprofit" is one of the biggest bits of doublespeak in the modern English lexicon.
It's a way to pay salaries and raise money and own real estate and get paid for services without paying taxes.
It's been watered down over the years to mean literally nothing about the ethics of those involved.
That's their story, and they're sticking to it.
Sounds better than "we weakly complied with Nazis cuz we have an enterprise that pays our salaries to protect.
".
yep.
usf just cancelled a search for a VP of DEI because of the current climate.
that was the reason given in an email from the university president - they're just assuming DEI will be banned so why continue with the search.
meanwhile "campus reform" is hounding any department that does any event that could fall under DEI or gender studies or anything else the right doesn't like and outing them all in biased, poorly researched anger "articles.
".
That’s not the point.
People need to stop parroting this and see the bigger picture.
They want education to suffer because they want these states to keep voting red.
It’s been known that generally people with high education tend to lean left.
Texas and Florida are two big ass states with key votes in the electoral college.
Doesn’t matter if you live in these states or not, shit like this is gonna play a huge factor in deciding elections.
And it’s not gonna stop at only these states.
