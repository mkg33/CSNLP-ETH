What is with the persistent belief that one can do something, loudly and publicly declare one is doing it, then insist that neither happened and attempt to insult the intelligence of anyone who questions this strange behavior?
It feels like a holdout from when the general public politely pretended to not recognize worthless morons as such.
How entitled are these morons to not realize that grievances aren't a blank check for creating bigger grievances for others?
The mental gymnastics required to justify what happened in Ottawa just highlights how fundamentally flawed these people are.
Entitlement combined with poor critical thinking skills is a hell of a combo.
Toronto handled it perfectly when the Klown Konvoy tried to come here.
They closed off the streets around Queen's Park (home to the Ontario Legislature) and forced the idiots to deal with Toronto traffic for a few hours before they gave up and left.
They were told they could park at malls on the outskirts and make their way downtown by transit and protest on foot if they wanted.
They didn't.
It was beautiful.
