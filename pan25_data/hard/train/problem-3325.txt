I agree that NATO would get a veto on this defense, but the EU does not have the kind of command and control infrastructure to wage war.
That has been one of the key reasons for the EU to begin creating a military.
The EU may have a mutual defense agreement, but the military response would likely be through NATO.
There is no way that the EU could conduct a war without NATO involvement.
Its important to know that NATO is way more precise how countries have to help in case of aggression.
They meet the criteria set out by NATO so they should be able to join unless there is good security reasons why not.
I don’t think the EU could step into a war to protect a non-nato member and expect NATO to also step in with them.
It’s a defensive pact for a reason.
They will protect, not attack unless any NATO member pulls the article 5 (which will only happen if attacked first) not super clear on what would happen if EU forces get bombed on foreign soil that they chose to be in to protect someone(non-nato)else would cause.
All around it isn’t a great idea for say, Russia or china trying it.
