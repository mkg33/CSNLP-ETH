No, the vast majority WANT the current state of affairs.
Only a very small minority living in the cities were anti-taliban.
People have to remember that Afghanistan was a stone age society 20 years ago.
We cannot force idealogical change.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
If you watch some of the early 1900s interviews of women talking about the right to vote, a surprising number were anti-suffrage.
An entire system of oppression cannot be maintained without participation from both genders.
Maybe 50% of young women in Afghanistan are anti Taliban but women in general are probably not anti Taliban.
My idea is to arm, support, provide ongoing on base education to create a female resistance army in Afghanistan.
The men can’t do it but I’ll wager a shiny bauble that if the women there find out there’s an army, they’ll do some changes.
It’s war against females.
It’s sick and evil perpetuated largely by the men of Afghanistan, along with the area surrounding.
Those who choose to fight against them are small in number.
I didn’t say anything about the U.S. but that’s just like you sort to invite yourself when no one asked.
And my plan wasn’t to start and mismanage a corrupt war, if it were I’d have asked you coup starting jokers along.
