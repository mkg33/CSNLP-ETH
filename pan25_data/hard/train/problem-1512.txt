What about a pardon from the state of Georgia?
Apparently the governor doesn’t have the power to issue pardons in Georgia.
A state board has that power.
If convicted, I imagine he will be issued a pardon within minutes.
So, no pre-emptive pardons.
And as far as the "5 years law-abiding life," I don't know that Trump could ever go that long without criming.
On the other hand, Trump doesn't live in Georgia.
Which means that Florida would have to agree to hand him over.
This could give us an entirely new set of problems if Desantis flatly refuses to do so.
DeSantis could refuse to turn Trump over until the question is settled (thus "sticking it to the libs", generating enthusiastic support among the maga-ites) and ultimately turn Trump over once the courts have ruled (thus sticking it to Trump).
And getting huge amounts of nation-wide press as he solemnly swears he's just doing his job as governor, trying to protect the rights of a citizen of Florida.
Did Trump "flee" Georgia?
My understanding is he was never in the state during the events in question, so arguably there was no "fleeing from justice" to another state.
“Shall flee from justice”, is open to a novel interpretation from SCOTUS, 1) if Trump has not been to Georgia than he is not fleeing, 2) it’s a political witch-hunt without merit not justice.
