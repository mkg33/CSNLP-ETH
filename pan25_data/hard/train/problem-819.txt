Except they can't even do that right.
It's really hard to blame the dems for not helping the GOP pick a speaker.
So why don’t democrats just vote for Mcarthy?
Or convince enough republicans to vote for a moderate Republican?
The democrats should get behind the absolutely most reasonable, least power seeking House republican and throw their votes to that person….
Get some sort of concessions thrown the Dems way and all of the sudden you have a functioning House of Representatives; that maybe, maybe…..has a shot at getting something useful done in the next two years.
Maybe, but from what I’m seeing, no matter who gets the speakership for the Republicans, they will need Democrats’ support to get almost anything done.
Whenever the GOP finally get their act together and agree on a speaker, it isn’t going to mean they suddenly knuckle down and get to work doing the peoples’ business.
We’re really not missing out on much by having this particular group of would-be congresspeople unable to get to work.
