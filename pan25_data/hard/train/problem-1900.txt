I mean, the US invented the car, the transistor, the computer, the internet, and went to the moon.
I don't think them investing in green energy is going to be bad for our species.
Maybe bad for your favorite billionaires pocket books?
The US loudly, openly complained to the EU about their Russian gas addiction for decades.
It's not like the US came in to profit off their misery.
They actively tried to prevent this from happening, even threatening sanctions on Germany at one point for buying too much Russian gas.
The US has actively tried to prevent trade between Russia and Europe (Germany, specifically) and it seems like they've gotten their wish with the present conflict.
Geopolitically it makes sense for the US (and the UK to an extent): if Europe was peacefully trading with Eurasia, and Eurasia with China, then the US(/UK)'s role as global peacekeeper and financier is no longer necessary, and we would no longer be able to capture the economic value we do for that service.
As Kissinger said "America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests."
As long as NATO is beneficial to the US the US will defend the territorial integrity of NATO member nations.
If Russia were to intentionally attack a NATO country I expect the US to honor it's commitments.
(I also suspect Russia recognizes this and will do (and so far has done) everything to avoid escalating beyond Ukraine into NATO countries.
).
