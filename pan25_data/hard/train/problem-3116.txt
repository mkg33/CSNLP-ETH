Bruh no shit they are responsible but the workers tried to do something about it and government stopped them.
It was a awful move on Bidenâ€™s part and a perfectly good reason to be mad at him.
A lot of people are rightfully pissed at Biden because he broke the rail worker strike.
Not that this is his fault, but instead of doing anything to even try and prevent something like this, he backed the train companies.
Despite the fact that the rail companies are the ones responsible does the media focused on them.
Did they name one rail executive or the majority owners and point out they did this.
The media chose instead to focus on Biden.
Had Biden not intervened, the media would, instead of blaming the executives and owners, blamed Biden for the shortages and additional inflation it caused.
Yeah, how dare the media point out that Biden's union busting 3 months prior to this disaster is largely responsible for this disaster.
We should all definitely be mad at someone other than Biden.
Great take right here.
Well done.
Of the 7 largest U.S. freight railroads, 6 have reported implementing "precision-scheduled railroading" (PSR), a strategy intended to increase efficiency and reduce costs.
While there is no one definition of PSR, stakeholders told us this strategy is associated with fewer staff, longer trains, and more.
