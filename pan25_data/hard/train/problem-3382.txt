I would think any country seeing the impact for Ukraine having the use of US weapons would be very leery of taking on the US in a traditional type of war.
But that's for traditional fighting.
The US has proved it's bad at unconventional warfare and in rebuilding failed states.
The real truth has always been you can't rebuild failed states and you shouldn't fight an unconventional war unless you have no choice.
The US just made the Vietnam mistake again after being told not to, but actually pushed into it by "the heritage foundation" neocons.
All militaries have strenhs and weaknesses.
The US military is always in flux and times change.
The Heritage Foundation are the same people who would cut aid to Ukraine and at the same time complain we aren't read for a 2 front war.
It is absolutely a giant appeal to authority.
What they do is start with their goal and work backward.
This is just like the SCOTUS judges they recommended and pushed.
They have "experts" who use technobabble to support the construct and message they want to push.
