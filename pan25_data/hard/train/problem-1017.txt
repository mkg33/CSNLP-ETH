While I agree that she is an utter moron and supported a terrorist regime.
She is actually British, and should be tried and imprisoned for her crimes here.
She might not deserve that justice, but it certainly should be her right.
Especially considering she has been left stateless as a result of being stripped.
She is not rendered stateless, she lost citizenship in her preferred state.
That’s a huge difference.
She joined a terrorist org, got caught as they collapsed, had her UK citizenship revoked because the UK claims she has a right to Bangladeshi citizenship and has a law allowing them to revoke citizenship of dual nationals in cases of terrorism.
She’s in a unique situation as the decision to strip her citizenship was made under the belief she was a dual citizen of Bangladesh.
The Bangladeshi government is refusing to acknowledge her.
So her statelessness was not an intentional act by the UK, but they’re not inclined to reverse the decision simply because Bangladesh refuses to take her.
Her argument is that because Bangladesh refuses to admit she is theirs she is rendered effectively stateless by this law which conflicts with UK law that does not allow someone to be rendered stateless.
So she feels that despite her activities and support of terrorists she should be free to return to the UK.
So for the people arguing to allow her back, what is her punishment for becoming a terrorist?
Jail time?
Say she’s gone through enough?
