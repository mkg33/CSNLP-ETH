Russia as a single country wasn't given a seat, the USSR was.
When that fell apart, Russia simply assumed the seat, they were never formally granted a permanent spot.
Until now, no one bothered with it because Russia was considered a major power and of course they have nuks and are prone to tantrums.
But the reality is, any country of the former USSR could have laid claim to that seat, Russia just bullied their way in because Moscow was the USSR's base of power.
What really needs to be eliminated is Russia's veto power.
There's no country that has abused that power more than Russia.
Russia is still one of the most powerful and politically relevant nations in the world.
Far moreso than those you have listed.
Just like when Russia and America didnt get anywhere in Afghanistan, or America got nowhere in Vietnam, we don't assume that just because they havent instantly gotten their goals with conventional force that these nations are no longer politically relevant.
Russia are, whether we like it or not, a major power fighting a border war with a smaller neighbor who have been used as proxy by the Allies since the beginning of the war.
Proxy.
We have not entered this war to help Ukraine with our own forces because that would cross a red line, endangering (potentially) the entire human race.
This should have happened the moment they attacked Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ and her people, not as an afterthought because of the increasing atrocities being shown coming out of the Ukraine, committed by Russian ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º soldiers.
The Russians raped and murdered CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND MEN, and left their animals to starve to death or eat their corpses, and then when a few Russians were caught and admitted their deeds on camera, suddenly they are alarmists â€” fake news, Russia claims.
Fake News â€” I remember a similar US President using a little tactic like that in the USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ when he was leading his country toward an attempted and failed coup dâ€™etat.
