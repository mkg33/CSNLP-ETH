It true in the sense that the government doesn't really have a compelling reason to ban abortion.
But, then the religious exemption wouldn't matter because it would be legal.
That's the real reason they're against abortion, but the actual reasoning in court isn't based on the Bible, so this argument makes no difference.
So, SCOTUS has (wrongly) decided there's a compelling government reason to ban abortion.
The religious exemption argument won't work, because it isn't applicable to that kind of law, until that law itself is found unconstitutional.
Basically, pro-choice people don’t need to rely on Satanists, they can merely cite the Old Testament to argue that state abortion bans violate the 1st Amendment which protects freedom of religion.
Instead, we can use freedom of religion against pro-lifers, by arguing the pro-choice position based on freedom of religion.
Because what will pro-lifers say?
That we can’t have freedom of religion under the First Amendment?
No, so you use their own weapon against them, to make abortion federally legal under freedom of religion under the First Amendment, so no state could ban abortion anymore.
My conservative mother and father believe that abortion is being used by irresponsible people as birth control, murdering viable babies in the process.
They have referenced people on social media celebrating how many abortions they have had.
They aren't religiously motivated, they "value life".
They believe whole heartedly that there is so much of this "abortion as birth control" going on that it outweighs any legitimate reason to be allowing it.
