He didn't forget the meaning, he replaced 'beautiful Qatari stadium' to 'built by blood money/slavery Qatari stadium', which makes some sense as a sentence.
I've got my own problems with American foreign policy, but you don't usually expect a sports tournament to have a body count comparable to a war.
Don't know how American warcrimes justifies the excessive deaths and slavery just to host a world cup.
"Don't know how American warcrimes justifies the excessive deaths and slavery just to host a world cup".
U think the only war crimes America committed were in Vietnam?
Btw what about Israel?
America supports Israel right?
And we all know how many children die in Palestine every year.
What Saudi Arabia is doing in Yemen is bad but what about America?
America constantly supports Israel.
And don't forget the human rights violations in every war.
They lost in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam but still don't answer for the war crimes they commit.
Don't look for excuses.
Don't pick and choose lol.
All I'm saying is IF they juiced, there's not a chance in hell FIFA would do anything about it.
As much as they want Qatar money, they want SA's money more.
Years of playing in desert conditions maybe?
Or actual juice, not like FIFA is gonna question SA athletes lol, esp considering Saudi is gonna be picked as the next host location.
Not insinuating, also my first comment was literally "maybe their environment caused them to have better conditioning.
".
Yep.
I find this reasonable, to be honest.
Adding at maximum 4-5 minutes when every substitution at 88min takes three minutes and every throw takes 40sec just isn't enough.
The new directive to add all the out-of-play time is mostly a reaction to all the teams going out of their way to delay the game and abusing the old system.
Those teams are going to look like idiots now, and I love it.
