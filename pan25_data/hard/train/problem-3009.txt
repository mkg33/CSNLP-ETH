No shit, Russia violated the treaty that saw Ukraine give up it's nukes in exchange for never being threatened with invasion from Russia, only for this shitshow, Don't Trust Russian Promises.
If you dont do the bare minimum (which i thought we did in Minsk 2) of guaranteeing the rights of Russian Speakers in Ukraine than Russia AND NATO dont have a reason to keep Militarizing Ukraine to use it as a proxy war between Russia and the US.
The terms that Ukraine will require, meanwhile-- freedom to join NATO and the EU, war reparations, the return of all abducted Ukrainian citizens and the return of all Ukrainian territory seized in this war (including Crimea)-- are going to be unacceptable to Putin and the pro-war establishment in Russia.
Putin has the option to cease being an asshat and pull back troops and cease military action in Ukraine, and the Russian people who continue to support the conflict are almost as much to blame, but only as a result to the decades of Russian propaganda that Putin has orchestrated and forced on the Russian people.
There isn't going to be a diplomatic end to this conflict so long as Russia believes that Ukraine belongs to them and is willing to use whatever means they have available to impose Russian rule.
