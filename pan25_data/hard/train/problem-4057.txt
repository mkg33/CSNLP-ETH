I thought about that, but feral cats still don't tend to live as long as indoor cats, and likely don't have the same quality of life.
About actual libertarians though, it's hard to imagine that they miss the power corporations have.
Maybe the free market does balance itself, but the market we use is definitely not free.
Minimum standards of behavior is a free market concept.
It is not against the ideals of the free market for a while society to say "Don't do business here unless you can meet these standards.
".
I get it.
Reagan sucks and presided over the start of a lot of bad things.
That doesn't mean Carter gets a pass for starting something that continued under Reagan.
Ok, my question to you then would be "so what?".
The topic, again, is Airline Deregulation playing a part in the chaos with holiday travel.
You seem to think that this is a legacy of Reagan, because he "oversaw the deregulation in 80s," as you put it.
But bear in mind that Carter was the one who started Airline Deregulation with the abolishment of the Civil Aeronautics Board and the legislation surrounding deregulation in 1978.
Imagine blaming a bunch of cancelled flights after a historically bad storm on deregulation enacted over 40 years ago.
FDA regulations that keep perfectly safe products already sold in other countries from being sold in the US (like the baby formula shortage).
What an awful article.
Airline deregulation in the 70s is what made it available to the average person.
The “Golden Age” of flying was exclusive to the wealthy, a cross country flight in the 60s cost thousands of dollars adjusted for inflation.
