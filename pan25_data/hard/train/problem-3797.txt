And the reason nato bombed them iss why?because they refused to stop mass murdering kosovar albanians,go google 1999 bombings before making stupid comments.
Btw, you didnt just let Serbs kill Albanians, you also let Albanians kill hundreds of Serb civillians after the war was over and NATO troops enterd Kosovo.
What the fuck were they doing there then?
If they couldnt protect even that little of Serbs that lived in Kosovo.
It always fascinates me how important Serbs think their little country is.
I have nothing against Serbs or even Serbia beyond these kinds of political issues.
Mind you, I have a ton of friends from Serbia who are quite decent, but their government is a whole other story.
To give some examples - their media said Montenegrins as an ethnicity are.

... all of it was false of course, merely in order to fuel disdain towards Montenegro.
If we weren't in NATO, I swear Serbia would have done a special military operation upon us, considering the narratives that were published by them.
