"ever heard of the Shah?
How about Ferdinand Marcos?
Or Pinapple Face (AKA Manuel Noriega),?
Castelo Branco?
Pinochet?
Rhee?
Islam Karimov?
".
Wow.
Does Putin think that Macron will say, "Okay, it's fine that you seized Crimea in 2014 and invaded Ukraine in 2022 because of the actions of one dictator who happened to be French?
Cool, cool.
".
P.S.
Check out the Czekoslovak legion.
They were volunteers from Czech and Slovak prisoners and formed the legion to fight Austria-Hungary in the hopes of getting a homeland.
They get caught up in the Revolution, decide to go home by crossing Russia, the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and continue the fight in France.
At one point they are strung out over a huge lenh of the country when the order comes down to disarm them.
They easily fight off anyone sent, the legion is better armed, better trained, has better morale, and has more experience.
One factor as to why the Romanovs are killed is that the legion is sympathetic to the Whites and they are getting close to where Nicholas and his family are kept.
I think a lot of that is not entirely correct.
There was no way Nicholas II was keeping the throne, he had no one on his side, and his own family, and military leadership was calling for his removal.
He lost the support of the military in the February revolution.
He could not even get back to Petrograd after his train could not get past checkpoints.
