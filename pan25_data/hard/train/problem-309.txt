In this scenario, Democrats win every state they won in 2016 and Republicans and Trump split all the states they won in 2016, with neither getting to 270, right?
The only way that works is if only one of Trump or the Republican is on the ballot in most states.
Otherwise, they split the vote and the Democrat wins in places they wouldn't otherwise win.
That would have to take coordination between the Republicans and the Trump campaign.
A Trump independent run kind of implies he's trying to get revenge on the Republicans so I don't see him partaking in a scheme like this and even if he were to, the odds of the vote going exactly that way are far less than 1 in 3.
Your scenario would require either the Electoral votes NOT be winner take all (which they are) or Trump get enough votes after splitting the Republican party that he actually wins a significant number of states - essentially impossible.
No, because all but 2 states are winner take all.
He'd split the Republican vote, the Dems would win handily, and all the states Electoral votes would go to the Dems.
You're assuming that Democrats would win all the states that they traditionally win.
If the 2016 electoral college repeats itself, but Trump stops DeSantis from getting 270 it goes to the House.
They don't have to split all the states.
An independent would have to win enough to stop either party from getting 270.
In a repeat of the 2000 electoral college scenario, Trump would only need to win one red state, like Wyoming, to prevent both sides from getting 270.
That would mean he would need about 250,000 votes in a state like Wyoming or South Dakota, or Idaho, and the Republicans can't get 270.
This would send the decision of the presidency to the House of Representatives.
In a repeat of the 2000 electoral college outcome, he would only need to win Wyoming, or some other small red state.
Then, no candidate gets the requisite 270 in the electoral college.
