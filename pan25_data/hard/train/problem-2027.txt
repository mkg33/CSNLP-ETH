I understand that war crimes have been committed and they warrant trials butâ€¦ are Ukrainian judges really the best people to handle this?
A judge is supposed to be impartial.
I understand what you are saying.
If Ukraine wants to prosecute whoever they want for whatever they want that happens on their own soil that is their right.
But it is hard to believe that they trials will be fair and impartial.
That happens anyway in any trial.
The real hard part is getting a nation to give up its rights to administer justice on its own land.
The right to govern one's self is not a right most nations give up willingly.
The notion that the law of the land doesn't apply btlecause the defendant is foreign is something that hasn't really taken in any justice system in the world.
The Hague is an international court.
Ukraine would have to give up these prisoners to the Hague, go through whatever international criminal referral is required.
Hopefully Ukraine is able to find the perpetrators of these crimes and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law in fair trials.
If Ukraine would render rather one-sided judgements or fails to prosecute in some way, does not have the capacity to deal with all cases in timely manner, victims/advocates for victims can go to the ICC and the UNSC can also refer cases to the ICC.
Basically, the ICC is only a backup court in case a domestic court fails to do its job.
