This is the only way to fight Russia in Ukraine.
The only language that Putin and his cronies understands.
That of might.
The west shouldn't fear escalation, since it is only percieved as weakness not to deliver the weapons Ukraine needs.
Give Ukraine the tools to "smesh" Russia on the battlefield, now!
The simple answer to that is that Russia is using its own weapons and Ukraine would be using weapons given by NATO members.
No one has said that Ukraine cannot hit Russia in Russia - with their own weapons.

".
right..
Explain to me then: how is that russians can hit Ukraine from 500+.. event thousands of km away and s o m e h o w Ukraine getting 150+ km range weapons is a red line AND escalation?
Russians using their 500 000 prison population to wage war in Ukraine.. even if its at 1:10 ratio.. its freaking bloody bad for Ukraine.
I think you're forgetting how russia wages wars.. russia will just throw 10 000 000 Ukrainians into its army and to the Turkey you go.
throwing bodies on a problem and don;t care just works.
