Greene’s tweet was prompted by backlash to a dinner hosted last month by Donald Trump featuring rapper Ye and Fuentes.
While Fuentes and his army of groypers might have been OK with Greene claiming not to know him, they were not at all happy about her recent disavowal of him—and say it’s the latest evidence that she’s sold out her far-right fans and betrayed their white nationalist “America First” movement.
“She’s just weak.
She goes and says something edgy to get attention, and then when the pressure comes, she buckles,” said Fuentes on a podcast after Greene’s disavowal of him.
“Fuentes also mocked Greene’s dreams of becoming the face of “Christian nationalism” in the U.S. “How are you going to be the face of Christian nationalism when you’re a divorced woman, girlboss,” said Fuentes.
“I’m so glad I don’t have to pretend to support that anymore.”.
The "I'm so glad I don't have to pretend to support that anymore" from Fuentes was interesting.
Limbaugh would do things like that, too, like calling out how hard it was to keep supporting Bush Jr.
