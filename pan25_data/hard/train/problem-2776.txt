This is the first logical explanation i have encountered.
Thank you for the explanation.
I do think the leopard is designed to be extensively versatile.
The issue is Ukraine’s need of 250 at the least, no groups of countries can put up those numbers without compromising their own security.
Because the one thats a few hundred kms away dosen’t claim to be a superpower and dosen’t wave its armed forces around like its a dick measuring contest.
I have seen this argument several times.
But big strong America could surely be able to provide all the necessary logisitics to support ally ukraine.
I would hope that the US could push the Abrams to those countries that give up tanks to Ukraine.
In fact, I would hope we provide a substantial discount to make that happen.
The Abrams is designed to exist within US logistical doctrines that allow it to be properly maintained and supplied.
Ukraine’s logistics are based on Soviet doctrine that’s effective for the T-72.
Ukraine would need to redesign the way it handles tanks from the ground up to incorporate the Abrams.
If this were peace time that’s not a big deal, but there’s a war of survival going on.
