Rape is, yes.
Please don’t conflate it with gay sex and love, they have almost nothing to do with each other.
Never understood the whole 'being a bottom is more gay' argument lol.
You're still gay af if you're banging a dudes ass, Russian military in shambles.
That’s why Putin has to remind Russians that gay people are bad.
Cause nobody really cares otherwise.
I’m not saying Russians are LGTB-friendly but most of them follow the “don’t tell me what you do in your bedroom and I won’t tell you what I think about it” rule.
Putin pushes hard for anti-gay laws that nobody asked for.
My guess is that only about 25-30% of population truly genuinely support Putin, his puppets and the war.
Putin fails to understand that the anti-gay propaganda is not working anymore because Russian people are afraid of an economic collapse way more than they are afraid of gay people.
So what Russia is saying is that their society is so fragile the west could collapse it by airdropping a bunch of gay people in to have a Pride parade in Red Square?
The CIA should get on this.
