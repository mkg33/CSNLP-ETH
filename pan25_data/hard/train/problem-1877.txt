Humans are weird.
When everyone in the country is the same race, they have to make up a new racism based on arbitrary qualities.
This reeks of pointed racism.
Itâ€™s like making a law that bans serving dog meat, or a law that bans planning and committing crimes in Spanish.
It's not like banning dog meat or committing crimes in another language, that's a pretty ridiculous comparison.
This is about further defining forms of discrimination.
Those don't define discrimination, they are discrimination.
I wouldn't say that it's exempted, but it's so poorly understood by Americans that it really needs its own definition.
Just because _you_ might understand doesn't mean the HR lawyer at Microsoft who is trying to deal with a caste discrimination case understands it or knows of legal precedent.
While I understand the sentiment and wish it could be the case, unfortunately it has been proven time and time again that people are unable to _agree not to be assholes_.
We have a very large Indian population and caste is very poorly understood by anyone who is not a part of the culture.
Human resources, in specifically tech companies, often dismiss caste discrimination because they don't understand it or feel they cannot prove it in a court of law.
Hopefully this law brings awareness and gives companies the confidence they can win a court case if they need to fire someone for caste discrimination.
