I am flabbergasted that they didn’t measured the radiation before putting it inside the secured storage facility.
This is a basic and simple procedure for dealing with radioactive source to make sure that the source is still inside the shielded container after transportation.
Yeah it was reported that the radiation was checked before the truck left the minesite, but there's no report that it was checked on arrival at the facility.
But somewhere along the journey, a bolt on the gizmo came undone leaving a hole that the radioactive source could escape from, bounce around in the crate, then the truck and then make a break for freedom and onto the road.
The shipping crate or whatever it was that held the device had tamper-proof security tape around it as per the regulations, that's what was reported in the media early on in the incident.
So nobody got into the crate while it was in transit.
Police categorically ruled out theft etc.
The capsule was packaged on 10 January 2023 to be sent to Perth for repair before leaving the site for transport by road on 12 January 2023.
The package holding the capsule arrived in Perth on 16 January and was unloaded and stored in the licensed service provider’s secure radiation store.
On 25 January, the gauge was unpacked for inspection.
Upon opening the package, it was found that the gauge was broken apart with one of the four mounting bolts missing and the source itself and all screws on the gauge also missing.
DFES as the Hazard Management Agency were notified on the evening of 25 January by WA Police.
