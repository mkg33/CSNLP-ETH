When you see the reality of living in harmony with another ethnic group as worse than death, then there isn’t a lot one can do to compromise with you.
Be honest with yourself.
If this was an anti-Israel article, you would be making the exact same speech that guy is (except it actually would be on the front page).
let's say that Fox is extremely biased against Palestine, would you want me to cite them to make a point about it?
Palestine is like the kinda country and people you want to advocate for and then some of them say shit like this and it makes it a million times harder.
However, it makes it pretty hard to support the Palestinian cause when they celebrate literal terrorism, which is why I can’t even go all in on Palestine.
If you are gonna diminish the Palestinian side of the struggle to this perverted sentence you are revealing yourself as a bad faith actor with no real knowledge of one entire half of the conflict.
no one said that Israelis committed no wrong, and that Palestinians are genetically evil, only one who tries to talk about it is you, which clearly is an attempt to just push and say your opinions in a riled up comment section.
Obviously many of the arab states were ready to commit crimes against humanity on Israelis if not outright genocide, but to say that the entire side of Palestine can be boiled down to them " driven mad because they lost a genocidal war and can’t deal with it."
Was your rhetoric not mine.
