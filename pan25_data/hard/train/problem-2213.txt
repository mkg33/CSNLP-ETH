With regards to aircraft that's a little more complex than the missile systems Ukraine is currently utilizing.
It takes months to train pilots and mechanics on the operation and maintenance of aircraft, and the infrastructure to fuel, house, and protect them must also be developed.
I wouldn't be surprised if we see the Ukrainians fielding a much larger airforce in the next year or so of the war.
With regards to long range missiles that is more a matter of brinksmanship, and imho we should be supplying more to Ukraine.
We do not do this because we take Russia's threats at face value, even when Russia's "red lines" have been exposed as false in Belgorod, Crimea, Kherson, and on the Kerch Bridge.
Russia has millions of poor men from ethnic minorities that it can use for cannon fodder.
Every one of those men who dies is a net win for Putin's Russia, since it "purifies" the Russian state.
Not all it can short of nuclear war.
We could provide modern jets to Ukraine to help defend their cities against missile/drone attacks (see: the videos of AFU jets shooting down missiles), long range missiles to destroy Russian missile launchers at their source, and modern infantry fighting vehicles to help Ukraine advance with fewer casualties.
