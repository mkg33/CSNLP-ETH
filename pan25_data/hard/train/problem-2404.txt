Good thing this isn't a baseless movement against vaccination going on!
Otherwise, this would have to the potential to become catastrophic if a global pandemic were to occur /s.
This was actually a huge sticking point at the beginning of the covid pandemic because precautions to avoid human to human transmission were avoided until it was proven.
That is absolutely the wrong way to go about infectious diseases- take more precautions and drop them as evidence eliminates the need for them.
The best "response" to a disease is to prevent it from mass spread.
Covid was, at one point, preventable, for example.
But covid was relatively weak (and still killed us).
Avian flus are known to be rough and they spread thru birds also, which you can't control (ask China or australia).
Bird flu is also spread by birds.
We've seen this variant go around the globe, it's a bird pandemic.
It'll probably be a pandemic if it goes with human-human transmission too.
And gapsin H-H transmission will be made up for by bird-human transmission.
