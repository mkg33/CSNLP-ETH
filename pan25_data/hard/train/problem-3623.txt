The Russians want to eradicate this smaller Ukraine, but it manages to hold on.
The smaller nearer Russia gets conquered after it failed to invade, and so it sends suicide bombers to the smaller Ukraine every five years or so, in waves.
That's basically Israel, extremely simplified, and most likely a wrong analogy, but you get the jist.
Just because Arab governments brainwash their citizens to hate Israel doesn't mean it's right to do so.
As a Saudi I can say that many of us don't hate Jewish people, we hate Zionists.
A lot of us treat Jewish people as people from any other religion although we don't have many jews here.
1- A lot of "Middle Easterners' have the mindset of Jews = Israelis (my point here is they don't know the difference.
).
Lastly If we were to agree with "Expect educated people in general do tend toward more secular attitude" Then why mention the word "Arab" or "Muslim" at all?
why not focus on education then and the shitty governments that were placed or endorsed by the western world in the middle east that we Middle Easterners constantly try to replace to no avail.
