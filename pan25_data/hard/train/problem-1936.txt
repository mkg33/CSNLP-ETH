Good question.
They needed international recognition to trade with other countries so they could make money.
If they defaulted this would be void and they would no longer be recognized.
The revolutions podcast by Mike Duncan does a whole rundown of the Haitian revolution if your interested.
Seeing Reddit discuss Haiti is always interesting.
We like to think we know the answer to everything and that it’s always just a matter of “well you have to do this…” but with this subject we lack even the most basic perspective outside of some crappy YouTube documentaries, there isn’t a single answer, or an easy answer, there isn’t even a “right thing to do”.
Redditors seldom find themselves stumped like this.
Military intervention is not an option.
Traditional humanitarian aid doesn’t work.
Economic investment doesn’t work.
Haiti can’t even grow their own food because they ruined the soil cutting down trees for energy/farming.
Without that basic economic cornerstone there is nothing to build on.
Whatever we decide to do (even if we do nothing) it will be a tragic outcome for most people in Haiti.
Yeah, people need to consider how not well the headline of “American soldier dies in Haiti” would go over.
Unfortunately this may be a situation that Haiti might have to dig itself out of.
International aid isn't going to do the trick as history shows it hasn't really worked before.
