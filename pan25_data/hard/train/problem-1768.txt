That's not true.
Russian battlefield tactics and strategy have been constantly changing and evolving over the course of this war.
A better comparison to the Russo-Ukraine war would be the Iran-Iraq war where two mostly equivalent forces fight a long and protracted war with little frontline moment and a shit ton of foreign interference.
Russia's military at the start of the war was 4 times bigger than that of Ukraines, they had every single tactical advantage you would want when invading a neighbor and they completely fucked it up.
Yeah the Ukraine and Russia are closer than the US and any other country in the world but my point stands that America has fought large scale battles like the 1st gulf War where they inflicted 10s of thousands of casualties and suffered like 100 losses.
I think Russian losses are probably higher than this, due to infighting between troops, and all the troops who are dying of starvation and exposure that don't get counted.
Not nearly as many military losses, although we can't be sure of exact numbers because they aren't released.
But this disparity is due to Ukraine's better field medicine.
More concern for their troops.
Better trained and equipped troops.
Military strategy and tactics that attempt to minimize losses.
Often being on defense more than offense.
Etc.
