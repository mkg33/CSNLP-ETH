Emphasis on for now.
Fighter jets aren't much good if your pilots aren't skilled enough with them and/or you don't have the logistics or training to keep them armed and maintained.
Modern aircraft would be useful for firing long ranged air to air and air to ground weapons, the former of which can't be integrated onto UA's Soviet jets.
The F16 wouldn’t be too useful in a ground attack role but it would be fine as a missile truck to lob AMRAAMs at the planes that are used as cruise missile platforms.
That 100 mile+ range would be a huge boon for air defenses.
Plus I want to see Tu-95s get AMRAAMed, I think that would be funny.
You don’t have to be shot at to do SEAD, you just need the enemy to have their RADAR on so you can send some HARMs their way.
That’s actually the DEAD (destruction of enemy air defenses) aspect.
SEAD missions can be effective even if they never fire a missile, if they spook the RADAR operators to the point they don’t turn on their RADARs.
I think theres a good reason you don't see much aircraft footage and the few things you do see are lobbing rockets 40 miles away, because both sides have such extensive manpad/sam networks.
it's pretty clear you have no idea what you are talking about, how about you do some reading about the s300 and s400 and why that isn't used to shoot down drones and can't be used to shoot down himars rockets, and how it can absolutely deny air superiority to F16s.
