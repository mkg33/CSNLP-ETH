So I always though I needed to steal sloops from others, load them with powder kegs and sail them into galleons without the loss of my own brigantines.
Ukrainian logic… who needs a navy if they want to take all your sea ports alway.
It's one area where Ukraine has the advantage.... it has no fleet of its own after Putin seized it when he captured Crimea.
And they have a large, weakly defended fleet, all of which are military targets.
Don’t US warships have those automated mini guns that blow anything that gets close out of the sky?
Do the Russian ships not have the equivalent or are drones too small to trigger those turrets?
The US armed forces after running a naval warfare simulation and finding out the US fleet can be sunk by a fleet of a swarm of Iranian Ship drones.
This actually sounds like a US advise as the US has ran multiple simulations of Torpedo/munition swarm attack effective against modern Surface fleet Navies.
-Russian ship defense systems(Auto-cannons/Anti-ship defense) are not working due to bad maintenance and or outated parts atleast according to the Moskva after action report.
Now idk if they were going full banzai charges or if its massed seaborne drone attack as I have not personally read the paper but from the looks of Russian Baltic formation of ships.
