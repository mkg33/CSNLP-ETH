OK, so with the same money you can buy a shitty Chinese car with bad resale value and less safety/reliability or a decent one with a combustion engine.
I think most people would opt for the latter in your specific example.
I would not consider this price parity.
Compare different models from similar makers.
EV's have distinctly higher price positioning.
And it's not looking like EV's or cars will get cheaper soon because there are long waiting lists practically everywhere at the moment.
Price parity, really?
Most hybrid models in Europe cost 10-15K EUR more than the regular ones.
Plug-in hybrid / full-EV models are sometimes double the price.
On top of that, resale value of EV's is highly questionable due to batteries degrading.
I am all for lowering emissions, but EV's are not very affordable to many people.
By 2030 fossil powered vehicles will be made in lower numbers and have higher costs by a fair margin.
cars are parked 90-95% of the time.
we already have kerb side ac chargers, chargers fitted to lightposts etc.
btw you realize a lot of DC chargers are now using aluminium cables right?
And that Aluminium is actually a better conductor?
China is now over 30% EV for new vehicles.
They are the largest vehicle market.
US is also changing rapidly and will increase in speed with the IRA act etc.
