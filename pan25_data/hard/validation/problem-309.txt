They might have lost the house majority and the Senate majority isn't enough to overcome the two shitty Democrats who obstruct everything so hard, the Republicans don't have to take any heat over it.
That was because of a Democratic majority passing "Obamacare".
It didn't do a lot.
Premiums went up by the amount of the subsidy by the next year because they refused to push for price controls (because they're in the pockets of health insurance companies just like their buddies across the aisle), and it made health insurance mandatory without said price controls, but perhaps the only truly meaningful it did was eliminate the concept of denial for preexisting conditions.
I would disagree that it didn't do alot, It did prevent insurance companies from denying a person coverage or issuing a policy due to a preexisting condition.
Imagine having cancer and trying to get insurance, and being denied from every carrier or $10k monthly premiums.
This was a huge leg up for people on their knees already.
