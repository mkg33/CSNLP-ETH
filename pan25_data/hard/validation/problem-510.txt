I don't smoke pot (nor do I ever plan to) but it's nuts it's on the same level as cocaine and heroin in terms of treatment under the Controller Substances Act.
I'll also note medical use of marijuana also prohibits firearms ownership.
I don't think potheads are any worse than alcoholics, and you can still own a firearm as an alcoholic.
For me, if pot users in states where it's legalized for recreational use can own guns but not in states which haven't legalized it, that's the greater problem.
Actually, in an advanced, reasoning and civilized society, I would think that a ban on owning guns is constitutional whilst a ban on marijuana is not.
I would say that neither marijuana nor alcohol should be mixed with guns, but this ruling doesn’t talk about using them at the same time, it states that people who smoke can’t be barred from owning firearms regardless of whether or not you smoke at the same time you use your firearm.
Presumably there are LOTS of pot users in states which have legalized it for recreational use who own guns w/o hassle from local or state police, though perhaps from ATF.
A bit of consistency across states would be refreshing.
