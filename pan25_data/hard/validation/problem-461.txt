If you read the article, modern Germany calls it Reichspogromnacht, which makes it more believable that nobody looked at the calendar rather than mistaking it for a happy occasion.
I'm an American unfamiliar with either term, but Krystalnacht (crystal night) sounds like it would be very beautiful and Reichsprograomnacht immediately sounds like a bad time involved with Hitler and the Reich.
Moreover if you click through to Reichspogromnacht, the English definition for this German word is "Kristallnacht".
That's bs, espacially since (Reichs)Kristallnacht is the term the Nazis used.
Eyery german calendar would use Reichsprogromnacht to remember 09.11.1938.
As I said in an other comment, it is still a german word, not just a loan word, the exact same word is still used in Germany-- but the one who use it are (Neo)Nazis.
It could have been used, if it was the german HQ who send it, and the one who had to check it wanted it to be hateful.
So you might understand that sometimes a translation is not exact, in this case it could have had a hateful meaning or just me not knowing that it is used in English.
Btw I won't recommend to use it in Germany.
First I am german, second Kristallnacht is still a german word, so if noone checked the meaning of it, it's not a good look for them.
They should have never used it for advertising.
They should review all the dates in their calendar, to prevent something like that.
