I commented to support your other comment, but ok. What is the myth?
That people in the US are getting paid more?
.
So not really.
That's the minimum age to start getting your "pension".
The french system is different from say the US.
You have to work 172 trimester to get your full "pension" so 43 year.
You need to have started working at 19 to get your full pension at 62.
The real retiring age is more 67 since it's at that age that your job can force you to retire even if you haven't all your trimester.
If they don't raise it then you retire at 62 but it will be at a pittance retirement level for the rest of your life, because the amount of taxed workers is so few per retired citizen.
That is true, but if you retire early, you receive a reduced amount compared to retiring at retirement age.
Raising the age kind of forces people to work longer to get their full retirement when they could have received full benefits at an earlier age, but the age was raised.
So basically moving retirement age to 64 is mostly impacting people who started working early...
So most likely poorer people who couldn't afford to achieve higher education.
