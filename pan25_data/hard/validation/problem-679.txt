yeah it's probably super common (in the case that people find documents that should have been returned and immediately return them) and wouldn't at all be newsworthy if it wasn't for Trump's scandal.
Like, if the Trump matter had consisted of: the Archives asked for the documents back and Trump handed over however many hundred he had, then it would have been no big deal.
Instead, what we got was: the Archives asked for the documents, the lawyers handed over a couple, the Archives said there should be more, Trump and his lawyers insisted there weren't, and then an FBI raid uncovered a massive room full of documents exactly where Trump and his lawyers swore there weren't any.
And then this happened again too...
The "something bad" at issue happened 6 years ago when Biden lost track of classified material.
Whether the DOJ wants to do something about that when Biden's out of office is up to them.
If Biden Biden did anything wrong he should be held accountable.
But letâ€™s not confuse this with willfully withholding top secret documents after being told to return them.
Potentially different in the sense that we don't yet know why nobody realized the documents were missing.
But we know that NARA realized that there were tons of documents missing very soon after Trump stole them, because he stole so many in such a short time.
