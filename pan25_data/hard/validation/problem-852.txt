Russia might have more people but it is also less stable, the more people are as much a liability as they are an asset, those people need to be heavily policed, the massive land border also needs to be defended so they can't bring all their forces to Ukraine.
Russia can't win a war of attrition here, they planned for a quick campaign where most of Ukraine capitulated, they signed a quick treaty where they annexed a chunk of Eastern Ukraine to maintain clear access to Crimea and installed their own pro-Russian government in what remains of Ukraine.
If this were any other time in history, Russia's neighbors would be seeing a weak nation barely able to hold onto their "gains" in Ukraine, and would be eyeing territory in Russia they could annex without much of a fight.
Huh, picture if Ukraine pushes Russia back and manages to take Russian territory, I don't think putin would accept that that land is now Ukrainian would he.
I have a feeling eventually the Ukrainians will force back the Russians enough to take hold of Russian territory and then Pooty-Poot is going to look like an idiot.
