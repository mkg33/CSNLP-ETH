Or even precedent from most of the history of the country.
There are letters written by DAs or AGs in the 19th century saying that they couldn't (not wouldn't) charge anyone for ending a pregnancy before quickening.
It won't put much into the economy, most people who will actually be helped by this live paycheck to paycheck.
The money that they would have been paying on the loans was instead going to other things they needed.
So, when this goes through, it's not going to add money to the economy.
Or not as much as so many people think.
Because what's going to happen is that some will just not have to pay anything to their loans (that's not new money into the economy for most of them, because they have been spending what they would have been paying on their loans), while a lot of people will just be paying a lower amount on their loans.
The people at the higher end of the scale are going to be the ones who start putting money into the economy, and that's likely to be a much smaller amount than will be leaving the economy because people are paying on their student loans again.
It’s almost like if you can bailout big banks and the auto industry in 08 AND now the pandemic PPP loans amongst companies and wealthy people that got them, I’m more than certain you have MORE than enough capabilities to bailout students.
I’m talking EVERYONE.
Not just those that are poor, or too rich, or went to private school or those that just enrolled.
No matter who you are along the path of college, it should be an option for people to an more choices with their future.
Don’t bullshit me and cry about taxes.
Take that answer and throw it in the shredder, as you can and WILL be taxed more at the fucking whim of the government.
Point is if we can bailout the rich and wealthy on mostly WEAKER arguments than those that have mountains of debt, to where they cannot default or declare bankruptcy we have a serious problem here.
