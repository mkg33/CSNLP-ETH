So US companies have announced about $200 billion worth of stock buybacks so far this year.
By end of the year, let's say that's 1.2 trillion on same pace.
That 4% is $40 billion dollars in tax revenue.
Not a small amount of money by many standards, but the actual question is not if 4% is the right number, it's if 4% will cut into or negate the value of the process of stock buybacks in the first place enough to discourage it?
Yeah the thing about buybacks being such a delay in the taxes being paid by the shareholder are why I don’t mind a small excise tax on buybacks, I’m just pushing back on some of those comments about buybacks being purely stock manipulation.
I think the overall message being sent by people who believe buybacks should be banned is this - it incentivizes a company’s leadership to prioritize buybacks over everything else as that’s the fastest way to your end goal of raising stock price and “creating value for the shareholder.” Why would you pay dividends (which incentivize a more long-term approach to the stock market)?
The bar for expanding a company’s portfolio of products gets moved far higher because you could instead spend that R&D money on buybacks and immediately get “shareholder value.” Why would you reinvest in your employees and hope that equates to better productivity in five years when you could just buy back stock now?
Why would you update equipment for a gain in efficiency when you could just buy back stock?
At the end of the day, stock buybacks incentivize company leadership to do the bare minimum to maintain what they have and show investors that “hey look, we’re investing in the future.” Then they turn around and tell those investors they’re gonna buy back stock, EPS artificially looks better, and everyone happily nods and moves on.
It’s hollowing out companies and their employees because buybacks don’t incentivize reinvesting in them.
Stock buybacks aren’t a company actually buying back their stocks, they’re destroying that number of stocks, therefore decreasing supply, and raising the value.
Without buybacks, only share dilution would exist in perpetuity until there are just ridiculous numbers of shares.
