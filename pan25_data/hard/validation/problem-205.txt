Even if they currently have those things, not being able to replenish them puts limits on their use.
Not being able to use ammo freely because it can't be replaced puts you at a severe disadvantage.
Not having the resources to counter attack allows your opponent far more freedom.
Just something as simple as lacking sandbags or fire fighting equipment can cause problems.
It creates a situation that only gets worse with time; a situation that can't be won.
Sometimes that's fine if it's important to delay your opponent, but there is no advantage in that respect for Russia because Ukraine would have no reason to be in a hurry to take a defended Kherson when they could just apply a little light pressure and wait, much like they have been doing in the Kherson region in general.
More importantly, it requires supplies.
If they had defended the city, Ukraine would have moved it's arty close enough to fully block of the already very limited supply routes.
Any Russian force large enough to effectively defend the city would be in a bad situation before any real attack.
The real problem is that unless they can cross the river somewhere, the Russians can simply bombard the city with artillery.
I bet the Russians are going to destroy everything they can on the way out, wait until ukraine moves in, then blow the dam and flood everything.
they won't even try to fight, they will just reposition to defend Crimea or elsewhere.
how many Russian are in the flood zone right now?
