That said, while Electoral Count Act reform would protect against a 2020-type challenge, there are myriad other ways for an election-denying secretary of state, attorney general, or governor to gum up the electoral process, restrict voting rights, or sow confusion around elections.
And presidential elections aren’t the only concern: They could cause problems for other races too, and almost certainly will where they’re virtually certain to win.
Absent major (and unlikely) political reform, they’re going to continue to pose a risk as long as they remain so influential within the GOP.

There are some ongoing efforts in Congress to help safeguard the 2024 contest from the sort of challenge Trump and his allies launched in 2020: The House in September passed a bill to , which outlines the congressional certification process that served as the venue to contest the election (and ultimately the Capitol insurrection) on Jan. 6, 2021.
The Senate still needs to pass it, but it’s that top Republicans like Mitch McConnell may support, so it could potentially get across the line in the lame-duck session before a new Congress arrives next year.
If the GOP take control of the House and Senate, how realistic is it for them to challenge the election results in 2024 if the Democrats win?
Would it depend on the candidate on top of the GOP ticket?
