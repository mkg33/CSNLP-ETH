Looking at this from a software design perspective, why is there a switch to ignore 2nd and lower preferences in ballots without 1st preference votes?
If ballots without a 1st preference vote were nevertheless VALID, when could such a switch be needed?
If such ballots would be invalid, when could such a switch be needed?
Q: does ranked choice voting vary between different cities or counties within the same state?
Serious question: do the requirements for VALID RCV ballots differ between city elections in Oakland, CA and San Francisco, CA?
If not, does the California department of State not provide any guidance to local election officials on how to configure vote tabulation machines?
Whether said ballots are valid is a matter of state/local regulations that vary by place, so different elections boards would want to set the setting differently with the otherwise same software.
Yes, they can differ, though I’m not sure if they do anywhere or if it’s purely theoretical.
IIRC in this case the rules for how to count ballots came from the Oakland City Charter, which would imply that it could be a city-by-city designation.
