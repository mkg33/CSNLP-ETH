Remember King Midas from Greek mythology?
Midas asked Dionysus that he should be able to turn into gold everything he touched.
His wish granted, Midas went away trying it out.
He first turned some twigs into gold and then some stones.
Afterward, he did the same to an ear of corn and some apples.
There was no end to his rejoicing.
No one said any of that.
And no, money cannot buy happiness but it sure can make misery a lot more comfortable.
The point is that money will never solve all your problems because some of your problems have nothing to do with money.
I find once I had no money, money was the only problem.
Once I solved that problem, I then had the issues of holding on to that money and keeping people or institutions from leeching me dry.
Whole new world of stress opens up once you cross the boundary.
Oh by no means think I am consoling the rich side here.
I have been down both sides, and I am not rich but very very comfortable.
I worked 60 hours a week.
I’ve had a negative bank account.
But most people never get to see the flip side, if they do, they keep it quiet and just brag on about life’s treats.
