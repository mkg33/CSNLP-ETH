When I was 16, I was pretty much an idiot who thought he knew the whole thing, beginning to end, smartest kid in the room anywhere.
That kid would have totally agree with this decision, and embraced it, and engaged in the whole process.
Of course now in my 50's I know that I didn't know shit, and most of my opinions were based on fucking nothing, or just what I heard randomly somewhere that sounded cool or whatever...but I still like the idea of engaging, rather than alienating the young.
I never experienced that.
I like the idea that things could be done better, and let's give it a try.
Takes a little trust, but the alternative is what?
And then maybe for the third, I thought that a capable person would just choose where they wanted to go, and then work toward that, and it would work out.
In other words, you find yourself in a certain place and wish to go to another place, then you proceed until you get there.
Of course in practice there are all kinds of random twists and turns, and half the time you can't even remember where you intended to go in all the windy paths and curveballs life tends to throw at you.
I thought it was all about deciding, then applying one's will.
In reality we don't really have many actual decisions in life, and most of those we hardly know whether they are going to work out or not.
Yeah, those things have significant personal consequences that come about through one's individual choices so I don't think they can be equated.
The consequence of voting for a muppet polician on an individual level is not similar.
I think if a bunch of 16 year olds took this all the way to our supreme court so I think we give them the vote.
The ones that don't care won't vote, just like everyone over 18 now.
Many of them won't care, and for the ones that do, they'll make better informed voters when they turn 18.
Plus 16 year olds are much more likely to be politically aware if they can vote, otherwise they are just not gonna care.
But if we're letting old people vote and they have hardly any real skin in the game, I don't see why 16 year olds shouldn't have the chance.
Even if it just means that more young people are more politically active by the time they reach 18 and don't vote much before that's a huge win.
Many of the people against this idea seem to be under the impression that being eligible to vote means that 100% of 16 and 17 year olds will vote.
