Edit: The Pacific theatre should also get MORE attention in the US too.
It was our biggest role in the war and the Pacific saw just about as many casualties as Europe.
China was especially hit hard.
I will say though, the United States did take out Japan almost exclusively by themselves.
There was some help by other allies but it was primarily the US in the Pacific.
Not talking about civilian casualties just military ones and most of japans military casualties were at the hands of the US and Japan lost significantly more men than the US in the Pacific.
I have heard some British claim it was the US and British who won the war, maybe not US won the war but definitely discounting the Soviet union and other allies roles.
Edit: I also talk to a lot of British people while traveling and I heard the Pacific theatre of the war isn't really taught there.
Is that correct?
Their statement is still correct.
A modern tank is probably one of the safest places you can be if nukes start going off because they filter the air against all NBC threats and, well, its a fucking 70 ton tank.
