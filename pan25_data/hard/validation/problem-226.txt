"October 10, 1952, Harry Truman said this: Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years.
".
Here’s the thing.
It was already an unconditional surrender except for one minor detail.
Immunity for Hirohito, as I had already mentioned.
Which he already got.
History just doesn’t line up with this view that it was necessary.
There is to show what I said.
This is definitely not true.
Maybe earlier in the bombing campaign the entire Junta thought this way, but after the firebombing of Tokyo half, if not 4 members of the war council were willing to give into everything but the Emperor Clause.
To say that it was just or necessary is blind to the history of the subject.
The reality was what I had already said.
The only precondition the Japanese and the Americans could not agree to was what to do with Hirohito.
FDR, and later Truman, wanted an unconditional surrender as a show of force.
And nuking Japan was not only a message to the Japanese, but also a message to the USSR who had already began invading Japan and taking territory.

The first piece is well cited.
A good paper is made up of good citations.
Using an ad hominem to attack the piece rather than analyzing the content, while aimlessly appealing to unnamed experts does not do your point any service.
