I live in the bluest state in the country, Massachusetts (as of the 2020 election), and I have not heard of any of this.
Though, to be fair, that could be because 90% of my ballot will be Democrats running unopposed.

So maybe the Democratic Party messaging isnt as strong here, because they don't need to waste the money, resulting in me being a bit out of the loop on mainstream Dem politicking.
I guess the only option is to vote for the party that isn't constantly undermining democracy and spreading conspiracy theories about rigged elections then.

Is crying fraud everytime you lose and rallying your base to an insurrgency over it good democratic values?
