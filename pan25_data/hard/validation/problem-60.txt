To be clear, the above isn't the sole defining trait of fascism, so while the above can apply to the USA to a degree, that doesn't make it fascist (yet.
Try to keep Republicans out).
Russia meets other criteria too.
And exactly how do you do that with Russia?
Are you going to gain air superiority first?
It's HUGE and can station bomber well away from it's capital.
We've got to assume that Russia can't throw 'everything it's got' at Ukraine because it's still worried about NATO happening on another front.
It would reveal NATO's hand, but then again, the whole point is threatening so that Belarus won't join the war or be a launchpad for another front.
But I've said this years ago many times to many downvotes; I sincerely doubt Russia would use nukes even if it goes to war with NATO, and same for NATO.
The only situation where nukes may actually start dropping is when NATO forces approach Moscow or St. Petersburg, and that's as tactical nukes.
Which yes, means nuking themselves.
Well, no, but they'd nuke the US.
Nothing about MAD implies saving yourself.
It's a deterrence strategy.
