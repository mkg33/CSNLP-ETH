Apparently, the IL governor and him were in some sort of feud.
Griffin spent a lot of money trying to get a republican governor into office, and ultimately relocated to FL, where I imagine DeSantis is licking his balls for a piece of the pie.
PFOF is mutually beneficial?
I like paying more while some market maker gets to play different markets and sell me a share at a higher price than they pay for it by manipulating the seconds between trades, or buying my share at a lower price and selling it higher using the same method.
I mean, if it's so mutually beneficial, why has it been banned from several countries already?
Anyway, there's a reason it's illegal in numerous other countries.
To pretend that these "free trades" are overall good for the consumer/retailer is folly, if not malice considering what we know about "free services" online, particularly compounded with Wall Street drug use, overall attitude & value system, and historical, habitual criminality.
