So it might not be Elon's idea, but some underling who is either overzealous or else trying to deliberately sabotage things.

“UPDATE: The tweets by @TwitterSupport this morning, announcing a new policy banning linking to competing websites, have been deleted.
Twitter prohibited accounts that solely promote links on other platforms.
So if you had an account that, for example, only tweeted links to trump’s truths or whatever as his posted them, that would be banned.
I will admit that, as I said, I have never actually used Twitter, only seen the tweets that are reposted everywhere.
I'm still confused by the whole thing.
I have been on "social media" in some form since the early 90s, but never had any desire nor sense of need to be on Twitter, nor seen the usefulness of it.
It's the dumbest of all social media, though not the most dangerous, as that would be Facebook, and I left there in '12 when I saw the direction it was heading.
Facebook at least had a decent base idea of linking friends and family together.
Twitter is just a megaphone for every one of us idiots to attempt to shout over one another.
I came of age on old hobby forums, which were particularly good at forcing you to find common ground with people you might vehemently disagree with on many topics.
