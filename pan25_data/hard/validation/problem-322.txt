just typical American schizophrenic online mentality.
You find it on American comment sections of either side (left or right).
You are either for the narrative or you must be some kind of spy sent there by the opposing side.
You can try to argue with them that you are having a rational argument, but it's like trying to convince a religious person.
In fact these political sides are like religions at this point.
I think that's BS to be honest, Russian Federation is nowhere near collapse and they have plenty of allies still.
While I’m glad Ukraine has held Russia in check, it’d be silly to think Russia is beat.
If previous wars have taught us anything Russia always does bad in the first years of war until they get their manufacturing going and figure things out.
I hope this doesn’t last but I’d never count Russia out.
Because Russia isn’t heading for defeat.
They are doing much much worse than expected.
They’re paying a high price for small gains, but defeat is still a long way off and it isn’t certain.
Third parties absolutely push for longer wars.
The longer Russia is bogged down in Ukraine the better it is for pretty much everybody, except Ukraine and Russia.
Aye, if it wasn't for NATO's hands being tied by Russia's nuclear stockpile, the Russian army would have been steamrolled out of Ukraine and back across their own border by now.
Given how corruption has rotted the Russian army from the inside out, it would be a turkey shoot on par with the invasion of Iraq.
