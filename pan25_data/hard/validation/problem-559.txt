Nobody needs more than 6 tries with a gun to stop an attacker.
If you don't think you can do it with a handgun, get a pump shotgun, and stop electing people who promise to cut your taxes as that is the Number ONE way our police have been "defunded" since 1980.
Absurd.
The semi-auto gun is what makes the "mass" part so easy.
It also gives otherwise candyass twits the idea they can commit crimes with impunity.
The only serious difference between the US and the rest of the world is we have enshrined the ability to commit mass murder and nobody else has.
As for Czech and Italians owning military grade (semi-auto, large capacity) weapons, you're making that up.
This makes perfect sense - it's the rate of fire that promotes mass shootings and what distinguishes a military grade weapon from a gun for sport or self-defense.
But I also think that looking at it objectively, that very thought, can be a part of the equation that leads to gun violence.
It wouldn't solve the problem violence, but we'd probably have a lot lot less firearm deaths if we had much stricter gun control.
Logistically as well, going up to gun owners and trying to take away their guns is just... Well it wouldn't work out for anyone.
Cats out of the bag, physically you can't take the guns away there'd be too much bloodshed.
Instead implementing training courses, stiffer background checks, and even a pysch eval would go much further.
