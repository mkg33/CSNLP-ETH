But the important part to you, the part you really need to get out there, is it's somehow the libs fault for Republican behavior.
And you're TOTALLY a liberal.
Feminist too, just against resources spent for sex trafficking of women.
Yeah, totally.
A liberal/feminist spouting complete Republican talking points, yeah sure.
It's the liberals fault Republicans are behaving so poorly It's all their fault Look what we made them do!
"But, but, my anecdote11" Your unrelated one that's really touching on homelessness and the problems of the war on drugs (which party is primarily responsible for that?
I bet you also think it's the liberals/feminists fault, don't you?)
Just all merges together for you, doesn't it?
Don't we know this is a zero sum game?
If we spend resources on sex trafficking, why, suddenly other trafficking is somehow magically not dealt with.
I mean, total "misuse" of the term surely, to label sex trafficking as trafficking and spend resources on it.
And the side bonus is, now they can co-opt the entire idea of human trafficking so no attention will be paid to actual human trafficking!
They already co-opted grooming... /s.
