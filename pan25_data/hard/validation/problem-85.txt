My big concern is medical education in Florida.
The accrediting body for residency (ACGME) has specific requirement for DEI and teaching about health care inequalities.
This bill could lead to the loss of a huge number of physician training programs.
As if our medical institutions weren’t already in a dire enough situation.
I’m guessing most health professional job training would go away.
Just want to make sure people understand the ramifications of this type of legislation.
They probably will if these types of things actually pass and start being enforced.
Their universities can say goodbye to most federal grants as well if these laws are actually implemented.
Restricting academics was one of the policies enacted and anyone who opposed the State’s policy was removed.
It is a long book that I am suggesting and you have to ignore the obvious homophobia within(released in 1960) but “The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich” by William Shirer is almost frightening similar to what Republicans are pushing.
