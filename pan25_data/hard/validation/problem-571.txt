They did this in WV a few years ago and I've noticed so many guns being carried improperly ever since.
I had a concealed carry permit and had a lot of respect for that process.
They're not fucking around in there, it was heavily impressed upon us that this is serious business.
They taught what the law is, what the law isn't, safety as pertains to concealed carry in addition to usual gun safety, and a general filter for dumbasses and psychos.
And the guy failed people for being dumb, crazy talking, unsafe, or just clearly there for the wrong reasons.
Not too uncommon to see people carrying wrong and hear talk about carrying that is just plain stupid.
It needs to be on the top shelf.
Oh don't get me wrong I'm all for carrying a gun - legally, safely, and with full understanding of what your rights are and where your rights end.
Legality of the firearm is almost always just "who's allowed to have this gun and where."
Very few guns are themselves outright illegal.
Expanding who can have what gun and where just makes more guns "legal" more of the time.
You can get a charge for illegally purchasing a weapon even if you legally can own a weapon.
Same applies to carrying.
Granting permitless carry is affecting the aspect of public use.
It has no effect on gun ownership or access to guns.
It's making a single action legal.
It isnt making more firearms legal where ownership would do that.
The legality of the firearm is not the legality of carrying or ownership.
Getting a charge for illegally carrying has nothing to do with the legality of the gun itself.
You can also get a charge for illegally ownership (say unregistered firearm in certain states) if you can legally carry.
