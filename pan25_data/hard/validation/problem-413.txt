The Communist-led government was deemed inflexible to serious reform and refused to relinquish power for years.
Orban, Fidesz, and many opposed it only years later to become an inflexible government that now tilts the voting scales because it wants to remain in power.
The real upcoming problem is what happens when he leaves the stage.
People who hold onto power like this stay until they die usually (because they are legally vulnerable if ousted) but since they don't leave, they also don't foster a successor either.
Hungary is about to have a power vacuum in the next decade or so.
It seems that Orban had a more liberal vision for Hungary during his first term in power from 1998 to 2002, but once he regained it in 2010 that power corrupted him.
Did you know that Orbán's government changed the voting laws so they got 2/3 of the mandates by only around half of the votes?
So one half of Hungary do not support Fidesz and Orbán but they cannot be removed or controlled by democratic means... ☹️.
Orbán has turnedh is back on democracy and has become a complete follower of Putin.
He has corrupted the country and established his media empire based on the Russian example.
The system as as corrupt as it was during the Soviet Union if not more, except set up to funnel EU money to the FIDESZ aristocracy.
