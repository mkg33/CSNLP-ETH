Yup.
Every administration has been telling them to up their defense spending and invest in their defense infrastructure.
They didn’t and are now seeing the consequences.
What annoys me most are EU politician complaining about the US profiteering from the war, when most equipment given to Ukraine has been donated, and of course were going to be able to supply Ukraine in a larger quantity, we’ve never stop investing in our defense.
There was this article on politico, that mentioned that Europe wants alternatives to US arms (F35 in the articles) but none exist in Europe.
If Europe were to federalize which many in this thread seem to think is a good idea (I'm very doubtful), there is a future where they'd have their own army and maybe the US wouldn't necessarily have to step into Russa-Europe conflicts.
If Russia had a United EU on one border, China on another, and USA on the last id be surprised if russia ever had ideas of grandeur again.
I think the best way to keep Russia from acting up again in the future would be for the EU to become one country.
It makes no sense to have a bunch of small imperialistic countries in Europe any more.
It makes sense since the US is furthest from European countries as well as Asian countries compared to Europe.
Europe is not really concerned about South America and certainly isn't worried about the US or Canada.
