(Article isn't about palin winning, it's about begick winning, while running essentially third party in this race).
Worse thing it there is propaganda saying RCV fixes the spoiler effect, or that honest voting is safe.
It's also not about palin.
It's actually about the voters second vote being thrown out before it's counted.
A failure of RCV not about elections being rigged.
The problem here is that you think voters who wanted begich, but not Palin were confused by the voting process or tricked.
If around 5000 of those Palin voters didn't show up to vote.
Begich would have won.
Which is the preference they selected when they voted.
That’s because not enough people voted for him as their first choice.
This entire article is asinine because it purposefully ignores that it’s RANKED choice voting.
The entire argument is that he wins if you only look at people’s second picks.
But if most people wanted Begrich more than the other two, they would’ve put him first.
They did not, so they didn’t, which is why he didn’t win.
