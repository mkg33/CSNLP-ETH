The coalition Netanyahu is building is not a monolith.
Ben-Gvir is looking to be treading the same steps as Lieberman and Bennett; if he continues on the path of radicalization, which is not in line with Likud's beliefs, it is a matter of time before the right wing will fracture as Likud is heavily composed of centrists who bought into the delusion marketed by Bibi that the center-left (Lapid; Likud being center-right) is in any way different from the Likud besides not being led by him.
I'm not speaking of Bennett and Lieberman's current dispositions; I am talking about the electoral base they initially courted that gave them their mandates.
Ben-Gvir has inherited the voting base of Lieberman / Bennett (Lieberman maintains a couple of seats because, as you say, he also courts the the Russian-speaking electorate.)
The secular armchair settlers and the actual religious settlers.
Either he will radicalize and the right-wing will fracture, or he will become palatable and assume proper politicking, which will put him on a collision course with the Ultra-Orthodox sooner or later.
It is a party pitching to a sector of people who are not orthodox or fundamentalists religiously, and carry a dose of right-wing nationalism.
