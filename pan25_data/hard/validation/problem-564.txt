It doesn't necessarily mean that.
It could also mean everyone is overthinking that these are balloons for spying.
First of all, people were talking about spy satellites from the first balloon reported in the news.
And second, this IS different because satellites aren't in our air space.
These are.
And last, why did you write out the word satellite then put the icon?
Did you think we wouldn't recognize the word?
I mean, of they believe that balloons are straight with to engage or notice, or considered benign enough to ignore, they could deliver something like an EMP if it's in their interests to do so, such as if they decided to move against Taiwan.
Prop 2: there has always been more mundane balloon releases locally/by nearby countries that often got blown around and didn't get too much attention until chinese balloon comes along.
Prop 1: china released more balloons that managed to get there after the first one got popped while hoping usa will not escalate.
it also means the chinese satellite technology is not very good if they have to use balloons.
US does not use balloons because we don't have to.
Peter Zeihan talked about how stupid these balloons are today.
He is a well respected foreign policy analyst.
He said its just a dumb decision by the chinese.
He explained why they did it.
They are trying to learn how to scale up their nuclear deterant by seeing what the US does.
Good Satellites can see all this.
