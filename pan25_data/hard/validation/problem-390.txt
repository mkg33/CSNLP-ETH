Yep, Russia pretty solidly killed global efforts for nuclear non-proliferation.
But really it was just part of a larger trend working against countries without nukes.
-There was also the hushed worries that Russia would come in and force them to give up the nukes.
Doesn't matter what the piece of paper said.
-Whatever your stance on Israel is, their neighbors have invaded them before.
And Iran has stated many, many times that they'd wipe Israel and US off the map.
Israel isn't giving up shit.
Israel don't give a fuck and will never give a fuck.
The right to self-defense is essential and absolute.
The UN also, without irony, seats the most violent, humans-right abusing regimes on the planets on its Human Rights Council.
Or Iran and Women's Rights, has there ever been a more iconic duo?!
And yes, many of these are rotating bodies, but not holding every member to a set of standards undermines any attempt to impose them.
Yeah people need to put away the expectation that the UN can take actions that affect its member states, because it rarely can without the consent of the Security Council.
The most important thing about the UN is that it is a forum for diplomacy no matter what happens, even when two nations have completely broken down diplomatic relations, meaning there will always be an avenue for negotiation.
