Well yes, but no.
It's been autonomous since 1924 within whatever country it was a part of.
It was originally part of the Ukrainian SSR, then the Moldovan SSR, then the Nazi Romanians took it, and then it went back to Moldova.
But they always had some form of autonomous government.
The Russian troops are there as part of the settlement.
Hypothetically the Moldovans wouldn't persecute the Transnistrians if "peaceepers" were there.
There's a similar situation in Kosovo (officially a province of Serbia) as an autonomous region with NATO peacekeepers.
When the Soviet Union broke up there was this massive power grab across the former empire.
In Moldova it got incredibly bloody between the Transnistrians who wanted to join Ukraine to side with Russia and the Moldovans who wanted to join Romania.
The region was created as a middle ground to allow them to join the Ukrainians (probably now Russians) if Romania and Moldova sought reunification.
Ukraine may help out later- especially since even a Crimea-less Ukraine can choke out the Russian presence- but right now Ukraine's not likely to touch it unless the TDR does something very, very stupid and convinces Ukraine to help Moldova out.
