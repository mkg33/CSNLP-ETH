Removing books from libraries is far short of censorship.
Your local library doesn’t have every single book written.
They choose what they want to stock.
Every library does it.
Are they all banning books?
At least they aren't burning the books?
But yeah, the idea that this war has "turned into a fight between democracy and authoritarianism" is just false given how dysfunctional ukraine is as a liberal democracy.
Ukraine is at war so some of the stuff it has done sucks but makes sense for the context, like consolidating all news into one state broadcast and banning rival political parties, which outside of war would be horrible, but understandable now given the circumstances.
This is literally exactly how conservatives from Alabama feel about schools removing lgbt books.
We have so many good examples from history that banning information like this is a horrible idea.
It’s perfectly fine for Ukraine to be wrong about this one thing, but it’s wrong.
Yes agreed 100% here, people try and rationalize every thing Ukraine does, but they are still our allies and even if they misstep, they should have our support.
Edit: I'm as much on the Ukrainian's side as anyone sane and decent, but I'm honestly surprised and disturbed that support for Ukraine has to be absolute in all things in some people's eyes.
I think Ukraine is fighting a good fight and I will continue cheering them on in liberating their homeland, but when their officials pull questionable actions like this one it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.
My support won't waver over this, but I will still call it out as wrong.
Not everything is digitized, especially not Soviet era literature.
And seriously, are you actually cheering on what is essentially book burning?
Even books with known biased views have value - historians will use propaganda pieces to see what the focuses and motivations of a state are, even if the content is not factual, it is still useful in some capacity.
Would you be happy if we had burned German literature after WWI, because they were the enemy for most European/American nations?
How about French literature after Napoleon?
