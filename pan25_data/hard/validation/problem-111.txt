You do not need to consider the messenger... at all... for the vast majority of handling the worthiness of a statement or proposition.
In your last example, you need not consider at all, to say nothing of remembering, any aspect about Bush whatsoever if the issue of the discussion is the worth of solar power or any claims related to such.
If the issue is Bush's advocacy, Bush himself, or any concern of corruption related to Bash's advocacy, then... by all means fold in anything and everything that will help you evaluate Bush rather than solar.
Or, put differently: When George W. Bush comes out in full throated advocacy of solar power you don't take that opportunity to remind people about his torture program, you take that opportunity to double down on his comments about solar power.
You don't forget about the torture program, you just put a pin in it for a second.
Yeah, so I kind of think that a well known conservative Republican coming out and announcing his support for solar power is demonstrably different than a liberal Democrat announcing the same thing.
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend" is a bit simplistic, but in this case it's true.
The snowball's chance in hell that American conservatives listen to Kissinger is worth the ignominy of repeating his words, at least in this situation.
