And why is Abbott having to build a make-shift wall on the El Paso border anyway?
Trump promised to build a wall across the entire border.
Why didn’t Abbott ask Trump to start building in El Paso if that was Abbott’s biggest concern?
And Trump had 4 years to work with Abbott on building the wall.
They got nothing accomplished.
They built nothing.
Now Abbott wants to blame Biden because Trump didn’t build the wall he promised?
If Abbott is so concerned about this, why didn’t he ask Trump to declare the cartels terrorist organizations while Trump was in office?
Why wasn’t Abbott calling to send our military to go fight in Mexico against cartels while Trump was President?
Are you telling me the cartels are any more dangerous now than they were 2 years ago while Trump was President?
Politics aside, it may actually be true that cartels are more dangerous today than they were in 2019.
It isn't like the cartels got more stable and less violent in the last few years.
Brazen attacks are on the rise, new weapons and tactics are being explored, and tensions between the government and the cartels are escalating.
