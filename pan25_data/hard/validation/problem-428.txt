Basically that's what she did when she declared being independent, she didn't want to get ousted in a primary (which she 100% would) now the democrats have to decide whether to run a candidate and basically guarantee losing the seat, or not run a candidate and live with 'the devil you know'.
Centrists/moderates tend to have this love affair with 'divided government is good' because it means the government can't get anything done so they go on ignoring it.
So Sinemas antics may appeal to tbem.
Republicans will win the seat if sinema splits moderate/dem leaning voters with any other candidate.
The most realistic scenario is that Sinema and the Democrat split the non Republican vote, and a Republican will win with about 45-50% of the vote.
I honestly think there is a decent chance now that she is more of a liability for Republicans than Dems, or draws voters evenly from both camps making her a nonentity.
This could change if Republicans nominate a genuine centrist candidate though... but I highly doubt the Republican base would ever vote for a pragmatic centrist candidate.
I honestly doubt she could get moderate/dem leaning voters at all.
She has pissed off the party way too much leaning into her stupid 'maverick' image.
