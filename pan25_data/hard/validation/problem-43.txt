Russia looks at World War II ('the Great Patriotic War') somewhat differently than the Western Allies (or Germany) do.
Obviously, that's broad strokes, and I'm sure there are plenty of Russians that do have a better grasp on history than that -- but propaganda is a helluva drug.
To 'De-nazify' Ukraine (in their eyes) is to remove anyone and anything that is anti-Soviet (or at least, anti-Russian).
For them, WWII was a war against the Nazis, and the Nazis were bad because they were invading, attacking and attempting to genocide the Soviet Union.
The genocide was 'bad' because it was directed at them, but not really for any other reason (as they were and remain pretty open to Genocide, themselves -- it is exactly what they've been up to in Ukraine, after all).
It makes little sense to call it a genocide against Ukrainians because indeed it was 'people who consumed food' that were victims, not just Ukrainians.
It's more akin to China's Great Leap Forward or India's Bengal famine than even, say, the Great Hunger of Ireland (neither of these being considered genocides, by the way), and certainly not at all comparable to the clearly planned and targeted attacks on specific groups such as the Armenian genocide or the Holocaust.
As horrible as famines are, you canâ€™t exactly put them in same category as the holocaust, where one is an unintentional side effect and the other is deliberate mass murder.
(Yes, seizing the crops is bad, but the purpose is not to kill the Ukrainians, but to feed the soviets).
