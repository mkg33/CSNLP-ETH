Well, maybe so, but I don’t think NATO is gonna put up with this level of violence against civilians endlessly.
The tanks are coming.
The Bradleys are coming.
All kinds of other stuff is coming.
I would imagine that more patriots will come now.
Because here’s the deal.
Based on the readiness they have displayed so far in this war, and the stories we were hearing in the 1990’s about their nukes being unsecured and not well tended, and the actual nukes we have found laying on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean, I’m guessing that most of what nukes they have would explode inside Russia.
I don’t buy reports about Russia unleashing more destruction upon Ukraine as a result of “xyz” for the simple reason that Russia has thrown everything it has (except nukes) at Ukraine since the invasion.
Russia doesn’t have anything left.
For Russia, this is a fight for survival.
They cannot survive the fallout.
It's an easy opportunity to cut Russia's head off without the US swinging the sword.
Then bring in US contractors to help with the rebuilding process, make $$$$ and eliminate the threat while indirectly damaging China by controlling Ukrainian energy, instead of the Russians.
