Unfortunately I don’t think nuclear is the answer.
The the fear and panic any unstability around a nuclear power plant will cause.
“ I remember 6 months ago when Russian soldiers took over a nuclear power plant and it almost caused a global catastrophe.”.
Though Russian actions at Ukrainian nuclear plants, amounting to state terrorism, are quite scary to anyone - let alone the layman with 0 knowledge about what is safe or not.
A bully could take up such a stance and cause huge issues to the whole world.
Any sources you would recommend to read to follow up on this?
Sounds interesting but at the same time leads to disbelief why there is so little known activity.
What are the viable alternatives in your mind?
We apparently are unable to ask/stem the global population growth.
We need energy at ever increasing levels.
So we stop drilling and what energy source do we turn to fulfill our all energy needs starting tomorrow?
Point being is to stop relying on foreign oil when we could do more here.
Provide more jobs here.
Provide the ability to sell more and stop using our Strategic Reserves.
As far as the strategic reserves, they exist specifically to combat high prices (not an emergency supply), and protect the US economy.
Not releasing them would be counter to their whole reason for existence.
