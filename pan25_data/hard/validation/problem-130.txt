I literally just watched this and.. it's a young man, a guy with a typical skater's frame.. skinny, athletic and unarmed.. being manhandled by a group of much larger armed men, who restrain him while commanding him to "get on the floor" while holding his arms preventing him from going prone, and then proceed to pepper spray him in the face until he's incapable of seeing or responding to commands, and then physically stand him up to receive full force punches and baton shots to the face until his brain dies.
Is this how you want your kid to live?
Can he or she be just randomly descended upon and beaten to death by a group of grown men who see them as a meat bag to release their tensions on?
Because that's literally what I just saw on the police bodycam and elevated video feed.
I mean, this could be your kid.
Any teen or young adult.
This dude was clearly not a threat to these officers, yet they felt the urge, the need to crush him.. to kill him.
And they did just that.
Yup always how it is.
When Dems do something right they get lumped in as ‘politicians’ or ‘lawmakers’ in general, but when they do something wrong they get specifically named as Dems.
Meanwhile a Republican does something wrong and it’s ‘politician does ___’ but when they do something right for once - they get specifically called a Republican.
Someone else pointed it out a while ago and I’ve been noticing it ever since….
It’s more so that the avg citizen is powerless at this point.
What’s someone in WA supposed to do about cops in TN?
The majority want it to stop and are against it, we just can’t control any of it anymore….
Every time something like this happens, the few reasonable people on the sub post and it seems not totally loony.
Then the rest of the marching order ones show up and downvote them, and it derails into why it’s actually the left’s fault somehow and how the person killed had it coming.
