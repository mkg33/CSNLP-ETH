Defund the police isn't about defunding their training, it's about making sure the police with less or even just bad training don't become militarized like they are in the US.
Idk about you, but I wouldn't trust any cop with a loaded weapon to do their job properly when they can't stop being racist and hateful on main when unarmed.
And, again, we don't know at this point whether this guy was aggressive towards the officers ("Get the hell away from my car!
"), had a history of violence towards police or the public, or anything else that would justify restraint.
We do know that they had reasonable suspicion to investigate, which gives them the authority to detain him for that purpose.
We know, further, that investigation would have meant being right up in front of the vehicle, so permitting him into it while they carry that out would be unwise.
The lock had been damaged in a way characteristic of stolen vehicles, so there was what US case law refers to as reasonable suspicion that the vehicle - one of the models most often stolen in Qu√©bec - was stolen.
By this reasoning, wouldn't it mean they have reasonable articulable suspicion for anyone who approaches that model of car, given it's apparently commonly stolen?
He wasn't arrested, sure, but it seem kind of a stretch to say a guy walking up to a car with a damaged lock \while carrying the keys to it\ is reasonable suspicion he tried to steal the car.
While this is true, what was the reasonable suspicion if the guy walked up with the keys to the car?
Is just approaching a car which someone apparently tried to steal at some point sufficient to be suspected of being the thief, even if you weren't seen in proximity to the car prior to this, the thief wasn't seen and you have the keys to the car?
Not having been reported as stolen is certainly not proof that it hasn't been, as the owner may not be aware that it has been to report it - this is true in any case, but especially with physical evidence supporting (but not proving) a stolen vehicle.
If the car hasn't been reported stolen yet - say, it was stolen today while its owner was working - or the plates were stolen off a matching vehicle and that theft not yet reported, what good will running the plates do?
It's the first step, yes, but it's not definitive.
Keep in mind that I was responding to a comment that assumed that clean plates were the be-all and end-all of stolen vehicle investigation.
