they were getting away with occupying Crimea for 8 years, and would have continued to do so if they hadn't gotten greedy.
without the war Ukraine might have had a small chance of recovering Crimea at the eventual death of Putin, if it had led to enough turmoil within Russia, but that's about it.
Combine that with Russia's borderline suicidal aggressiveness elsewhere, and it starts to look like there isn't going to be much left to defend Crimea by the time Ukraine gets there.
I mean, I have no doubts Ukraine is going to liberate Melitopol eventually but I expect the Russian army to throw everything it can to prevent it.
When the war is over, I want Ukraine rebuilt to better than it ever was just to show Russians what they are missing by supporting Putin's cleptocracy.
My slight hope of Russians doing something about their government has long since evaporated.
The population is too afraid, too brainwashed, too apathetic or too much already gone from Russia.
Basically make Putin's nightmare come true with a free and prosperous ex-Soviet neighbour that Russians can relate to.
