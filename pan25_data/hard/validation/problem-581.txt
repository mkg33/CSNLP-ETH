Evergreen got stuck at the narrowest one way point.
There are parts of the canal that two or even three ships can be abreast, and there is technically a lake in the middle of the canal which would still count as “in the canal” if it got stuck while trying to park up.
That's how the other two boats got stuck too, always someone that's not experienced with the boat trying to pilot a massive hunk of steel down a narrow canal.
The name of the lake is the Great Bitter Lake and basically a holding area for ships which need urgent work or parts and have broken down mid-transit.
Those 22 miles are still a single line channel, divided by a sand bank, merging at both ends and as yet, there's no spot for any ship to overtake.
The only spot (recently dredged) that I can see for a possible overtaking in the entire canal, and that's my guesstimate, is half a mile wide.
My bad.
Should've made that clear.
But, for all intents and purposes, the distance between 2 ships is 1 mile, even in the canal.
There are no parts in the canal which are large enough to have 2 or even 3 ships abreast.
There has to be a distance of atleast 1nm between 2 ships.
