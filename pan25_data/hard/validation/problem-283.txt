Been going on since Abe's days (at least since 2006).
I don't see a reason why they shouldn't have more offensive capabilities, Japan's a stable nation and an ally, plus they're neighbors with NK and China.
China can try taking Taiwan if they would like, but they'd just lose a bunch of boats to missile strikes, there's really no way that escalates into WW3 because China doesn't have enough nukes to win a nuclear war.
They have enough nukes to make it too painful for the USA to start a nuclear war, but at the end of a nuclear exchange America would still exist as a country and China wouldn't.
So a war over Taiwan would be almost certain to stay conventional.
Also, Japan having more missiles makes it less likely that China is willing to invade the island, not more likely.
In the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the first place the Chinese hit will be Guam, and Japan.
I think what's going on in Ukraine is a wake up call that history isn't over and that is a real possibility that needs to be positioned for.
Well, they're buying the missiles from them, so I guess the US isn't very stretched.
The States have all this shit lying around and an unrealized manufacturing sector that can be spun up if it ever gets to that.
No it doesn't, but in this case it does.
Japan has a seriously entrenched grassroots culture of pacifism.
Abe spent most of his career trying to build up the military and getting cockblocked at most every turn.
Japanese troops sent abroad are frequently unarmed and when they are, are prohibited from firing on anyone.
