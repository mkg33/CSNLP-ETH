At the start I thought if Russia would struggle Putin would be replaced but by now it seems as if the whole country really is ok with being completely wrecked just so they don't have to accept a loss.
...unless they make people rise up for a Holy War, which is the futile bet Putin is currently making (based on the rhetoric in Russian media).
Yes, it won't work.
But Putin is still making this bet because that's the only one he can still make.
That, however, includes Putin himself.
He didn't get the memo that the times have changed.
And now he's not getting the memo that the war is already lost.
We'll see a lot of tragic things happen because of that.
Again, everything you say is spot on.
But I don't see any indication that Putin is making decisions going off of the same perception of reality.
In short, Putin is trying to make the Holy War happen, and it ain't happening, because the postmodernist apathy of his regime's ideology makes people not care about that, just like they don't care about how much Putin steals.
