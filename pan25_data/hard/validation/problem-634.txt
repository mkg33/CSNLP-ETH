What lives do you think it saves if we end the war now if it rewards Putin for his decision to invade another country?
Question, what if the decision to start this war, Putin decision to start this war was likewise influence by Russia's arms industry?
Stopping this war to appease Putin to not throw as much Russian soldiers into the meatgrinder, and to force the Ukrainian to accept a defeat and loss of parts of their country, will not lead to long term better situation.
I think we should continue to support Ukraine till they made sure that Putin will have gained nothing from this.
I'm not a fan of endless war (btw, this war is only one year which is very very short still).
I'm not a fan of America's weapons industry.
But I'm even less a fan of Russia's (+ North Korea's + Iran's) weapon industry and their entanglement with Russia's leadership.
The only thing that should make Russian leadership desperate is if we launch an offensive into Russia proper, which we are never going to do.
Good point, yeah that’s my preferred too but I think it’s risky to make Russia and their leadership increasingly desperate.
Not to mention the civilian costs in Ukraine, Russia is a long way from stopping.
