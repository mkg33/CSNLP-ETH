As I said, again and again, I agree 100% they should be in jail.

Too bad Jordan didn't want it back or the Palestinians did not accept peace and sovereignty that was offered then.

As far as all Palestinian leaders, and many of their people, the occupation will end when all Jews will be "Annihilated" (Real quote).
It is literally written as the first thing in the Hamas covenant.
