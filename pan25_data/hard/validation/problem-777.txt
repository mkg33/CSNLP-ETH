The intermittent nature of wind and solar is a real problem but not one that would stop them from giving a good average power output for the year.
It instead means we still need a large capacity of energy generation with load following, which Europe had with oil and coal.
A good baseline also helps which Europe has in some places with nuclear.
Baseline power does support renewables, if it’s not nuclear it’s more fossil fuels.
You need to generate four times as much energy if you are going to store it, for example as potential energy, then turn it back in to electricity again.
So if you want to generate lots of energy for storage, you would be a fool to go for nuclear rather than renewables, even from a purely economical perspective.
So we need to need to be concentrating on the solutions we have now (renewables, existing reactor designs, SMRs, etc.)
to solve the problems for the next 20-30 years.
Research is going extremely well, and it's basically down to engineering rather than physics problems now as no-one in the industry really doubts that it will be a viable form of energy generation.
But it's still 10-15 years away from even having a viable fusion reactor design, and then a huge amount more from being a dominant source of energy.
Well, yeah, but then again we've never before been a decade away from an actual, real Q10+ fusion reactor, even if it's not intended to be a commercial one, and now we are.
I can't help but feel that we could be looking at fusion power as a more realistic near future option if the whole world was throwing everything they have at it.
However difficult these problems are, if the world wasn't stuck in a status quo of exploitation and war posturing, it would certainly make the job easier.
