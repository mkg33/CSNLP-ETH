Article 4 of the NATO treaty covers the case when a member state feels threatened by another country or a terrorist organization.
The 30 member states then start formal consultations at the request of the threatened member.
The talks look at whether a threat exists and how to counter it, with decisions arrived at unanimously.
Even if it was a Russian missile, it was an accident most likely, and with no ongoing "attack" there will be no use for article 5, article 4 on the other hand....
This is the important piece here and I suspect the result is more equipment for Ukraine and potentially NATO anti-air assets on the polish border, covering a good part of Ukraine as well.
Absolutely, but that’s also conditional of a Russian invasion into NATO territory with movement of troops and equipment.
I think that’s what’s being suggested there.
That’s our line in the sand.
I’m totally onboard with ramping up war support as a response.
Russia lost even more leverage today and now we can send even more weapons to make sure these missile strikes don’t happen again.
Certainly there won’t be no consequences though.
Defense support will just push harder.
Everyone still prefers it only stays at 2 missiles and 2 dead rather than hundreds and thousands.
