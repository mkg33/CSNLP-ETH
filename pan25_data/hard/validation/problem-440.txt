I don't think you understand politics lol... Trump can be made to go away if he becomes a problem and he just made himself a problem.
By him pushing to have so many failures of politicians running in this election - because he's the King maker - it's showed the Republicans that trump is basically a threat to their success at this stage.
They will prop up DeSantis and slowly sweep trump under the bus.
Obviously trump will not go quietly, but his day has come and gone... the future of the republican party is going a different route now.
Regardless of what the voters want or think, the Republicans will rebrand trump as a failure and force feed the voters DeSantis instead, with their army of talking heads... it won't take long and it's already underway.
Just look at people like Lindsay Graham, Mitch McConnell, even doctor Oz (who trump basically put there) plus many others at the top are already distancing themselves from trump.
You will also notice more and more talk about how trump is a problem in the media from the republican side.
Go read what the brainiacs are talking about over at r/conservative , they want to oust Mitch and put in a trump sycophant.
Doubling down on the double down it seems.
