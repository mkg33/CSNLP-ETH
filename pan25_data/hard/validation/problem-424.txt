No, it's not.
But Republicans won't allow paid sick leave, and a rail strike would be disastrous to the nation - thousands of lost jobs at minimum, and very likely people would die due to inability to get food, medicine, or fuel.
Bullshit.
Republicans would never have allowed a bill with paid sick leave to pass.
They'd have gleefully watched the nation burn and people starve to death or die without medicine they need or fuel to heat their homes because they could have blamed it on the democrats.
You don't seem to realize how much we depend on rail shipping.
You think the adderall shortage is bad now?
What about when half the nation can't get their shipments.
Or insulin.
What about when feed hay can't get to farms and the livestock all die?
Or if you can't get fuel to drive to work, or even to heat your home?
So the dems passed what they could.
It sucks.
But it's the least terrible of the only paths republicans would have allowed.
Yeah, I know Republicans suck.
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't also recognize how the Dems also fail to do what's right.
Then Republicans would have been voting for hurting the economy/American workers.
Make the Republicans the bad guys that they are.
But instead, Democrats who had all the power here to make it that way failed to stand up for American workers the way they should.
so that’s why the democrats didn’t even bother to push for it at all?
didn’t bother to use their bully pulpit for a second?
just.
“aww shucks, guess we gotta fuck over the workers again”?
