If tonight’s dump looks good for Dems it will be over for Masters and finchem.
If it heavily favors Republicans Lake will win and Kelly/Fontes could still be in trouble.
Tonight’s Maricopa county count will tell us a lot.
It’s expected to be the first set of ballots with the Election Day drop off ballots.
This type of ballot went heavily for Republicans in 2020, but favored Dems in years prior to that.
It could be that the Republicans who don’t trust the election system but still are on the permanent early voting list chose to drop off their ballots on Election Day in greater numbers than Dems.
The whole "Slow-rolling" thing is exacerbated by the whole election denial and the GOP's efforts to suppress the voter turnout.
You could make it so that all votes were tabulated with 12 hours, if they are all recorded and transmitted electronically, it would take a faction of the time.
Mail-in ballots could be counted prior to election day.
But all of that runs counter to what the GOP has engineered.
