But potentially with much longer range -- the Iranian Shahed-136 has a range of 2000 km, for example.
> Ukraine has also raised just over one million US dollars, nearing the goal of $1,250,000, for the "Shahed Hunter system," which is being created to counter Iranian-made Shahed-136 kamikaze drones used by Russia.
Ukraine hopes the anti-drone system will detect and intercept drones and jam their GPS signals.
Supposedly the Iranian drones would be destroyed by "ultra-fast drones" released by the Shahed Hunter.
They just need to invent reusable melee drones to pursue the slow-flying Shahed drones and destroy or jam the propellers.
Drones are very vulnerable to any anti-air fire.
Building them to be reusable drastically increases cost without neccessarily increasing their effectivness.
Meanwhile kamikaze drones can be mass produced at low cost to overhelm and deplete enemy air defenses.
On the flip side, if they become too popular, cheap drone defense will be created, maybe actually using drones to crash into other drones, and the offensive drones will lose all value against well-equipped countries.
On an offensive, if plenty of these drones are over the battlefield, that will make the enemy keep their heads down and not use their weapons.
