They have one of the best equipment militaries in the world.
Especially considering they are a third rate power with a one trick pony economy and run by a petulant little tyrant.
But all that equipment doesnâ€™t mean much when your soldiers are shitty.
Pretty sure toe to toe Iran would stomp Saudi Arabia and the Saudi leadership knows it.
Everyone always talks about what Iran and Saudi can do like we don't have any cards here.
We have a hell of a lot of cards that we simply don't and shouldn't play.
But they are there.
And we should perhaps remind our friends in a privet conversation that they are our friends and we expect our friends to do things for us when we ask much like they expect us to do things for them when they ask.
There is a hell of a lot of space in between pretending nothing happened and moving troupes to their defense like a lap dog at the first sign of trouble.
And walking away from an agreement and doing nothing while Iran invades Saudi.
While you are not wrong in your point, it misses the reason why the US cares about defending Saudi Arabia.
Does Saudi Arabia, a place which is very rich and works with a lot of other countries, not have the means to defend themselves?
That being said the Saudi government was just trying to make more money because they are greedy, but they are not actually on Russia's side.
