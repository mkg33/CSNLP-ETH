They're throwing the 'child-murdering' bit in there for more global appeal (hypocritical to say the least given their fondness for shooting children during the protests), but really they just want it destroyed because they hate Jews.
Fada also urged the destruction of the Jewish state, calling it "the child-murdering regime [of] Israel.
".
um.
thats what you chose to comment in this thread about an insane threat from iran?
geeee.
do you have a biased take on the conflict in israel maybe?
you cant criticize israel without it being labeled “antisemitism!”: 25%ish of the world is muslims.
the grand mufti met with hitler to help him out before israel was ever founded... jews face more hate crimes per capita than anyone else in the usa.
the UNHRC condemns israel about as much as all other countries combined (46%).
it IS mostly anti semitism.
to shit sooo much on the one jewish country for defending itself against hamas who makes no distinctions between jews and israelis in its founding charter as stated above.
furthermore.
it is an offensive.
stupid.
strawman.
trope.
that i cant tell the difference.
as a jew.
when it is anti israel vs anti semitism.
war crimes/genocide/open air prison/ethnic cleansing: israel has nukes.
hamas has random unguided rockets and digging tunnels to kidnap people.
any other country on EARTH would have glassed all of gaza by now as it sends rockets into israel’s border (a tiny country) on a regular basis, basically asking for it.
instead, israel invented iron dome and pays more than 100k per rocket hamas sends.
hamas uses children as human shields which sounds made up… and uses hospitals etc to store its munitions as clowns like you… do their PR job for them simply because the palestinians therefor have a higher death count.
more germans died in wwii than americans but that doesnt make them the “victims.” the population of palestinians has multiplied several times over since 1949. hamas has in its founding charter the desire to kill all JEWS which brings me to my next point….
“why cant we (the usa) stop propping up israel with 3 billion a year!”: this is less than 1% of israel’s gdp, hardly “propping them up.” they are forced to spend it on US weapons.
in exchange, israel made peace with egypt while giving up the sinai peninsula won in a defensive war (that they just found oil and planted trees in…), israel stopped developing the fastest airplane in the world, israel shared iron dome and other technology with the USA, israel constantly does surveillance for the USA, is a good democratic ally and frankly scapegoat and it provides leverage.
israel has free speech… in response to charlie hebdo some muslims made a cartoon mocking the holocaust… oh no… in response to that, israel hosted its own holocaust comic competition.
