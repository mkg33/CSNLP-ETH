This is the stupidity of the GOP and its fascist reasoning.
They don't even stop to think whether the statement makes any logical sense or has empirical support, just so long as it supports their position somehow and is attributable to a "trusted" source (no matter if trustworthy or even correctly attributed) it is now doctrine that must be taken on faith for fear of excommunication.
Also, the same logic would turn senseless murderers and rapists into moral paragons, as they make enemies of every victims family.
Also, WWII basically proves the whole sentence wrong, something a gay man (the congressman) should understand because Nazis picked enemies for reasons unrelated to principle at all.
So dumb!
This is the thing with these fucking idiots.
They think that is calling then fucking idiots puts them " over the target".
In their view being "persecuted" proves that they are right it's proof that they are right.
It's a dumb way to live because you learn the most from people who tell you your a fucking idiot.
