Russia had more nukes than the US even after the Cold War, even if only 5% are still functional they could fire like 200-300 nukes at the west.
Doesn’t mean I don’t think they’re bluffing about using them but they definitely still have functioning nukes.
Look I don't understand what value there is in underestimating the danger of nuclear war.
Clearly you could never have been a DOD employee.
As you have completely errored in stating that a one megaton blast is only five times larger than a 15 to 20 kiloton blast.
It's not.
It's 50 times larger.
The latest generation of Russian missiles can carry 10 independently targeted devices and their next upgrade is going to increase that to about 15.
The United States is catching up in the development of hypersonic missiles and will be caught up or ahead of Russia within a few years.
In the meantime this gives the Russians a slight advantage in the destruction of civilization.
The threat of destroying humanity is growing old.
I actually do understand.
I closely follow the development of the arms race including directed energy weapons.
There is no value in underestimating the ability of Russia to engage in a cataclysmic nuclear confrontation.
Although I am an American, I speak Russian, have advanced degree in comparative politics specializing in Russia from one of the top universities in the world, and read everything I can regarding the foreign policy of Russia.
If you think Russia is incapable, because of incompetence, of putting a massive hurt on the United States and the rest of the world you are simply wrong.
