In one way of looking at it, he's using Ukraine and the west to eliminate his own potential enemies in the Russian federation, pre-emptively.
He hates the idea of an independent Ukraine, and one that is more prosperous and democratic than Russia.
As he sees Ukrainians as 'lesser Russians'; having an example of thriving life and freedoms on his doorstep is dangerous for him domestically.
But Some have said he doesn't care or doesn't hate Ukrainians.
This is somewhat true but mostly false.
As Kyiv is seen historically for him as the birth of Russia, having it not be Russian is also an issue.
The old glory of the Russian Empire is where he is going with this.
Ukraine has to be first because it is the breadbasket of the region.
It is the most arable of the Russian regions and needs to be held to pay for the rest.
It's not that he dislikes Ukrainians.
A number of years ago he did a wrap up study of how the Russian Empire came to be.
To the extent that they approached British historian Simon Seabag Montefiore and asked how history unfolded.
That guy is somewhat an expert on Russian history.
This also plays into the whole 'superior Russian people' narrative that he believes or uses.
'Russians are a superior, tough people'.
