I also found that induction has issues with pans that arenâ€™t perfectly flat.
I also missed the ability to pick up a pan/pot briefly to regulate temperature - as soon as the pot is lifted off induction, all heat stops.
The biggest thing I like about gas stoves is the durability of the surface - you never are worried about damaging or cracking it.
Induction uses a glass surface and has complex electronics underneath.
I never have to worry about my gas stove breaking.
Venting the stove outside isn't common where I'm at.
Most people don't realize that the fan above the stove (commonly below the microwave) recirculates instead of vents.
The cooling fan in the countertop units is noticeable, (and full-size stoves vary a lot on that score) but I don't think it's a big deal when compared with the huge amount of noise that an effective vent hood makes.
I don't think I've seen the spatter thing; you notice it more with a countertop unit I think simply because you end up using it places without a backsplash that a proper stove has.
