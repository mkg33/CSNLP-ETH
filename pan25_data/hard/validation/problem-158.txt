They aren’t tho.
It’s not like the government asks the people where the budget should go.
Corruption leads to money flowing places that the people have little control over.
But it not like they all hate each other.
It’s government policy.
I’m no expert on the situation but to me it seems that for both sides conflict keeps them in power.
On the Israeli side you have the far-right nationalists who feed on fear and on the other you have basically the same thing but with a bit of extremist Islam mixed in there.
You are just a race baiting piece of shit trying to throw hate towards Palestinians with a biased and most likely false news article.
Go educate yourself on the situation instead of posting biased articles literally made by the aggression group with 100x the power of the Palestinians.
the Israeli newspapers have no problem bashing the Israeli government, powerful Israelis, etc due to free press, meanwhile if the truth is made public in Palestinian publications, its off to the gallows for you.
