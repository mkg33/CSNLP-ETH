Only idiots need a reminder not to travel to Russia when practically the entire news cycle has been dominated by Russia’s invasion.
And up until a few months ago it was all about Brittany Griner.
Even if you don’t watch the news you would have to be intentionally ignoring every source of media to not be aware of what has been going on for over a year.
And that’s unfortunate if people have family in Russia, but if you choose to go back there, you can’t say there haven’t been countless warnings for American citizens who travel to Russia.
You're seriously asking what's the danger if you're an American currently in Russia, or you're running a business in Russia that caters to Americans?
Or, are you being sarcastic?
Yeah, y'know, I think I'd rather take my chances trying to be safe in Chicago than being a really conspicuous target for Putin (via any number of people acting on his behalf) to have arrested on bogus charges for no other reason than in retaliation against the U.S. for its support of Ukraine in its defense against the Russian invasion.
I mean, are you really suggesting that the U.S. Embassy advisory is unfounded and without merit?
You also have to ask if those expats, who are American, support the U.S. stance on Ukraine or Russia's so-called "De-Nazification Special Military Operation", or are in general support Putin, because, startlingly enough, there are some Americans who are in the latter category.
Those people, who openly side with Russia, are probably safe, and I'm betting that nearly all of those Americans who are openly in support of America's position have either already left or are quickly making plans to do so.
