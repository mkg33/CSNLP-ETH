It's actually more complicated than that.
From a theological perspective, sin is like poison to the soul.
It makes you worse.
I'm not saying that being gay is a sin, or that it makes you a worse person, by the way.
I'm just trying to talk about how it's a bit more complicated than "sin is a crime against God".
Sin= a crime against God.
Especially if it's on purpose.
In worldly terms, a person shouldn't be shunned, thrown in jail, ect for being gay, but to God, you're technically disappointing Him with continuous sin.
So by saying it's a sin but not a crime, he isn't really saying anything specific against gay people, since sin is nothing to be ashamed of in the catholic faith, because everybody sins.
Basically, every human commits sin on a daily basis and so you shouldn't hate someone because they sin differently than you.
Keep in mind that the bible says we're ALL sinners and that homosexuality is a sin no worse than any other.
Thinking about sex with someone who isn't your wife is a sin.
So in other words, every married man ever has sinned.
Like if you cheat on your wife, that's a sin.
If you lust after another person's wife, that's also a sin.
Both of those things warp your relationships and make you a little bit less of a good person.
They're habit forming.
