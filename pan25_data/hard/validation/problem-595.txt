When you lose your elite fighting troops in such a rapid and short time and replace it with inexperienced consripts and far less armaments, is it still the same tank army?
"I can see the parts falling off the tank as it drives and the crew barely knows half the systems, it's obviously not up to standard.
".
i.e.
The Russians are still dangerous as there are a lot of them, but they get less dangerous everyday, and the Ukrainians get more dangerous.
And the balance of casulaties is VERY much in Ukraine's favor.
Therefore comitting troops for the Ukrainians doesn't deteriorate the rest of society, or degrade the material component of their war machine.
What does this mean?
It means that the material to continue to fight in Ukraine must be produced in Russia by Russians.
So, every Russian that fights in Ukraine is one more Russian who isn't help to maintain the Russian war machine.
If Ukraine can field proper combined arms maneuvers with Western tanks and IFVs, we're talking about an incredible advantage, where Russia's manpower advantage counts for little.
The Ukrainian advantage in armorer vehicles will be pronounced as long as they can prevent the Russians from doing to their tanks what Ukrainian anti-tank teams did to the Russians.
Ukraine's new tanks are far more vulnerable to artillery and anti-tank missile teams than they are going to be to what's left of the Russian inventory in Ukraine.
And the Russians clearly know this, based on their language and posturing since these deals for Leopards and M1s were announced.
