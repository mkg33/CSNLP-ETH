Remedy for a lot of police misconduct almost isn’t juice worth the squeeze, as it were.
See, for example, remedy for 4th or 6th Am.
violations is often just exclusion of evidence- no punishment/hefty deterrent to police.

Interdependence of police and prosecutors.
Have, in the course of my own work, seen in Internal Affairs and DA materials that efforts by line prosecutors to combat police corruption get sidelined and swept under the rug by higher-ups in order to keep peace between the two interdependent agencies and prevent discredit.

Highly overpowered & funded police unions that stifle, and “paper” to death, many efforts to seek accountability.
I believe that strong unions and oversight are the best tools to curb the worst tendencies of capitalism, but police unions are a good example of what happens when a union becomes too powerful.
No union should be able to hold entire cities hostage because the people voted to begin oversight of their operations.
Especially when it's government work that's being overseen.
