It's more than that.
In the beginning, the constitution only applied to the federal government.
States could violate your rights any way the wanted.
Does this sound scary?
If one case is overturned in just the right way, we go back to each state doing their own thing, regardless of constitutional rights.
Once again, your argument has been explicitly addressed and rejected, by the very Court you claim would never give up power.
Sorry, you're just wrong.
The general form of Article III is there must be a Supreme Court, optional lower courts, here are the areas the courts have jurisdiction over, this subset is original jurisdiction for the Supreme Court, and everything else is appellate jurisdiction unless Congress takes it away.
It goes on to say that for all other areas (from clause 1), the Supreme Court has only appellate jurisdiction, but allows for Congress to make exceptions to that, meaning Congress can take away the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction for anything.
The only areas where the Supreme Court has mandatory jurisdiction, that Congress can't take away, are areas where the Constitution gives it original jurisdiction, which are explicitly enumerated in clause 2:
Clause 2 specifies over which areas the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction (meaning, it serves as the trial court, as opposed to as an appellate court, reviewing another court's decision):
That being the case, there's no reason to think that, if Congress opts to constitute lower courts, that it magically loses a power it would have had had it not exercised that option, given there's nothing creating that arrangement (eg, "but, should Congress choose to create lower courts, then the Supreme Court may not be denied appellate jurisdiction over such courts").
There is no contingent clause, so the power exists regardless of the existence of any lower courts.
The drafters knew how to address such a situation, had they wanted to.
If you don't like it, take it up with them.
Or advocate for an amendment constraining Congress in the way you think it should be constrained.
Consider that Congress is not obligated to create any lower courts.
There could be only a single federal court, the Supreme Court, with no lower courts at all.
Had Congress opted to do this, there would be no issue with denying the Supreme Court jurisdiction over any matter where it does not have original jurisdiction.
1) The judicial power of the United States is vested into SCOTUS non-negotiably, and then into other INFERIOR courts if Congress feels like it.
INFERIOR.
What does that word mean?
Think about it.
You're saying that an INFERIOR court can gain EQUAL OR SUPERIOR say over SCOTUS?
Really?
That doesn't make you pause for a second?
