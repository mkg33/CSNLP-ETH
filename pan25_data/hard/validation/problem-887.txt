It's a flag operation, but it's a false flag operation since they're signaling that it's the Ukraine's false flag operation, which it isn't.
So, by saying there will be a false flag, it makes sense to Russians - of course those fascists would do that, anything to undermine Russia.
And then when Russia kills more innocent people, the population is already primed to believe what they’re being told.
It’s for domestic audiences.
In Russia, Ukraine is overrun by gay NATO nazis that gleefully slaughter innocent Russian-speakers, and Putin, in his infinite wisdom, has reluctantly but heroically committed forces to stop this barbarism from happening.
And that operation has been successful, but the West seeks to undermine that and plots to use brainwashed Ukrainians in order to defeat Russia, so now they need to defend the motherland against NATO troops, who are secretly in Ukraine calling all the shots.
Translation: Translation: Ukraine is about to launch a large scale attack to spearhead their next offensive and Russia can claim it's simply a "false flag" attack while their propagandists try to justify losing more occupied territory after months of failing to advance.
BREAKING NEWS: Ukraine has been fighting itself this whole time in false flag operation, Russia has no involvement and recognizes the independent nation of Ukraine.
