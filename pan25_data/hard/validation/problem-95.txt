I know it's not good politics once I came to my senses, but my gut reaction to flipping Manchin was, "Good, you can have that coal munching wolf dressed in sheep's clothing.
".
Sure.
But a WVA Republican wouldn't have even voted for that.
What I don't get is how people can't see how we are lucky to have a Democrat , even one as shitty as Manchin - in a state Trump wins by 40 points.
He's the only Dem who has any chance of holding that seat.
It would be ideal if Arizona replaced her with a real Democrat.
Hopefully 2024 is a good cycle for Dems and Az is clearly trending blue.
But I'm worried she gets replaced by an actual Republican.
Some of y'all don't get how much worse an actual Republican is over Sinema and Manchin.
At least they vote for Dem judges and Dem leadership and give votes on some important legislation.
A Republican gives you nothing.
Hate Manchin all you like, he's many times better than whatever crazy asshole Republican WV would replace him with.
Manchin votes for Biden's judges.
He votes for Schumer as leader.
He voted for Build Back Better.
Of course all of these good points about Manchin are exactly what makes him vulnerable in deep red WV.
Hopefully he can hold on.
