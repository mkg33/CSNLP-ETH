I work for the government and I wish more people did complain about what we can investigate.
We get a decent amount of complaints but I'm sure there's more that can be said.
We can't investigate and cite for things people don't report.
The reporting is easy, super easy even.
It's the investigation and out come that might not go your way.
I won't claim to know how good the DoL (or state DoL) is but reporting is typically pretty easy.
I suspect when it comes to reporting stolen tips or other lost wages people just assume the government is totally incompetent and won't do anything so they don't bother reporting.
Employers stealing tips is illegal but it happens everywhere because the money is stolen from by people who either don't know about it or can't afford to do anything about it.
Posting a listing offering $25/hr and then only hiring people for $18/hr may be illegal - but there is no way a bunch of hourly workers could afford to sue the company anyways.
The companies most likely to take advantage of things like this are not good companies that can retain people - it is slimier companies who don't mind scamming their own, lower-end, employees.
