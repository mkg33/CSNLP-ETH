The other commenter provided a really good link, but about some shockingly racist and awful things Fuentes has said.
He is closer to being a nazi than most people given a platform these days.
Both these dudes are nazis.
Thereâ€™s even a photo of Milo in a nazi uniform floating around the internet.
Antisemitism is such a fundamental form of bigotry, such a binding force of hatred itâ€™s allowing all three of these dudes whoâ€™s bigotry is directly aimed at one another to put all that aside so they might indoctrinate more Americans into their antisemitism.
They see an opportunity for coalition and any red blooded American who gives a damn about democracy and what the Statue of Liberty represents should loudly shout them down at any and every opportunity.
The fascists are getting organized and anyone who loves this country should hurry up and do the same to counter them.
Kanye is working with Nick Fuentes, a streamer who hates Jews, believes interracial relationships are beastiality, and homosexuality is a punishable sin, and Milo Yiannopoulis, a gay, Jewish altright Internet personality that hates Jews and believes gay folk shouldnâ€™t be allowed to marry and who also advocate for homosexual pedophilia.
Heâ€™s also racist.
Itâ€™s like the Chapelle skit where the blind black man doesnâ€™t know heâ€™s black and heâ€™s racist towards black people.
Excerpt Kanye Is just an actual racist asshole.
All this tells me is that Kanye is likely a racist.
Dude is literally a Chappelle skit.
This is a man who has a mental illness and often goes off the meds.
Being given this platform only exacerbates it.
They didnâ€™t need to knock on my door.
4 agents popped out of nowhere and detained me ðŸ¤£ Iâ€™m sure the snipers around the buildings had me on scope as well.
I miss those days, those USSS Agents were good guys, professional as fuck and total class acts.
