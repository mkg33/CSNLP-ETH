Trump will make several disparaging comments about her.
Some will be sexiest.
Some will be right out racist about her background and culture.
Your comment about minorities I think is off too.
Despite the popular narrative about minorities mostly voting for democrats, many of our minority communities are very socially conservative.
Give them a socially conservative Indian woman on the side of the GOP, without any of the hate and anti-immigrant propaganda that we saw from Trump and I think she takes off a lot of those votes from the democrats as well.
This isn't one of the major voting blocks, but after losing some women this will be more votes that Biden or Harris cannot afford to lose.
In recent years white centrist women has become a must win demographic for Democrats.
If the Ds don't get that voting block they don't win.
Hailey is charismatic, educated, experienced, people will feel good about voting for the first woman president and first Indian/Asian president.
She brings a whole lot of what Hillary brought, with fewer negatives, and the identity obsessed left is going to have a very hard time attacking her because they'll worry about the optics.
She'd peel away enough women to make a difference.
I appreciate the thoughtful and respectful way you disagreed.
I'll elaborate a bit.
The battle for the white house is won in the middle.
The wings of each party is only about getting them out to vote, but we've seen record turnouts in recent elections, so there is not a lot of indication that GOTV is really a problem for either side.
I don’t think she’ll get the nomination, but if she did there is no chance that Biden or Harris can beat her.
She’d peal off women from Biden, along with a whole lot of minority votes.
Harris rubs all but the hardest left voters the wrong way, I don’t think she can beat any Republican, including Trump.
