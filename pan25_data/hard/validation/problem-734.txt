It's a stupid thing to do, honestly.
Any moderate is going to see the obvious bias of only releasing bad info about one side, and so any revelation from the "twitter files" is going to be tainted and ignored.
But, the goal was to have the Twitter files articles provide quotes for right-wing media to amplify to a base that would never read the evidence or possibly even the original article.
I guess from what I’ve seen, this is nothing and I feel like we’re following Republicans down this rabbit hole that in the end will show that Twitter moderated content and may or may not have considered, among other factors, whether the government thought the content was factual or not.
Or just recognize that Twitter was having to make some difficult content control decisions and were getting feedback from the government and sometimes did what the government asked while they sometimes did not.
That's the whole thing.
It's not a scandal.
There are no "both sides" to cover.
Maintaining a major social media platform is complicated.
The end.
