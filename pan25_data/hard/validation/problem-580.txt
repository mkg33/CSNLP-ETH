Germany should be heavily thinking about forcing their defense companies to return manufacturing back to Germany proper so this issue with Switzerland blocking export of Germany’s own ammunition doesn’t happen again with something else.
But the Swiss' government's refusal to approve ammo for re-export to Switzerland is a nightmare scenario for their arms-industry.
Switzerland refusing to send countries ammo needed to protect themselves means losing foreign contracts, which means defense contractors have to downscale, which means Switzerlands defensability can be no longer guaranteed, which means their concept of armed Neutrality is at risk.
Their argument is: Switzerland is a defensible Democracy based on armed neutrality.
This armed neutrality needs a defense industry to function.
This defense industry needs foreign contractors to be wealthy and productive enough to produce the arms needed to protect the country.
Which is why Swiss defense contractors are HEAVILY lobbying the government to open the market and allow exports.
