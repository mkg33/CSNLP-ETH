It's funny when people compare him to Manning and Snowden.
Right after he said he would release leaks from the Russian federal government, he wound up on RT, the state run Russian news program.
And that’s not even counting all the info Wikileaks was sent about Russia’s bad actions they never printed.
Or that Assange got paid to be on Russian State TV.
It’s wild how little this is mentioned by the media.
Snowden was a legit whistleblower, but if you actually do any digging into how he ended up in Russia, it’s clear Assange was given orders to get him there.
After the U.S. intelligence community publicly announced its assessment that Russia was behind the hacking operation, Assange continued to deny that the Clinton materials released by WikiLeaks had come from Russian hacking.
According to media reports, Assange told a U.S. congressman that the DNC hack was an “inside job,” and purported to have “physical proof” that Russians did not give materials to Assange.182.

Assange is a Russian stooge who directly interfered with the US elections when he chose to release only the DNCs emails and not the RNC.
This man has everything that is coming to him and he deserves it despite how many reddit tankies tell you otherwise.
