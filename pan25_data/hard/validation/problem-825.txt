A little off topic, but it always rubbed me the wrong way when Sen.Tim Scott would give a speech, and he would talk about how he failed a bunch of classes in HS (he mentions Civics class specifically), and then he would say his family went "from cotton to Congress.
".
He said it more than once.
Hearing it made me feel really uncomfortable, like he was being made to portray a certain stereotype of black people for GOP constituents.
Like if I said something like "Wow, Tim Scott went from cotton to Congress" people would think I'm a racist, but he was just out there saying this about himself.
It sort of proves how racist the GOP is, in their mind Walker is a stereotypical black man, good at sports and terrible otherwise.
In the GOP mind Walker is what they think all black man are.
But Walker is a grown-ass man.
He is a willing participant in his own life.
He's allowing himself to be used.
He's ignoring all the people in his life who love him, who doubtlessly advised him against doing what he's doing.
I understand why the author is so upset that Walker is obviously being used by people who don't care about him to advance an agenda that is utterly hostile to black Americans.
Nominating Walker to compete against Warnock was cynical, irresponsible, and dickish, and speaks volumes about how little the GOP thinks of black Georgians' intelligence.
republicans dont see Warnock as a man of intelligence, character, or accomplishment.
They see him as a black man and believe he is equal to Herschel Walker.
It is an incredible insult.
