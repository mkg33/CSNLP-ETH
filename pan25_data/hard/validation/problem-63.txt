Democrats lost the house in the midterms, Dems overturned a few Republican seats, Republicans overturned some Dems.
A record number of people went to the last election and voted in a lot of Democrats while overturning seats that had always been Republican.
That was possibly because the Republicans have backed insane policies like anti-abortion and shown support to shooters and white supremacists.
The language some of the crazier Republicans and Republican supporters have been insane.
That made the news quite frequently and definitely brought bad attention to the party.
There's also the issue of Trump.
He's still dividing the party and a majority of supporters won't leave him no matter what.
It's cultish and some people think Trump equals the Republican party when he only represents the fanatics.
He's been vocal and forceful about being the next elections Republican Presidential candidate.
People within the Republican party are cutting him off because he's insane and possibly career suicide.
Trump was a beneficial idiot when he was president.
Now that there's no value in maintaining a relationship with him and he's seen as crazy- all that he has to offer is him being just a crazy delusional man that would only be in some joke in onion article if the world was a good place.
