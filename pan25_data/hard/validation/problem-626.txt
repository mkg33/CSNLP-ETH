Anyone who says he has lost his marbles needs to just rewatch that masterclass.
He took their schoolyard jackassery and owned them.
Iâ€™m honestly not sure how Repubs move on from that.
Agree completely with the first part.
I don't want it privatized either.
I want it gone.
You seem to have misunderstood my point, so here is an example.
My grandmother is very wealthy and receives a bit more per month from social security than my grandmother-in-law who is and has always been dirt poor (I did a budget for both).
How is this in any way fair if it's supposed to help the poor?
Why not, instead of letting poor people be taxed out of what little they make, let them invest the same amount instead?
Point 1: Living "paycheck to paycheck" means that you spend all your money before you get paid again.
Many, if not most, Americans live this way.
My point is that right now, they pay SS.
That means that, since they aren't dead, they can afford to save 12.4 percent of their gross income if social security was abolished.
No.. the GOP is not sunsetting medicare or social security.
One bill was proposed to renew these every 5 years but not do away with them.
It was struck down by the rest of the GOP before it hit the floor.
