This makes sense if you live in Washinon.
If you populate the real world, Sinema has a 0% chance of reelection whether the Democrats run a candidate or not.
She's so incredibly unpopular, she cannot win, even heads-up against whatever fucking lunatic the Arizona GOP selects.
Sheâ€™s so unpopular in Arizona that even if the Dems rolled over and let her run unchallenged from the left, any Republican candidate would still win.
She represents as a Republican more than as a Dem so any moderate Republican should be split between her and the Republican candidate.
If he thinks she'd be some kind of spoiler candidate, siphoning votes off from the Democrat OR Republican, then he must be imagining someone who would see three options and think Sinema was the best choice.
The "dilemma" he's referring to is the notion that Democrats might be better off not running a candidate and supporting "Independent" Sinema as the best chance of holding onto the seat.
My point/belief is that Sinema cannot win reelection whether she runs as a Democrat, Independent or second-coming of Jesus...
So, the Democrats should make their decisions from that mindset, rather than one in which Sinema is very popular and Dems would be better off not running a candidate and having her return as an independent.
The only real question is whether Sinema will run as an independent and spoil the election for the Dems.
I may be wrong, but I'm staking my political fortune on the reality that Sinema cannot win any version of this election.
People who believe she has a chance to win and the Democrats have a dilemma here are delusional... Or Republicans rooting for drama.
