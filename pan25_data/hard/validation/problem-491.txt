> Article 5 of the NATO Treaty states that: "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.
".
True.
Though I mean at this point in history, well over half the members of NATO don't actually need any protection from anyone anymore.
The Berlin Wall is gone, the Russian forces have pulled back one or two thousand miles east.
The Baltic states have a reasonable fear of Russian aggression.
But I don't really think Italy or Spain do.
So loss of prestige is really all that keeps Italy or Spain from reneging on their obligations to NATO.
I mean they're not forced to do anything.
No collective defense agreement between sovereign nations can really be truly binding.
When push comes to shove, one country could just refuse to do their obligations.
And there's not really anything the other countries can do besides denounce them for their disloyalty.
There's no supranational government that can punish a country for going back on its treaty obligations.
