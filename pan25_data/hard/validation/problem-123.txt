Berlin's NYE fireworks have been totally shut down since covid started, so this is the first year that it's 'back on'.
So there's millions of people who want to go crazy again.
And when I say crazy, I mean it.
NYE 12:00-12:30 in many parts of Berlin feels like, literally, every other man, woman, and child, and baby of the city has stashed $1000 worth of fireworks and is drunkenly lighting them up directly in front of their apartments, on their balconies, and roofs.
Your windows get pelted with fireworks, and many streets are impossible to pass without getting hit.
The smoke is hard to see through, and from a roof, it looks like a small town's july 4--except in every direction and as far as the eyes can see.
But I didn't see anywhere in the article that houses dozens of houses were burnt down and firefighters couldn't save the homes.
Fire in a garbage can that can't be put out because of crazed firework junkies?
Burning car (an oddly European pastime) amidst a concrete jungle that isn't accessible?
Likely.
This is a country where the far right thinks Putin is someone they should help take over Ukraine, and the far left thinks that America has occupied their country since ww2.
And most of them don't have any guns.
So they purge it out with fireworks on NYE in Berlin.
Shooting off fireworks in cities during New Years is a thing in Germany.
I saw some kids shoot some at police in Frankfurt years back.
It's viewed as a mostly harmless prank, especially when the targets have adequate protection to prevent injury, like firefighters.
I could see this kind of ambush being just an escalation of that sort of behavior.
