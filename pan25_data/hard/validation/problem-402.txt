It's not enough to just call out the nazis.
We need to actively ruin their lives.
Boycott them, ostracize them, fire them from their jobs, and be rude to them.
Do your worst.
They deserve it.
Nah, we don't do witch hunts like Republicans like to do.
We only accuse people of being nazis when they're acting like nazis, the way Republicans are doing these days.
I'm not opposed to that, and I think that's certainly one way to teach people not to be Nazis, at least not openly.
Collectively, a super well-educated population would be a fantastic defense (and offense) against Nazism, racism, and bigotry of all kinds.
That's quite a leap.
I was referring to the people who choose not to be educated out of their Nazism, racism, bigotry, or who are otherwise incapable of being educated out of those views.
It's not unreasonable for those people to be "destroyed" by being ostracized from civil society if they choose to be willfully ignorant.
Every Nazi (budding or full blown) that you can convert into a decent, sensible human being is one more Nazi you've destroyed.
We do the same thing with people who advocate for pedophilia for example - those people should absolutely be destroyed, if not through education then through ostracism, social consequences, or prison if they act on their views.
