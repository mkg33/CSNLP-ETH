I'm an attorney that worked at a White Shoe firm.
Nose candy was everywhere, shamelessly.
I was still a small town kid at heart and perhaps regrettably didn't partake.
It was a bit odd to me at the time, but now I know how common it is.
Fwiw, I didn't work at that firm in the 80's either.
You are spot on and that is what scares me.
I loathe dictators but I also don't want to risk Putin forced into desperation to the point where nuclear escalation starts to seem like a reasonable yolo play.
...as he acts in such an unstable manner-not the invasion either, I'm talking about his fucked up rants and actually being the only idiot on earth besides Kim who directly threatens nukes.
Yeah, I think we can say the reliable evidence points hard toward Putin being a fatally sick man.
He's acting like a dying man would.
People forget that gov agencies are a primary source in these situations.
Though their laws forbid them from exposing their sources and methods.
But when they say with a straight face over and over for a year "this dude has cancer" and everyone thinks he looks like he has at least cancer (or worse, a combination of fatal conditions)...
