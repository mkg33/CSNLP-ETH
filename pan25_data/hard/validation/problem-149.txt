Also its OK to have some debt as a country, what matters is the debt to GDP ratio.
The US is doing just fine.
More balanced budgets will help, removing tax cuts for the wealthy will help, spending less of wars and weapons of war would help.
These are where actual dollars can be recouped.
The irreparable harm is in defaulting on the debts, because when you default you are seen as not good for your own debts, the people holding the debts demand payment.
Many US companies have performed services on behalf of the government and have not been fully paid, those businesses have workers..... no one would then take jobs from the ederal government without upfront direct payment.
You know those interstate highways?
Work stops on many government infrastructure projects.
It all cascades from there.
I'm pretty sure you don't understand much of monetary policy.
The debts are huge, Marijuana is a growing, but insignificant market.
Currently Marijuanna taxes help states partially fund educational and other services, it is not a cash cow that would solve the country's debt.
Marijuana taxation will not provide enough tax revenue to alleviate the national debt limit problems.
It's not a silver bullet, and such a small drop in the bucket as compared to things like defense spending and corporate taxes that it's barely worth mentioning when it comes to the national financial issues we face every day.
Yeah, it's significant for the states it's legal in, but at the federal level it's unfortunately just not that much.
