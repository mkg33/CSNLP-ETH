Except for the fact that "Françafrique" was Cold War era policy that matched the Truman doctrine of containment of communism so French policy in Africa shifted a lot in the past decades.
The reason we've seen a lot of coups in Francophone Africa these past few years is that their corrupt military leaders also figured that the Françafrique doctrine is gone for good and France won't interfere with whatever the fuck they want to do, so they seize power, ask the French counter terrorism forces invited by previous rulers to leave and they just do.
But it's rather odd to argue that there is an equivalency between France's counter-terrorism activities in the Sahel and the various unprovoked French invasions of African nations in the 19th and 20th centuries.
No, that's really not what I said.
All I'm saying is that trying to draw an equivalency between the Russian and French government in 2023 doesn't make any sense.
I'm not under the illusion that France's (or any other Western country's) primary motivations are humanitarian.
France, just like any other nation state, looks out for its own interests.
