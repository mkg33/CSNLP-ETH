I feel like this is an inappropriate response to an FOIA request.
Yes, the FEC is right to withhold the release of any documents that may be material to a criminal inquiry.
Yes, intelligence agencies are right to deny certain sources and documents even exist, if even revealing their existence threatens secret sources.
Yes, any federal law enforcement agency is right to neither confirm or deny a specific investigation even exists, until the proper time.
But those are being conflated together like they are one, and they are not.
A US citizen does not need a US government agency pulling this “cannot confirm the records exist” in response to an FOIA inquiry.
“To the extent that the records you requested concern an ongoing FEC enforcement matter, we can neither confirm nor deny that any such records exist,” the agency’s FOIA attorney wrote in the letter, which was shared with The Daily Beast.
When the Federal Elections Commission rejected a recent Freedom of Information Act request related to Donald Trump’s “recount” expenses after the 2020 election, the campaign watchdog had a conspicuous reason for turning down the petition: Trump’s political spending after he left the White House is currently the subject of an FEC enforcement matter.
The request asked the agency for documents and communications related to a major Trump vendor that has received millions in campaign “recount” funds for seemingly unrelated services—including document production for subpoenas from the congressional COVID subcommittee.
According to agency records obtained by The Daily Beast, the FEC rejected a FOIA request—filed Dec. 20 by a nonpartisan research group that shared the documents on condition of anonymity—because those records may involve an active inquiry.
