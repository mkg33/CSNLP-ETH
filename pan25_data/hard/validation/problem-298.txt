I might agree with this, IF the NRO was part of Space Force.
It is not.
The NRO is the most heavily funded agency in the DoD that is not a military branch.
The cost of the later series of Satellites (Late model KH-11 and the Orion/Mentor Family, as well as MISTY and others) have all been angrily compared to the price of Aircraft Carriers by the Congressional Budget office, and we have dozens of them.
The Director of the NRO reports directly to SECDEF.
Space Force has to go through the Secretary of the Air Force.
That is an incredibly weak position to be in for them.
The fact the Navy and Army programs were not folded into Space Force further weakens and influence they have.
If Space Force genuinely controlled US Defense Assets in Space, I would be fine with this.
But without direct control over the NRO or the NSSL, or even oversight over the GPS program, it doesn't even control a majority of the DoD space assets, let alone cross departmental influence.
It is just a rebranded AF Space Command, that didn't pick up any additional authority in the change.
It didn't even absorb the Army and Navy Space commands.
I do think we needed a Space Force.
I just don't think what we got is it.
I also think we will need a unified Cyber Command at some point (Although it would probably work better as a civilian DoD agency like NRO).
I just feel like Space Force got born half-formed in a rush to get it out the door, and is in no way ready or capable of doing what an independent branch should be able to do.
So we are left with a military branch that exists entirely in someone else's office buildings, as they lack any physical assets to operate anything on their own.
The "own" the X-37B, the only major bit of hardware they have, but they have no launch assets or bases to operate from it.
Instead, Space Force is forced to exist inside the NRO, NASA, and the Air Force, because they can't do anything else.
Because they are still Air Force Space Command, just with (slightly) different uniforms.
And the US Air Force used to be the army.
Doesn’t matter that it is derived from another branch.
He created another branch of the armed forces that is going to expand the scope of their reach.
It’s clear China and Russia are militarizing space and it was an important and necessary step.
He gets credit for being the one that did it.
