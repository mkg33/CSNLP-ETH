It's interesting how many "Canadians" are coming out to say that Trudeau did something wrong while mere moments ago they were complaining that Trudeau was nothing but a Chinese puppet.
I have no issue with Trudeau 'calling out' Xi over his attitudes to other countries and even over his attitudes to groups in his own country, though the latter is kind of hard to pull off (as per 'The mote in god's eye' etc).
There is a comment in this thread suggesting that the exchange between the 2 (Xi's complaint and Trudeau's sanctimonious response) is a media beat-up.
I think this is correct.
However, Trudeau's choice of words were unhelpful and risks Chinese opting to 'punish' a relative weak representative of their 'enemy'.
Recall they have been doing this with Australia for the past 2 years.
However, China is the largest exporter of Carbon dioxide pollution in the world (through its export of manufactured goods and use of concrete in construction).
It has also substantially increased CFC pollution (that damages the ozone layer).
I presume you have looked at clips of the exchange.
My impression of of Xi was that he was "pissed at the leaks", while Trudeau was being a "sanctimonous jerk" in his response.
It seemed like Trudeau was playing to an audience maybe real, maybe in his head.
Certainly not being "diplomatic".
