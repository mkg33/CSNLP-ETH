Reporters for the most part work only with the same rights afforded to all of us.
Basically, their authority is the First Amendment, just like you and me.
This is a lot like excluding certain reporters from news conferences.
It’s a First Amendment violation.
Government doesn’t get to play favorites when it comes to public information.
Now the argument could be made that Tucker Carlson would or should have a hard time establishing any such privilege when he distorts material deliberately for entertainment purposes and admits this in court, so much so that he’s not a news guy trying to inform us, but it would be case by case - satire has it’s place for example, and of course what he does isn’t good enough to be considered satire, but you get the gist.
I wish the media would highlight the fact that Carlson has argued in court that he is an opinion journalist and no reasonable person would believe the things he says, and that he purposely pushed the false narrative of bad election integrity specifically because he knew it was what his viewers wanted to hear, even if it wasn’t the truth.
What confuses the fuck out of me is... Legalistically Fox News and specifically Tucker Carlson's show are "entertainment" and no "reasonable person" would suggest they are factual outlets for "news" related information.
So why is the house speaker allowed to send national security footage to them?
Shouldn't they also have to send it to South Park?
Jon Stewart?
Colbert?
if requested.
