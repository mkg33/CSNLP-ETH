EDIT: I'm not talking about people who've studied Marx, Mao, or Lenin and Soviet governance, and who make complex and coherent arguments for specific modes of economic organization.
I'm talking mostly about people who simply call themselves "socialist" or "communist" or "anticapitalist".
Feel free to point out the limitations in the significance of that kind of self-identification, but I remain convinced that it's a very important thing to pay attention to nonetheless.
More like half the democrats I know.
Probably half a dozen at least are full-blown socialist and several dozen are seriously anticapitalist and lean toward socialism but don't explicitly identify with that group full-stop.
What?
You're not making sense.
You're supposing that to be a "democrat" means to identify solely as a democrat.
Most "democrats" I know are extremely disillusioned with the democratic party, and their identification with it is a very incomplete and approximate thing.
But they still think of themselves as democrats.
Honestly, rank and file democrats seem fine.
They're classist for sure, but they're punching up.
Those who are punching down are Republicans and rich people who pretend to be Democrats to ensure they get invited to the cool parties.
