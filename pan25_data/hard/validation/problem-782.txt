Republicans are banning drag shows, reducing the rights of trans people in different ways, and it will likely get worse.
Why?
Ostensibly in some places to "save the children".
No, really.
Despite trans behavior having nothing at all to do with risks to children.
They're threatened by trans women for two reasons.
One, they're terrified that being attracted to a trans woman somehow makes them gay.
And two, they see it as a man voluntarily giving up his inherently superior social position.
This threatens them because someone giving up something they see as valuable might mean it's not actually that valuable at all.
And if there's no inherent value or superiority in people simply because they were born male, that takes the wind out of a lot of conservative men's sails.
Trans men offend conservatives because they see it as cheating their way out of an inherently inferior social position.
A supposedly subordinate woman can become a man, and thus benefit from the additional power that conservatives believe men should be automatically endowed with.
Since they also don't believe that trans men are real men, it threatens their worldview because it proves that women can perform equally to men.
that's because they don't think of trans men in the same way as they think of trans women.
they generally think trans men are just confused lesbians and often resort to corrective rape when hurting them.
Many of the attacks on trans people are attacks on gender nonconformity as a whole which impacts cis women pretty heavily.
There's way more of them than trans women and the gender nonconforming cis women or tomboys and butch women get swept up in it to.
I've also seen anecdotes from trans women saying they really had no idea how bad harassment issues were for women until they started passing as female.
Bingo!
Being anti trans is essential for the conservative worldview, where men are inherently superior to women because a while ago some lady ate an apple and convinced her husband to also eat an apple.
