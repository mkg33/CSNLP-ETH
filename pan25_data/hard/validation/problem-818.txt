I grew up in it and can confirm.
Non-"Christian" (we called them "secular") schools were looked at only with distrust.
Anything without the label "Christian" was thought to be infiltrated by demons or Satan himself, and "common sense" (uneducated gut feelings) were what we were told to listen to as "God's voice.
".
Yes.
Was going to reply to this person's comment similarly.
I'm sure they're right about what/how they were taught, but many (most?)
people really would be shocked if they knew how different things can be state-to-state.
I grew up in New England, but both my parents grew up in the deep south.
I went to college in the mountain west, and live in California now (where my kid has gone to school).
Many of my friends and coworkers have similarly varied backgrounds.
It's truly astounding how different the educations can be.
It’s also fascinating how different school districts in different regions of the country teach this stuff.
I grew up in northern Indiana.
Moved to Florida for college, moved to Los Angeles for work, and find myself in Atlanta often for work.
What I learned vs what my friends in FL learned vs what my friends in CA learned vs what they learned in GA can be crazy different depending on a specific topic.
This should be another subject where there really should be a national baseline for the basic information.
How in the world can anyone say civics isn’t one of those “areas that are very important for development into functional adulthood”.
I’m 44 and had social studies as a required class from like 4th or 5th grade through high school graduation.
Then in college, some form of civics/US history was a required gen-ed course for my degree.
I don’t have kids.
This is a sobering realization.
