I don't want to go all 'Murican, but after watching Ukraine bring Russia to its knees, I think a "real war" with the west would be very very different than what Russia is having now.
From what I've read, there's a real fear in Washinon that if we do get dragged into a conventional war and slaughter Russia too quickly, the war will go nuclear very quickly as a result.
I was just saying that Russia needs to understand there are very real consequences to using a WMD.
If they think they can use one Ukraine and get away with it they will.
It is the same reason they never sent in peacekeepers and the same reason Germany is hesitant to send Leopard tanks.
The hesitation on tanks from Germany is a good example of how weakness can incite greater attack.
That is one example of NATO telling Russia, “we won’t risk Berlin for Kyiv”.
That's a scary thought, but it helps to remember this is the message Russia wants to convey.
It's clearly in their best interests to stir up public protest in the U.S. to end the war.
That doesn't mean the threat is any less scary, but it's important to keep in mind who is the country escalating tensions this entire time.
If Russia decides things are too scary for them, they can be the ones to back out of the fight they started at \any\ time.
The one consistent thing about Russia is that there's never a semblance to integrity in what they say.
Everything is propaganda, from the Russian bots to the official Kremlin announcements.
When Russia says the U.S. should watch out or else war might start, what they really mean to say is they hope to hinder support of Ukraine by scaring people into the possibility of a world war 3.
The latest propaganda from Russia being propagated through online trolls and far right conservative media in the U.S. is that the U.S. should stop because if it doesn't, a war really would break out between Russia and the U.S. potentially starting world war 3.
