His whole fit on Twitter yesterday was 100% designed to rile up the MAGA base.
Just in time for elections.
The issue is after the election.
Who gets verified on twitter as your senator or representative of after Election Day if the candidate who didn’t actually win claims they did?
Any politician who was relying on Twitter to win them the mid-terms wouldn't be waiting until the week of the election to get verified.
If they stop verifying politicians this close to an election it won’t matter.
If they verified people erroneously it won’t matter.
We are too close for it to matter.
This is just an article which people want to be afraid of.
The same article would’ve been written if Twitter employed 1,000 people to verify and they let go of one person.
My point is there are still people working in that area according to this article.
Maybe 15?
from memory.
Most people will get filtered out quickly.
I’m guessing there wasn’t a very high hurdle to overcome in the first place.
After Trump was out of office every new message was the top story on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, etc.
depending on the outlet it was either here are the lies Trump is spreading or here’s the “truth”.
