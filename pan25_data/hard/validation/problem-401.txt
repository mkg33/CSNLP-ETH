Idk, I personally didn’t hear anything about that, for me that wouldn’t make sense because it’s just a balloon and F-22s need something like 17 man hours of maintenance for every hour of flight or some shit but it’s possible.
If they did then I guess they could’ve used them.
I don’t think so.
I saw one comment saying it was an F22 but honestly those things are so expensive to run it would be a waste.
I would assume they used either an F-16 or F-15 with a kinetic missile.
The F-16 has a celling of 50,000 feet but this balloon was at 65,000 feet so it was pout of range of the F-16s gun.
Same with the F-35.
However, the F-15 has a ceiling of 65,000 feet so in theory it could make the shot.
One well placed gun burst from an F-22 should do it; puncture the balloon enough to make it come down but not enough to make it plumet.
That way they can recover the gondola\ and extract intel from that.
That and they want hard evidence that it is in fact Chinese.
I just hope it doesn't have a self-destruct mechanism.
