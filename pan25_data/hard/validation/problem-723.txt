Yes.
I agree, and I think that’s why we’re starting to see some manufacturing leave China, in favor of less authoritarian governments.
And not just the US.
Covid, and now Ukraine, have made since ppl reevaluate our relationships, and I think that will likely continue.
The truth is that the most affective way to apply pressure is through the checkbook.
Then, what are you talking about?
It’s not hypocritical, at all.
If I didn’t criticize my country, then sure, that’d be hypocritical, But that isn’t the case.

I criticize the fuck out of my, and most, countries’ behavior throughout history.

And, the fact that they don’t give a shit about genocide being waged on Muslims shows just how pathetic of “clerics” they are.
Typical for religious leaders.
