Even if you could put the toothpaste back in the tube in the US.
Nullify the 2nd amendment, round up all the guns.
You're still left with these angry motivated individuals, who would turn to any other available methods: bombs, knives, poisons, cars, planes... whatever.
What laws you gonna pass then?
Before you double down and say civilian gun ownership is at the center of the issue, just look at some countries that outlaw it completely: Cambodia, Myanmar, North Korea, Somalia.
They don't allow citizens to own guns, but are subject to either government genocides, totalitarianism, complete unenforcability, civil wars, or rampant arms blackmarkets.
On the other hand, you have countries like Switzerland where there is about 1 privately owned gun for every 4 people and they haven't had a mass shooting in over 20 years.
So gun ownership or gun control aren't the issue itself.
The Chicago killings are also committed by guns, so that doesn't refute the argument that guns are a threat.
In fact, that highlights the need for more gun control and less indulging the NRA and their paid for GOP puppets.
