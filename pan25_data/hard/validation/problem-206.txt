It'll likely change rectify some of the votes, but probably not enough to flip the election, unfortunately.
A recount flipped a state house election in favor of the Democratic candidate by 1 vote this year.
I went ahead and changed "change" to "rectify" anyway.
Although if someone believes a recount is gonna rig an election, I doubt they'd know what that word means anyway.
I point to situations like this or the 1 vote flip when my friend remarked they hadn't voted this year stating their vote didn't matter.
They thankfully said they planned to vote next time because of the examples provided but damnit i had to bite my tongue not to scold them for not voting this time.
Even if a vote didn't make a win happen this one time, it's still worth it to vote because it shows your fellows that with enough votes, it moves the needle, just a bit, a believable bit, that it in turn inspires others to help push the needle that much farther toward actual change.
Like the scene in a bug's life, one ant can soon become thousands, then hundreds of thousands.
Invigorate and inspire enough people and it can make that wave happen.
