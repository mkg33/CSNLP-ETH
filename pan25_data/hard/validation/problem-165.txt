He's a west Phoenix stalwart with strong and proud Maryvale roots.
Fontes, Mayes are not only new-ish they're Central Corridor folks.
This is a thing.
Not enough to cause a schism in the AZDems but Maryvale still has baggage for genteel & (wannabe) urbane Phoenix/Tucson Dems like we're seeing here.
I truly believe the more centrist folks in the Dem party folks look a little down at him and some of his fellow West Phx elected folks who are almost all all Hispanic.
I mean, some of those centrists are the very same south/west Phoenix Hispanics.
I think a lot better of someone like Anna Tovar, Betty Guardado, Analise Ortiz, or Martin Quezada vs. ex-Rep. Chavez, Sen. Miranda, ex-Rep. Diego Espinoza, or Rep. Lydia Hernandez.
The former haven't done the headscratching stuff the latter have done, like Miranda's outright endorsement of Ducey in 2014, Lydia's endorsement of Michele Regan that year, or Espinoza taking SRP's functional buyout and necessitating a seat-of-our-pants effort to help Diaz run a successful write-in campaign.
Fair, def.
worth noting despite her activity in the CWA Bejarano only got one other union to back her.
I was hoping Bejarano would pull this off given that a decent number of the downballot candidates that endorsed Gallardo herald from the centrist/further-right wing of the party (eg.
Sen. Miranda, the Hernandez siblings, Rep. Longdon, former Commissioner Kennedy) but he and Bejarano aren’t all that different politically – she may be a tick or two left of him, but nothing particularly noteworthy.
