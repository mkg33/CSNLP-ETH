People are missing the larger story here, which is that the economic incentives in our society are so irredeemably fucked up that people sold their stocks when it seemed like the companies might be doing something noble.
Price fixing is a huge issue, and involves a number of bad actors including the pharma companies, pharmacy benefit managers, lobbyists, and the web of non-profit "charities" that give the whole sham political cover.

It is absolutely not in your interests to let the free market decide 100 per cent of everything you do.
