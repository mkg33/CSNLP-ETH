Everything we know about the GOP's ability to fall in line and rally to a cause is based on the discipline among their political leaders.
I don't think the voters necessarily do it on their own -- it's that all of the various big mouths and big heads come together in the end and agree to lead their flocks together, even if they were arguing during the primaries.
Trump does what Trump wants, and he's not going to be asking Republicans to be good and loyal and vote for the party in 2024 if he isn't leading it.
He will not care if it all burns down around him, and there are a core group of his supporters who he will NEVER give his blessing to if it comes to getting behind a Trump competitor in the interest of saving their side overall.
Trump never acts in the interest of the common good -- not even the American conservative concept of the "common good.
".
This.
I am the opposite of a McConnell fan, but it’s a mistake to think that he’s not intelligent and savvy.
Red team dollars for political strategists spend just the same, and they’ve got a lot of business interests with deep pockets.
