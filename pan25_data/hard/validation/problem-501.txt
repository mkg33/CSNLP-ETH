This being said, would it be possible for Russia to claim that Ukraine is not a proper member of the UN itself?
To be honest the big risk with the gambit the Ukrainians are pulling here is it could end the UN.
Russia could just say, “fine, I’m out,” and then they’d form their own.
Their allies would join, and then we’d have two international bodies rivaling for control of the planet.
(It’d probably boil down to BRICS and NATO).
Don’t see how that could end poorly, not at all.
It exists because the big players (and the victors) at the end of World War II, the UK, the USSR and the US did not want to give up their sovereignty when the UN was formed and so they need veto power over whatever the UN General Assembly decides.
They threw France and China in there too, basically for political reasons that didn’t pan out.
Then they added the rotating membership so others could get their turn at the big boy table.
It existed before that was the reality, and among the five permanent members the only two that have the nuclear capability to end the world today are the US and Russia.
In Dec 2022 the perceived reality is that Russia is an aggressor to another UN member state, and in so doing has destabilized the entire planets food and energy supplies.
Of anyone provided even questionable legal reasoning, I believe many member states would consider removal seriously.
Including other security counsel members.
