I mean rejoining Transjordan is probably the best option but the Jordanians hate the Palestinians cause they outnumber them and treated refugees in Jordan like crap.
Jordan is the most stable country of all of Israel's neighbors, and they've put up with a lot of bullshit, and their population is already like 20% refugees from Israel, Syria, & Iraq.
But yeah, I guess they draw the line at Israel potentially doubling their refugee population with a flood of new deported Palestinians.
Also, the refugees are a result of their attacks on Israel in 48 and 67, so it would be ridiculous to draw a red line there.
"We have attacked you twice and lost, stop creating a refugee problem for us"?
Not obsessed, you have to look at the reasons.
The problems holding us back in the present are the results of actions of the past, and it's obligatory to acknowledge that and act accordingly.
What you are saying is like "everyone should be friends with Assad.
So what if he just had a brutal civil war?
It's the past.
It's all fine now".
Never forget to look at the reasons, they are always relevant.
