If the roles were reversed, Trump would promise Desatan a pardon in exchange for him not running as an independent and then renege after it was too late for Desatan to run and try to extract something more.
So Trump will probably expect them to screw him since that’s what he would do.
But he also comes off as fake as hell, and not in the same way as Trump did.
Trump was like a weird "authentic-fake" for a lack of a better phrase.
He seemed genuine when he was bullshitting his voters, DeSantis feels just kinda fake-fake to me.
I'm dubious if DeSantis can mimic them, even though he's trying to.
So my thoughts are that if the 2024 election will have smaller returns for Rs it's because those once first time voters stopped voting because they could feel like DeSantis is establishment.
So if they don't feel like Destantis is legit, then Rs might have a numbers problem not because people leave the party but rather a core niche of the GOP simply stops existing because what they liked about Trump isn't there anymore.
Yep, and as soon as he doesn’t have popularity, all the republicans that have been bending at the knee to Trump will claim they never really supported him.
Or something does come of it, Trump looses what little credibility he has left, and Republicans find someone new to rally behind.
Probably Ron DeSantis.
