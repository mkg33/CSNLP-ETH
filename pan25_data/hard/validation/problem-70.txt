Quote from Duda: "I have spoken with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
This is an extremely difficult situation for Ukraine, emotions are running high and there is an enormous amount of stress.
Over the course of the last couple of days Ukraine has suffered a particularly large-scale Russian missile attack.
Russia has cruelly and ruthlessly launched several hundred missiles on Ukraine," Duda said.
Oh, there’s no way Russia intentionally attacked Poland.
But it’s extremely plausible they overshot or input erroneous coordinates.
The Polish farm that was hit has the exact latitude of Kyiv and exact longitude of Lviv.
It would be perfectly understandable for an undertrained Russian missile operator to accidentally combine the two targets.
'That said, whatever the final conclusions may be, it is clear that the party ultimately responsible for this tragic incident is Russia, which launched a barrage of missiles on Ukraine specifically intended to target civilian infrastructure.
Ukraine had — and has — every right to defend itself.
'.
Yup.
Zelenskyy is watching in horror as Russia murders civilians on a daily basis.
Gotta be a helpless feeling.
