This.
It sucks to war in winter, but it will not hamper movement.
Winter will favor the prepared, in this case, Ukraine (I hope) I dunno why I keep reading about everything ceasing when winter hits.
Ukraine has the initiative right now, and Russia is poorly supplied for winter (oh, the irony).
If they pause, they give Russia time to train and regroup, which is unwise.
Push south down towards Mariupol, and you threaten to cut off Russian supplies to Crimea and the western half of the occupied territories.
At that point, the Russians either defend both and potentially get isolated, or they evac and surrender the area to Ukraine.
It also wouldn't surprise me if they attacked due south from Zaporizhzhia's front lines to bisect the Russian forces and isolate a contingent in Crimea.
The Kerch Strait Bridge is looking awfully vulnerable right now.
Even though the Russian army is a mess, those defensive lines can certainly make it painful for Ukraine.
That’s where I think the real slowdown will come from, unfortunately.
I’d call it an underestimation if not for the fact that their army is a proven mess in the current conflict.
What concerns me is they’ve been fortifying behind the lines with the intent of drawing out the war.
