That's not really relevant.
MOHELA could be fine financially as a result of the debt relief if they cut costs in certain areas, but the state of Missouri could be harmed by those cuts.
The argument Missouri is making is that with MOHELA’s purchase of the loan from the USG it is an asset on MOHELA’s books.
Forgiving that asset without payment to MOHELA is a takings case.
Because the USG sold the debt on their books to get a cash asset.
In selling it the USG agreed to get the total, current principle and interest accrued, but forgoes the total interest payments for the life of the loan.
And because the sale doesn’t include the payer (you in this case) you will still make your payment and either the USG gives the payment to MOHELA or merely changes the direct debit location.
And because the terms of your loan did not change you as a payer do not have a say it who the owner is.
If someone refinances their loan through the company, then yes the debt changes hands.
But that loan would no longer be up for forgiveness.
I’m not against the concept of the loan forgiveness.
The EO was not the legal/constitutional way to do it.
Given the lame duck congress there are about 2 weeks to get a bill passed and signed to make this moot.
If President Biden wants this to hold he need to get the lame duck Congress to pass this relief.
It’s the only sure way to get his way or watch this EO die in court and have the new Congress close it entirely.
