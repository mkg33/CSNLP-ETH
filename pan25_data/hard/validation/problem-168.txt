It's less of a reform, more of an assertion of power from branch of government over the other.
Like if the US Supreme Court ruled that it could tell the President what to do.
Calling that reform is like calling a fist fight facial reconstructive surgery.
Though to actually answer you, what you might actually call it is a collapse of democratic institutions.
Yes, 'the people' have a check on the government, where if half the country rises up the govt has no choice but to collapse.
But ask Iran how that's going.
Ask the Chinese if they have a 'check' on the government.
Direct check?
What direct check?
There is no check by the people beyond causing economic damage.
You are talking about a scenario where the legislative goes rogue.
It's all over if the legislative goes rogue.
They can institute state propaganda, outlaw criticism using loaded language to excuse the censorship, and you'll end up with a situation no different from any other "democracy.
".
Just because the Supreme Court's various rulings are hit or miss does not mean we should get rid of the Supreme Court.
It means we need a constitution.
It doesn't mean we need to effectively abolish the court.
Even as proposed it doesn't abolish the court.
That's a silly take.
It just allows the Knesset to override it by simple majority rather than the more standard super majority.
And the people voting are themselves subject to direct democracy.
Everyone's pearls are fine.
Israel needs a constitutional convention and actually hammer out a sensible set of checks and balances, but democracy isn't on the line because it needs 16.7% less than a super majority to overturn the court.
"This is the death of democracy" is becoming the liberal equivalent of circa 2002 "this is how the terrorists win."
Dial it back.
