There are exceptions to hipaa, most of them involve the need for a court order for a lawful subpoena.
HIPAA prevents this, and requires a subpoena for this purpose.
She's challenging a subpoena from what I understand.
There's no proof that a crime has occurred.
There are allegations that a crime has been committed, which in some cases would allow for the disclosure of records, but in this case, all the claims seem to be 3rd party, and not directly related to the claimants..
But in this case, the burden of proof for probable cause hasn't been met, meaning the allegations and subpoena can be said to not be meritorious.
HIPAA doesn't even apply outside of mainly three different types of entities.
HIPAA most certainly applies to this doctor, who would likely refuse to turn over these records regardless, because the investigation against her hasn't even bothered to show that the case has merit....which is only one key element of her being able to release these records.
This is one of those things that she would be doing regardless of if she has the patient interest in mind, as her insurance company would be quite interested in avoiding any malpractice suit that the patient could bring, and she could easily lose her license if she ignores HIPAA protocols.
HIPAA requires there be reason for this other party to have an interest in these records,, and until those requesting the records can prove their interest, HIPAA prevents her from even being allowed to release these records without the patients(or guardians) consent.
The burden of proof to gain these records goes well beyond normal probable cause.
