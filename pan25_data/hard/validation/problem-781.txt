It’s all well saying NATO would win a conventional war with Russia, but hasn’t literally every military simulation or war game of that scenario ended up in nuclear conflict.
In which case both NATO and Russia get flattened.
There is no such thing as a conventional war between Russia and NATO.
So that discussion is kinda pointless IMO.
UK intelligence reports.
They said recently that Ukraine was taking casualties in the low to mid hundreds per day.
I’d take that as 300.
But they’re obviously not publicising it, so as not to undermine Ukrainian messaging.
We can also apply a bit of logical thinking.
If Ukraine claims to have killed 130,000 Russian soldiers, losing 30,000 of their own would be an optimistic 4:1 ratio.
That’s reasonable given there are defending not attacking, they have some western intelligence backing them up, and they have some extra weapons to help.
However, most of the fighting is still Soviet era stuff on both sides, and most soldier deaths are from old-fashioned artillery.
Still pretty scary.
They’ve reduced entire Ukrainian cities to literally nothing but rubble.
Go check satellite photos.
Whole blocks of apartments, roads and everything else just gone.
What there is right now is a conventional war between Russia and Ukraine, who are helped by their allies.
And in that war, there is no obvious ‘winner’.
One can argue that both sides are actually losing.
I just think it’s a mistake to constantly underestimate Russia.
Reddit has turned it into some sort of joke, but I assure you that Ukrainians aren’t laughing about it as their country is destroyed.
