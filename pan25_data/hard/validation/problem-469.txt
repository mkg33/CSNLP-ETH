my grandfather (bread used to be a quarter) says that he has never seen the prices go down to what they used to be.
People see the number % given and since it is going down think inflation is going down.
The rate might me slowing compared to last year but even if it was a 0% increase, the prices are still the same.
You'd, I guess, need a negative percent to see the prices going down, but that won't happen.
As soon as inflation stops rising, they will lower the interest rates.
Very little Biden has done has anything to do with inflation.
Likewise, all of the Republicans attacking Biden for inflation and saying that they will somehow magically fix it are idiots.
Progressives have terrible ideas when it comes to fixing inflation.
You are correct that most improvement comes from the Fed and not Biden, though.
A lot of inflation is also driven by the housing scarcity, which progressives have bad ideas on as well.
So yes, we have seen the consequences of Progressive policy in the housing market and it's bad.
In California the YIMBY/Pro abundance Liberal agenda that's pushing back against anti-development sentiment is mostly being driven by the center-left and a few progressive allies.
