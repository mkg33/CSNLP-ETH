To everybody not in the know, this is not their biggest country airport, it is one smaller one in Hahn.
I flew there in mid 2010s and I was wondering why it is called Frankfurt-Hahn and not just Hahn airport.
Anyway, I missed my connection flight because Hahn is 100km from Frankfurt.
(There were a few hours between flights, but no, I didn't make it).
Fucking assholes at Ryanair.
I booked flights to eastern Europe in 2005 and the first flight was Ryanair to "Frankfurt (HHN)" or something like that.
I'm thinking, "Frankfurt!"
and not paying attention to airport codes because who the fuck does?
[Answer: people who have been fucked by Ryanair.

Right.
I forgot that rule of international relations where a newly elected government means a country is not responsible at all for anything that happened under the previous administration.
Germany, 2014-2022: "Yes, we are Russia's second largest trading partner.
And, yes, Russia is in the process of invading and annexing Ukraine.
But Here, look, we're giving less than 5% the money we give to Russia to Ukraine We're even now.
What?
Allies telling us to reduce our dependence on Russian energy?
Haha!
No.
That's laughable.
Why would we do that?
".
YES.
This is the first thing I thought of when I got here.
There's either 20 million euros for free or...I was going to say "we find out he's a friendly anti-Putin Russian oligarch and it's all just fine" but I think any friendly anti-Putin Russian oligarchs accidentally fall out of fifth-floor windows after accidentally falling backwards onto a large knife nine times and shooting themselves three times in the back of the head.
