Good point, but in other years, he made a very big deal of announcing his donations every quarter, and that seems to be missing in 2020.
And I suspect someone like Trump isn't like me forgetting to fill it in Turbo Tax, he probably has accountants and assistants taking care of such mundaneness.
Also, the notion that Trump, who regularly brags about being smart for not paying any more taxes than absolutely necessary, wouldn't claim these deductions is hilarious.
Slight contention here, At the bottom of the article you posted, I found a link to which explains that Trump can claim deductions for at least some of these donations.
I have no doubt that trump didn't donate his salary but he allegedly was donating it to different departments of the US government which isn't a charity so it can't be written off.
Before we get too excited, it's possible that Trump's salary was sent directly to HHS instead of first going to Trump and then him making a charitable donation.
Doing it this way would have a tax advantage by helping Trump avoid Alternative Minimum Tax.
