Because you don't have enough real ones, and inert converted NBC ones can still cause some damage since they're still a couple thousand pound kamikaze aircraft.
That is how it went in the sixties for a little bit, when it was easier to make nukes bigger than to make missiles more accurate.
As you mention later, it was less a lack of warheads and more that their best missiles are nuclear missiles.
They wanted some missiles that would hit, but weren't quite crazy enough to actually nuke Ukraine.
So they took the warheads out and used them as kinetic strikes.
Well, put a big enough nuclear warhead on something and it doesn't need to be that accurate.
Of course, if you're going to put a nuke on a missile, you probably want to be sure it hits where you want it to.
Not even because you're worried about misses, but because you don't put a 100 billion dollar warhead on a 100 million dollar missile (numbers pulled out of my ass).
It doesn't matter how many rockets they toss at targets, they won't destroy power plants and substations in worrying numbers away from the frontlines which is what they've been trying to do.
Non-precision weapons are battlefield weapons, not the kind that fly hundreds of miles to attack power plants and substations far behind the front lines.
