Real question if the sick leave is that important and they are willing to strike why not just ignore their demands and refuse to come in if sick, they clearly can't afford to lose them.
If they sincerely support the sick leave provision, it would've been more effective to let workers legally strike than failing to deliver in this way.
Expecting Republicans to act in good faith in 2022 is either extreme incompetence or willful ignorance.
Either one carries some responsibility.
Can anyone clarify why Dems proposed this as separate bills in the first place?
and why they passed the first bill without a guarantee the second would also pass?
Part of their job is to know what they are capable of delivering and what they are not.
In this case, they should've let the workers legally strike and secure the sick-leave Dems failed to deliver.
Once the paid sick leave amendment was voted down, all Democrats should have voted No on the larger bill.
That way, rail workers would still be allowed to strike if they didn't like the deal.
Any Democrat in the Senate that voted to force the deal took power away from the unions.
That power should have remained with the unions and Congress should not have gotten involved unless they were able to pass the paid sick leave amendment.
All union advocates should be disappointed that Democrats (and Republicans) voted to remove power from the workers and give it to the owners.
