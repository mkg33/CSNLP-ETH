Have you ever seen trump try to talk without a prompter?
It's a grab-bag of word-association salad.
Thinking on his feet isn't his strong point, and "stand back" doesn't really have a common meaning - whereas "stand down" does.
It seems more likely to me that the above train of thought was probably what happened there: attempting to remember "stand down" but instead coming out with "Stand back - shit that's not a thing, maybe stand by".
While yes, it was literally a disgusting thing to have said...
I'm not convinced he knew what it meant.
He is, above all, a fucking idiot.
I could easily see his thought process being "hmm, I'm supposed to tell them to stop, what's the command for that?
Stand up?
Stand behind me?
Stand down?
No, down sounds weird, that can't be it.
Stand back?
Yeah, that's good.
Stand back.
Oh, there's another one, maybe by?
Yeah, Stand back and by, it's probably one of those, I'll just say both and be double-sure.
".
Yeah.
If you were a real manly man, then the only people tough enough to have sex with you would be lumberjacks, cowboys, and especially sailors.
A real man would need to cover themselves in seamen to be satisfied.
You go on and enjoy your "woman".
What's she gonna do, dress up real nice in something pink and silky, just like you like it?
She probably smells real pretty too.
