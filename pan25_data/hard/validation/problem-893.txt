This is what tax is like as a moderately wealthy person.
You get a raise or bonus of some number of dollars.
You then divide that number by 2 to get the amount of extra money you actually will get.
I wouldn't mind paying taxes so much if they didn't go to so many things I disagree with spending money on.
If I was wealthy I wouldn't mind paying my fair share of taxes.
It's pretty hefty for the middle class too and I don't complain about it.
I know it's my contribution to having a functional society to live in and scientific/technological progress.
Not really.
All you have to do is start a business.
You can get wealthy by starting an honest business.
The assumption that all rich people are evil is wrong.
By the way this isn't just about taxing the obscenely wealthy, but also the regular wealthy.
Admittedly, there are a number of reasons why maybe taxing accumulated wealth wouldn't be a good thing.
But I've never heard "it's weird" as a reason.
So are you suggesting that we shouldn't tax the wealth accumulation of billionaires because they may need to sell some of their assets to pay their bills, and that would be "weird"?
I have a theory that the type of person who actually wouldnâ€™t mind giving their wealth away are not the type of people that will become millionaires anyways.
Becoming obscenely wealthy requires an individual to have an unscrupulous character in the first place.
