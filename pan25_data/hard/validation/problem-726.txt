Low confidence is just another way of saying they don't want to lose funding or be labeled as racist Trump supporting conspiracy theorists.
the term debunked is used constantly by both sides in the same way.
Rarely is it fully true however.
Almost without exception it gets used as a cop out.
By both sides.
And both sides use the source as their prime reasoning for ignoring data, whether it's from Hannity or Maddow, Alex Jones or Greta Thurnberg.
Truly debunking something is something they don't want to actually address .
Whether it's election fraud, hacked emails, gain of function research, or accusations of fake news.
Obviously you must either be an Alex Jones watcher, or you're just making stuff up, because I certainly have never watched or listened to him.
You clearly know him well it seems?
Don't think so.
Not at all.
It just sounded good so you said it.
It does though.
Translated from the parlance used by intelligence analysts, if an assessment has low confidence in something, it is unlikely that whatever is being assessed will happen.
For example: "We assess with low confidence that the current provisional government of Stanistan will remain stable if the United States stops providing civilian advisors, military support, and financial aid that may currently be integral to its survival," translates to "It's unlikely that the Stanistani government we've been supporting will last long without our continued assistance.
