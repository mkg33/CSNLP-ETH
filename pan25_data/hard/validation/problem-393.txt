Which is really the tragedy here, millions of Russians fleeing abroad not because they find the actions of the Russian state reprehensible, but because they feel they should not be the ones to to die for the cause of Russian imperialism.
Just keep sending weapons to Ukraine, if these Russians choose to stay and participate in killing Ukrainians instead of attempting to leave then they deserve death at the hands of the Ukrainians.
I wonder how they will be paying for this doubling of the Russian soldiers, and what armaments they plan to produce along side them when they can't even keep up with losses in Ukraine.
The West's strategy is to draw the Russian forces into a protracted conflict with high losses in order to force Russia to go to extreme measures like this to weaken Putin's domestic support.
The West has no problem supplying Ukraine with ammo and armaments, we can build it faster than we give it, and most of the giveaways have been surplus equipment anyway.
The West has to supply more advanced weapons to Ukraine such as the Gray Eagle drone, GLSDB, a Western tank, and a Western fighter plane to offset Russia's huge superiority in manpower.
During the Korean War, China had overwhelming superiority in manpower, but this couldn't overcome the UN's superiority in weapons.
