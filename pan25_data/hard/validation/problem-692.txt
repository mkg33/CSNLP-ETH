You see, Iran and North Korea supplying us weapons is cool.... No global catastrophes.
The west supplying Ukraine however will lead to global catastrophe.
West not sending enough weapons to Ukraine prior to Russian invasion has lead to a catastrophe.
If Ukraine was NATO outpost armed to the teeth, Putin would be scared to invade like puppy.
In my mind its more like, the West sending more weapons to Ukraine will lead to their foot kicking deeper into russias ass till Zelenskyy's boot is coming out of putins mouth.
If Russia actually thinks it is going to lose the war in Ukraine, this is the reality for the Russian elite.
They will be ostracized from just about anywhere in the world where you can eat in a Michelin star restaurant, park a yacht, and stay in the presidential suite of a Four Seasons.
They and their nation will be humiliated and isolated from the developed world’s economic system, which they have used to facilitate their theft of state resources and escape Russia to enjoy the freedom and democracy of Europe and North America.
Their future will be one of poverty and isolation.
They will not tolerate that.
They will absolutely break all the toys and leave the sandbox if they can’t do what they want when they play in it.
The mentality of the Russian elite is quite simple.
They are mostly psychopaths and narcissists used to living very high on the hog from ill-gotten gains.
What are two things ultra-rich psychopaths and narcissists are likely to never tolerate?
Losing control, and losing the ability to enjoy their wealth.
In other words, being an average person like the ones they are sending into the meat grinder every day.
