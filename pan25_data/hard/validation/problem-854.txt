That's my line of thinking on it, too.
I don't care if it was Ukraine's missile, it wouldn't have been in the air at all had Russia stayed the fuck home instead of invading a sovereign nation.
I don't think NATO would go to a war with Russia over this even if it was a Russian cruise missile.
The missile being Russian wouldn't be sufficient, in order for the NATO member states to go to war, I think that Poland would have to prove beyond any doubt that this was not simply a stray missile but an intentional attack and the intent would be extremely hard to prove decisively.
They believe that NATO is brushing it under the carpet and saying the missile was launched by Ukraine so that they don't risk getting directly involved in the war, since if it was a Russian-launched missile, Poland would insist that NATO take action against Russia.
If the missile was indeed fired by Russia, it would be a good excuse for NATO to setup a no-fly or missile defense zone within a certain distance of Poland's border.
It could also provide leverage to get Belarus to push back against Russia firing missiles from it's south western border with Ukraine too.
Which would let NATO get partially involved and help Ukraine defend it's western side.
Ukraine could then concentrate their anti-air systems more to the east to try to stop the infrastructure bombings.
