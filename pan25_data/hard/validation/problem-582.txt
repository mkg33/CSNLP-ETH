Not even a few years ago they chose not to look into Trump's withholding of congressional allocated military aid to Ukraine.
And, honestly, from a realistic standpoint, Ukraine taking it by force is unlikely.
It's an incredibly easy position to defend if your opponent doesn't have a navy.
The only road access is a very narrow chokepoint, or a massive tidal swamp.
Neither is very appealing as far as offensive action goes and the Russian navy, despite its fuckups, still owns the Black Sea as far as the war effort's concerned.
The big worry would be that if Ukraine actually does mass enough troops to force Perekop that Putin would be tempted to employ tactical nukes.
That's pretty much the exact situation such weapons were developed for and losing Crimea would, as you say, be a death knell for his regime.
If they are in the process of losing Crimea that means the war is all but over already.
Nuking Ukraine at that point, which Russia has already been warned will result in NATO intervention, makes little to no sense.
But the main difference between losing Crimea and all these things you mentioned is that Putins propaganda couldn't hide or twist losing Crimea at all.
Everyone in Russia will know that 2 million Russians are desperately trying to flee Crimea back to Russia, with ferries overloaded, people swimming the Strait.
The Russian ethnofascists will be screaming for blood.
It's already hard enough for Putin to keep them satisfied.
Again, most Russians don't follow news or military - I bet you money that you could ask 8/10 Russians what happened to Moskva and they'll think you're talking about the city.
It also barely registered about the bridge because for all most Russians know, it was incredibly minor damage that they fixed overnight.
Why would they go and risk their lives protesting for that?
For now, not only is Putin protected by his 400k Rosgvardiya troops, an incredibly potent and loyal FSB, and the military, but he also still likely has a gentle majority of the population in support of him (reasonable estimates put it around 60%).
Hard to know exact numbers these days.
Those factions I mentioned (Rosgvardiya, FSB, military, etc) are also the only groups capable of mounting a threat to Putin, arguably only the FSB or military in fact.
Now, by themselves, the military or FSB would struggle to overcome the other power players, especially with a population that would be hostile to you.
But if Putin's support is tangibly nosediving, suddenly either of those factions could go in and remove Putin under the guise of "acting on behalf of the people".
I'm not saying Russians will suddenly be out in the streets overthrowing Putin.
In the same way that redditors love to simplify incredibly complex sociological and political topics into "lol Russians dumb dumb love riding their dicktator", redditors also generally fail to realise that dictators aren't scared of crowds of people flooding to the streets with pitchforks, like what happens in Hollywood.
The danger for dictators is that a sudden and big shift in popular support, one which can be tangibly felt throughout society, is a fantastic moment to move against said dictator.
