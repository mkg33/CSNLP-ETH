At the time that agreement on the Palestinian side was led by Yasser Arafat, who was part of Fatah.
Since that agreement, most Palestinians do not support Fatah and definitely not Mahmood Abbas since he took over.
As much as I wold like to think that Hamas can't speak for the Palestinian people, in reality they do, they were democratically elected by the Palestinian people and still have wide support from them.
The Palestinian government goes back and forth on recognition, clearly does not stop the Oslo accords given the way the WB looks right now, Hamas very specifically does not recognize Israel and at points has called for the eradication of not only Israelis but Jews world wide.
\^ This is what the average Israeli supporter responds with at the suggestion that the Palestinians have their own state, something almost every country on the planet universally supports.
2 State is the only viable solution for Israel to stay a majority jewish state, the Palestinian people, the Arab world and the world community.
Maybe someone should remind Prince Faisal that the Palestinians have passed on 5 separate opportunities for a state, and the reason they don't have one is because they want their state to replace Israel.
Then letâ€™s check how serious the Arab world is about supporting the Palestinian people and how capable the extremist Palestinian political factions are about reforming and actually building and ruling a functioning state that provides for its people.
