There is no comparison between the 2003 Iraq air defense vs the current Ukrainian Air defense.
The Iraqi air defense was almost non existent and it was easier for the US to achieve air superiority as opposed to the Ukrainian air defense with S-300.
Interesting article but it does a lot of handwaving that really underscore US dominance and asymmetric air warfare vs Russian air power than set Ukraine's air defense as markedly different than the Iraqi interested air defense system.
Actually easy to understand: Soviets focused on anti-air defence over airpower, and Ukraine inherited the same air defences.
Then, Ukrainians get HARM missles that hunt radars, and Russian equivalent missiles don't work all that well, and it's all a huge game of cat and mouse now.
So... Russia strikes hard with air, jams the Ukrainians till blind, but then has to shut down their jamming to not interfere with own operations.
Russia also has way more bodies to throw at this war, they will win an extended war of attrition.
I see way too many jokes and overconfident remarks on here.
The situation is pretty serious in Ukraine.
