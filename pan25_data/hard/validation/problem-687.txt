Definitely her.
Her daughter also outed her when she had covid and was trying to pretend she didn't.
Her daughter is pretty cool actually.
And bisexual I believe.
No.
I said I thought she was pretty cool first.
The bisexual thing is only recently public and I might be wrong, she might be lesbian.I added that because her mother doesn't seem to be the type to be a big supporter of the LGBTQ community.
The average person is so homophobic, that people who wat to deny rights to LGBTQ could be called "moderate" until recently.
It was only possible to call people like her a "moderate" because it is socially acceptable to be homophobic and to fail at supporting equal rights for queers.
In europe less than 100 years ago, it was considered "moderate" to do pogroms and lynchings against non Christians.
Again, the knowledge of having guns and a willingness to use them stopped both lynchings and pogroms in the past.
In Crimea prior to WW1 there were pogroms prevented by a dozen armed people willing to stand up to literally hundreds.
