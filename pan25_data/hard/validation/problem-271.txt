> According to Daily Star, Maslov was criticized by both Putin and the Kremlin before his death for failing to produce enough tanks for Russian troops to use in Ukraine.
A while ago RT announced that Putin was going after the second-tier officers who had lied about Russia's military readiness and led him and the Kremlin top brass into this quagmire in Ukraine.

You're right, in my haste I got casualties crossed with fatalities.

Am I missing something (probably)?
Hell, this is what Novgorod in the Middle Ages used to do.
