For starters, there is widespread U.S. military presence throughout South Korea.
One of the factors in Russia’s decision to invade was the lack of a significant Western military presence in Ukraine.
They wouldn’t have launched an invasion if it meant getting the U.S. military directly involved in the conflict.
I guarantee you such a factor would be considered by North Korean military planners as well.
Secondly, North Korea (While being an authoritarian state) literally has no ability to wage a conventional war against South Korea.
They are already incredibly weakened by sanctions that have left them with inadequate equipment and a poorly-supplied military.
Their primary way of threatening the South is through their nuclear weapons.
Again, as I have stated, the main thing (and pretty much only thing) that North Korea is able to deploy as a meaningful threat against South Korea is their nuclear weapons.
You're definitely wrong there, North Korea has a massive army and they've got plenty of weapons which haven't been hurt by sanctions.
For instance, they have a huge number of artillery aimed right at Seoul which would devastate the city in the event of a war.
I’m sure the massive air power advantage of the south and US would have that artillery decimated in a few hours.
No way battle plans aren’t in place to deal with that first and foremost.
