It’s the same as if a man or woman were born without an arm, they would still be genetically man or woman despite the failure of a limb to develop.
What about people born appearing 100% female, complete with the bits, but are genetically males?
Who can they have sex with without sinning?
According to the bible, are they men or women?
Are Christian hardliners going to be happy with 100% female looking (from birth) males marrying women?
Something tells me they won't.
The most hilarious thing to me is that many of these "testosterone insensitive males" are indistinguishable from XX females, and many of them never find out.
The consequence is that thousands of bigots have been in a gay marriage their entire lives and are banging men regularly with no clue.
However, I’m not sure that “thousands” of bigots have married people with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.
The , so between .005% and .0016% of our population.
Meaning only about 5k-16k of these individuals are likely to exist in the US, and only a percentage of those have a female-presenting image or genitals.
My point in saying all of this is that you make a wonderful point and keep doing God’s work, but don’t risk the efficacy of your argument by reaching for a far-off scenario, no matter how satisfying the image may be.
