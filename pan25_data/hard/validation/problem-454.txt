Please don't propose stupid things.
Poland has been a solid supporter of Ukrainian independence and has shot down any suggestion of wanting to seize parts of Ukraine that were controlled by Poland at one point.
This is exactly the sort of conspiracy Russia is pushing in the article to undermine the alliance and friendship between the two countries.
And talking about the war and the borders might also brings up memories of the slaughter of Poles by extreme Ukrainian nationalists during the war.
We attacked Ukraine and took their land, so clearly Poland wants to do it so we're here now to protect Ukraine from Polish aggression - GOP/Putin.
I am pretty sure that if Poland wanted to annex parts of Ukraine they would not be handing over vast amounts of their military hardware to Ukraine...
Speaking of Poland, you say that it’s okay for the Soviets to invade Poland to keep them as a buffer, and that buying them an extra month saved Moscow.
That’s certainly possible, but imagine how much time would be saved by Russia sending troops into Poland to fight back the Nazis with Poland instead of conquering them.
The nazi war machine would have also been weakened if the poles didn’t capitulate from a two front war.
TLDR: The Soviets were the greatest contributor to defeating the Nazis, but their collaboration was evil imo and the actions of the Soviet Union led to WW2.
Even if the western powers snubbed the USSR, that doesn’t excuse subjugating half of Europe under Stalin’s totalitarian rule.
The scenario you presented also makes 0 sense, and it kind of shows a gross misunderstanding of ww2 and why things happened.
