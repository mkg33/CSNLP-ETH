as front line/ breakthrough tanks.
Even the dozens of the most modernized T-90M Proriv tanks Russia recently sent over to the front have thus far been used to take long range shots at Ukrainian armored vehicles and set infantry positions up to 5km away.
The morale and propaganda hit that losing their most prized and state of the art tank to the Ukrainians would be too much to risk it in vulnerable offensive roles when they still have thousands of T-72s and T-80s in storage they can quickly repair, modernize, and use for offensive operations if they must.
I doubt that any will actually be sent if they send any and when Ukrainian forces destroy them it would literally tank the commercial value of it for export never mind the first one they capture would likely mean the West will see how advanced the Armata is and not just the numbers the Russians put out.
Especially since this could influence Western nations, especially the US and Germany, to send more armor to Ukraine in exchange to getting access to disabled or destroyed T-14s to get a peek under the hood and get details and specifications on it.
Though, funnily enough, Russian vehicles are the only ones that don't have their specs leaked.
Largely because some details of them are actually over-performing, or they also possibly get the full specs of the vehicles regardless.
If they're actually committing things that have been little more than parade and propaganda vehicles, it shows how desperate they getting for useable vehicles.
