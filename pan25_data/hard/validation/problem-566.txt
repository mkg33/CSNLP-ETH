Hopefully that will clip russia's wings and keep it in it's place.
(Somewhere on the ground, underneath the cockroaches).
It really does seem as though the russian elite are rewriting history to write out the most uncomfortable parts or the parts that make the war in Ukraine and every other war they wage look hypocritical,.stupid and invalid.
Also, it's pretty despicable to portray a Russian invasion of Ukraine as similar to the Nazi invasion of the USSR or Napoleon's invasion of Russia, but I think that goes without saying.
When Medvedev says "Patriotic War," he's drawing comparisons specifically to the French and later Nazi invasions of Russia:
Is he forgetting that when russia was invaded in WW2 other countries were on their side when they switched sides after Nazi Germany invaded.
Ah yes, that war where Russia was but one part of the USSR, which was but one of the military powers fighting the Nazis.
That same war where 24 million or so of the USSR's people died, of which only 8.8 tp 10.7 were military.
