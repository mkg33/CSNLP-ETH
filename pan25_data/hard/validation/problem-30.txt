NATO could be sending the long range missile systems Ukraine needs.
Ukraine not having those is probably the main reason why recapturing the occupied regions is taking so long: Russians are simply out of range.
Now I have no doubt if Russia escalated beyond what they're doing currently and was showing more success in capturing land in Ukraine; they'd step in.
But I understand why they're avoiding that for now and taking a more reactive stance.
They're sending em weapons, training soliders, and providing finacial aid; what more people could want besides a formal declaration of war is beyond me.
So unless you're strapping up your boots rn and are ready to march over there this second with a rifle in hand; don't be bitching 'the US isn't doing enough'.
I don't know what possibly more people (more specifically their citizens) could want at the moment unless they're suggesting outright WW3 which we should all be trying to avoid.
Again I'm not saying any of these choices don't come with compromises to put it extremely mildly; but I can see why it's not as easy as 'just send tanks/heavy artillery, and tell em to aim at mainland russia' at the current moment.
