I’m not one claiming Obama did nothing but one piece of legislation hardly makes him a better president than Biden.
Biden is outpacing him on legislation, executive orders, judges and most economic indicators.
Overall I don’t really care to debate it though because it’s not like I think Obama was terrible.
I just think Biden has been great by virtually any standard you can hold the position to.
Biden has really won me over so far.
I think the media's hyper-focus on Obama, followed by the insanity of Trump, had me used to breaking news happening every single day.
Biden has been a great return to normalcy plus he's been surprisingly left of where I thought he'd be.
It's not enough to stop me from voting Biden - it looks like he's going to run and stability is important.
But I wish he could nominate Kamala for another post and free up the VP slot for someone else without obliterating Kamala's career/life.
She was my personal choice for Biden's VP (was hoping for Kamala as AG), and I think she needs a lot more recognition.
