I’m not even a fan of them, and I can easily see how their shows could be some of the most entertaining and fun time.
(Fun fact: I hate bro-country.
Luke Bryan was hands down the most fun I’ve ever had at a concert.
And I hate his music.
).
Yep.
But mentioning the empty housing and the fact we could house every homeless man, woman and child in this country is apparently “communist”/“socialist.”.
This is old school democrat beliefs— remember that the Dems used to be a pro-union party and organized labor until the last 15-20 years was very, very anti-immigrant because immigration decreases wages in the industries they take jobs in.
They can demonize the community, browbeat them into accepting lower wages while employing millions of them and incite their fanatics to believe that they are ruining the country and only Republicans can stop them.
Long story short it's a win win because they get to exploit their labor and score political points with people who don't know anything.
From otherwise reasonable people I still hear how immigrants are somehow bad for the economy when they statistically receive less in services than they pay in taxes while also fixing our labor shortage issue.
They won't admit it but a lot of them are racist and are more than willing to jump at any chance to not like immigrants because of something other than them just being racist.
Also, historically many black people really, really don’t like Hispanics or Asians (and a lot of Hispanics and Asians didn’t like black people).
