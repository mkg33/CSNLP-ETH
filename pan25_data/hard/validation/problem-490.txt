The complete prohibition of any substance has never worked, and nicotine is extremely addictive and still leaves a person completely functional.
So this might actually work to some extent if there is still the option of vaping nicotine.
If there isn't though, people will just start growing and selling tobacco, and it will be much harsher and more tarry than the one's being sold rn (although they would have waaaayyy less additives and a lot of those cause a shitton of cancer).
There's no need to though, as smuggling cigarettes is easy AF since no drug dogs give a shit about smoking, and they couldn't even if they wanted to.
People on international airports in NZ would be arriving from countries in which smoking is legal, so most people would smell of cigarettes, making the dog useless (which they already are after 40 min of work.
).
Yes it is included.
Essentially people stop working at around the same age regardless.
Smokers tend to die either during their productive years or just after meaning they only last long enough to contribute but not long enough to be a drain or to go negative.
Smoking makes you statistically more likely to die younger, but there are loads and loads of people who live to a very old age as a smoker.
But smokers die earlier … a stroke or cancer and they’re out in their sixties … the elderly at the age of 70-80 are a massive drain on health resources and smoking kinda ….
Alleviates that.
