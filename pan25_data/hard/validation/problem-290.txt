I never thought I'd see the day when a politician would bad mouth a billionaire, normally companies can do anything they want and not a word is said, even if it kills people.
I have never heard of the guy but 2 thumbs up as he is spot on.
Government money, same with Tesla, the only one without Government money is Twitter.
3 companies, 1 going out of business, 1 going well, 1 needing a bailout because they had a month left.
Exactly, if I am a billionaire I want friends to stand up to me and say that's wrong, if 75% of my friends say no then I wouldn't do it.
It would prevent me making a fool of myself on the world stage.
But narcissists don't think that way, they think they are always right and can never admit wrong or losing.
See Trump blaming everyone but his neighbours pet goldfish for the midterms.
He does sound like as good guy though, must be tough going against everyone who has been bribed by corporations.
His only ability is in getting people to give him money.
That doesn't make him a scientist, coder, or engineer.
Every one of his former employees talks about the fact that most slow-downs come from him trying to be hands on about shit he doesn't understand.
