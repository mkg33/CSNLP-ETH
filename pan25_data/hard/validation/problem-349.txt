It’s also possible this balloon had some problem and wasn’t at the planned altitude.
Had it been higher, it’s possible it wouldn’t have been spotted by civilians.
As it is, it took days to be spotted.
Not that large, moves slow so the human brain isn’t interested in it, and can be 17 miles up (a bit over 11 in this case).
The other balloons could have been higher and/or smaller which, besides being over land a shorter period, aided in civilians not noticing them.
Balloons loiter, are somewhat difficult to detect due to their altitude and slow speed (radar), and can catch a site off guard.
If you can catch a site off guard you can photo things you normally couldn’t.
Government tracks all spy satellites so won’t expose new tech on ground if it’s doing a pass by.
A balloon could catch then unaware and could lead to photos of secret planes, open silos, weapons tests, and so on.
A lot of photos too since it’s over the area for a long time compared to a satellite.
Also used to determine the effectiveness of North American air defenses.
Since they supposedly missed three balloons years ago there’s something to that.
Wouldn't the only point of this balloon be to rile people up?
China has high tech and satellites, they don't need balloons to spy on anyone.
It's only a couple of steps up from having a guy climb a phone pole to eavesdrop on landline conversations.
