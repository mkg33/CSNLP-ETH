There's a lot of regional rivalry in the area, but both nations are culturally conflict adverse- even their skirmishes in Aksai Chin have a "no firearms" rule, so when things get heated they beat each other up physically/ throw rocks at each other.
The only times guns were used were as warning shots in 2020 in over 50 years (both sides claiming the other side started first, what most likely happened is one side mistook the other side as firing a shot).
But you're right- all of the 1900's China was getting wrecked from wars and unrest, and that made them very reluctant to engage in further conflict.
For all the shit China does, maybe that made them re-think just a bit about being in conflicts, or maybe not, since itâ€™s within their own borders.
China is already dealing with financial problems and civil unrest at home, the last thing they want is possible nuclear war.
It should be worrying then that China is even talking about nuclear war.
Redditors here seem obsessed about what China means by this.
The problem is, it's simple, Putin told Xi there is a chance of nukes.
This is China making it very clear that it's not acceptable.
But again the problem is when has Putin ever listened to anyone...
However, since this is coming out of a meeting with Scholz, it might just be China reaffirming their no first use policy.
India and China are the only 2 countries with an absolutely no first use policy.
It's one of the reasons China refuses to negotiate with USA about nukes since Obama made it clear USA is willing to nuke China first.
