Now I may be wrong to assume that well renown UK institutions might draw from their respect for tradition and differentiate more between teacher and student on account of power distance dynamics, among other things.
Not sure whether they have a divide or not, there is a huge difference between Universities of Applied Sciences and...
The other type that isn't that, maybe one is full of researchers and the other with teachers?
And that's before you factor in that college in the UK costs so much that a lot of their own students would study in countries like The Netherlands for 1/3rd of the price and get a less outdated education in the process.
if the British universities cost for example a billion and instead of for example two million students now there are only one million who pays this billion?
Do you want British students to really not have to pay more?
EU students used to pay home fees for UK universities.
Post-Brexit, they now pay international fees, which are triple the cost.
So in actuality they're making more profit from them now even with half the EU student intake.
Not that it's a good thing overall but from a purely financial point of view they're better off now.
Especially since for many courses universities actually lose money per every student paying home fees.
