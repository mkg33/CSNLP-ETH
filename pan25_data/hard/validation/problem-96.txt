Jesting that if you see a decently equipped soldier it's probably an officer because we've seen footage of men in wwII gear.
Best way I heard it described was like at the platoon level -- the sergeant is there to make sure the platoon is ready to fight and the officer is there to tell them where to go and who to shoot.
It works that way all the way up the chain of command.
NCO's in the west are the backbone of the military.
You don't have them, you fall to pieces.
Especially with modern militaries, there's so much work involved you absolutely need to have a divide in responsibilities between officers and NCO's.
There's only so many hats one person can wear.
It's hard to get a straight answer on Russian manufacturing capabilities.
Seen a bunch of back and forth on credible defense.
There's an argument that small arms and ammo isn't a problem, even tanks and integrated circuits up to 80's standards.
But there's other arguments saying they lost domestic capabilities they had in the Cold War, started sourcing critical parts from foreign sources, including critical manufacturing equipment so they could no longer produce domestically.
Not much dissimilar to how we used to have a ton of semiconductor manufacturing here in the States and then willingly offshored the work and are now bringing it back the hard way.
Also, the special sauce in advanced weapons is electronics and computers.
A modern tank without the electronics is next to useless.
There's also the difference of going from prototype to production.
That's why they have T-14's for parades but you aren't seeing them deployed in useful numbers.
Troops aren't getting proper armour or weapons.
Many who do get equipment end up with things used in WW2 such as old fashioned metal helmets and bolt action rifles.
They're given uniforms that don't fit.
Many captured troops have said they were only sent with one magazine/clip of ammo and told to find more when in the field.
There was video footage of a Russian squad being given paintball/airsoft armour that's just plastic to stop toys leaving welts.
Ukrainian troops have recorded videos of them being able to fold Russian helmets that are supposedly modern standards.
Ukrainians have shown videos of them inspecting Russian plates in their vests only to find scrap metal wedged inside.
Inspections of destroyed and captured tanks has found that the little boxes on the outside that are supposed to detonate to stop rockets hitting the tank have been empty or just a block of wood rather than explosives.
Videos of Russians mocking their own guns has shown rusty guns that fall apart when reloading.
Russians have posted videos laughing about resupply crates having dress shoes and shirts like they're going to a disco.
Multiple videos have shown Russians arguing with each other over a lack of supplies being sent to the front and captured Russians have complained they were deployed alone without communications or resupplies.
