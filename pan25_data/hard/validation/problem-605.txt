A tank isn't a piece of metal though, it's a mix of many materials.
So you have to disassemble it into individual parts and recycle those separately.
And many of the parts are full of odd alloys and compounds that make them really hard to reuse.
Contamination that's hard to remove, basically.
"Copper in steel causes metallurgical problems, but is pervasive in end-of-life scrap and cannot currently be removed commercially once in the melt.
Contamination can be managed to an extent by globally trading scrap for use in tolerant applications and dilution with primary iron sources.
".
This is never a true.
It is always cheaper to recycle metal vs getting it from the earth.
Raw earth is a mix of all elements, not just iron.
You have to mine it, transport it, separate it, and process it.
Scrap metal has already gone through all of that.
Melting it down will always be less resource and energy intensive.
Regardless, this process is still 3-5x less resource intensive from starting from scratch with raw earth.
