Not just stop-and-go, also a lot of sitting.
Even though it's brief stops [for mail trucks] it's a lot of them and it adds up.
ICE engines can't help but continue to use fuel while electric engines use nothing while stopped.
EV's require far less maintenance than ICE vehicles.
It's one of their major draws.
This would actually be a cost-savings side effect of going to an EV fleet.
For regular citizens that don't frequently drive more than 250 miles in an day, it also makes a lot of sense to use an EV.
70% of Americans live in single family homes (thanks to terrible zoning regulations) and would have access to charge at home, effectively starting each day with a "full tank".
On rare occasions that they need to drive further, a DC fast charger (if available in the area) would recharge the battery in 25-45 minutes for most EVs.
Most of the best batteries need the max charge rate for at most a couple hours, beyond that charging speed is limited by the chemistry of the battery and literally can't be charged faster without damage.
Charging slower the full time tends to help the battery have a much longer and more reliable life as well.
Which longer and more reliable life is good for assets of a government agency.
