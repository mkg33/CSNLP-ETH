Military service is REALLY QUITE GOOD at getting you to follow orders without question, and there is a severe issue with white nationalism in the low officer ranks.
The Military has always targeted people with no social mobility and a lot of these people tend to be Republican.
You don’t find a lot of Democrats in deep red dirt farming towns where career choices boil down to military, mechanic, or farmhand.
As for the slaps to the face, they probably just shove it off.
That’s what basic training can be like - break people down to build them up.
If nothing else, they can always just write it off as “nah he’s not talking about us, he’s talking about that woke part of the military.”.
Something tells me there’s a lot of veterans in general that probably weren’t as stoked to get a Purple Heart as Trump was.
Ehhh Vietnam vets I thought skewed left compared to veterans of other wars.
Remember, a good amount of them were not there by choice.
But please don't let me get in the way of you shitting on a demographic forced to kill or be killed against their will for ultimately no reason.
