One of the major issues for their Air Force isn’t a lack of planes or pilots, but a lack of munitions for their jets.
Jet munitions are “smart” munitions and Russia isn’t able to make more of those with the sanctions.
The only use their jets have are as kamikaze weapons since any intelligence application has been taken over by harder to target drones.
Not true, if your enemy has proper electronic warfare capability then drones are unusable.
Drones would be unusable against any NATO member for example.
I’m sure 100% of drones won’t be shut down completely, so incursions are definitely possible, but in general replacing all air capability with drones against a modern army won’t work.
Yeah you may hit a target or two, few drones make through but you are much better off at using ballistic and even better hypersonic missiles for that task.
Vs a modern army you need a human or AI operated (non distance controlled) aircraft that is capable of operating blind.
Eventually AI might get there but it will have to be able to operate with zero gps or external inputs, besides camera input maybe.
Because against a formidable enemy you probably can’t use radar/emit any signals.
It’s not lack of air force, they still have over a thousand jet fighters, it’s that if they try to use them in Ukraine they will be shot down, so they aren’t (they tried in the beginning of war and lost multiple planes per day.
Maybe that's because of shit Russian hardware or maybe it still out classes everything in the field so there is no point in keeping an overly expensive fighter in the air when the budget can be redirected to the next best thing.
I don’t know my planes very well but I was under the impression that the F-22 is basically the most advanced and capable fighter in the world by a long margin but is expensive and complicated as fuck.
I thought the F-35 was basically a less capable but still very good plane that was cheaper and more versatile to have in service and also something the US would export to allies unlike the F-22.
Was there a particular reason the F-22 wasn’t simply updated with the F-35’s avionics or is the F-35 and it’s associated avionics package just too different for that to be a consideration ?
