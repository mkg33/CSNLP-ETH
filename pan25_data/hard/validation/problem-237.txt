Plus, burning wood is almost carbon neutral, as long as there is a system put in place to plant and manage replacement trees for consumption.
Reforestation with the sole purpose of burning is practical enough that it's viable.
Not as our main energy and heat production solution globally, but as an addition, especially in these times of transitioning.
You overlook the production we have to meet in order for everyone to have heat and power.
While completely turning off everything that pollutes would be very effective in fighting climate change, we have to do it in smaller steps.
If you consider growing the trees but then not harvesting to burn, I think you’ll arrive at how limiting them would be considered “fighting climate change”.
Sure, you might have increased demand at certain times and increase the amount of trees you cut down, but that just means you'd have to increase the amount of trees you plant/let grow back as well.
Well, if you're not letting your trees grow back then you're eventually gonna run out of trees.
That just sounds like really poor forestry, this isn't the 1800s, countries in the developed world aren't going to perform some kind of 1800s-style deforestation.
