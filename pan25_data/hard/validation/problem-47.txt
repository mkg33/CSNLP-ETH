Yeah, If you had a chronic illness that was managable before the Rona hit you and then it wasn't, Covid is still what killed you.
I think the reason why people have a hard time understanding it is because once you hear they have an illness it feels like they fall into special category appart from "healthy" people but thats not how the statistic of mortallity works because it just has to look at the set data pool of a of a combined people that could include any of the possible categorys humans possibly could fall into, like child, old, heathy unhealthy etc.
Remember when people complained that data in the west might be skewed because deaths from secondary problems like diabetes related kidney failure were counted as Covid deaths if someone was even just infected (which is the correct way to do it) with Covid?
China probably does it the other eay around.
Let's hope the rest of the world has strict rules for people that want to travel out of China.
(the same rules China has for travelers into China).
The effects of all the people traveling around because of Chinese New Year the 22nd of January is going to be 'interesting'.
