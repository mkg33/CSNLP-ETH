I'm (european) disappointed with the choice on Brexit because I think it was done for the wrong reason, and that the voters were manipulated by populists.
Watching what the British government has done to "take advantage of Brexit" since the vote has been a bitter lesson for many.
For the UK to then to have a Referendum to see if we want Brexit and vote against that and get dragged out anyway...
It's just fucking baffling.
That's the thing - that doesn't even make sense.
But it's so demeaning to say that people only voted because they're right wing, or people only voted because they're racist.
Our society is so so so divided in it because almost every sub group of people voted different ways for different reasons, there's no clear cut lines.
Politics is just different ideas on how you fix the same problems, but we are too busy assigning blame to the people that are not us.
Yeah there was something for everyone in the narrative.
They also had someone write up an article, or an expert to counter every point raised against them, it was practically impossible to counter.
