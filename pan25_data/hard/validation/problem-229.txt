Yes comrades, we are unstoppable in our mission to capture Ukraine Kyiv Sumy Kharkiv Kherson Bhakmut Soledar which is clearly a huge victory and definitely not only a costly Pyyrhic victory for what amounts only to a small town.^/s.
Not only that, the Ukrainian Stronghold of Siversk to the north of Soledar is also majorly threatened because of the broken frontlines; that city will also be surrounded if the Russians capitalise on their victory and push.
The Ukrainian forces at Siversk will need to decide whether to withdraw to a more stable frontline early (because of all the equipment and vehicles they need to take with them), or defend the city at very real risk of encirclement.
The capture of Soledar threatens the city of Bakhmut, there is now a risk that Russia could outflank the city and attempt an encirclement.
This turns Bakhmut into a salient flanked on three sides (if Ukraine isn't careful, it could even lead to an encirclement of Bakhmut).
Bakhmut is now threatened from the north, Russians could even attempt encirclement by moving deeper behind Bakhmut.
If Bakhmut is threatened from 3 directions, is it really beyond possibility that the attacking side could try to or want to attempt encirclement and close the hole?
