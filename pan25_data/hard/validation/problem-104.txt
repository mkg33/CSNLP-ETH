No it won’t, it will be used as an excuse to ram a ban through that includes banning paintball and airsoft (currently in the works, C-21) regardless of the truth.
Unlikely considering he had multiple restraining orders against him, grounds for the police to seize your weapons when you come up as flagged during the daily background check you agreed to when you get an RPAL (the license that allows the possession of handguns).
Given that the people he shot up literally had a restraining order against him, he shouldn’t have been eligible to have a restricted license (and thus, a handgun) in the first place.
Hasn’t been confirmed yet.
Given the shooting was with a handgun, he would have needed a restricted license to legally own it.
Which are heavily regulated, including daily background checks.
When DailyMail is the only source claiming it was illegal, and they don’t even have ‘illegal’ in the quote, I’m not sure how reliable it is tbh.
Seems like a case of them misinterpreting things, because we 100% would have seen other reporting mentioning this by now.
You’re way overthinking things.
At this stage, there’s two options.
It’s legal or illegal.
If illegal, it would take far more investigation to track down where it actually came from.
If they explicitly said it’s illegal, we 100% would have a more reputable source then Daily Mail reporting it.
There are plenty of right-leaning Canadian news sources such as National Post who would be all over it.
