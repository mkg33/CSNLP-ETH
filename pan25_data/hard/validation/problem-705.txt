It is very much strategic and they have only to look at the Ukraine war to see why BRICS might be beneficial to them.
China is promising them a financial system free from the interference of politics, where their money is safe and they don't have to worry about a privileged few using their control over the system to force you to do things their way.
This is very appealing to a lot of countries who view the West as using their influence over the worlds financial systems to hold them back and forcing them to jump thru hoops the West never had to jump through to get where they are today.
India feels they can compete with China, but they can't compete with the US / West should we decide to cut off their access to international money because their population once again voted in a racist populist with authoritarian leanings.
I mean India and China are actual regional competitors, have gone to war in the past, have had multiple border spats sometimes deadly in the last couple years and both countries have developed or are developing vehicles to fight in high terrain so both countries at least do see a conflict as possible.
And canâ€™t forget that the same Russian ideology that called for the invasion of Ukraine and other countries also calls for the break up of China.
