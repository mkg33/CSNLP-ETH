The public outrage against the zoo has been massive here in Sweden, People have been cancelling their annual passes to the zoo en masse and saying that they will never visit again.
There have also even been many threats against the zookeepers, which is of course not okay.
The keepers do seem to deeply care for the chimpanzees, and this has been very traumatic for them as well.
The outrage should be aimed fully at the zoo owners and management of course.
The more news that are coming out about the Furuvik Zoo, the worse it looks.
I highly doubt that they will able to keep their remaining chimpanzees after this.
PS: Your point about a human life being more important than that of a Chimp I would dispute such a charge.
There are many humans off the top of my head that I would gladly sacrifice over the life of any Chimp….
It’s immaterial to you if the facts prove me right because you’re simply unwilling to accept them, regardless.
The sky is red by the way, if you say otherwise you're unwilling to accept "the facts", after all my word is enough to claim something as fact, as you have.
