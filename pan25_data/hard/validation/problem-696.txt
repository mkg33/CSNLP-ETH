"They argue that Section 230’s protections should not apply to the content a company’s algorithm recommends online, and therefore Google is legally liable for the extremist videos published on its YouTube service".
Now, in the case the Court will decide, the Section 230 issue isn't that there was content that incited immediate violence (which wouldn't have been a legal problem for the website), the issue is that the website's algorithm actively promoted that content to some of its users.
So now that's no longer just user generated content, but website generated promotion of content inciting violence, and that's a liability issue for the website now, which the Court will probably hold isn't covered under Section 230.
Section 230 is for websites that publish user-generated content (including the one we're on right now) and states that these sites cannot be held legally liable for the content that was generated by their users, be that in terms of defamation, copyright infringement, or (in this case) incitement to violence.
Admittedly Bruen was a bit of a surprise, but a very pleasant one.
If you're referencing Roe, that was never a law to begin with, so that's not comparable to this question.
Again, none of the parties argue that 230 is unconstitutional and should be struck down, the argument is about what specific things 230 does or does not cover.
I've asked this a few times now on this topic, what is the actual harm in giving Republicans what they want and repealing Section 230 in this instance?
Because a small fraction of them then want to go after suing a bunch of people for libel and defamation?
So what?
Repealing Section 230 will force something to replace it.
If any politician grandstands on that issue and fubars it, that's a lot of bad press for them at the end of all of this.
Is the replacement going to be worse than the current law?
How?
