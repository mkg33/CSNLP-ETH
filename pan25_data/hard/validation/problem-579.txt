Historically, you always bet on the Russians to do better in the cold than anybody else.
Not in this case though.
The Ukrainians know how to fight in the cold too, and are much better equipped to do so.
Ukraine will be better equipped, but they are now on the offensive.
Attacking in the cold is a lot harder than defending, that will work against ukraine.
I've seen a few analysts and strategists saying that within two months ukraine will be back to pre-invasion borders, I'm not so sure.
They'll certainly start attacking the region from afar, but it's not like Ukraine's army is going to mass in there for a party.
Also the Russians there were under watch from civilians, if there was something big it would be caught already.
While it's possible I think if they really just want to focus on holding Crimea.
It will be interesting to see where the Ukrainians will push next.
Will it be into Zaporizhzhia Oblast straight through to the Azov Sea, or a slow grind from the north east?
Keep up the fight Ukraine.
Australia is with you.
I hope our howitzers and armored vehicles are serving you well.
