It’s funny, based on the CDC’s data, homicide isn’t even in the top 10 as far as what usually kills people in the US.
I think alotta people have a John Wick power fantasy where they imagine they’ll use their guns to kill all the bad guys.
Also, unlicensed persons may sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer a long gun or long gun ammunition to a person of any age.
So.
Yeah.
No.
Robbers want quick, easy and no trouble.
Think about it.
You think people actually break in to homes where people are asleep anymore?
Oh hell no.
And with the amount of doorbell cameras, wifi cameras, fucking cameras the look like the head of a screw, there simply isn't as much crime as the used to be.
You don't have anything to be scared of.
Not really.
The odds are so low bookies would laugh at you.
Plus, most robberies these days happen during the day, while you're at work.
then they can steal your gun too!
So cool, you keep your gun.
Pull it on your kid or wife in the middle of the night.
I hope you have trigger discipline.
Plus, you have stuff in your house worth more than a human life?
Stuff people should die if they touch?
Fuck that.
Take my TV, I'm not going to kill for it.
I figured you were on my side, but nah man.
You owning a gun increases your chances of being shot by a ton.
You're also 22x more likely to shoot a family member or a friend than an intruder.
