It's easy to say that people are just dumb and some of them definitely are.
But a lot are actually smarter than we give them credit for.
They know what it takes to get the policies that they want.
They want women to have fewer rights, gay people to not exist, they want a white race to be dominant always, they want men to be more empowered than women, they want to game a system and get as rich as they can and get as much power as they can and just stay there.
The majority of truly intelligent people don't want this, as seen by most exit polls when you look at college educated people and how they vote.
The smart ones that do, are smart enough to know what it takes to get the stuff that they want.
They don't care that Santos lies, because it helps to push an agenda.
Look at MTG and Boebert.
The GOP is NOT looking for smart people, they are looking for people dumb enough to help push their agenda outlined above.
I’m not both sidesing this but voters in general aren’t as educated on the candidates as they should be.
In the past I have been guilty of this same party line voting but for D instead of R. Now I’d argue doing that for democrats is better than doing it for republicans but that aligns with my ideology so of course I’d think that.
I’d bet that the majority of Americans couldn’t tell you how their representative in Congress has voted on most issues.
Sure they can assume based on party lines but that’s an assumption and not everyone in office votes straight down lines.
I’d say that this is even more the case for state representatives.
There are lots of signs for state reps during the election cycle but then unless you seek out information on them you usually don’t hear about the state reps until the next election cycle.
That’s great for you but the reality is many people aren’t as informed, especially when it comes to local elections.
A lot of people don’t follow politics, even in their own district.
If it weren’t for the jokes half probably wouldn’t even know who their Congressman is.
Yes, he probably has actual supporters too but I imagine not that many.
