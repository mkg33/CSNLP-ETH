On the other hand, only homeowners get to pick their stoves, and if you can't afford an induction stove you certainly can't afford a home.
The top end of gas and induction ranges are actually in similar price ranges ($9k), and in any case nobody's going to be buying high-end anything if they're worried about the cost.
Mid-range units are in the $12k range for gas vs $23k for induction, and budget induction ranges start at a little over $1k.
As for performance, you might just be confusing those now-common flat-glass-top coil ranges for true induction.
If the burner gets hot even with nothing on it, it's not an induction range.
And any induction stove should perform comparably to gas (IMO superior, but there's a lot of room for personal preference there).
You can afford a house and not be able to afford a high end induction stove that may be comparable to gas.
As long as you can get together a down payment a mortgage isnâ€™t much more than rent, and the down payment can easily burn through extra money that you would need to buy a high end induction range.
