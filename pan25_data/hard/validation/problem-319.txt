They didn't need to keep anything from him.
He wouldn't read it anyway.
I doubt it would have made the cut when his staff condensed the daily briefing down to thing that Trump would actually read.
It honestly wouldn’t surprise me if he wasn’t paying attention in briefings and didn’t know they were there.
But he also lies so frequently that it could go either way.
What a chump and a chronic liar.
In addition to Chinese balloons flying over the USA during Trump's reckless and destructive SINGLE term as a failed president, Trump and his lackeys also handed Afghanistan over to the Taliban by locking the Afghanistan government out of the withdrawal negotiations and releasing Taliban terrorists who had been imprisoned.
Then he withdrew all but 2,500 US troops out and basically handed over the keys to the car in the ditch to Biden.
Trump extended the pullout just long enough to drop the failure into Biden's lap and the Trump Administration refused to aid in the presidential transition of power.
Hillary might not be perfect, but I doubt that she would've ran the country into the ground as horribly as Trump did and maybe Trump would've just faded away after losing...
