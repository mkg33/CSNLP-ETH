Maybe this will finally help with all those suicides at my local VA Hospital parking lot.
They happened way too often, and I think they all chose that specific spot as a cry for help for their fellow veterans.
I had a coworker who was an Iraq veteran who used to "joke" that if he was gonna do it, he would do it in the VA parking lot.
I was never really sure how serious he was.
Thankfully things are looking up for him, he has a fiancé now and things are looking up... but it's in the grim shadow of his fiancé's former husband, also a veteran, having committed suicide himself.
It's kinda sad how casual veterans talk about suicide and there not being enough support for them in civilian life.
They’ve known people who have committed suicide because of the lose-lose situation they feel like they’re in.
Lifelong military dedication can get taken away if you admit you need help.
So very, very sad.
The god you believe in says that humans aren’t perfect, which includes a human brains ability to emotionally regulate and balance itself.
Literally in the bible, but you call someone not being perfect and needing to reach out for help being coddled?
So who is wrong here, god or you?
Religion isn’t real, so talking to a chaplain is worthless, which means prayer is equally worthless.
I know, because my family and I prayed our hearts out to save one of my parents from cancer.
Didn’t work, but it did teach me that god isn’t real.
So there is that.
