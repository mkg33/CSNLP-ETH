The right believes that emotion is irrational, that the ideal form of rationality is to be in a state of pure apathy.
The police regularly arrest innocent people, knowing they've done nothing, JUST to "get them in the system."
And once they're in it, if they so much as sneeze at a place that later becomes a crime scene, boom, they're on the list of suspects, and the cops will treat that as proof of criminality.
Anyone who thinks I'm being remotely hyperbolic about this doesn't even stop to consider that we as a society have already accepted and glossed over that the cops keep a permanent record of innocent people who at one point or another may have been suspected of a crime.
Anyone who's ever been a suspect, innocent or otherwise, who has their fingerprints and DNA in the system, is checked EVERY time they run crime scene prints and DNA.
There is NO mechanism for a wrongly accused person to have their data removed from the system and there is NO national movement to prevent cops from holding onto people's data after they've been cleared of wrongdoing or after they've served their time in prison.
And we as a society just accept that.
Because when cops first started doing it, no one stepped up and said how fucked up it is.
50 years from now, our children might accept cops having menstrual data as just The Way Things Are, without even considering that it doesn't have to be like that.
I want to know who thinks it’s a good idea to allow law enforcement to have access to women’s menstrual data so I can get a good laugh.
