God damn, if I recall this has happened in the past too.
During the 2010 Ahmedabad (located in the Gujarat state) heat wave I'm pretty sure the temperature reached somewhere around 46°C and above and many people died.
"In April 2022, India suffered a punishing early spring heat wave that saw temperatures in New Delhi, topping 46 degrees Celsius.
".
Yeah, get used to it.
As NASA tracks the worlds climate changes by satellite and measures the carbon in the atmosphere we will see more countries reporting this.
Not to mention the tripling of multibillion weather events.
Interesting that the climate scientist were able to predict this decades ago, it’s almost like they were right….
It's not like no one knows here the impact pollution has on global warming.
Mainly the CO2 particulate matter is affected due to crops being burnt by small farmers for agriculture in the winter season when there is a downward force of winds from Punjab to Delhi and increases the particulates overall.
Among many other steps.
Ofcourse it'll take more time to even out as cities are growing and so is their consumption in the form of energy leading to higher levels of pollution but no one is ignoring the fact of it.
