Yeah this study was done a while back and the exact amount varies from country to country.
The idea or theory in essence is that when you have plenty for recreation, core needs, and peace of mind, this dramatically lowers our stress and takes us out of fear/survival mode.
It would definitely have to be adjusted for inflation ðŸ˜… Also, $100k/yr in San Francisco and New York is totally different than $100k/yr in a rural area with low property cost like Arkansas.
Not to burst your bubble, but there are already studies on this ðŸ˜… According to the studies, happiness does increase with more money, BUT only up to about $70k-$100k per year in the developed world (depends on the country).
When you have money to save, invest, vacation, and to meet all your needs with ease like food, Healthcare, shelter, etc.
happiness increases dramatically.
Beyond that, it is just the addition of zeros.
Conclusion: Money doesn't buy happiness, but being poor causes misery ðŸ˜•.
These "leaders" see increases year after year with out fail they get bonuses that would be life changing for regular people and yet money doesn't buy happiness.
People need to wake up and stop buying the decades of bullshit from business leaders and politicians.
Don't believe the propaganda, these people and their companies should have paid the fair share from the start.
