America needs both but its widely known that the US needs more immigrants and has been immigrant dependent on labor for quite a long time now.
Even if we paid every single American a fair, livable wage, there would still be a labor shortage without immigrants, legal or illegal.
Even if every single American had a job with a fair and livable wage, there would still be a labor shortage.
This is not a black/white situation like so many people seem to think.
It's quite shortsighted to think our labor shortage will be fixed by simply employing every single employable American.
I'm not saying we shouldn't have a higher minimum wage, I'm saying that's not going to fix our labor shortage.
Immigrants could solve the labor shortage and also help with the social security short fall.
We have too many olds and they're not dying as young as they used to...
The only way to support them is more young people paying into the system... Birthrates have trended down for awhile now, so where are those young people going to come from?
The folks over on the high horse will tell you the young folks will come from taking away birth control and young women doing their "duty" by having children...
