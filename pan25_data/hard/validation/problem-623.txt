There is no comparison between that and Russia's Ukraine invasion but that doesn't stop those who are deranged from trying to make one.
Ukraine is paying a huge price in lives, its allies are paying a huge price in support, and it's not always possible to hold Russia back on every front.
But Ukraine has been gradually winning the battle for territory even though it is slow and costly.
It's a difficult but still positive picture for Ukraine's war effort.
One eye-opener is to look at how many major Soviet technological achievements had their origin in Ukraine.
Despite all the catastrophes and relocations, Ukraine SSR wasn't just providing manpower to the Soviet Union.
It was an integral part of Soviet learning, research, and production as well.
Ukraine is like Russia's California when it comes to population, land, sea, tech, agriculture, industry, trade, and so on.
It's much more than a buffer zone, it's a cornerstone of any larger plans for a globally relevant Russian empire.
When talking about buffers, you have to realize that what Russia has been trying to do (along with other things) since the Empire has been to put as much land between it's border and Moscow, because everything between is flat.
It peaked during the Cold War when the Warsaw pact essentially pushed the USSR sphere of influence to Germany.
However, with the collapse of the USSR, Russia found its border much closer to home, along with an encroaching NATO.
The Baltics are a prime example of that.
So that's why Russia has been so intent on influencing governments in Eastern Europe.
If Ukraine joined NATO it would massively increase Russia's border with NATO on the Great European Plain, which it simply can't have because that is a feasting ground for tanks and armored vehicles.
The purpose of supplying Ukraine with a Western fighter would be to force Putin to accept the proposal or risk losing all the land it seized from Ukraine.
The purpose of supplying Ukraine with a Western fighter is to make Russia's losses unsustainable.
With air superiority, Ukraine can attack Russian forces from the air.
If all this equipment were required, Ukraine would not be pleading for Western fighters.
Russia's air defense system might not be that good.
At the very least, Western fighters would prevent Ukranian ground forces from being attacked from the air.
The West should supply Ukraine with a Western fighter plane.
The type to be determined.
This should be done ASAP so Ukrainians can begin training.
The fighter will give Ukraine air superiority.
With Ukrainian air superiority, Russia cannot win the war and could lose it.
This could force Putin to accept the peace proposal.
This is the peace proposal which should be offered to Russia.
Russia will only be permitted to occupy land it seized from Ukraine before the invasion although the land would still legally belong to Ukraine.
The UN would be obligated to defend Ukraine if Russia attacks again.
