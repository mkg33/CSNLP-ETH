The biggest issue isnt that we are supporting ukraine, its that we are giving more then all of europe combined.
Like why are we giving more in aid to ukraine then europe as a whole when europe has so much more to lose if russia were to win?
Ya if we didnâ€™t help ukraine right now, Russia would win & then start going after other countries - and the US would inevitably be pulled into the war.
Helping Ukraine now is definitely the smart way to go.
I do think Russia should get support, but there is just too vast a landmass to show the citizenry what's going on in Ukraine.
Part of what shocked the Germans into contrition (aside from complete and utter defeat) was being toured through the camps.
Economically crippling a nation and beheading its government, then leaving after the war is over, usually leads to something worse down the line?
But as others are saying, this is a purchase in military equipment for the fulfillment of a geopolitical goal.
The US gets to hobble one of its geopolitical rivals without so much as getting its hands dirty.
Depending on the magnitude of Russia's defeat may have an impact on their ability to manipulate global oil prices.
I receive: the defeat of my longest contemporary geopolitical rival and consequently a reduction of their control over the global oil market.
