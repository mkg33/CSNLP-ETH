Allotting the whole 900B defense budget to it isn't going to fix it, it'll just increase the budget of a broken system by 20%.
Americans will get healthcare they fix their currently broken system that costs twice as much as a not-broken system.
universal healthcare would cost American less than the current system.
There is no financial obstacle to achieving it, its not a binary choice between military spending and healthcare.
Yep the obstacle is purely political will not financial.
The US gov already spends more as a percentage of per capita GDP on healthcare than the likes of Canada, the UK or France.
America already spends more on healthcare as a percentage of the federal government budget than any major European country.
America is cross subsidising the war, but if you insist on looking at this through one dimension you'll never see a bigger picture.
If you want the answer to this difficult question of how do they do it?
Then it isn't hard.
Compare the tax burden between countries like Denmark, and the Netherlands sometime to America.
