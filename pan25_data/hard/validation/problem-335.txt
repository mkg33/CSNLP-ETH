Let’s make sure that those who bluff are aware that they can’t count on our silence to give their performance-art-piece space.
How to say you don’t understand Dutch constitutional law without saying you don’t understand Dutch constitutional law.
There are a lot of examples of for example students that were hard of hearing failing a hearing part of a language exam and not being allowed a sign language or writing alternative and such.
And judges have said those students would be better aided with this change to our constitution.
Multiple judges have already said this will help them in certain legal cases as the specification allows them to point at certain edge cases regarding disability and sexuality discrimination (but ESPECIALLY disability discrimination) and tilt them in favour of the disabled party.
Curious about the balance between banning discrimination on grounds of sexualising or disability whilst protecting religious freedom.
Curious because my country is currently attempting to thread the needle on this to prevent discrimination but protecting religious expression.
Seems almost impossible.
