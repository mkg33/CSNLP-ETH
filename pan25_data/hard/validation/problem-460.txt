There are many differences, Japan made the transition to high tech production over the course of decades, and China is already middle income trapping itself with the worst demographic situation in human history.
But who knows what the future holds.
But for now... Russia isn't getting much oomph from China's processers, which is what we are all discussing here.
I guess Russia's plan of "we will just buy everything from China and India now" is failing.
Especially since China also creates large problems for russian ship cargo certification, since they refuse to accreditate russian cargo and lowered the import of cars and electronics into Russia.
In the recent past, Russia has also restricted the export of some of their most advanced military technology to China, who has otherwise been their largest importer of military equipment.
Regardless of any diplomatic rhetoric from China's leadership or any Western assessments of their "alliance" with Russia, the two countries are merely opportunistic trading partners and never true allies.
