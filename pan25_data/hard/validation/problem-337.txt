The term Genocide has a very specific definition as determined by the United Nations.
(www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml).
Exactly!
This is no place for Euphemisms, Russia is straight up commiting genocide.
it's also what Ottomans/Turks did when they enslaved Greece.
Kidnapped children and brainwashed them to be Genitsaroi, soldiers made to hunt down and fight their own kind.
Apologies for being pedantic here, I agree with this statement of yours, which is why I am refering to the definition determined by the United Nations and not a colloquial understanding of the word.
Taking away children of a group in order to prevent them from being raised into their initial culture is an act of genocide.
Killing members of a specific group is of course also an act of genocide.
Genocide is about eliminating a nation (the people, not the state) or ethnic group.
That can be done by killing them, but could also be done by sterilizing them and waiting for natural death.
Or, in this case, removing their children and raising them to be a member of another nation or group.
Or many other variations.
