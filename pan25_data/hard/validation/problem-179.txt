Will there ever be a resolution to determine the fate of Nagorno-Karabakh / Artsakh?
I can't imagine that the Armenian and Azerbaijani people want to be in this situation forever.
Honestly I don't think Armenia is right to cede parts of Azerbaijan.
That's not how international borders work.
You can't vote yourself out of a country.
Azerbaijan is being despicable in their practice tho.
TL;DR: area with high Armenian populated voted to cede from Azerbaijan (think Crimea maybe?)
and then Azerbaijan shelled the shit out of Armenian biggest city and Armenians massacred 1k people evacuating some town.
They got good until 2016.
It doesn't explain why Artsakh would cede to Armenia though.
Anytime an independent country cedes to another I can't help but smell bullshit.
I think big shame is on the international community for not recognizing Artsakh even after it met the de facto country state and was self governing.
This could have probably prevented the whole conflict and create a buffer state between two cultural enemies.
