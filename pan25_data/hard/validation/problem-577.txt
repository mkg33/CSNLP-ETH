Exactly this.
Kaliningrad and their close proximity to Belarus effectively make them cut off from the rest of the NATO country, should a war break out.
The only way would be to support them via the sea (and air).
It's only 100km wide though.
Lithuania - Kaliningrad border is almost 3 times longer, and Lithuania - Belarus border is 6.7 times longer.
The Baltic front might only be a few hundred km long but Belarus has significant exposure to an assault from the Polish side, with significant population centres not far from the border.
I'm not saying you are wrong, and your points are well made and thought out, but it would seem very stupid to drag Belarus into a war where there is clearly only one outcome.
Lukashenko is a lot of things, including a survivor, but he does not appear to be a total idiot.
You say "Belarus is only an independent country on paper, as long as Lukashenko, who is only propped up by russian interference, is in charge."
Another way of looking at it is that Belarus is only an ally and vassal state of Russia as long as Lukashenko is there.
I take your point but the deterrent of NATO is that it would not be a simple Baltics v Russia and Belarus fight.
Ukraine is doing what NATO doesnâ€™t have the balls to do, the least we can do is supply them with offensive weapons so they can take the fight to Russia.
Problem is, them "staying out of the conflict" still means they will let russian troops attack from their territory, just as they are doing in Ukraine now, while lying that they don't participate.
But the thing is, if they don't do that, then Russia will just annex them and do it anyway.
Belarus is only an independent country on paper, as long as Lukashenko, who is only propped up by russian interference, is in charge.
If an invasion of the Baltics were to happen, you can be damn sure Belarus would participate at the very least as a russian staging ground.
Question is what would NATO do then.
They could absolutely wipe every military asset in Belarus out in a counter-invasion, but would they call their bluff of "staying out" as russian troops are pouring out of Belarus into NATO territory?
I think the difference is using Belarus as a staging post for an invasion of Ukraine (largely under funded and unprepared military) is very different from using it as a staging post for attacking NATO allies.
