Yes, it does sound reasonable.
Rebellion is not the same as righteousness.
You claim to know they are just righteous?
Because that DOES sound ridiculous.
That is a stupid argument.
There are 320M SUVs in the world.
They will never make the chance higher than a natural car accident ... and don't tell me people are considering not buying a car because of the probability of a car accident.
Pointless and counter productive.
There are 320M SUVs in the world (from google), deflate the tires of 900 means nothing except now more fossil fuel is going to be burnt to service these 900 SUVs.
The funny thing is that deflated tires means a lot more fossil fuel consumption, so these people are obviously very uneducated in how things really work.ðŸ«£.
So they ran around and deflated people's tires because they're as big a bunch of idiots as the ones who glued themselves to the highway and got laughed at a few weeks ago.
Did they?
It looks like they just got everyone talking about how big a bunch of clowns they are, usually with comparisons being drawn between them and other clownsthat either use soup or glue to be clowns.
