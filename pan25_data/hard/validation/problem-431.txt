In fact, it would likely prevent people from dressing in certain period appropriate outfits just because said outfits are seen by today's society as "belonging to the opposite gender."
At one point in history, tights and high heels were seen as garments for men.
If a man walked out in those today, they'd be said to be wearing "women's clothing."
So if I, a man, were to wear that to a gathering of people dressed in period costumes and a few of us danced to music (period appropriate, of course), would that count as a drag show?
It looks like it would even though it's obviously not.
It's also used to rally their base to get more extreme right politicians in office and more extreme right judges in place.
Once they get enough extreme right judges in the right places, the courts will suddenly decide that people don't have a right to be LGBTQ and that politicians can definitely persecute them as much as they like.
Remember that the right pushed for 50 years to repeal Roe before they succeeded.
They're willing to make incremental steps over the next 50 years if it means that they can dial LGBTQ rights back 100 years.
LGBT Americans and allies, you cannot exist as free and equal people in the society that conservatives want to build.
You cannot exist in their society.
They won't let you.
It's performative.
It's a power game.
Conservatives use the indomitable power of the state to intimidate and instill fear in the LGBT community.
