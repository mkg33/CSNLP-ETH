CBS caters to anyone with a pulse, it's not some special news organization catering to the geographically minded.
The average American has about as much reason to know about British Columbia as knowing about Chiapas, it's just not a topic that comes up in daily life.
It's a rather normal point to make, political subdivisions of a different country are rarely taught in school.
Stating a Canadian province is more than enough to get the point across that some part of Canada is decriminalizing drugs.
Just take a look at the link I sent, there are still plenty of illicit substances that would benefit from similar decriminalisation.
Yet because they aren’t actively killing people they stay illicit.
What sense does that make?
I didn’t say this is a bad thing, I just find it frustrating that it’s being done piecemeal and only after significant duress.
This is clearly not something the government particularly wants to do.
Which is the problem.
So small amounts of addictive and potentially deadly drugs are decriminalised but the more safe and therapeutically beneficial recreational drugs stay illicit?
What type of message does that send?
Seems confused and half arsed.
A desperate last minute policy that clearly has not been thought over much.
