No, they want to make it easier for Republicans to challenge election results when they lose.
Hey, must be voter fraud, we were ahead by 10 points in the polls etc.
Rigging polls so they can claim the election is rigged when they lose?
Doesn’t seem far fetched since every election they’ve lost has been “rigged” for going on 6 years now.
Long way of saying we’d all be better if we just ignored polls and predictions and just voted (which I’ve already done!
).
Yep.
Although, to contradict myself a bit, and maybe this is a bit conspiratorial, but I never actually believed the secret trump voters existed.
These people if anything are the vocal minority.
They put trump all in your face at every opportunity.
So I think the whole idea was ludicrous, and the more probable scenario is that they simply stuffed some ballots.
Nobody really investigated it or questioned it, which was always insane to me.
This is also why I believe trump is so adamant that the election was stolen, because he has the reciept from 2016.
I want to add a lot of women might say they are voting R but will go in the booth and vote D. Much like the fabled “secret trump voters” in 2016.
Also, in midterms, likely voters don’t always go.
A lot of the pro-life people might just sit this one out now that they got roe overturned, and also trump isn’t on the ballot.
People who have already voted have leaned heavily democrat by the largest margins ever.
The polls are people who say they are likely to vote.
The thing is, in midterms, they don’t always actually do it.
