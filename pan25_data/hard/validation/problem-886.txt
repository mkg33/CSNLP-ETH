They were working on birth control for men--which makes way more fucking sense than the other way around--but decided that it wasn't feasible because the side effects were "too severe".
The side effects?
the same exact ones women get from birth control.
Yeah it was stuff like acne, depression, moodswings and weight gain.
Imagine having to deal with that on a regular basis.
ðŸ˜ž.
Uh uh.
No.
We are NOT going to let this pass.
If it does, I can't see the SC government making it much longer before it's overrun by half of its population and chaos starts.
Not to mention the cost that the death penalty in general has on the economy compared to being imprisoned for life.
Can you imagine how many court battles there would be while women and their doctors sit in death row waiting for their arbitrary execution like it's Henry the 8th all over again?
Women are already dying from Roe v Wade being overturned but I can't imagine a place where they are killed outright for choosing NOT to give birth.
If this happens then we are essentially no longer a democracy, just a theocracy.
