And America doesn't have superfund sites?
You profited from environmental destruction for the last century, so you're virtue signaling as a hypocrite.
As I said, China industrialised to sell to Western nations, we've just outsourced pollution so it's out of sight.
You don't care about the environment if you're that naive to those facts and avoiding responsibility.
I didn't make it political, just showed how weak minded you are to blame others without acknowledging what America has done.
Sure China has a lot to learn, hopefully they will, but it doesn't sound like you can.
Most ppl will get way more radiation from an airplane flight than swimming on that coastline.
Radiation scares are often paid for by oil and gas companies because it's a direct threat to their industry.
It's the oil companies pushing the nukes, they know they are boondoggles that will take forever to build, in the meantime we keep burning oil.
Russia is a prime example, they want you to buy their uranium, waste money on nuclear power and keep being reliant on them for both.
