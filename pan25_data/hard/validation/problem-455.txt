I know there are large cultural differences, but it seems like the DR should slowly annex a little slice of Haiti, modernize it, add functioning government, and when that area meets certain benchmarks for stability, add another slice etc.
Haiti is too failed to pull itself out of this by itself unfortunately and all the aid being dumped in doesn't do a thing without a functional government to administer it and build a future where it can be more independent.
When it comes to Haiti, it's not that the world hasn't tried, it's just that it's such a messed up Gordian Knot of interconnected problems that even the best development planners in the world working together with enormous budgets haven't been able to figure it out.
The perennial problem is the deadly combination of aid dependence, political instability, and lack of economic opportunity.
Every solution that's been come up with fails because of the interconnectedness of these three problems.
Then, as the new government is also unable to convince foreign powers to give a fuel subsidy, the same guy who used to be the last government's political enforcer has his gang seize the fuel depot, and offer it back in exchange for a power sharing agreement.
But what they're really asking for is a cut of the aid money again.
And in the meanwhile, with the fuel depot down, the economy is tanked again and economic opportunity decreases even further.
