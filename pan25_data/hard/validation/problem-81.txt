It’s almost as if…and stick with me here cause this gets weird, but it’s almost as if the whole war started because Russia wanted Ukraine, or parts of it at the very least, and Ukraine didn’t want to give them that.
It bothers me that so many people are trying to use this as a example of Ukraines aggressiveness and unwillingness to make peace when it’s Russia who is unwilling to compromise.
Another common theme is Putin refusing to negotiate with Ukraine directly, and instead mostly referring to possible negotiations with "the West."
It plays into treating Ukraine as if it weren't a sovereign nation, and instead just a piece of territory that Russia is "reclaiming.
".
Which is why it's not happening.
Russian people are too used to being slaves, misinformed and apathetic that there won't be enough numbers or will to force a change in power.
And not even the oligarchs can as well, as Putin can easily have them killed and replaced.
Long term?
Maybe not.
Short term?
Until Europe and the rest of the world completely turn away Russian gas, and Russia still has allies willing to ship it weapons, Russia can just keep bombing Ukrainian cities and be comfortable that Ukraine cannot retaliate cause of nukes.
