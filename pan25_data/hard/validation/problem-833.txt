It's literally all they have, though.
The enormous corporate tax breaks are still in the national zeitgeist, due to inflation and cost of living rising while people are aware they got screwed on taxes, so they can't pass another tax "reform" yet.
And taking away women's rights wasn't as popular in reality as when it was a rallying cry for them.
They're spent re policy/legislation/planning.
All they have is the culture war, and they expected Biden's admin to be as chaotic as Trump's, partially because they swore to interfere in it as much as possible.
But Biden's been passing good legislation for the people, and his admin is too vanilla/scandal-free for them to have anything but Hunter Biden and his massive dong.
So, the claim on the part of the republicans is that hunter biden acted as a “bag man” for Joe Biden for the entirety of his political career.
Which, if they were able to prove it, would be sort of a big deal.
The issue is, with the laptop, nothing has come out that concretely shows that.
All republicans are doing is pointing to the numerous high paying jobs Hunter held, and then pointing to the laptops evidence that his personal life was a mess and he was likely not a competent employee at the time.
The inference they want to make is that Joe Biden was getting kickbacks through his son, however they have yet to show any proof that makes that connection, even if a lot of people on the right seem to be making that leap.
I for one, hope Biden lets them run all their investigations, lets them throw as much muck as they can at him, then pulls out of 2024 at the latest possible moment and says “nah, I never had any intention of running again.” That would make their whole charade pointless, but it would take all their time and leave them no time to build a fresh scandal around the real 2024 candidate.
If I was Hunter Biden, I’d show up, flip off every single Republican in Congress, stand up, walk out, and dare them to do anything about it.
Explain to me how a non-governmental individual with only a familial connection to the government falls under the purview of the House.
