Well, have any paintings been destroyed?
Do these protesters keep accidentally targeting paintings with protective covers like they're in some comedy skit?
Its interesting how much time people spend criticising the protestors instead of the oil companies in these threads when literally no art has been damaged by these protests.
I think people on reddit just hate liberal young people.
It is literally one of the most effective protests ever invented because its getting massive play in the press without ever doing any damage to any property.
No piece of art has been damaged in this series of protests.
You'd notice if it were because it would be in the headline like this "Protestors destroy art to combat climate change".
They could start by gluing themselves to practically anything else high-profile that relates to climate change instead of artworks.
That's something they haven't tried yet.
Doing something that makes their movement look stupid and turns it into a punchline is worse than doing nothing.
That makes it even dumber, because people are still going to get angry about what sounds like damage to the paintings.
So now they need an extra step to explain it was fake vandalism before they can even get around to explaining how real or fake vandalism of paintings is supposed to relate to climate change.
Yeah, and convinced lots of people that the climate movement is a bunch of attention-starved narcissists who would rather destroy art and put peopleâ€™s lives in danger by blocking emergency vehicles than being of any use to humanity.
The only awarenes raised here is that these people are entitled gutless scumbags and that their cause is championed by imbecilles.
