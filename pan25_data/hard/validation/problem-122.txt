“A new study from academic researchers found that 66.5 percent of all bankruptcies were tied to medical issues —either because of high costs for care or time out of work.
An estimated 530,000 families turn to bankruptcy each year because of medical issues and bills, the research found.”.
Privatized medical care is not a solution and we simply don’t care about people who cannot afford or who have their lives ruined not by a medical emergency but by the bill sent to them - regardless of insurance or not.
You realize the ones trying to turn it into the American healthcare system are the ones that will majorly profit from it due to their own personal investments in health companies... Just admit you're okay with poor people being unable to afford decent healthcare...
Our poor people pay less taxes too...and if poor enough, get free socialized healthcare...subsidized by the taxes of the more well off...its literally the same thing with different words.
Hell the us is higher in per capita spending on public services, without public medical, than most european countries are, with public medical.
We also have lower poverty and homeless rates than most of them.
Wait wut?
Socialized medicine causes medical staff to feel underpaid, go on strike, and leave patients in the lurch?
No way?
