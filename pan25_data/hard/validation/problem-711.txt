And my argument still stands....the chaebols of SK are corrupt, SK used to be corrupt like any other asian country.
At the lower levels, the corruption has gone down, but at the higher levels, it is thriving.
And, economic growth will later be the answer to corruption after some time, at least at the lower levels, just like how it happened in SK.
I come from a country that is deeply affected by south east asias politics.
And in my country there is a belief system that there won't be any development until we completely eradicate corruption.
I think that is a silly assumption.
As long as the percentage of corruption isn't detrimentally hindering percentage of economic development, we are ok.
And did I mention I stayed in SK for a year, I am invested in that country in more ways than one, definitely more than any average reddit user.
south korea is proof to all third world countries that you can be unbelievably corrupt and also be a developed country as long as you have an open economic market and there are no civil wars.
Someone should make a game of thrones west wing based on all the political corruption in South Korea, their news stories are so hierarchical when you read about their government.
That show would be lit.
