But, the deal isn't final.
It's been proposed, and they are waiting for a response.
Most recently, they were asked to submit additional information, but no one knows if the deal will even be accepted.
In the deal, there is stipulation that in the event that there is too much overlap in markets, they would create a different company not run by Kroger or Albertsons to operate the stores not allowed to be included.
It's still less market share than what Walmart has.
I think combined Kroger & Albertsons would make up a total 16% of the grocery market share, where Walmart is like 20 or 22%?
I think it should be investigated but Walmart is 1 by far in grocery revenue.
Maybe they mean stores?
Also wonder since kroger is union and Walmart is not.
And here I thought Kroger was the least shitty of the "regular tier" grocery chains.
Guess they're all just terrible employers with bad track records.
No way Kroger and Albertsons should be allowed to merge.
Albertsons and Safeway both got worse after they merged.
Are we so stupid we will allow it to happen again?
