I thought Russia was recruiting in Africa, turns out theyâ€™re holding African students studying in Russia hostage with threats of cancelling scholarships/debt trapping to force them to fight in a war.
Someone asked on r/myfriendwantstoknow this past September about whether "their friend" studying in Russia should be worried about being forcibly drafted into the Russian Army despite being a foreign national who was only there for university.
People gave him a lot of different advice, ranging from "no it's crazy to worry about that" to "run while you can.
".
Well said.
You and I know that, but the "unify the Russias" justification Putin used to drum up his base denied that reality.
From his own nationalist perspective, by recruiting foreigners, Putin is a traitor to his own nation.
The richest US citizens can't exercise half the arbitrary, despotic power of the richest Russians, including Putin.
Putin and his FSB cronies face little to no legal limits on what they demand from the workers.
As with the Bolsheviks, there is no true right to independent labor unions.
The rule of law exists in America, and it is not a right to be dismissed lightly.
Democracy provides more of an authentic voice for working class woes than top down tyranny.
