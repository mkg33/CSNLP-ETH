Remember that time they crashed a plane into a US spy plane, then ransomed off the crew while dismantling what was left of the plane?
Remember when the chinese air force crashed into a US navy plane, forcing an emergency landing and china seized the aircraft and detained and interrogated the crew for ten days?
Remember in 2001 when China flew a J-8 into an American AWACS, forcing it to land in China, and then when America said hey, give our plane back, we instead watched from surveillance satellites how the Chinese dismantled the plane, and then sent it back to us in pieces when they were done, and then they copied the whole damn thing for their air force..?
Of course China wants chips.
Russia wants chips.
Everyone does.
No one goes it alone, right now.
No one can today.
The US is bringing more chip fab back home, but those projects are a decade out, and all it's going to do is make us more internationally shock resistant, not independent.
If China and Russia want to do it alone...
They just... can't...
Both countries demographics are inverted pyramids - they have more older people than younger people.
Russia has a population of 143 million, but only 8.4 million between 20-40, and Putin has pledged to send up to 2 million of those to die in a war.
There isn't going to be a Russia in 10 years.
China isn't faring much better, by 2050 their population is going to reduce by HALF.
There isn't going to a China anymore.
They don't have enough people left, neither of them, to innovate, because they don't have enough people left to hold their own shit together in the first place.
Nothing about China is what the propaganda would lead you to believe.
They're not an economic powerhouse because they're entirely dependent.
Their economy only exists by the good graces of the US IN THE FIRST PLACE.
China is an empire over conquered regions, they were never unified until recent history.
The China you know today has only existed for 70 years, though as they tell it, they've always been this singularly large country.
The only reason we fostered their economy is to pull them away from Russia, which we did, and it worked.
Since the Soviet collapse, China has been industrializing in 30 years what took the US nearly 200 years.
They are entirely dependent upon globalization to make anything work.
There was no value in innovation, they needed money, they needed infrastructure, they needed industrialization.
30 years is just not a lot of time.
