And also a lot of democracies had a shitton of religious cults in the governement, US for example has a rampanting problem of Cristian cults trying to take over.
I just think Christians are just as autoritarians and have seen Christians being like these regimem.
The point is, this ideas can spread mostly because religion creates a f√©rtile enviroment for then, if we teached people to think, to analyze and use method to build world views we would be faar more advanced as Societies (but to be fair its not a religion but a power thing).
Instead we get irrational humans with ground beliefs that defy reality and logic.
Those are religious (at least to this zealotry level) are so wrapped up in that fear of nothingness that they won't listen to reason.
The only way religion will ever go away is to stop teaching it and as long as the churches remain, that too will continue, sadly.
Ironically, this kind of shit is going to just galvanize the protestors as well as push a lot of them away from religion.
The problem is religion is founded on fear.
God and heaven was invented because at the time life on Earth was so shit those in power needed a way to keep the rabble in line by promising them if they didn't cut their heads off, there would be a paradise waiting for them in death.
