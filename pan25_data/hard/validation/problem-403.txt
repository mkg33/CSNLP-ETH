To further your point, one of the primary concerns with specified donors is that any potential donor who knows the child or their parents personally may intentionally lie or withold vital information during the screening process to ensure their blood is used, which could lead to a higher risk of blood that could be dangerous to the baby.
Still, I am seeing at least two instances where these parents had access to clear information that their child's health was in imminent or likely danger, and in both of these instances they chose the option that endangered the child.
Pointlessly, in the case of taking the baby to the court.
Now, I will acknowledge that the Justice stated he believed the parents to be loving and want the best for the baby multiple times.
The cynical part of me believes this may be motivated in part to try to soothe the reactionary rage of the anti-vaxx protestors, but it is also entirely possible that with the full facts available, the judge does sincerely believe this to be true.
Seriously, they're so hostile \- I imagine primarily because one of the main believed reasons for believing in conspiracy theories is a desire to feel better than everyone else.
That you are part of an elite minority who are the only people who are smart enough to figure out the real secrets of the world, and everyone else is a dumb sheeple for not bowing down before your shining brilliance.
