for sure, obviously a lot of the price is tied to russian aggression in ukraine and them being sanctioned.
I'd argue that it wouldn't have mattered what the real cause is behind gas prices when one side of US politics pounces on the everything bad is democrats fault.
I understand thinking that way, but you have to remember it also dropped pretty low in 2016 when low gas prices would benefit the Democrats.
So the price inputs are a lot more complicated than simply "election year, price it to help Republicans".
If you think the Industry, the one that spent $12.4 million just in the 1st quarter of this year, would be below manipulating prices to feed the Republican talking point and make a few bucks in the process, then I don't know what else to say.
Politics, or the formation of policy, is just one of the factors that the Industry tries to guide, through lobbying and influencing election cycles through price manipulation.
My relative never had money, was pregnant at 17 and divorced in the early 60's, with a 6th grade education.
Meanwhile, Congressman Albert guided policy, among them was "Farm Price Supports", subsidies of certain crops.
At one time he was the Chair of the Agriculture committee.
So he guided policy for the government, helping to mold it.
Part of that policy was to avoid another dust bowl, overfarming land so that the soil becomes leeched of nutrients and blows away.
One of the solutions is nitrogen fixers, crops that replenish the soil of this vital nutrient.
The policy of subsidizing these crops, such as soybeans, peanuts, fava beans, etc.
became a way to provide an economic incentive to farmers to farm these specific crops.
I didn't say that.
Reread it again and see if it makes more sense.
If it doesn't, grab a sandwich or take a nap and come back to it to read again.
