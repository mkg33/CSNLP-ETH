I work at a research institution in Europe and we have seen a dramatic increase in applications from researchers and students from Ukraine, Russia, and Iran lately.
One recent Russian applicant straight up put in his motivation letter that he wanted to get out to avoid conscription.
I had a phone interview with a young woman from Iran who said that she just "wants to live in a country that is better for women."
It's really sad.
It was fascinating as a doc but also sad.
These people spoke excellent Estonian but they all said that they’d been abroad so long now that they couldn’t/wouldn’t come back and also that the Estonia they remembered or were told stories about didn’t really exist anymore, that it had been ruined by the Soviet experience.
Well, the Soviets counted all Estonians as Soviet citizens, even if they had manage to flee at one point during WWII.
Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians in exile were also pretty vocal about the annexation of the three countries, so they were seen as troublemakers.
Let’s not also forget that Soviets asked for refugees to be returned to them, and I think Sweden or Finland actually did do this with some former officers, IIRC.
One of the reasons people wanted to move away from Sweden and to places like Canada/USA/Australia (in addition to these countries having the immigration programs where you worked X number of years in some specific industry/area and then were allowed to stay indefinitely/become a citizen).
There’s a documentary about children who escaped with their parents.
They went to Germany and lived in a small town there, which was so crowded with Baltic refugees that Estonians had their own school, even university, there for a while.
And they stayed quite a long time - so long, in fact, that the UN supposedly started to get a bit angry with the Baltic refugees because they didn’t want to continue paying for their stay there and the Baltic refugees absolutely refused to be repatriated back to USSR (because obviously by that time, USSR had annexed their countries).
People even chose to basically die instead of being repatriated, because there were instances where someone’s family would go with the UN and there rumours that they had been forcibly repatriated basically.
I’m not sure if these stories were actually true or just rumours circling amongst the refugees, but there were fears that the UN and other humanitarian organisations expected to deal with the large number of refugees just kind of wanted to get rid of the problem and would just offload them to USSR.
