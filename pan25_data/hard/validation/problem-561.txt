This is why we need a multiparty, ranked choice system.
When you have a political duopoly, people just vote AGAINST a candidate instead of FOR a candidate and we call that dEmOcRaCy.
I'm worried that DeSantis will be superficially "not Trump" enough to lure swing and "Independent" voters back to voting for the side that wants to end democracy.
I just don’t think I would ever advocate Trump winning the nomination over him, even if it’s obvious DeSantis has much better odds of beating the democratic nominee.
If I’m going to claim Trump deserves to be disqualified, and republicans are complicit in his crimes, then I can’t well turn around and say I hope he wins the primary because it’s politically convenient.
Republicans still want Trump, the only issue they have with him is they now think he's unelectable, but if they thought he could win they'd be lining up behind him again.
The only reason they like DeSantis is because to them he represents Trumpism without Trump's guaranteed unelectability.
I wouldn't be so sure about that, I think he's already exposed to potential prosecution for human trafficking and/or kidnapping for his Martha's Vineyard stunt.
So far he's mainly been relying on Florida having his back (or him cowing them into not investigating him), but he doesn't have that same sway with other states and the federal government.
I wouldn't be surprised if someone does get indicted over that flight, but whether they'd then flip on DeSantis is anyone's guess.
Yeah, that guy is full of shit.
62 million conservatives voted for Trump over Hillary in 2016.
But then after seeing all the deranged, evil shit he did for four years, 74 million of them voted for him again in 2020 when Hillary was not on the ballot.
