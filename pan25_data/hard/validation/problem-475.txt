I think around 15-20% of republicans voters think Donald Trump was sent by the lord to save America from evil.
I’ve seen multiple people say Trump is one of the signs from the book of revelations.
It’s absolutely juicy to watch the gop seize on the Christian base, only to have them turn on them.
The reason they loved him is because all the others sounded like every politician, saying nothing, yet somehow reading a script.
Trump, obviously, broke the mold and won the election, which wouldn’t actually be a bad thing if it was based in sanity, but Trump was a maniac.
That came back to bite him when covid happened and we couldn’t have an orange rhinoceros destroying the White House anymore.
Denying the election was the cherry on top.
We saw the same Trump effect this election.
The thing about 2024 is, at minimum 15% of republicans see Trump as being ordained by God to save America.
Anyone who takes him on will attract their ire and protest.
Desantis is also incredibly weak in an actual fight, which will also help seal the factions of a split GOP.
Trump is also facing legal troubles that might incentivize him to run 3rd party (I like to dream).
American politics can be surprising, but it’s hard to imagine how this works out well for republicans.
Until a large chunk of big business and country club Republicans believe they have more in common with Democrats than the MAGA Minions, little will change.
For some of the very rich, who have their own jets to take their pregnant mistresses to countries still providing legal abortions, coalitions with pro-forced-birth White+Christian nationalists with no clue how national finances work makes a lot of sense.
