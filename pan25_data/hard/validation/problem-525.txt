Sure.
But only dictators who control their domestic media can get away with making such obviously false comments.
Hence why all the dictators seem to follow the same playbook.
It is quite remarkable how there seem to be a ridiculous dictator statement handbook they all use.
China uses it too, for example by recently blaming Ukraine for the war.
You are right, that's why China is considering sending ammo to russia to prolong this aggression.
China wants this war to continue and russia wants it as well, their goals are perfectly aligned (even so reasons may differ), so they can be called allies.
Besides, if Russia keeps running their soldiers into deathtraps, at some point, all chine needs to do is send unarmed trucks with Chinese flags to take large chunks of Ressource rich areas.
And by providing weapons to Russia they would not prolong this war, they would help Russia winning it and i don't think they would want that.
That's probably would change when Ukraine start their counteroffensive in the spring tho, but we'll see.
Why would you try to return normal Russia's trade relationships with EU when you can just use them as your colony to sell and buy whatever you want at your price?
Russia doesn't have allies (except for maybe DPRK), all who not directly oppose them just using them to get cheap resources.
