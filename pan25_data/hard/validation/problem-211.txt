I mean that does make sense.

Well she’s been great in pushing against voter suppression so hopefully she shores this up if she decides for another try.

It’s also worth mentioning that his campaign waited more than 48 hours to inform the public about his stroke which indicates they are probably not telling you the whole story in regard to his health or the other complications related to his stroke.
There is no way to tell if he will ever fully recover but most stroke victims do have long term effects.

That clear conflict of interest also indicates he and his team are hiding something.
