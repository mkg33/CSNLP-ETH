However, a few people have rose-tinted glasses about the era.
It turns out, those people were either enforcers or are children of enforcers under the regime.
If parents donâ€™t raise and discipline their children, and refuse to allow teachers to, what do you expect?
Most schools make a zoo look peaceful.
With incompetent parents sending uncivilized, undisciplined savage children to schools for teachers to contend with, who can blame them for leaving?
Teachers will continue to be the scapegoat for the unraveling family and quality of life brought about by the low wage hyper grind / dual income system.
I know this is the narrative being pushed, but teachers don't want to work in private schools because they pay even less than public schools and have even worse benefits.
The teachers you see in many private schools often have sketchy backgrounds, are not qualified to teach in public schools, or are straight up racist.
for their kids by , there will always be a public option.
So far it's just a proposal, so I'm really hoping that it goes nowhere.
Even the name of the bill is gross because it takes away rights from those that want union representation.
Hopefully teachers can get some of their colleagues that have been free riding to join.
I know in our county the union has done a great job to help teachers, so it's a shame that it doesn't have higher membership.
