Though if the Russians can keep a higher readiness, some of their ship based weapon systems (specifically their 30mm CIWS) are pretty ideal for taking out such drones.
It’s important to note that ships these days are explicitly designed with one of their key fundamentals to be able to defend themselves from such missiles.
The Russian navy has many issues, indeed, but they still do have a good deal of anti-missile tech.
Shooting missiles at these things will not guarantee a kill unless one use a hell of s lot of them.
What missiles are you talking about?
I only read that they were going to receive patriots, which are defensive surface to air missiles.
I mean logically, the states giving offensive first strike weapons to Ukraine would be the fastest way to WW3, but I’m not even American and you would know best.
Unfortunately, the current US admin is still reluctant to supply anything that can strike "Russian territory", even though the Ukrainians have been very clear they would not use American weapons to do this.
