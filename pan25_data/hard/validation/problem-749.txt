It is astounding how people think isreal = jewish.
Nah dude...a country is a country, and a people is a people.
A country can be informed/led by a religion or culture, but it is NOT that religion nor culture.
I wear the downvotes as a badge of honor because it shows just how many actual morons I triggered.
Get rekt intersectionalist snowflakes.
I am the real feminist.
This is the same reason you can Hate china and not be racist because you Love Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Chinese isnt only in one place, Jewish isnt only in one place.
Anti-semitism has literally no meaning in it that is connected to Israel.
you cant criticize israel without it being labeled “antisemitism!”: 25%ish of the world is muslims.
the grand mufti met with hitler to help him out before israel was ever founded... jews face more hate crimes per capita than anyone else in the usa.
the UNHRC condemns israel about as much as all other countries combined (46%).
it IS mostly anti semitism.
to shit sooo much on the one jewish country for defending itself against hamas who makes no distinctions between jews and israelis in its founding charter as stated above.
furthermore.
it is an offensive.
stupid.
strawman.
trope.
that i cant tell the difference.
as a jew.
when it is anti israel vs anti semitism.
apartheid/ethnic cleansing: 20% of israeli citizens are arabs and 10% of the israeli government is.
all israeli citizens have equal rights.
basically the only organization that makes this claim is amnesty international.
not that this whattaboutism matters but gaza is 0% jewish and like 1% christian, as are multiple other surrounding countries, some wont let you in if you have an israeli stamp on your passport.
palestinians are arabs, who decided to refer to themselves as palestinians after israel was formed in 1949, they have since been used as a prop by their neighboring arab countries (their brothers) rather than accepted in because the refugee crisis is a convenient scapegoat.
It's one of the many reasons they never declared independence, once they do they will never be able to attack Israeli citizens with impunity and the newly found Palestinian state will be sanctioned and ground to dust by Israeli military.
