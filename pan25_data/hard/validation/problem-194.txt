I think the term get rid of is a little extreme.
He's done far better with what he's been handed than I thought he would.
Fought for more out of BBB (fuck a Joe Manchin), the CHIPS Act, the child tax credit was good while it was around (again.....Manchin), his speech calling out the threat that we face from the inside was needed and great.
Could've done better with the rail workers, is trying like hell for what he said he'd do relating to student loans.
My only concern is his age.
Like what happens if something terrible happens to him on the campaign trail and it's too late to run another candidate.
I know that the odds are slim but we're finished if 2024 doesn't go right.
Have to hope the republicans keep running senatorial candidates who struggle at the state level.
I also feel like if it's not Biden the party heads will try to shove Pete down our throats and he's more of a centrist than Biden.
If Democratic voters truly want to get rid of Biden, then he will not be re-elected for a second term.
Simple.
However, I suspect they don’t actually want that.
I also don’t actually believe that it’s really an issue, truthfully.
We have people in these threads advocating for Warren to run, and she’s just seven years younger than Biden.
Bernie still has people wanting him to be president.
This is just the latest round of people who are upset that Biden won the primary even though most of them didn’t even participate.
It does not seem organic whatsoever.
Age is a superficial issue, one that should come secondary to job performance.
It’s just crazy to me that the argument is essentially, “Yeah he’s doing a remarkable job but he’s not young and hot”.
