China's economy can be shut down at a moments notice by the US, the US through allies and naval bases can blockade China, I'm guessing they want a stable source of resources and oil and russia is the best bet if things heat up in the pacific.
But let's take the nukes been launched off the table, no one's going to push into Russia, Russia would break up splinter and create even more chaos, at best they may be pushed back to the old border.
I say let China send the weapons to Russia, we can see how they operate and if it turns out anything like Russian weapons then we eliminating arsenal of 2 countries at the same time.
VOA: So, are you saying that there is indeed an indication that China is considering sending lethal weapons to Russia?
VOA: Does the U.S. believe China is considering sending lethal weapons to Russia?
Do you see any evidence?
SHERMAN: What I'm saying is that Secretary Blinken raised the issue because we obviously have reason to be concerned.
SHERMAN: Well, Secretary Blinken raised that concern because we do have that concern.
We have said so directly to the People's Republic of China.
We've shared our concern with many countries around the world and urge them to urge Xi Jinping to make the right choice here.
