This seat may very well go to Palin despite the apparently large lead of Peltola.
It will depend on the second choice (and, in some cases, the third choice) votes of people whose first choice was either the independent candidate or the non-Palin Republican candidate.
EDIT: The above comment was based on Peltola (D) having 42% of votes and Bye (independent) having 7% with about 50% of votes counted.
(Source was AP or Politico, I think.)
With 72% of votes counted as of 11am EST on Nov 14, it appears Peltola has 47%, Palin (R) has 27%, Begich (R) has 24%, and Bye has 2%.
(Source: , and .
I think politico uses AP's polling and fivethirtyeight uses ABC News'.)
If this remains the breakdown, Peltola would need between 1% and 4% of voters who selected Begich as their first choice to have selected Peltola ahead of Palin further down their ticket (Peltola as second choice, or Begich as second choice and Peltola as third choice).
So it will come down to how many Begich voters are voting against Palin vs for the Republican party.
Palin would need almost every person who voted for the 3rd place candidate to put her as their second choice to win, something like 70% of the second choice needs to be for her to win.
No the vote is split 3 ways, in Alaska the top candidate with 42 plus percentage of the vote is a Democrat, Palin got 26ish percent and the third Republican candidate 24 ish.
