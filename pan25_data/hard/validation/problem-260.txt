Yes but death penalty doesn’t ultimately solve the problem of people using drugs.
The demand will be always there and even if you kill the leader, someone will keep taking their place.
The past how many years of war on drugs should be sufficient enough to prove that.
for years and years the war on drugs has proven ineffective and a waste of time.
The only thing we havent tried is to legalize the drugs in the US and let the government tax it.
Thats side income to improve communitys, and it will take dealers off the streets.
Yes there will still be deaths in the US, but that is legit the only way you take away the cartels finances.
Which means more innocent people in Mexico & elsewhere will be brutally murdered for the money machine.
Legalization and regulation/taxation would be the rational response.
Then the cartels would settle their differences in courts rather than AKM rifles.
But that means disemploying generations of US law enforcement, attorneys, and others who profit from the ”War On Drugs”.
So that’s not happening either.
