The still relevant questions here are: 1.
Were the documents properly handled given their classification level?
(probably not).
2.
What are the relevant laws to improper handling of classified documents.
3.
These are records under the PRA and should have been turned over to NARA.
(While that is a law there are no legal consequences to breaking it).
That's not true.
Biden maintained a security clearance during his time out of office.
He still had clearance for these documents.
We are still a nation of laws, however unfair they may be, and the laws should be applied equally to all citizens of this country.
No one is above them.
To answer your first question though, what should happen is a full investigation of both Biden and Trump.
And if any laws are found to be broken by either of them, then they should be charged for those and a trial conducted to examine the evidence and determine guilt.
If Biden broke the law then yes, he should face the consequences of that under the law.
Same goes for Trump.
Seems like it was planned to let Trump off the hook.
However, I think it's important to understand intent.
Much like hillary with her private email server, this shows Biden with a certainly level of incompetence.
Trump appeared to knowingly take top secret documents, has repeatedly hindered investigations along with his lawyers signing false declarations.
These are not the same.
They already are.
The r/conservative sub is convinced that the deep state is getting rid of Biden after the midterms to install Kamala and run her for the next two elections and have 10 years of her.
