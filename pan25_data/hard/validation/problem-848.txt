i explain a little.
there is a possibility that the universe is curved, and if you keep going in a straight line you come back where you started.
just like on planet earth, you make your round trip and come back home.
since the distance (and the time that it takes to that particular light to hit your eye) is quite big, we have not yet a proof that we are not watching ourself from behind.
quite correct, but we have not closed the case, yet.
the curvature of the universe is still debatable and studied, and the possible curvatures are more than one.
This means that even if the universe is curved (which, again, it doesn't appear to be), you still can't see yourself because the distance you'd have to look is further than the observable universe horizon.
I don't think that's true.
The universe may indeed be curved, but the value of the curve sure seems to be zero, and there are several known measurements that constrain the maximum value of the curve to be very, very close to zero (if it is curved at all).
