I'm going to disagree.
Not because I like these fucks, but because traitor has a very specific definition that is important.
I don't want to water it down or get to a point where we just call everyone a traitor.
Denying an election is just talk.
Trying to overthrow the election results?
That's treason.
Treason can carry a penalty of death.
Politicians contest results all the time.
There is a legal process.
If you say election deniers are traitors, Republicans will start calling every when recount treasonous.
Claiming the election was stolen, based on no evidence at all, just to inflame your base, and attempt to hang on to power when you have been democratically voted out, when you know it is a lie, is an attack on your countries constitution and democracy, aka treason.
It definitely is seditious trash talk when people try to discredit and defame our elections simply because they lost, it compromises our country’s national security, they are traitors to America for doing it trying to hurt fellow Americans.
I’m on board with telling it like it is, holding no punches, and keeping these idiots responsible, BUT, calling anyone who denies an election a traitor is not always completely accurate and it feels like a slippery slope.
We saw election fraud from right, does this mean any leftist who calls them out is a traitor?
No it doesn’t, so maybe we shouldn’t be too careless.
That’s true, no doubt, but you’re missing my point.
There was election fraud from the right.
Several people were caught voting twice and entering ballots for their dead relatives.
Calling them out doesn’t make a person a traitor, regardless of legitimacy.
It’s not the definition of the word in any sense, and it sets the stage for literally anyone to be deemed a traitor.
This is dangerous for all.
