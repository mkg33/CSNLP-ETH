You just can’t send families to war without 1st hand knowledge of what war does to families.

Yep.
I agree completely.
I think at the time (when a lot of peace treaties and the like are agreed) people chose to look past what others have done and build a future.

Why wasn't the British put on stand for their crimes against humanity when Germany and Japan had to suffer?
If we are talking about morals here, why hasn't the British government apologised for the pillaging and cultural genocide they did in India for over 200+ years ?
?
Hmm.
How many of these engineers you know that fell prey to that insanity have religious backgrounds I wonder?
