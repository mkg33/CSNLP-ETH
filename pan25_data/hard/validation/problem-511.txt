Just for future reference, there's a significant difference between authoritative and authoritarian.
I take your meaning though.
Do you think the corpses in the rubble piles created by American-made munitions would see the irony in all this?
I rather imagine they would.
Of course.
Problem is that the US, Israel and every other concerned party is dedicated to knowing before Tel Aviv, Riyadh or New York get incinerated.
Iraq was plagued by general incompetence, as evidenced by their total anhilliation courtesy of the US circa 1991, and Iran was using mid-WWI tactics.
Against a military that actually knows what its doing in a conventional war, Iran has no chance and they know it, hence the nuclear program.
People that think Iran can conventionally resist an invasion from the US are just trying to push nuclear non-proliferation (which is a perfectly valid goal without needing to lie about conventional warfare!
).
Sure.
But ballistic missile are mostly used for non-nuclear purposes, like 99.99999% of the time in history.
And asking Iran to stop doing ballistic missile research while threatening to drop bomb on their country is just not going to happen.
So when the nuclear deal was signed, it was thought the best approach was just to negotiate one thing at a time.
Saying that "it doesn't address ballistic missiles" as if that was some kind of oversight is just incorrect, because it was never meant to.
