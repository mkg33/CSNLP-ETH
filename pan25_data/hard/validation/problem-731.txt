For Tumblr it basically meant to ban all NSFW content and it was the cause of the downfall of the social media, for Porn Hub it forced them to simply delete all non verified content and only allow verified content to be uploaded.
The problem resides on everything else, Twitter could provide this services without the need of images, or videos, replies, likes or likes, with only 125 characters as it used to be, and without hashtags or anything.
But the reason all those things are there, is because Twitter is not meant to be a means of communications, but rather a tool to gather information on the consumers' habits and that is their true service.
I agree too, Twitter is now, unofficially, a direct means of communications for any organization or individual to inform the world, all news outlets give tweets as much weight as spoken words right now.
We literally saw a single tweet cost a company billions of dollars recently, I don't know how anyone could argue it isn't integrated into our society right now.
How many news articles use tweets nowadays?
How many organizations (government, social, economic, etc.)
use Twitter as a primary means of getting important information to the public?
Which is why Twitter had a robust content moderation team of humans to respond to reports and take them down.
