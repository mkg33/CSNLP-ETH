I think the special grand jury sees more evidence than the regular grand jury would see.
When they finish their job, a regular grand jury can evaluate a limited set of evidence to determine if charges should be filed so the people making that decision are not biased by having seen evidence that should not have been factored into the decision.
I thought the special grand jury did strictly an investigation, and the regular grand jury took those results and could decide and refer charges, not a lawyer, though, just an observer.
Georgia has special grand juries (the one referenced here) that canâ€™t indict themselves, but can only issue a report and make recommendations about indictment.
If they recommend an indictment, GA has to then convene a regular grand jury to indict or not.
It only takes 12/23 jurors to recommend an indictment (not unanimous like a trial jury and conviction).
Further, voting on an indictment isn't accusing someone of guilt - it's simply saying that probable cause has been established to bring a trial.
As a state prosecution, it also has none of the conflict-of-interest or executive privilege hurdles that a federal prosecution has to clear.
Fulton County is deep blue for a jury selection, and the charges Trump may face are exceptionally bad for him.
There are a bunch of things to worry about, but not really the GJ imo - Fulton County is deep blue, and the grand jury has a very low bar to clear with these decisions.
