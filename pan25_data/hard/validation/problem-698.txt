A) they will get destroyed in any prolong engagement without US military support.
They’re a tiny nation, small population and their sphere of influence won’t help in any sort of irregular fighting.
They’ll learn the same mistake that the US did in Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam.
If Israel was really going to change into Iran, they would have done it already.
They are just waiting to drag the US into it and have Americans died for Israel as Israel cannot support any sort of long term excursion.
B) whatever action occurs will open up the country to all out war with the Iranian aligned militias and groups that border Israel.
This is a hilarious point, considering that Iranian militias are already in an all out war with Israel and have been for a long time.
I think the threat comes from Iran’s ability to target vast sums of civilians rather than Iran’s ability to militarily win or not lose a war (where the former is all but a given against Israel).
In that case Israel would have no choice but to use any means necessary to destroy all Iranian nuclear capabilities, even if it means all out war, just like they've been saying since pretty much forever.
No idea if the US or anyone else would join in.
