Interesting to see that the skewed reporting rates occur on both sides of the aisle even if Republicans leaning areas are more likely to do so.
Over or under reporting provides an untrue narrative that can stymie efforts and direct resources to the wrong area.
Under-reporting crimes by a certain group isn't an honest or helpful path forward, especially if it leads to over reporting of another minority group.
It’ll take more than under-reporting crimes committed by black people for that stereotype to go away.
Unfortunately, black people have carried the stereotype of being more likely to commit a crime for quite some time.
So you combine all those factors with the historical issue of US culture stigmatizing black folks as inherently criminal or dangerous.
And then the cops reinforce that pervasive racist bias by using their social media platforms to highlight black suspected criminals at a disproportionate rate.
So, they’re saying police perpetuate racism?
I have a hard time believing this.
It’s gotta be some kind of liberul plot The police in America are the least racist people in the WORLD /s.
