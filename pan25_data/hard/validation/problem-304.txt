According to publicly available filings, LinkedIn profiles, and sources with knowledge of hiring decisions in both camps, the vast majority of staffers now within DeSantis’ ranks have zero connection to Trumpworld.
While there are a few exceptions, the overwhelming majority of DeSantis staffers are not former Trump people, and the vast majority of Trump’s inner circle was never in DeSantis’ camp.
The Daily Beast cross-referenced more than 600 names between the two operations and found an unusually small amount of crossover for such sprawling GOP networks.
The universe of GOP staffers is a notoriously small one, where even the most diametrically opposed Republican politicians often have overlapping orbits between their staffs.
But there are two GOP stars with remarkably little overlap: Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis.
DeSantis has nowhere to run except to compete on how more unAmerican he can be than Trump.
He really can't compete on fame or swagger and cults tend to be extremely resistant to just jumping to a new Messiah.
So DeSantis has to deliver on Tuesdays election, and then wait in the wings for two years just in case Trump is somehow incapable of taking the nomination.
Trump will burn down the Republican party before allowing anyone to take it from him.
