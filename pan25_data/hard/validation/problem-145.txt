Exactly; they can threaten all they want, they're not going to have the idiocy or balls to actually do it, because that means both North America and the rest of Europe have grounds for becoming active participants instead of just lending aid.
And the absolute last thing Putin and his cronies need is to have the EU and North America turn the big guns on them; they've been struggling enough just with Ukraine by themselves, adding all that extra firepower on Ukraine's side would turn this war into a rout.
Also, if the Russian army is fully crippled in Ukraine by the West, then they would be open to retaliation from eastern european countries that would want revenge for the Soviet times, and put Russia through a century of humiliation.
Russia should remember how Europeans are like when dealing with a weakened nation, since they did it to China last time.
Also, this is shaping up to be Russia's century of humiliation.
I think the PRC remembers what happened in their history, and is taking pity on Russians right now.
And besides, the last time Russia was getting their asses kicked in a war in Europe, with their economy destroyed, they turned to communism, so why would the CPC want to stop that?
I don't think Russia considers Ukraine to be an ultimate red line, but I was thinking more along the lines of "I will rule this \[land\] or see it burned to ashes around me.
".
if Russia had considered Ukraine to be the ultimate red line, then nuclear annihilation would be preferable to losing or backing down.
Launching first would just make sure the West loses as well.
How many working Russian nukes it would take depends on how many civilian dead the West would take before they consider it a losing war.
Note that implicit in this threat is the admission that from a senior Russian government official that Russia will lose this war using conventional weapons, would have to resort to the other weapons to win.
Volodin, the head of the Duma, warns that since West supplies weapons strong enough to defeat Russia, this will lead to Russia’s retaliation with “more powerful weapons,” ie implying nuclear.
