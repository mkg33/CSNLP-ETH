The Republicans all seem to be using the same weird form for their speeches.
They trash the Democrats, trash the other Republicans then appeal to "the other side of the aisle" meaning the other Republicans and say "we need to all work together".
That's a long shot, of course, but the writing has been on the wall for decades now that the GOP is not one party, it's several parties that loosely align and cooperate, especially when it comes to refusing to work with Dems.
But lately the glue that holds them together has been rotting.
What happens when somebody says it's time to drop the act and vote for realsies, but McCarthy still comes up short?
If it's clear they genuinely can't pull it together, all it would take is Dems convincing a few of the less crazy ones or promising committee positions for a vote.
Democrats would presumably still not have the votes to get anything done, so couldn’t that failure to get anything done be laid at his feet?
They are giving a lovely example as to why the democratic’s can’t functionally work with the republicans.
How on earth is anyone meant to negotiate and cooperate with a party that cannot successfully negotiate within themselves and appoint a speaker?
