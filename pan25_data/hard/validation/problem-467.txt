It’s because if Republicans had have nominated a more competent candidate, Warnock probably would have lost in November without the need for a runoff.
I mean, would you vote for a reasonable Republican over a terrible Democratic candidate?
You might say, “just because a particular Democrat is awful, doesn’t mean I would vote for Republican ideology I disagree with,” and that’s a perfectly reasonable position.
Well, it works both ways.
Yes, Republican ideology is terrible, but that doesn’t mean that Republican voters can’t genuinely agree with it.
I think you vastly underestimate exactly how many people agree with Republican ideology.
The cold hard reality is that 40%+ of the voter base is utter irredeemable dogshit who would gleefully drag you out into the street and beat you to death if given the opportunity.
They might be for things like a higher minimum wage and single payer healthcare but if, and only if, it were implemented by a White Christian ethno-state.
This is the hill they are going to die on and nothing will convince them otherwise.
