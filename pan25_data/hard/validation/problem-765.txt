There is no preventing it at this point, their only options are to kill him now and save as much as they can or let it play out and go down in total flames.
Russia best bet would be to taking out putin themslevs and salvaging what they can then begging the Ukraine and NATO for forgiveness.
No peace for Russia without returning what was stolen from Ukraine and fucking off back to your shit hole Moscow, you bunch if communist murdering cunts.
Well if you provide the casualties on each side then you may have something, but until you get me those numbers then idk man seems like ukraine is doing a pretty good job and Russia is embarrassing itself and should leave Ukraine and go back to Moscow.
Please enlighten me on the stats then, you won't find any that count ukrainian casualties vs Russian casualties , only ukrainian deaths vs Russian casualties making it look like Russia is losing much more when in reality both are getting fucked.
Those numbers aren't available in msm you can try to find yourself like I said, you will see ukrain deaths vs Russian casualties which counts both injury and death, both sides are getting equally fucked not sure why reddit is down voting a factual statement but here we are lol.
You would be surprised, there is a reason you can only find stats showing ukrainian DEATHS vs Russian CASUALTIES one side is only counting deaths the other counts death and injury.
I didn't say they were, but stats are being kept strictly on Ukrainian deaths, while Russian stats include deaths plus injuries, it's being shown like this for a reason.
Go try and find it, you'll only find stats about KILLED Ukrainians but for Russian stats it's KILLED + INJURED.
There's a reason they're showing the stats this way.
