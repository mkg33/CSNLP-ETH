He's also not putting his family into positions of power in the state apparatus either, but it's hard to know that for sure since the identities of his children is such a closely kept secret, but the simple fact of that secret shows there's not going to be any kind of a "Putin dynasty" after he's gone either.
Putin doesn't have a Vice President, and - on the rare occasion he takes a break from his duties and officially delegates authority (rather than simply disappearing from sight without word) then he tends to appoint whoever's his favourite at the time, meaning, yeah, no clear political successor.
Nah he twisted the constitution to allow presidents to have unlimited terms , plus it matters not but literally ask any guy Putin is the unofficial emperor of Russia , I am more curious about his successor and about what kadyrov will do.
An idiot whom Putin allows to own a military inside his empire , only Wagner and kadyrovâ€™s stooges , idiot or no idiot that fool has the ability to put Russia in a civil war.
