At present, though, I think I'd rather support farmers who are producing meat or milk ethically (I know, this is a difficult line to find), than come to outright absolutist determinations.
If I can support the local farmer who gives their chickens a happy life and then quickly and humanely ends their existence, I'll take it.
If I can buy eggs from someone whose chickens I can see running around and being chickens, I'll take it.
Wild, isn't it?
People are so defensive of their consumption that they'd rather ignore, or even defend, factory farm practices before they'd consider that their meat eating is problematic.
Yet you'll still have weird people defending it because they get so defensive about their meat eating habits.
Meat eaters are allowed to care about animal welfare - in fact they are the ones who we need to care the most since they consume it.
Vegans don’t matter — they aren’t buying it anyways.
On a macro level, a lot of people making small changes is far more impactful than a few people making large changes.
It’s not an “all or nothing” situation.
