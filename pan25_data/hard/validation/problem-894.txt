Why didn't the US do that with it's various vehicles and what not when pulling out of Afghanistan?
not trying to thumb my nose at the US by any means, just curious.
I wrote this with the Blackhawks in mind actually.
I watched a news report recounting the various weapons and vehicles left behind, there was / is an airfield lined with Humvees and helicopters (US) being flown around by what the reporter said were Taliban "pilots.
".
Same.
Could not get into Civ 6.
I tried again after a while but there was an error in a patch that made the AI prioritize science over everything else.
So your AI opponents would be like 2 ages ahead of you, but you could just waltz in and steal their cities because they had virtually no defense.
It kind of wrecked the game but I never heard that it got fixed.
I'm sure someone did with a mod, but I just went back to Civ 5.
I played civ 5, still play modded civ 5.
I could never really get into civ 6.
Hoping for 7 soon.
Its right at the end of the 6-7 year lifespan of civ games so hopefully 2023.
