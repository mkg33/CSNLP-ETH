Yup, I’m all about saying that he won’t because he’s a coward.
Only winners run on a third party.
If he doesn’t it shows that he needs the Republicans party.
Believe me I’m making comments like this to someone I know that’s in his circle.
Telling him that trump is a winner and winners would run for President regardless of party.
Unfortunately unlike trump, this guy is really smart and just laughs and tells me to go fuck my mom (he’s a gentleman).
Lmao!
DO IT DONNIE!
So another Dem can get elected.
Can you imagine the amount of votes he'd steal from the Republican candidate?
It would destroy the Republicans party.
Literally either way he goes, he's taking votes away from the GOP.
Many people flipped in 2020 just to keep him out of office, and they'll likely do it again, but if he runs as a third party, he's taking what's left of his base with him.
I think this is a lose-lose for the GOP.
They're not gaining overall votes either way, yet they have to choose one scenario over the other unless he's banned from office or in prison when the time comes to decide.
That's nice if he runs under a 3rd party but it dosen't change the fact that he still needs the votes and I don't think he will get anywhere close to what he's got before.
