Besides that, yeah.
Though the only people I hear grumbling about the workers and this whole situation are people that for sure are out of touch rich assholes, many that hold some sort of managerial position.
And ofc are usually on the older side.
Lmao what?
I can’t think of a single person irl or on here that thinks Biden is infallible.
I mean, maybe I’m just not seeing the same posts or whatever that you are but I honestly can’t think of anyone that has never criticized or never disliked anything Biden has done.
Irl everyone I know voted for Biden and non of them particularly like the guy, even myself.
one thing people here have a hard time grasping is you can criticize Joe Biden.
You don't have to think everything he does is great or even just bare minimum acceptable.
Biden's decision to force workers back to work is a litmus test if you're a tribalist or if you base your opinions on the policy and not the person.
If you have to side with someone side with the workers.
Don't side with people who make so much money they don't even understand the basics of your life.
