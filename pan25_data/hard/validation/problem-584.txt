There were many reports and and other places.
Of course, according to Ukrainian sources it was all Russian propaganda and/or self-shellings.
During that summer rain of that "petal mines" fell several times over Donetsk.
In the residential areas of the city, that is not controlled by Ukraine since 2014.
What were they trying to prevent there that hasn't happened in past 8 years?
And now, after Ukraine regain control over Izum, which is 150 kilometers away from Donetsk, the HRW says that "During the Russian occupation of Izyum, the Ukrainian military appears to have used landmines in nine areas around Izyum".
That is not a mines that tank would care at all.
Even if you drive a car into it, the mine will just damage your wheel at maximum.
They are talking about special shells for the artillery, that explode in the air and randomly saw large areas by anti-personnel landmines.
BTW these landmines are anti-personnel, not anti-tank.
They're "delivered" by artillery and then fly randomly covering a large area.
How could it be "justified" if it's a banned weaponry (becsuse they indiscriminately hit combatants and non-combatants).
Especially considering that Ukraine signed the agreement in 1997 and people suffering are their own citizens.
