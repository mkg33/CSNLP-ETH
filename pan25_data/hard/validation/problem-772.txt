In this intercepted call, a Russian soldier tells his wife about a failed assault operation with no support, surviving a direct missile strike, and Russian forces "writing off" friendly fire as casualties taken from Ukrainians.
Itâ€™s not the Groundhog Day.
Just Russians mine-clearing the area with their MBTs and trying to find every single mine placed by Ukrainian troops near Vuhledar.
I have read that the Russian thought they had cleared the mines but Ukraine was able to replace them before the attack, so thatt's why they are confused.
I'm pretty sure this ofensive is a last gasp, desperate move by Russia to try to reclaim some land before the western tanks start arriving in Ukraine.
Russia knows after the Ukrainians are trained and running in technologically superior tanks, that there's not much they can do to stop them.
Ukraine was still defending like Russia was using the doctrine of "kill everything with artiliary twice, then send in armor and infantry to mop up."
But as of January, Russian artiliary strikes are from the start of the war.
And Russian training and equipment was never meant to be used without it in mass.
