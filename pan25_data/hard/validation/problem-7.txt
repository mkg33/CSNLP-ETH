Let me add that people are getting fined just for putting a LIKE on anything that is perceived "unpatriotic".
Teachers getting ratted out by pupils and parents, students getting ratted out by their fellow students, people getting disowned by their family for not supporting the "spetzoperaciya", it's Orwellian levels of dystopia.
And that's before all the shell-shocked Wagnerites and amnestied murderers and rapists start coming back from the war (well, the minority that make it), in fact it's already happening, several criminal cases being reported, incidents involving demobbed soldiers.
I talk to some of the many Russians who fled to my country, they are all the normal ones as far as I can see: IT people, English teachers, they don't see how they can ever go back to living there.
Anything up to a million of Russia's intelligentsia gone, left the country, many of them for good, all of this seems very very bad for Russia.
Oh, the whole "Ukrainians are Nazis" thing is projection on a colossal scale, it's a farcical accusation, either the Russian ruling class are genuinely stupid and have no clue what fascism actually is, or they are just mind-blowing cynical.
Probably there is some of both.
Yep.
And in 1917 it was the cossacks turning against the police and joining the people that made the difference.
It's really hard to imagine something similar happening in putin's russia.
Personally I can't imagine Russia is going to be demilitarized like the axis powers.
It would take multiple significant changes - not least regime change, culture, voluntary de-nuclearlisation (I don't believe this will happen anywhere following several examples including Ukraine itself).
Not only that, but the effects of trauma will be staggering.
Soldiers returning from Afghanistan committed all kinds of violent crime and that conflict almost pales in comparison.
