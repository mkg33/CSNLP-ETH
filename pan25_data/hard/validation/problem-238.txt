Redner's or Wegmans?
Because as a WNYer, I'd almost say them's fightin' words if it's Wegmans, because I do like them and Tops both a hell of a lot, haha.
Wegmans actually has legitimately beautiful looking grocery stores, and their store-brand stuff is fantastic.
Plus, the one in Henrietta, NY by RIT used to give my friends and I discounts at the butcher shop in there even though we weren't technically buying enough for the Club Pack prices, and I was always very grateful for that.
I looooove the Wegmans bakery's stuff, so even though you're not in my area, thanks for your work Both the breads and the desserts are some of the best out there, those fruit tarts are legit works of art, and I'm a big fan of the croissants and bagels, too.
So very much obliged.
Yep.
For the record, MANY Latin American immigrants have very strong opinions on socialism/communism due to their own country's communist/socialist upheavals in decades past that had negative or dire impacts on their loved ones.
Fox News preys on that fear quite effectively.
That's why Cubans are so red, it's because they've been brainwashed to think American Democrat = Fidel Castro.
My partner's family, while not cuban, immigrated here not too long ago (generation or two) from a Latin American Country.
To be fair, communist â‰  good by default; many of these political uprisings were by very violent and corrupt people (nevermind the impact the US had...).
