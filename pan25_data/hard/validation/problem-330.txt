NCD living up to the sub name, just in very unfunny ways.
The amount of people on the sub who lap up everything PiS says is absurd, but there are still.
It would be highly paternalistic to say "No, we know better than you and we think you should surrender to the Russians, despite your willingness to fight, because we're scared that Russia might nuke Ukraine."
Doing this and stopping support to Ukraine would only prolong suffering and drag out.
Tell me something, are you someone who supports imperialism and the subjugation of foreign cultures?
Your order of events is wrong and incomplete.
First came the French AMX-10RC "light tanks"/heavy armament combat vehicles, then a day later came the joint announcement of US Bradley IFVs and German Marder IFVs, and later the other vehicles you mentioned.
This all came on the heels of the US sending Bradley fighting vehicles, Striker light tanks, and the British sending Challengers tanks to Ukraine.
The fact of the matter is that even despite the unprecedented aggression on the part of Russia, Germany has so far been a very weak ally in NATO, and has been dragged along by the ear up to now.
I can even recall early in the conflict the British setting up an air bridge with C-17s to send NLAWS to Ukraine, and their flight paths were identified as having skipped around German airspace, heavily implying that the Germans were refusing transit of the weapons-- shipments that were critical in the early phase of the war at repelling a Russian invasion of Kiev.
