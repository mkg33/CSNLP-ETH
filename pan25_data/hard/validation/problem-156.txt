Voters once again made the wrong choice and didn't give Biden a Congress that would pass voting rights.
Can't get mad at Biden over that.
Also, bear in mind that the Dems lost the house popular vote by like 3% and if we take uncontested races into account, iirc they'd have still likely lost by an estimated 1 or 2%, so if the maps across the nation were fair, the Dems still would have lost the house.
Ultimately there's a big failure by the voters there.
I blamed the voters for the Dems losing Congress, which has not one but two chambers, one being the Senate.
You blamed the voters for the dems losing the house.
That is false.
The dems lost the house.
And one of the big reasons the dems lost the house is because they lost 4 seats in blue New York State.
They lost those seats due to a Supreme Court that was seated during a GOP state senate that Cuomo made sure remained GOP.
The democrats lost the house due to Andrew Cuomoâ€™s alliance with republicans in New York.
Biden, Obama, and the democratic establishment loved Cuomo.
