Support secessionist movements also.
Creation of governments in exile for different regions.
Provide over and covert support for those willing to fight for independence.
There is more that can be done to not only defeat the fascist regime in the battlefield but make sure they will never be a threat again for centuries to come.
This isnt a slow burn insurgency, this is a full out war.
Russian deaths already are over 4 times what the Afghan war was, in less than 1/10 of the time.
Not to mention that Russia is 1/5 the Soviet Union, not an autarkic economy, lags technologically, and so much more.
State Department made clear not to attack Russia proper with NATO equipment.
Also intel on Russian formations is only given for the occupying forces.
But the truth is, there is nothing special about any of Russia's military or it's operations.
Just more incompetence after incompetence.
<sigh>.
What Putin needs to do is a Special Military Operation that withdrawals all of his soldiers from Ukraine and Crimea back to Russia.
After Russia ceases the war and withdraws from Ukraine, including the Crimea region of Ukraine, and returns all kidnapped citizens, they can then negotiate how much they are going to pay Ukraine.
NATO says they are willing to talk if Russia stops attacking Ukrainian territory and retreats.
Zelenskyy said he's willing to talk but not with Putin.
Putin says he's willing to talk if NATO acknowledges the "annexed" territory or if Ukraine gives up some of its autonomy.
These unrealistic statements of willingness for talks have been made already and it doesn't matter if random people on the internet call it what it is, unrealistic and stupid.
Well, ok, I agree that having some statement from everyone of willingness to talk, even if in reality is just unrealistic, is something important.
Because it doesn't give the enemy the argument of "the other side is completely unreasonable".
So yeah, I can agree with that idea.
But, such statements have already been made by all sides already.
It's just us on the internet who are freely expressing out opinions that there's nothing to talk about, because there really isn't if you aren't losing and have a righteous cause.
