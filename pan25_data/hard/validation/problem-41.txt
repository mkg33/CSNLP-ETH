I looked up what I was talking about was it was late posting last night and it was indeed the Schaffhaussen incident I was thinking of (mixed up the airfield and planes with another incident).
Some historians do not believe the bombing and a few others were an accident but rather a message sent to the Swiss.
Both the US and the Germans bombed Switzerland in order to try to force their position.
The Germans were especially upset because the Swiss didn't stop the allies from using their airspace or at least didn't try very hard.
I forget the exact incident but the US hit them really hard once destroying an airfield and some planes or something and this act is usually cited as being particularly impactful.
I don't know about (and doubt) the time the US "hit them really hard" by destroying an airfield, but the US did once accidently bomb Schaffhaussen, a Swiss city/town north of the Rhine while trying to bomb a German city in southwest Germany.
They got lost through dense cloud cover, their pathfinding radar malfunctioned, and their dead reckoning was way off.
Really terrible and stupid accident, but not an intentional diplomatic play to pressure the Swiss.
Not like the time the British attacked the French fleet.
