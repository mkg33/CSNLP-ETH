Recusal should absolutely happen if the case would cause you to rule differently due to impact to yourself, or your loved ones (looking at you Thomas), but I don't think being biased is a good yardstick for recusal ... even if I think she's utterly wrong in her bias.
By all means, ACB is a bad justice and I'd be happy to justify her stepping away from every decision ever, but that's just because I think she's a bad judge and bad human, which isn't a valid excuse.
Should every Catholic SCOTUS justice step away from Pro-Life cases?
Should a Quaker step away from any 2nd Amendment cases?
Should a Muslim step away from any case involving debt?
Should RBG step away from a case that involves pork?
Because it feels like every SCOTUS judge that has ever held a religious belief should have stepped away from every case they've had to rule on.
How on earth did we come to the place where we are urging Supreme Court justices to not let their personal beliefs colour their decisions.
Seriously?
Itâ€™s like an episode of the Simpsons where Bart becomes chief justice.
