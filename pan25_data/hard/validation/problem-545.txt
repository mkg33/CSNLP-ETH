It's the same playbook private companies use to privatize health/welfare sectors and social services in western capitalist countries, so you can't say it doesn't have a proven track record.
Jesus man, get off your horse.
I was drawing a comparison between the terrible shit Russia is doing to Ukrainians and the definitely-not-nearly-as-terrible-but-using-similar-general-strategy stuff private companies do in order to privatize public services.
Namely how Russia created the problem they're now claiming to be trying to "solve" by abducting these children and committing essentially cultural genocide if they manage to hold onto them and raise them as Russians rather than Ukrainians.
Identify a thing you want for yourself (Ukraine and its people), cause problem in/with the thing that you can then claim to have the solution for while ignoring/hiding that you caused the problem in the first place (invade country and blow up infrastructure, causing unsafe conditions for children and most likely a lot of orphans), implement the solution in a way that gives you what you wanted (abduct/relocate tens of thousands of Ukrainian children from occupied zones to raise them as Russian or at least pro-Russian).
1) Lobby for government to cut/redistribute government funding for some social service or benefit temporarily based on some reason or as part of some huge budget omnibus (e.g.
Russia invading Ukraine and destroying most of the infrastructure in the areas they now control).
2) The system of care in Ukraine being inadequate is because you invaded and destroyed the place you fascist fucks!
