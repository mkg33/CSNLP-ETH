Extremely unlikely that Ukraine is making direct assaults against Kreminna.
It would go against the trend of offensive Ukrainian operations that avoid assaulting fortified cities.
Also the fact that Russians are making those claims does not in anyway give credibility to them.
In fact, i'd be even more skeptical of them because it's coming from the Russians.
What is more likely happening is that Ukrainians have managed creep towards the edge of the town in the forest, and may be probing the defenses of Kreminna, but those "attacks" are unlikely to have intention of starting a fight inside the town itself.
It looks like rumors about our forces already being in Kreminna didn’t turn out to be true in the end, but there is definitely some movement happening in there, as we are getting new footage of fighting in the forests around Kreminna, which means our forces are getting closer to the town.
The fact that Russians are evacuating their officers from Kreminna also tells us a lot, they probably don’t think that they can hold it for long and of course their officers would run first, they don’t care about their troops.
Their soldiers will love that move, seeing your commanders run for their lives a great morale boost.
Today was a bit less quiet day than usual, because there was one missile strike that happened around 7pm.
We don’t know how many missiles they fired, but it was definitely more than one.
I’m not sure what they were aiming at, but at least one of the missiles was intercepted by our air defense, which was the explosion that people heard here.
The missile that was intercepted might have been aimed at Kharkiv, but others weren’t, as there were some reports about missiles landing somewhere in Kharkiv oblast.
