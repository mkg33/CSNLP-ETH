All of those minority you mention above are part of iran for so many years , we have pharse in iran we called they've become iranize , iran isn't about just language or religion , it's a identity, I suggests you study Iranshahr or Irenshehr theory to help you out more.as you mention Kordish independent state it's because of so many years of government suppression that minority of kord peoples seek independence and again history proves that majority of them doesn't want to become separated.
When discussing Iran and Iranians we think only of Persians, but there are multiple Iranian ethnic groups or Nations living in Iran, unlike China it never facilitated ethno-genisis between its various subgroups.
You have the Kurds, Lurs, Balochis and others that comprise of 25-30% of the population.
Persians themselves are only 51% of the population and seeing as these figures are old and non-Persian regions have higher birthrates, its probably lower.
The Kurds and Balochis both have active cross border insurgencies with the expressed goal of secession and the formation of a Kurdish and Balochi nation states.
Iranian civilisation is old, the Iranian state through the various Iranian empires are old; and even Iranian nationalism is old(it even appeared in Sassanid propaganda).
What is not old is the Iranian nation state itself.
The matter of fact is Iranians haven’t experienced ethno-genesis in the same way say China has, banding together its various linguistic subgroups.
The Iranian nation better resembles if anything the Russian Nation.
The concept of Russia as a state was to be the nation state of the Russians, the East Slavic ethnic groups that inhabited the lands of the Kievan Rus.
However, multiple subgroups, the Ukrainians especially held a strong attachment to their individual sub-identities, leading to the lack of ethno-genesis and the maintenance of multiple subnations(in this case its Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Rusyns) rather than one unified Nation.
The Kurds and Persians may be Iranian, but they don’t necessarily care for the commonality between eachother.
So while Iranian nationalism is old, ethno Genesis has simply not yet occurred between its subgroups.
That is to say Iran is still very much an Empire, its national subgroups have not undergone ethnogenesis and on top of that it contains a large proportion of ethnic minorities.
It is not a nation state like say Japan, Poland or Bangladesh.
It still has to worry about ethno-religious conflicts and tension.
This isn’t the first time the government in Iran has been unpopular, there will be elections in a few years and if worse comes to worst they could probably just pass secular reforms and call some emergency election as a pressure release valve.
