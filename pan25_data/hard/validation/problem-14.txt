British and Irish account for more than half of the dead at Gallipoli so you can bugger off pushing that narrative acting like it was just Anzac forces doing all the dying.
Man you have to be fucking dense to write all of that out and not look at the fact that twice as many Brits and Irish died when compared to the Anzac, from your own (NZ govt) numbers.
At least the Irish went home and worked toward independence from the people that forced your forefathers onto the wrong beach.
Yep, people don't realize that Chamberlain was one of the poor fuckers that was in charge of conscription during WWI.
Now, I understand the perspective that being a Director of Conscription during the war is likely to be considered evil in and of itself.
But the experience really fucked with him and he became highly reluctant to go to war without outright overwhelming force.
He wasn't a pacifist, he just wanted to make sure he wasn't sending people into an outright meat grinder like he was recruiting for in the spring of 1917.
It's weird.
It's like a piece of cultural history that was never said, never passed down, but that generation was aware of the difference.
My grandfather and his brother talked about it once while drinking.
Grandpa was a marine and was in the Pacific with the First division and my great uncle joined the war in Europe a bit late, sometime after D-Day but before the winter offensive.
But they talked about the difference between the guys that were Army in Europe and The Marines in the pacific, that there was a real difference in how they settled back into life back home.
