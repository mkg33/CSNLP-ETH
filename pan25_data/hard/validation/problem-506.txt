Obviously it now only needs 50 senators to approve it to pass, but it'll be interesting to see if anyone who voted for a vote on it will now vote against it (or vice-versa).
Under the current rules, if you are a senator and you don't want a bill to get voted on, all you have to do is send an email that says "I am filibustering this bill.
".
There has been a lot of talk saying that Democrats should change the rules to either remove the filibuster, or to make it more difficult than sending an email (in the old days, senators had to get up and talk to filibuster, and when they all stopped talking the filibuster would end).
What is stopping a rogue dem from immediately fillibustering every bill, then revoking that filibuster right away to make sure it kept moving and couldn't be filibustered again?
If you heard about the Senate passing something recently, such as the climate law a couple months ago, they did that by making it a budget reconciliation bill so it couldn't be filibustered.
However one of the Senate's rules is that a few spending bills ("budget reconciliation") cannot be filibustered.
They can only do this a few times per year, and these bills can only have certain types of provisions.
For example, it's not possible to do a marriage bill under budget reconciliation because it has nothing to do with taxing/spending.
