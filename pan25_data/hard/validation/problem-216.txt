But from reading the article, it looks like it’s the issue of whether bump stocks meet the legal definition of ‘machinegun’ in the Gun Control Act and National Firearms Act.
The subject of bump stocks is a great way of finding out if someone believes any gun control is permissible.
If you're a firearms absolutist, then no.
If there's any wiggle room for restricting the dumbest and most dangerous inventions, then bump stocks fit the criteria.
If you think bump stocks should be banned, that's fine; but do not endorse such a ban when it comes from a "reinterpretation" that is outside the textual scope of a current law.
If you fail to see the problem with this then... well, I think you will when the government comes to haul you off to prison for doing something that was previously legal until they "reinterpreted" the law.
Nothing good ever, ever comes from giving an administrative body that kind of power.
The 5th Circuit ruled against the bump stock ban because by the federal definition they are NOT machine guns.
Federal law defines a machine gun as a gun that can fire more than one shot per pull of the trigger.
Bump stocks do not do that.
They are basically devices that allow the trigger to be pulled over and over again fast enough to simulate full auto, but the trigger is still being pulled before each shot; therefore, they are not machine guns.
The Trump Administration and the ATF reclassified them as machine guns on a whim and nothing more.
Even by the nfa, 68 and 86 gun control acts, it's not a machine gun with a bump stock.
They're using chevron deference to make shit up.
You can legit bump fire an ar using your fucking belt loop and finger tension.
Bump firing or automatic firing is very inaccurate, just look at the idiots with "switches" on their glocks.
