Is this true?
Austria is being neutral on Russia invasion?
If so that is Pathetic that Austria is neutral on Russia imho.
They of all countries should be supporting Ukraine.
And it seems like many people want him to "promote peace" by arming Ukraine.
No, that's not how you promote peace.
I don't see how refusing to support either side means they're fine with one imperialism, but not the other.
Do you see an option for them to be even more "anti-imperialist"?
It's certainly not the primary purpose of Brazil's economic activity to "fuel the war".
And Brazil certainly isn't a colony of "imperialist Russia".
Plus Brazil's trade with the US is much more significant:
So what you're saying makes sense only if you make any trade with Russia as intentional support for everything Russia is doing but don't apply this to the US for some reason.
This angle surely didn't arise during America's wars.
And it's largely the American empire that's behind the sanctions on the Russian economy in the first place.
So they don't amount to "neutrality".
Neutrality is not the enlightened position you all think it is.
Shams on Brazil for blaming Ukraine.
