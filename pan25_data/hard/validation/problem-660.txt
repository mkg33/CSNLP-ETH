You mean a senator from Kentucky supported the plan that would bring jobs and tax dollars to Kentucky, rather than the one that would benefit Canada?
Wow, what a shocking revelation.
You really got him there /s.
His job as senator is to represent the people who elected him, and I have a really hard time imagining the people would want him turning down jobs and allowing other countries to increase their share of the market.
So no, I don’t blame him for what he did in the slightest, even if I agree with you in principle.
What is it you expect a politician to do?
Respond to their opponents’ attack ads by saying “well if we put a tariff on Canadian aluminum, it just shows we’re not very good at it” and “ok so some of you may have gotten jobs that would’ve paid well and put food on your plates, but let’s be real upper management wouldve benefitted more”.
It’s not an attack.
It’s the same reason Europe places hefty tariffs on American vehicle imports: to protect domestic industry.
Most countries have some form of tariffs, and sometimes they’re placed for genuine reasons and others it’s just because companies lobbied well.
For instance, imagine if you’re the President of Colombia, and you have a small but growing mining industry of xyz substance.
Brazil has the same, and starts flooding your market with cheap xyz, threatening your local miners.
To protect their jobs, you apply a 15% tariff on xyz from brazil, to help your mining companies stay competitive in the market.
If you have to put a tariff on any country that pays a fair wage to be competitive in the same industry locally, then theirs a good chance that place has other issues.
It also makes no sense to call out the US for tariffs as if its some unique exception when just about every country has tariffs in place.
Canada has tariffs for some US goods, too.
