When a deeply corrupt autocracy drills through it’s educated population just to be killed as infantry then you know it’s already lost, it will affect many generations.
Even though you mentioned it as sarcasm, it might be an actual possibility considering the state russia would be in after this war, I’m sure Finns and Ukrainians wouldn’t desire it, but China is probably polishing it’s cutleries.
Even state TV in Russia commented on this, it seems very bad for Russia to launch a war to say that parts of Ukraine should be part of the country because ethnic groups belong together since almost all (by geography) of current Russia is not ethnically Russian.
It’s more of an existential crises to Russia than any imagined risk Putin made up about Ukraine shift geopolitical allegiance to the west.
Most of their population growth is in the south eastern republics although that’s were many of their soldiers have come from until now.
Regardless, most of the emigration has been from western Russian cities.
So in addition to population loss, you get demographic shifts.
Yeah like 100k-200k dead and wounded men of reproductive age plus the million they lost to covid and the million that emigrated since the war started.
Except 100s of thousands of men of reproductive age dead and million emigrating is going to accelerate that.
The crises was 25 years off.
It’s going to be sooner because of this war.
That’s kinda been their MO when it comes to war fighting.
They throw a huge percentage of their male population at the war, lose a major portion of that percentage, and then are more or less screwed for 40-50 years as their workforce has to be birthed and live long enough to become “usable”.
