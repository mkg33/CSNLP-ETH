Side story: A friend's mom had a condition called deja vecu; it is like being trapped in time loops, and it's a horrible condition, she wanted to die to have peace.
Dr. Saks even weighed in on the case, it's so rare and there is no cure.
They went to Switzerland, she ended her life humanely.
It sounds like a right turn to me.
If someone wants to die because of mental issues, getting themselves in front of medical professionals and having to go through a process of eliminating every option of treatment sounds better than the alternative.
I have always been in favor of voluntary euthanasia for chronic medical conditions but that this has gotten any level of support makes me seriously reconsider even supporting that.
Dementia patients should have access to euthanasia, however I can’t support that if it would eventually lead to killing other people that don’t have to die, which it seems is the case due to the support for euthanasia for depression.
While I support a right to die for people who are near death already and wish to leave on their own terms, I'm not comfortable with it for people with mental illnesses.
People like you are why I can’t support euthanasia even for chronic illnesses which deserve to have it available.
We’ll quickly slide into you nightmarish fantasy.
