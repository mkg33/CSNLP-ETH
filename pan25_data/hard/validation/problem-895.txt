It really could go both ways.
It really depends on what kind of competent leadership is on the house GOP side.
McCarthy is likely to be a speaker and he's a pretty shitty leader.
I don't think house republicans will be able to keep moderates and crazies in check therefore DEMs will probably be able to take advantage of this and prevent shutdowns and blocking funding to ukraine.
The fact that Dems are probably going to be keeping the Senate sets up the house GOP for some very painful votes for them to be opposed to like Ukraine funding.
as far as the house goes there is not enforced partisanship, so it's based on how many GOP votes are needed.
The most likely outcome at this point is that Republicans control the house, and there's a virtual tie in the US senate.
If the Republicans control the house, the question is going to be, who is the speaker, and who is he beholden to?
Will he bring up bills to aide ukraine and potentially pass them with democratic votes over the objection of the pro-russia freedom caucus crazies?
Or will he say "I won't touch it unless the republicans are agreed.
".
Yep.
If more than half of voters are women, and more than 60% of voters are pro-choice, then the GOP should have lost a lot of Senate seats.
Turns out a lot of voters will say their are pro-choice but will vote for anti-choice Republicans.
Racism is a helluva drug.
