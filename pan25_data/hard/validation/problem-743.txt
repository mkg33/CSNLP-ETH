This really makes me wonder.
Had Biden been hurt or even killed when he went to Ukraine, would this idiots take Russia as a serious threat and condemn them?
Or go "Ha, idiot.
That's what you get for going to a warzone" and talk about how Russia's the victim?
That’s the situation Russia is in now.
They did it to themselves, certainly, but when someone feels that way, and they have weapons such as nuclear weapons, everything is put on the table.
Never underestimate a person who is afraid for their life.
They will go through great lenhs to not die.
And if that person has one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world, nobody wins.
Second, I do agree with the fact that we can’t let people do whatever they want as that is equally dangerous.
I’m only noting that the view the grounded republicans have is one that means ensuring we’re not making Putin feel like he needs to start a nuclear war.
All I can say in terms of my personal stance is as this war goes on and we continue to support Ukraine, he’s inching closer and closer to a nuclear ready state.
He could be doing it in case they are invaded by us and Ukraine.
He could be doing it because he’s ready to strike in Ukraine.
I have no clue.
