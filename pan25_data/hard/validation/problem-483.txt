Doesn't take a deep knowledge of politics to know that Japan is pretty far down the right wing rabbit hole.
Look into how minorities are treated in Japan.
"Japan has no law prohibiting racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination, or discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity...Japan has no national human rights institutions.
".
Yes.
The US and Japan have a mutual defense treaty which applies if either Japan or US military bases in Japan are attacked.
If Russia was at all serious itâ€™s a case of fuck around and find out.
This sounds dumb on Russia's part but doesn't every country have plans to invade each other?
I mean the US has drawn up plans to invade Canada as ridiculous as that sounds.
And then there was the British plan if Canada was invaded by the US... and their whole plan was to watch and let it happen.
Just as the US suspected.
In the 1930s the USA had a plan on how to invade Canada, and it relied on the idea that the British would abandon Canada.
Canada themselves had a plan on how to fight off American invaders, and it relied on the idea that the British would send troops to fight.
