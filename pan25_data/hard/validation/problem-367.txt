The general public sadly isn’t aware of how many great things his administration has gotten done, solely because Biden doesn’t brag on social media 24/7 looking for praise.
Many people didn’t take Trump seriously because of how awful he is, and I don’t think he should be discounted against Biden the next time around.
I was shocked when Trump won in 2016, and disillusioned in many ways.
What I’ve learned from this past decade is that approximately 50% of voters (30ish% of the population) have a completely different understanding of “right” and “wrong.”.
Generally, at face value or on paper, I think many humans agree on some basics of morality and ethics - but, once that mask slips and falls from the faces of the fascists, it’s hard for them to put it back on.
Trump didn’t win because he is Donald Trump - Donald Trump is an awful man from many perspectives - Trump won because his voters saw themselves in him.
Can you imagine the victory lap Trump would take if this happened for Republicans on his watch?
He would literally bring it up every day for the rest of his life.
