Of course not.
Itâ€™s the republicans decades of corruption related to the bogus war on drugs that is the cause of like half the problems our society faces today.
The drug war most definitely causes more problems than it fixes, but Fentanyl is a weird one that probably would persist even if drugs were legal.
It's not a problem that has any kind of easy solution.
The main thing would be to just reduce opiate addiction in general.
A shit ton of it starts in hospitals and with doctors, and patients just move on from oxycontin/vicoden/whatever to street drugs once they get dependent and either build a tolerance or lose their prescription.
Interestingly, kratom is actually a fantastic way to move from a dangerous opiate addiction to something much safer and easier to handle.
Kratom addiction also kind of cures itself after a while, because it weirdly stops working but you don't get severe withdrawal from it after that like you would with proper opiates.
You just kind of lose interest because it no longer gets you high.
That doesn't really work with opiates.
Once you are so addicted that you're shooting heroin or purposefully taking fentanyl, you generally no longer care how safe it is and only care about access - meaning how much it costs.
Fentanyl will always be cheaper than other opiates, so there will always be a market for it.
Some, but not necessarily with Fentanyl.
Fentanyl is used because it is cheap and potent.
I guess if heroin were legally available and people could get it in pure form it would save some deaths from Fentanyl, but generally heroin addicts are broke and desperate and will just buy whatever is cheapest and not worry too much about the dangers.
Perhaps having some harm reduction stations in poor urban areas could help if drugs weren't illegal, so they could do free tests on what people buy in addition to giving them clean needles.
Though there could be some benefits to that method, like providing on-site testing of heroin and other drugs to see if it's got too much Fentanyl in it.
And some of the more trendy heroin users like suburban kids and celebrities would not be getting tainted dope because they could afford to buy the real thing if it were legal.
