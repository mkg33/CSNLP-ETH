What was the last Republican administration that didn’t expand government, add to deficits, and pander to Christian extremists?
Not sure what republican party your dad is thinking of when he says he’s a small government R who disdains the Christian Nationalists.
I’m not American, but from the outside there are only two things I can think of when someone says “small government Republican”:
But please (not trying to be a dick here) what is it about “Republican” policies that makes you call yourself a Republican?
So, let me ask again - what is "Republican Ideology"?
Financially they still seem wed to the ridiculous notion of trickle down economics.
If you want to tell me that giving the wealthy huge tax breaks will somehow help everyone else, I'm going to point you to my earlier point about denying reality.
Look I don’t want to seem snarky (well ok I do a bit) but “your solutions” in the time I’ve been an adult aware of American politics seem to be nothing more than tax cuts for rich guys, and denying reality.
Oh and sticking it to minorities.
