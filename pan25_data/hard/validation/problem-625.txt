Last week, I was traveling in Texas -- specifically to San Antonio and the New Braunfels area to visit some friends.
Before my flight back to St. Louis, I bought a copy of a Texas Monthly magazine at the airport newsstand for some reading material on the plane since the airlines seem to have done away with in-flight magazines and even 'Sky Mall' catalogs.
It's a shame too as I saw some nice areas there but it sounds similar to some of the counties surrounding St. Louis City and St. Louis County which are so MAGA and 'rabid red' that they'd make even New Braunfels come off like Berkeley CA by comparison.
I think he might have been able to beat Abbott or at least come a lot closer to doing so had he never made that 'in the heat of the moment' statement about taking away all the guns.
I think if he had foregone his attempt at a Presidential run in 2020, and only had his previous narrow loss to Cruz on his record, he might have been able to be more electable and had better results against Abbott.
But his campaign for President, along with statements made during that campaign, really undercut some of his appeal to strictly Texans in the process.
