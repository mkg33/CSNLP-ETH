So, I’m not familiar with every name on that list, but I’m willing to bet that they all also supported the Jan. 6th attack on the US Capitol.
As someone that grew up during the Cold War, it’s bizarre that it’s Republicans going to bat for Russia now.
It’s funny how Republicans’ principled stances always have the effect of giving Russia exactly what they want.
Crazy set of coincidences.
“We must suspend all foreign aid for the War in Ukraine and demand that all combatants in this conflict reach a peace agreement immediately,”.
It’s time to end the war and let Ukraine strike a peace agreement before the whole country gets steamrolled or we get goose stepped into world war three.
Now the Ukrainian army is collapsing and hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have lost their lives fighting an army 3x their size… all so the US could extract tax payer money and give it to western oligarchs.
Good on them.
The US is using Ukraine as blood pawns to wash US taxpayers money into the hands of the military industrial complex.
Haha the total aid we have provided to Ukraine is probably less than one day of US spending on our military.
Gaetz is a dbag of the highest order.
May this fail miserably.
