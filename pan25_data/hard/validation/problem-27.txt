The USA literally supported a dictatorship here that suppressed our people in the past.
I dont like Iran either but geopolitics isnt a friendship game.
If your country doesnt like Iran just invade them already and handle the consequences yourselves.
If you have a beef with Iran just call Stuxnet back on, Brazil has no buisiness being USA's puppet, we are just doing our own thing over here.
Plus, i think theres a greater enviromental disaster to take care right now...
We are happy being nobody's puppet over here.
Better be neutral and friendly to both sides and get something from it... Brazil cant do everything yall want just because.
Here's the thing guys, we(Brasil) cant choose one side, we cant afford that.
If Brasil chooses one side for ever our economy will go bad, Brasil always must be a neutral country because that is better for our economy.
You guys have to understand our situation, even that shithead bolsonaro had to do deals with everyone because if that doesnt happen, our economy goes to shit.
