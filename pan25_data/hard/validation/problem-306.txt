â€œSupport for the war in Ukraine has reportedly plunged within Russia, per leaked internal polling data commissioned by the Kremlin and obtained by the independent, Latvia-based outlet Meduza.
The support has never been that high, and the one that was there quickly eroded by Russia's defense situation getting worse (Finland and Sweden joining Nato is almost as bad as Ukraine getting into it), the economic fallout and the reality of the war being unwinnable at this point.
Any hope of a quick victory from the Ukrainian government rapidly collapsing should be obviously dead at this point, conscription brings a risk of personal involvement, Western allies of Ukraine are facing some supply constraints re: military production and stockpiles for their own needs but still seem broadly inclined to support Kiev including maintaining existing sanctions, China seems disinclined to shower Russia with generous infusions of free cash and hardware, etc.
National pride can work for a while, but that's a harder justification to keep up if it looks like you're losing ground in a war of choice.
Like, worst case re: territorial concessions is probably hat they're also compelled to give up territory that they've essentially occupied since 2014.
NATO membeers aren't going to support Ukraine pushing towards Moscow out of some desire for revenge; and if there's any ideas about e.g.
driving the Russians out of other occupied/proxy-force areas like Transnistria or South Ossetia it doesn't seem like it's seriously on the table at least.
