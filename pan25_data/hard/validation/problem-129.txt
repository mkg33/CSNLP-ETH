That's the point, no one is hyped.
No one cares really.
We usually talk and discuss the upcoming world cup.
Make bets about winners and teams that go out early.
It's complete silence now.
Like there is no event at all.
Feels like everyone will just skip it.
I honestly doubt you would actually skip it.
I mean if you even remotely follow football, you’ll eventually be overwhelmed and give in because everyone’s gonna be hyped and talking about it.
You’re seriously gonna miss it because it’s winter?
I understand trying to stand up against corruption but it’s futile in this case.
This World Cup is probably gonna be immortalized as it’s the last of the two goats and if Argentina actually wins this year, probably gonna be one of the most famous world cups ever.
The World Cup is projected to be watched by 5 billion people.
People are definitely excited.
I mean if you’re talking about your own circle then I can’t really argue with you but people are definitely hyped online and especially where I live.
It’s projected to beat World Cup 2018’s viewership.
The World Cup will be popular no matter what.
The audience is just too large.
You have millions and millions of people desperately trying to get tickets.
This is why FIFA can do whatever they want and still not lose support from fans.
This is also Messi and Ronaldo’s last World Cup.
