A few minutes of Google research has led me to a current conclusion: getting there but not there yet, but the sheer number of them indicates that this tech must be getting easier to use and as it advances this will really blow up big.
Wow I didn't realize that this had become an issue already.
I always thought of it like fusion power: always somewhere in the future.
The few deepfake videos I had seen (non-porn) looked so obviously fake I didn't think much of them.
PS: I think deepfake porn is disgusting but faces of famous people on naked bodies is as old as photography.
It's possible the other parties in the porn do not want to be seen having sex with OP.
Even if it's fake.
Well... you technically wouldn't have consent of the other actor/actress(es) in the porn who your face-swapped body double would be having sex with.
This is a law against sharing pornographic material without the subjects consent, deep fake or real.
In other words it doesn't take a stand on deep fakes in general, but on pornographic material shared without consent.
