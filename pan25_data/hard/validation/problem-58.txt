That comes from our own instinctual morality and cultural norms.
It's actually been studied that when people are asked what god thinks, the same parts of the brain activate as when asked the question "what do you think."
Religious teachings are basically just projections of the teachers' personal morals.
So religion is mostly neither good nor bad, people/culture are going to do their thing regardless of whether it's wrapped up in religious ornamentation.
Yeah, I'd cheer that on, unfortunately, the people doing the book burnings are doing it because they think their religion is superior, not because they think that all of them are bad.
People who feel personally offended enough by a book of bunch of Bronze Age parables being burned that they want to kill other human beings are a trash fire.
The fucks that are burning books are doing them so they can provoke Muslims (well, the stupid fucks on the Muslim side) into a reaction so they can rile people up against them.
They’re obviously doing this to provoke the muslims but seriously who cares?
It’s just a book it’s not like they burned all the Qurans in the worlds and muslims can’t use them anymore.
The muslims community should just be mature and move on like nothing happaned.
