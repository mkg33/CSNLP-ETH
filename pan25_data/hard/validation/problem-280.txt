i wouldn't mind if someone replaces russian government by a real democratic one... or you know, maybe just a peaceful one.
that's how low my bar has become.
idgaf about russia any more.
What the ACTUAL FUCK, Russians?
Seriously, how can ANY Russian citizen actually think this shit is okay?
IN WHAT UNIVERSE can anyone think this is okay for any reason whatsoever?
It's like the current Russian regime are some horrid fairytale villians, who kidnap children and spirit them away to toil endlessly as slaves or something.
FWIW I'm talking about Russian people in Russia who (apparently) support Putin and all the evil shit he, and the Russian government, are doing, not Russian people here in the U.S.; I'd assume Russian people who emigrated here wouldn't leave if they supported Putin.
I'll be honest: there's a small part of me that wants World War 3, so we could nuke these motherfuckers until they glow, just to get them off my planet permanently.
But of course I know that would fuck the planet permanently, so I'll just have to wait for Putin to fail utterly and have his own people take him out.
The sooner, the better.
