2/4 Kyrylivka is located approximately 14 kilometers southeast of Vuhledar.
The central part of the town - educational and administrative buildings was turned into an assembly area where enemy forces gathered before dispatching to the frontline.
Before launching the Vuhledar offensive, occupational forces unconcernedly decided to set up an assembly area in the central part of Kyrylivka, not far from Vuhledar.
Let's see how did that work out for them almost a week ago.
Kyiv and western governments deny they exist, but saboteurs say they are striking Russia on its soil with the help of its people.
The primary asymmetry in this conflict is that Ukraine cares about its people and will cease to exist if they lose, while Russia does not.
This can go both ways.
Ukrainian can trade land for bodies.
But Russia has plenty of bodies, whereas Ukraine has finite (defensible) land.
One the morale side, Ukraine of course is in a much better situation then russia, as they are defending their land.
So, its basically comming down to weather the russian morale breaks before the Western support lessens (see: American elections Fall 2024).
Russia would loose half a million man until then at the current rate.
Are they able to stomach that?
Nobody really knows.
