Great news hopefully these gun control laws get scrapped since it's just taking guns away from law abiding citizens, more guns than people in U.S too easy for criminals to get one.
Anyways, that was a lot but my point is that I hear this a lot, “a hill to die on”, why are gun laws the thing that goes too far??
and I guess since I’m vocally pro bill of rights all the time, im always puzzled by this.
I’m as angry about Republican attempts to suppress minority votes via mail in ballot laws as I am with democratic attempts to prevent gun ownership.
Maybe it’s a good idea for people to reflect on how to be more pro-everyone.
Support your neighbor and your fellow countryman’s rights and not get so focused on why he needs them.
I assure you, he knows what rights he needs.
I hope I’ve made my point here.
But just to cement my idea, I’ll also provide links to RandCorps data on political gun control policy studies that show concretely that these policies scientifically do not do anything to curb gun violence (I think 3 day waits have been shown in one study to decrease shootings, but little else), or more accurately, that any politician or entity that claims strict gun laws have societal benefit is lying.
It’s difficult, if not impossible to differentiate between background processes and baseline variance in gun violence rates and the actual effect of policy.
I’m concerned about the direction of society when people get together and decide a certain end is so necessary, for instance a reduction in gun violence (which almost all of the gun violence in America that skews our statistics away from other modern western countries takes place in a handful of crime ridden cities in impoverished neighborhoods, but that’s another rant) that suppression of some peoples rights is warranted to achieve that outcome.
Historically, this type of thinking has been wrong every single time, and often not just wrong, but actively harmful and usually racist(consider suppression of Asian rights via internment and enslavement of American Japanese during WWII and after because of the threat of the war, for instance).
If your start listing societies that have determined that their supposed path to a better society involved suppression and limitation of certain groups rights instead of maximizing everyone’s rights, it gets dark very quickly.
This is just not the way to go.
