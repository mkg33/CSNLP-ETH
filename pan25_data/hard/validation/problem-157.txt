The judge cannot ban the drug, he can only override the FDA approval.
The FDA can simply immediately re-authorize the drug, potentially with aid from an executive order if they want some extra protection.
This would force it to be brought back to the court, with another lenhy hearing, after which the FDA can simply re-authorize, etc.
It might be extra-legal, but so is the authority the judge would call on to "ban" the drug.
This article discusses the claims that they are making and why, legally, the approval of the drug should not be reversed.
The claims they are making are ridiculous - it doesn't even appear that they have standing.
They're hoping the judge puts his personal beliefs above the law.
A federal judge in Texas has a say in federal laws, much like a federal judge in California does.
That’s federalism for you — the final say is SCOTUS which is illegitimate anyway.
After working on Aaon units; Tranes, Carriers, York, etc are all shit by comparison.
Socially, Texas policies suck donkey balls.
But there’s a lot of shit that’s built / sourced from there.
Not true.
Lots of manufacturing down there.
Aaon makes commercial RTU systems with heat/cool/reheat, has awesome controls designs that are not in any other AC\Heating units by other manufacturers and far more energy efficient.
I can literally wire their controls into third party controllers or integrate it into BAS / Bacnet to allow for remote control and monitoring via computer.
