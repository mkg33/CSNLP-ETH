Don’t get your hopes up, if anything if this happens enough detractors will support McCarthy just to avoid split committees.
Keeping their committee powers is far more important.
They can always just oust him at a later time.
Outside of that I also listed how both parties have a set of rules on how to oust a Speaker.
Ousting a Speaker doesn’t have set rules by the House so it’s established in the party rules that’s based at the beginning of each congressional session.
-Before a new Congress can get be sworn in and get to work, they have to pick a Speaker who will put committees together, bring bills to the floor, etc.
In theory, this could go one for the entire lenh of this congressional session which is two years.
If there is never a majority for any candidate, this Congress will never be sworn in and we just wont have a Congress, and no bills get passed.
That is very unlikely.
Edit: To be clear, I think the chances are very low.
But the fact that it's even a remote possibility is just hilarious.
