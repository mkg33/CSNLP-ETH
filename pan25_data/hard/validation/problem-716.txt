The guy is a fucking caveman in both disposition and intelligence.
And that might be being unkind to cavemen.
The Chechens fighting for Russia are Kadyrov’s stooges.
They make tiktok videos of them ‘fighting’ in Ukraine to show how dangerous they are but it’s generally shooting at empty buildings.
Multiple times he has claimed he was at the front fighting in Ukraine but you can clearly see his house in the background of the video.
Also reminds me of the Chechen who was live-streaming and go hit with a Ukrainian artillery while live.
Edit: it looks like it’s still disputed, so much going on looks like i fell prey to the fog of war.
His name is/was Magomed Tushayev.
It was early last year so it’d be hard to find, also I’m not sure there’s video of the strike on the kadyrov general but I believe there may be aftermath footage of the convoy following the attack.
Idk if video footage of his body is out there but Ukraine claims he’s dead while Russia denies it.
Yeah isn’t that how one of his top generals got got?
Dude or someone with him posted something and the Ukrainians bombed the piss outta them.
Poland and Ukraine, lol Russia would be so fucked.
If Poland can hold their own, I imagine there is little stopping them from attacking Russia on their home turf aye?
If they actually try to enter Poland, the biggest problem for the Polish military will be to get to Moscow before the Finns do.
