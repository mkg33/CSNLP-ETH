A Bradley carries a M242 25 mm chain gun, which...
If I were in a T-62, I would not be confident that my armor was going to protect me.
Perhaps a T-72 or T-90 can stand up to it, but from what I hear, Russia's increasingly having to rely on older hardware.
If a Bradley can perforate an enemy tank with a fully automatic weapon, the fact that it hasn't got a big cannon like a tank does really isn't that big of a problem.
People who think western tanks are invincible are about to get shocked to see that anti-tank weapons (especially mines) don't care where the tank was made.
As far as I understand there is massive difference between how to operate tank and how to employ it effectively on battlefield.
My hope is that experienced ones will be able to command them effectively, with newbies being able how to do their function.
Turkey used them horribly in its incursion into Syria.
I wonder if Ukraine has very experienced crews due to amount of fighting, or very inexperienced ones due to expansion of their military.
That’s no different to many of the weapons currently dominating the Ukraine battlefield at the moment.
Stugna, Milan, Kornet, Spike, Konkurs etc.
TOW is fine.
If you are in a situation where that tank is firing back, you shouldn’t be using TOW anyway.
You use the 25mm to suppress and GTFO.
