5) This fun one....eliminate proxy voting and restoring the ability of any member to make a “motion to vacate the Chair,”.
Essentially a motion to oust the Speaker at anytime.
Again - Boehner had to deal with this bullshit.
I'm sure McCarthy told them to go fuck themselves in regards to this.
3) Speaking of steering committee - they want to open it up to “regional representative” positions.
Again...to kick out establishment R's and get the loons in there.
I think those are the big ones.
I'm sure theirs been plenty more small personal favors as Kevin mention monday.
4) "Open the legislative process" - a rule to require that all legislation considered on the House floor is allowed amendments, or allow amendments supported by at least 10 percent of the GOP Conference.
This article did not mention the proposals for term limits, anti-lobbying measures, and banning stock trading by members of congress in office policies that the far-right wants voted on because they know the GOP establishment won’t let those rule changes be proposed because Democrats would vote for them.
