You're proposing exactly what countries such as Argentina are doing, and the result will be no different.
You give people money, inflation picks up fast and everything is back to normal, with everyone being a little bit poorer than last time.
When more money is circulating, inflation rises.
When you put price caps, shortages follow because nobody wants to sell for less.
When they can't do that, the price of other goods rise to account for the loses.
The rich will never lose this way, stop trying to solve things by making everyone else poor but the rich.
Yes I know that if poor people got some of the money that rich people horde that rich people would become slightly poorer in the immediate future.
But the world is better when everyone has purchasing power vs only a few having purchasing power.
If everyone can pay their rents nobody is ending up poor.
Not the rich people whose POV you keep speaking from.
Rich people are paying insane amounts of money to assure they don't lose this way, as in they dont want to be taxed the money that poor people need.
It's that stupidly simple.
