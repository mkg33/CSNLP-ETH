Mrs. Thomas: Thank you for that question, Congressman Raskin.
I can't say that I was familiar at that time with any specific evidence.
I was just hearing it from news reports and friends on the ground, grassroots activists who were inside of various polling places that found things suspicious.
So I don't know.
I was not an expert of the fraud and irregularities that were starting to be talked about.
"Mr. Raskin: Mrs. Thomas, what was the most significant case of voter fraud that you were concerned with after the election took place?
"Mrs. Thomas: I think, yeah, there was a general sense of surprise when the election night was going as it was.
It looked like President Trump was going to win, and it shifted, you know, late in the night.
And, honestly, it was just because of my sense on the ground as a grassroots activist that it was shocking, that the rather lackluster performance by the Biden candidacy versus what was happening on the ground with President Trump, it just -- you know, in a gut way, that was my first sense that something seems wrong here.
".
This.
But head over to that conservative subreddit and you’ll find it chock full of whataboutists and bleach drinkers who SWEAR there is info that’s not been shared that proves it was ANTIFA or some other bullshit.
