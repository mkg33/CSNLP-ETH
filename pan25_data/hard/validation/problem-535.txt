Not to support dailymail (Broken clocks, as you know), but the West pretty much is waging an economic war against Russia right now, and are actively supplying a side with more logisitical value than any other power could ever dream of getting.
Rightfully, might I add in case anyone gets any ideas.
Demanding a surrender of some kind (Like GTFOing out of all of Ukraine) for the lifting of sanctions is technically terms of negotiation that would fit the bill.
Of course they can offer surrender terms the west is backing Ukraine, like it or not Ukraine is not the only one who gets a say in this as long as they are getting western backing.
I do worry that these will be the conditions under which the West will want Peace, so they will be unwilling to provide Ukraine with support in retaking Crimea.
I'm just wondering how did you come to that conclusion, and why are you ignoring the other contested territory in Ukraine?
On the other hand, bending too much to the demands of an aggressive attacker shows they can get away with such land grabs and hold on to them.
And encourage future acts of aggression.
