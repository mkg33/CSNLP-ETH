I am honestly surprised Russia hasn't just started bombing the shit out of everything at this point; if it's standing it goes down.
Ukraine & Russia are basically on life support, and we are just watching a slug-fest between two countries to see who can survive longer on said life support.
It just sucks because I feel like for the Ukrainian's they can't fight back because if they go into Russian territory and start actually fighting them rather than defending they'll get their support ripped away from them.
That results in people cheering for a long conflict in which Russia loses even more and Ukraine wins all it's territory back and thus there should be no peace considered before that but that often ignores the possible ramifications of such a stance and it is easy to overlook the costs Ukraine has to pay.
If Ukraine surrendered, and Russia was able to propagandize the whole world, that all the people of the "newly liberated" areas are happy, and if they rebuild the place by pouring billions of oil money into it?
I'm not so sure.
Yup.
They have had a perpetual inferiority complex with the Western world, and a psychotic need to put more land between them and democracies.
Their people are complicit in allowing many different forms of autocracy and strongmen take over.
They will blame anything and everything for their inferiority complex.
I had one bring up Napoleon attacking the Ruzzian Empire as if Napoleon had not also attacked Spain, Italy, and many other countries that tried to oppose him.
They bring up the Nazis, as if the Nazis didn't try to take over all of Europe and exterminate multiple ethnicities.
They bring up WW1, as if they didn't escalate it from a regional conflict to a global conflict, while simultaneously dragging France and the UK into a destructive war.
