The judge will order them to do it, then the republicans will flood it with comments against it.

Lick those boots harder Mr. Bill Collector.
Helps with debt relief, give me a break.

You’re wrong pal.
Those Acts provide authority to waive or modify statutory provisions DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY.
Then when the emergency is over, the pause or modification is reinstated to the original requirement.
