This whole scam is her attempt at self-preservation.
By labeling herself as "independent", she cannot be primaried.
If the AZ Democrats choose to run another candidate against her, they risk splitting the vote and tossing the Senate seat to the Republican... who will most likely be Kari Lake or some other MAGAtt wackjob.
They should still run someone, the Democratic vote will be united in opposition; sheâ€™s more likely to pull GOP votes if the GOP puts up a nutter, which is likely given who runs the AZ GOP.
Those GOP Moderates were never voting for a Kari Lake style candidate and would vote Dem in the Senate now they may vote Sinema splitting the key vote Dems need in AZ.
Don't worry about Sinema: Run a Democrat for Senate in Arizona or risk losing house and statewide seats.
Run a Democrat for Senate in Arizona alongside Sinema and a Republican and watch a Republican win the senate seat, but hold a lot of statewide offices and set Mark Kelly up for a success in 2028.
Run a Democrat for Senate in Arizona alongside Sinema and a Republican and watch a Republican win the senate seat, but hold a lot of statewide offices and set Mark Kelly up for a success in 2028.
Run Sinema for Senate against a Republican in Arizona and watch a republican win the federal senate seat.
The Democrats also lose Arizona Statehouse, Statewide offices, etc, and the Democratic party infrastructure collapses in Arizona setting Mark Kelly up for a loss in 2028.
