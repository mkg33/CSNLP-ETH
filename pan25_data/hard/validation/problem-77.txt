I always keep hearing negativity, but what can we do at this point?
It’s becoming hard to have any hope with how things are going and yes we can vote, but it feels like we can’t win against the corrupt alt-right court system.
I think it's more that they can't vote, for a variety of reasons amplified by the current state governments.
Gerrymandering, closed polling places, long drives to cast a vote, no weekend voting, no ballot drop boxes, etc.
All part of a deliberate strategy to suppress Democratic votes, and enable a minority of Republican voters to keep the political machine running.
Lot of good people in the South.
Not their fault conservatives have stacked the deck so egregiously against them.
I wouldn't want to abandon them as a lost cause, when it's that nasty rump-end of the Confederacy that manages to stay in power, and pass ever more draconian legislation.
A minority of conservatives are trying to reshape America to their image.
And it's all nonsense.
By the time any of these policies have had an effect on a state, with more white babies born and becoming uneducated corporate workers, the conservative asshats that passed the legislation will be dead.
