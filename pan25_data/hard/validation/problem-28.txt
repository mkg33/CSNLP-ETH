British military intelligence believes the conditions of the battlefield are quickly turning against the Russians’ favor, as forecasts of warmer weather in the Donbas mean snows will melt and the ground will soften, making the swift movement of troops and heavy vehicles near impossible.
Those conditions are likely to be at their worst “with extremely muddy conditions, over mid-to-late March,” according to the latest intelligence assessment.
So on the anniversary of the start of the invasion, in which its forces became bogged down in mud, Russia will start another offensive in which it will be bogged down in mud.
Basically while the Mud is very much not on Russia's side, time is even more not on their side, so waiting for the mud to go away isn't an option.
Even more so when you consider the internal political games being played at every level.
Back a year ago the mud wasn't their main issue, their main issue was that their own solders had sold half their gas for booze and were expecting a walk-over.
The mud was a secondary issue to... basically all the other ridiculous issues on display.
The problem will be the mud.
You can't drive armor or supply trucks through mud, so unless this offensive wraps up before March it's going to start to run into serious problems as the snow melts.
Then everyone will probably have to wait until summer before any major offensives.
IMHO it will likely depend on how defense against this "anniversary offensive" goes.
If they decimate it even half as well as the battle for Kyiv last year, they might try to catch Russia offguard by doing a counterattack before most of the new Western hardware arrives.
Because at that point, Russia may try to spin things at home that they have "accomplished their mission" and try to dig in even harder then claim Ukraine "doesn't want peace" and use that as an excuse for full mobilization.
Denying Russia strategic political goals can end up being very beneficial for Ukraine in that regard.
