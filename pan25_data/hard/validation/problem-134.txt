His actual comment from the article sounds more like a wager.
That he was so sure no democrat would switch to vote in a moderate Republican and undermine him.
If that's what he'll do with a moderate GOP, what would he do if they elected a moderate democrats as speaker.
I think they know that the Democrats are close to recruiting a few people to get enough votes to get a centrist of some sort.
Gaetz et al thinks the threat of giving the Democrats the actual majority is enough to get them to not go for a centrist.
This whole I'll resign thing is just a ploy to delay that decision.
If a enough Republicans resign, the Democrats could get power, either by claiming 50% of occupied seats or if the seat is filled with a Democrat by a governors appointment where applicable.
“If Democrats join up to elect a moderate Republican, I will resign from the House of Representatives.
That is how certain I am.
I can assure your viewers that won’t happen.”.
In the article he's not saying it as a threat.
If you read the quote, he's saying that he's so confident democrats aren't going to budge that he'd resign if they did.
