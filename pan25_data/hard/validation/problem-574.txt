Biden could've also listened to Warren and AOC about leasing non-tribal federal land to privately funded healthcare clinics.
And he could've had the HHS change the federal guidelines to clearly and explicitly define what constitutes an "emergency" for abortion care, that way states don't get to play word games with what constitutes an "emergency" like TX is doing.
A "miscarriage" is also an "abortion" as far as the law is concerned (How the fuck do you tell the difference), so getting healthcare during a miscarriage event is perilous for women now.
Republicans: passes restrictive abortion bans after doctors testify that such bans force women to carry dead fetuses until sepsis sets in.
Republicans: We will make sure that when a kid is in the womb, theyâ€™re as safe as they are in the classroom, the workplace, the nursing home, because every stage of life has value.
