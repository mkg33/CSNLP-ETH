Maybe this would be an option for Trump if there were any way to ensure DeSantis actually follows through with a pardon, but there isn't.
Hard to imagine Trump plays along if all he has to go on is DeSantis' word.
Even with the promise of a pardon, I don't think Trump could play nice for very long.
Hes not wired to admit defeat.
People forget that he claimed Ted Cruz cheated in Iowa.
This is a guy who has made up awards for himself and sent a picture of his hands to a reporter for 25 straight years because the guy called them small.
He took a sharpie to a map for ficks sake when everyone would have forgotten about y if he ignored being called out for the tweet.
He can hate both.
Been saying it for weeks - other than promising a pardon if he plays nice, there is nothing Defascist could do that would prevent Trump from calling the Republican election rigged and calling the party thankless.
He'd love to say "only Trump can defeat the Democrats".
Trump will do everything he can to make sure he the last thing he is known as is a loser.
Admitting defeat and endorsing the guy would would make him a second fiddle loser.
He will never admit defeat.
And the GOP knew this when they supported Trump's Big Lie.
He will go full scorched earth and I'm going to be sitting back with my popcorn enjoying the show.
