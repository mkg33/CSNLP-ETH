Katty Porter: it's wrong to label them criminals simply for who they are.
I.e homosexuals, trans, cross dressers.
Being trans/queer is inherently a sexual thing (to them).
I mean, it HAS to be, right?
They have their own porn categories The right has looked at them, a lot.
Therefore, since queerness is inherently a sexual thing, queer people shouldn't be allowed anywhere near children.
Because A) we can't have them queers conning those sweet and innocent children into doing all that immoral sex stuff and B) no child ever attempts to explore their attractions and self-presentation until they are 18.
It’s also because they can’t conceptualize what it’s like to talk to children about sex and gender without wanting to fuck them, so they erroneously assume everyone else must be the same way.
I think the concern is there are parents who are possibly pushing or influencing, knowingly or unknowingly, their kid into convincing them they have a gender identity issue.
And then getting those children hormone blockers and/or gender reassignment surgery, when really they don’t have gender identity issues.
This would be a terrible outcome for a child who didn’t actually have a gender identity issue.
So I think most people see it as protecting children from parents who might be causing their child intentional or unintentional harm.
And I’m not saying there aren’t kids who truly feel like they are the opposite sex but rather that is challenging to distinguish a child who truly needs help transitioning and just girls who are tomboys and boys who are a little more feminine and like to play with Barbies.
Getting that wrong and transitioning a kid that shouldn’t be transitioned is incredibly harmful.
That is the concern.
I hope that makes sense and I shared that in the most respectful way possible.
