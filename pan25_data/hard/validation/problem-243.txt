I disagree with your comment.
The world buried Ukraine before the war started.
The US knew what was coming, and warned its allies and Ukraine both.
The Europeans pretty much said their farewells last time they saw Zelenskyy, as nobody believed that Ukraine could resist Russia.
The groundswell of support came after everyone realised that Ukraine will fight to the end, and that Russia is was more incompetent then anyone though.
If Zelenskyy run away as the US proposed at the beginning of the war then its likely the Ukrainian people would not have the moral to fight as fiercely as they did.
I also didnt mean to imply that the (old) west sided with Putin because of race.
They sided with Putin because it was convenient and there is a lot of money involved.
They get far more benefits from Putin then from Ukraine, i.e.
low energy prices for one.
Anyways a lot to unpack here, if you are interested there is a lot information out there.
(Old) Europe was way more invested in siding with Putin at the start for example.
The fact that they are white, well maybe thats subjective, Taiwan has been getting a lot more help over the years then Ukraine, its a hard comparison to make as there are many reasons for this, but just one off the top of my head.
You my good sir are reasonable, donâ€™t get me wrong the Ukrainians and any other fellows fighting over there have my full respect, and Taiwan is a strategic place economically and geographically, so I am pretty sure the US is willing to go to war with china over it.
