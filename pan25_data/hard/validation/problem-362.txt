Russians love Amnesty international, they give them propaganda fodder because Ukraine dared to defend their cities from Russian nazis and use abandoned school buildings.
AI observers go there and their report focuses on how bad Ukraine is for nonsense like that lmao.
The worst thing about it is that there are real crimes committed on Ukrainian side.
Amnesty just decided to manipulate some stuff into dubious statements because it's easier and fits the order.
The whole thesis about military men being in hospital turning it into military base is also straight from russian playbook (remember how they hit "officers house" in Vinnytsia because of the name and then it turned out it was basically a club?).
No word of evacuation or lack thereof here too.
Only one instance can be classified as violation, where guns fired from near one hospital, but we have no word on it's status (civilian/commandeered/evacuated) either.
"Both sides bad" is exactly what russia needs, and, in fact, one of their narratives.
Amnesty provider them that.
Is there something about Amnesty International I don’t know?
I’ve never heard of them being any sort of authority on valid military targets and am confused as to what “brand” you’re referring.
Aren’t they a human rights organization?
