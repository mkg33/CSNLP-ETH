Interesting that the administration is turning it's attention to the border and immigration now that Congress is split.
Any reason why they'd be doing this now, or is that just coincidental?
An alternative response could have been something along the lines of, "I disagree they're turning their attention to the border now because of A, B, C".
I think your response is based in some snap judgements about my intent.
From my perspective, while there have obviously been policy actions around the border and immigration, the administration tried to keep it from being a public focal point.
With Biden making his first in-person visit, that seems to be changing.
But Biden is just playing to the Republicans.
He's not solving any humanitarian crisis by adopting the right wing position on immigration.
He's just doubling down on the Trump policy he was elected to oppose.
Biden "deals with " Republicans the same way Chamberlain "dealt" with Hitler.
Sorry, no.
I mean Quisling, not Chamberlain.
You are obviously unfamiliar with Biden's entire career of trying to be more Republican than the Republicans.
