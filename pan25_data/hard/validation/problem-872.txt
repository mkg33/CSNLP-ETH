A standard feature of business tax deductions is depreciation of assets.
You buy a vehicle, or a computer, for your business, and you get to depreciate the cost in your taxes over a standard number of years, because trucks and laptops wear out, or become obsolete.
So my company gets to buy houses, and take depreciation, then after a while, when it works for my company’s business, I turn around and sell the property for 30% more than I paid for it.
In the Seattle market, that would have been about five years!
In those five years, I’ve written off 18% of the cost of acquisition from my company’s taxes.
This depreciation gives a business a significant advantage over an individual who wants to buy a house to live in, because if you live there, it’s effectively cost you 18% MORE to own that house than it cost my business to buy it and rent it out.
So, even if the house doesn’t appreciate at all, I’ve still made a profit that you would never see, so it makes sense for my company to buy residential real estate even in a flat market.
Whereas if you just unchain the market and let the developers do their thing and increase supply, that's also the sort of thing that would make it less profitable to sit on property while having it be vacant - because property values would decrease due to the increased supply.
There's some other things that can be done to shave things down around the margins a bit, but ultimately this is a supply side issue and we need supply side reforms if we want to actually make substantial progress on it as opposed to just doing some populism.
The housing crisis is caused by government regulations that make it harder to build more and denser housing.
The way to make housing more affordable is to slash zoning regulations so that the market can provide more housing, with increased supply leading to downward pressure on prices.
Here in Portland, the population decreased slightly and yet the housing availability went down significantly due to hedgefund guys buying all the houses (with cash, above asking price, and with no inspections) and using them for AirBnB.
