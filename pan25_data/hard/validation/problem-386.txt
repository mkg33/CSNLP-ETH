Republicans created this mess by pandering to single-issue voters, and single issue voters are nearly all radical or even extremists.
The Republican party would merely look like they heeled behind another elitist white collar criminal politician instead of an anti-democratic and existentially dangerous one.
While still providing the break from Trump that this election may have shown they needed.
That way, Trump no longer has an opportunity to divide Republicans and push away centrists from voting Republican in the next election, while also ensuring that the most “respectful” (relative to inciting a coup at the capital or stealing top secret security documents that put lives in danger) of the numerous cases that are being worked on is the one that puts him away.
What are the chances this is an agreement by the Republican elite to throw Trump under the bus in the least harmful way possible to the Republican party in regards to 2024?
Without looking at which judges voted which way, I'm guessing the Republican controlled Supreme court is doing this to sink Trump's chances of getting the party nomination.
This is just the supreme court throwing a bone at liberals before they give Republicans the power to legally overthrow the voters.
Then they can point to this ruling and say "see, we are impartial.
".
