They're going to impeach Joe Biden at least 3 times for stupid bullshit reasons.
They're doing it because Trump was impeached twice for good reasons each time.
Then the (R) house would impeach Harris 3 times so that TFG woudn't be the most impeached president.
Sure, MTG will be grandstanding on the House floor making QANON speeches and calling for impeachment, but I don't see impeachment going anywhere.
Some of the 'ultra' magas will try to introduce impeachments, hearings, etc and they'll be shot down by the leadership.
The hearings they do hold will be constantly bringing administration officials before committees and using their time to lie and pontificate for a Fox News soundbite.
That's about it.
Nothing will get done, McCarthy, or whoever is the Speaker, will have a nightmare trying to keep his (because it will be a man) caucus together.
He'll have the same problem Schumer has in the senate, a very narrow majority skews power to a tiny handful of republicans.
It will only take a handful of moderate Republicans in the House to stop the "Freedom" caucus from their bullshit, especially if McCarthy does everything by "secret ballot.
