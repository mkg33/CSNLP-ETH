"least regulated and structured" You do realize Sheriffs are ELECTED officials that swore an oath to the Constitution?
Wtf you mean scares you?
They should be the safest and least corrupt in comparison to police chiefs and state police that are completely controlled by State officials/feds LMAO theyre the ones protecting your Constitutional rights, and wont get fired for doing so.
You're cringe.
Huh whats your point?
Women couldnt vote cuz there no amendment yet lol.
U wanted the women to wait forever?
If a state bans women from voting again should we just wait for the court to decide for years or uphold the Constitution immediately?
Then, ILL will pass a differently worded law that is equally unconstitutional, sherriffs will again refuse to enforce said unconstitutional law, and it'll go back to the courts to be struck down again.
This is an Illinois law, and that’s why Illinois sheriffs are supposed to enforce it, at least until it’s constitutionality is brought into question and decided.
If and when parts of it are ruled unconstitutional by Illinois or US Constitution, then that changes things.
So the 2nd amendment supercedes the IL state constitution which says that the state legislature can take away the right to keep and bear arms?
Agreed.
