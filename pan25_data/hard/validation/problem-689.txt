That not at all why healthcare isn’t a thing in the United States.
The US spends enough on domestic health to have free healthcare, it’s just the funds are mismanaged and insurance companies make it worse at every turn.
That's actually a lot more comparable to why healthcare sucks in this country than "fund mismanagement".
Someone on minimum wage can't afford to live because the cost of living is too damn high.
Yet for some reason its never a problem when they want to cut taxes or increase military spending.
No, it's only an issue when we want to provide healthcare.
Medical procedures in the US cost 10x more than in other countries and the government has no ability to regulate prices.
The US can't provide good healthcare because the cost of healthcare is too damn high.
It's not because the government is spending money in the wrong places, it's because it costs $15,000 to treat a broken arm in the US meanwhile it costs less than $1000 in Europe.
That's not "fund mismanagement", that's the government having no control over healthcare prices.
