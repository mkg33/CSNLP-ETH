Don't destroying these Russian units means that they will continue destroying Ukrainian cities and killing Ukrainian soldiers.
I'm sure.
If it would have been possible, Ukraine would have cut of and destroyed /captured the Russian units on the right bank of the river.
But the Russians managed an orderly retreat and didn't gave them an opportunity for it.
In peacetime such a process usually takes years.
If Ukraine and its allies can do it in just one year under war conditions, that would be a great accomplishment.
So while sending 100 western tanks and 50 Bradleys is great and all, Ukraine is a big place and those numbers need to go up by a LOT.
The US has 2,000 Bradleys sitting in deep reserve just waiting to be decommissioned, I'd like to see us donate 500-1000 of them.
THAT would be a game changer.
Ukraine mobilized early and have close to 1M personnel under arms currently.
Now, the quality is all over the place, ranging from veterans to TDF to Pavel and his bros, which explains why NATO has emphasized training programs.
