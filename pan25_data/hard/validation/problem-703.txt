Why is it even news?
Countries have their vessels dock in other countries all the time.
It's not like the Iranian ships are a threat to the US or something.
The Coast Guard could probably knock them out.
It gets posted here because people don't realize it's pretty routine, and think this is some kind of new or alarming threat.
There's so much clickbait over these otherwise everyday things just to scare people who think this is some kind of declaration of war by Iran.
It's not a matter of liking it or disliking it.
I don't really care.
I'm simply saying that this is more clickbait than anything.
It happens all the time from stronger countries than Iran with no coverage.
Iran itself has had warships in Venezuela before, closer to the US.
Iran is one of the US's top 2-3 enemies.
The only reasons their ships are even in the Western hemisphere is to irk the US.
It's not even remotely an everyday occurrence for Iran to sail military ships into the Atlantic, let alone all the way to the Americas.
im amazed they made it across the atlantic, Iran every year threatens to send "warships" ( usually a frigate and tanker) to the U.S. coast, causes a big media uproar then the trip either never happens or gets as far as the cape of good hope and turns back.
Honestly it's pretty bizarre because Brazil and Iran must have set this up well in advance, Iran only has a green-water navy.
