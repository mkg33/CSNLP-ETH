Frankly, most Ohioans don't want it.
I have never met more inhospitable people anywhere else in the country than I did in Ohio.
The exception to the rule is some of the queer groups, but even then its often "I hate you but we'll get along.
".
It's not though.
Your income doesn't define your class.
Your relationship to capital does.
If you work for capital owners to earn a wage, you're working class.
If you own capital, you're in the owning class.
Lol how does defining working class as people who work for their living not make sense?
That's literally what the term has always meant.
There are capital owners and laborers.
It doesn't matter what kind of work you do.
You're still a worker.
No it doesn't.
Working class refers to people who make their money by working and earning a wage, rather than owning a business and earning based on ownership, rather than labor.
An NFL player making millions is still working class even if his material conditions are vastly different than many other working class people.
Similarly, someone running a small family business with employees is not working class regardless of how profitable the business is.
Agreed.
We aren't talking about middle class, but the middle class are people who, for example, own small businesses, but still work at those businesses or people who work high end jobs earning a salary, but also make a significant amount of their money on investments.
There are plenty of those people out there, but the point of this conversation was to define working class, and expunging workers from the working class based on arbitrary criteria like the kind of work they do is idiotic and completely counterproductive.
Why is a construction worker making $80k/year any different from an engineer making $80k/year?
Why do you desire to set people against each other based on something so arbitrary?
Their struggles will be the same, and their socioeconomic situations will be nearly identical.
