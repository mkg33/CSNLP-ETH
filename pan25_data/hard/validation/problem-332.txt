It doesn't matter that this happened before Elon Musk bought Twitter.
What matters now is this situation is Elon Musk's problem.
That's a lot of raw, high profile user data.
Add another fine from the FCC GDPR (thanks for the correction u/Pepf) , and its a wash.
Musk loses either way - hundred thousand to the FCC and a couple hundred million to the GDPR, and the data of high profile users get doxxed; Or discussing terms with the person selling the data, and hoping they hold up their end of the bargain.
Twitter's always been shit, in fact I think Musk only proves how unnecessary a lot of people were if the company is gonna keep running just fine the way it already did lmao.
To think Elon Musk bought Twitter without doing the due diligence to discover this problem on the horizon, and has been at the helm making major changes for months now and still didn’t do anything to solve this or warn about it.
Almost like he’s incompetent.
Then rocket genius boy surely discovered this during due diligence and already has a plan in place to handle it right?
He stopped the process of acquisition at several points to gather information and address concerns.
Because that’s what CEO’s are expected to do and anything less means he deserves as much criticism as if he did it himself.
