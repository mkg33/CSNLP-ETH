What about the poor pilots?
There are 4 confirm Balloon poppers and only one of them has bragging rights.
"Hey girl, ya Im a pretty big deal fight pilot.
Bagged me one of those balloons you might have heard about.
".
Yeah.
900 weather balloons are launched twice a day.
92 in the US alone.
Could easily have been a couple of those or another research balloon.
Probably donâ€™t want to disclose, because they will be laughed at for spending a bunch of money downing research balloons.
Also I think you haven't been paying attention if you think the balloons were discreet considering they were all spotted and shot down.
I just don't really buy into the idea that the military/gov are in panic mode and blindly shooting at old balloons that wander into NA airspace.
These objects were much smaller than that first spy balloon, so if you wanted to send a message that you have clear capability to detect and shoot down these sort of objects, why not shoot down a couple harmless (and pretty small) balloons?
I feel like if they have access to FTL/Anti-grav tech then they must be able to create more discreet and more efficient surveillance methods than giant balloons with sensors attached to the bottom.
It defeats the purpose of recording data if the data recorder will be destroyed immediately upon discovery?
