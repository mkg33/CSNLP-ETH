Countries all over the world has bought more weapons from them.
America alone has earned back 10x times whatever they’ve given to Ukraine from these weapon sales.
They’ve made security a tangible issue, and that’s what they do best.
The lesser seen political and diplomatic influence is far more valuable.
America has united the EU, and earned a staunch ally where before Ukraine has seen the US as an unstable thorn on the side (remember when trump asked the Ukraine president to dig up some corruption stories).
So because of one group and a history of corruption (which is also true for every eastern european country), you would say that the US should rather let Russia just invade and annex Ukraine?
Is that also true for other Eastern European countries then?
Like, if Russia attacks Moldova, just let 'em?
EDIT: And by the way, your wording of "Before that it was a part of a single party authoritarian state."
is a bit weird way to say "forcefully occupied by the same guys attacking them now" - like that's the main part of defending Ukraine is to not let this happen again.
Saying Putin can conquer NATO because he invaded Ukraine is like saying Saddam can conquer the entire middle east because he invaded Kuwait.
"they make money on selling weapons" then use the money to bribe politicians and journalists to stoke war so they can sell more weapons.
