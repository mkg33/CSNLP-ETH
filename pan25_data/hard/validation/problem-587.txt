Yesterday US Senators.
Lindsey Graham, Richard Blumenthal & Sheldon Whitehouse met President Zelensky in Ukraine.
Graham said: 🇺🇦 military needs tanks.
I am tired of the s show surrounding who is going to send tanks & when are they going to send them.
“We can unofficially call it “armored Ramstein”.
And we are also very hopeful.
And today, during his speech, the president announced that the next Rammstein will be aviation,”- Sibiga said.
Repeated calls from Ukrainian officials and pilots for F-16 fighter jets look like they finally could be a step closer to being answered, confirmation from the Dutch government that it will look at any request to transfer its aircraft with an “open mind".
This could also force Russians to start attriting their strategic fighter jets to Ukrainian AA fire when the hunt for F16s would become important, plane types that are currently kept away from the frontlines.
If Ukraine gets F-16s, then they're going to have to use the AIM-120C and air-to-ground weapons that force them into range of VKS aircraft: JDAM-ER, SDBs, HARM.
What Ukraine needs is standoff munitions: JASSM, JSOW, SLAM-ER, and Storm Shadow.
What Ukraine needs is missiles capable of engaging VKS planes from extreme range, like the AIM-120D.
It'll be better, but Ukraine still has the problem of the VKS (Russian Air Force).
The VKS has been reported to be establishing combat air patrols behind the front line where they have been throwing very long ranged R-37 missiles at Ukrainian aircraft.
In fact, this is the first ever documented destruction of the S-400 Triumph long-range and medium-range air defense system, which has been in service with the Russian army since 2007.
The Russian invaders are very protective of these complexes and tried to the last not to use them in the Ukrainian war.
> "Anything with the flag of the Russian Federation is now a target for the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
It doesn't matter if it's a cruiser, a boat, a frigate, or a submarine," Neizhpapa emphasized.
