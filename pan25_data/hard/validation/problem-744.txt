You're far to causal with accusations of racism.
Maybe this is racially motivated but maybe it's not.
The point is we don't know and just assuming racism with zero evidence is ridiculous.
Or you just end up throwing around frivolous accusation and make it that much easier for actual racists to hide.
If you're always accusing people, why should anyone take it seriously?
Also, after reading the quote that got her in trouble, it's incredibly ironic how she says accusing her of antisemitism is meant to derail any debate and then accuse Republicans of Islamophobia.
Well I can’t approve of them stripping someone of committee assignments for antisemitic remarks when they are enabling republicans who are literal Christian nationalists is all.
It’s clear what this is to me and it’s not about antisemitism.
The anti-semitic trope is that Jews = Israel and they are one and the same.
Today it's to boot her from the committee.
Tomorrow the same trope will be used to question the loyalty of all Jewish Americans.
