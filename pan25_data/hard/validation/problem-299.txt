How it's going?
Let's put it this way: in the last 6 months media that opposes Netanyahu avoids reporting on it, while the media that supports Netanyahu reports constantly.
I don't think there is a need to spell out why...
I did a very simple exercise.
After one witness testimony, I read the coverage in anti-Bibi media, the coverage in pro-Bibi media and then took the actual protocols of the testimony and read them start to finish.
There was only minor difference between the pro-Bibi media coverage and reality, while there was 180 degree difference between anti-Bibi media coverage and reality.
To put it simply, anti-Bibi media ignored cross interrogation, that actually nullified everything that the witness claimed in her initial testimony.
I don't see any chance of this being "Israel's OJ".
We are not talking about some comedian being on trial.
When one puts on trial a politician that gets as much support of the people as Netanyahu does, the public opinion battle is critical.
When the public opinion battle is lost, then it is not accused who is on trial, but the judges.
For most people, their political belief will determine how they feel about the results of the trial.
Nah dude, I follow it on opposition and independent media all the time.
They are actually quite optimistic and keep saying the prosecution is winning, even in the battles the pro Bibi media claims as detrimental to the prosecution, usually there's a legal win that was ignored in the pro Bibi article.
As an Israeli lawyer I tend to agree with the "prosecution is winning" narrative, as the legal case is substantial and they are gaining most of their legal goals, but they are suffering great losses in the public opinion battle.
