The US is already giving an insane amount of financial and military aid to Ukraine.
This particular defense system purchase is not part of US aid, it's part of Canadian aid.
It just happens to be purchased from the US.
And the USA by itself has more than all of that.
There's 26 carriers in service right now worldwide and 11 of them are US Navy.
They've got over 6,000 M1A1 Abrams tanks, not to mention other AFVs.
No it's , you might by thinking of just the USAF, but the US Army, US Navy, and US Marines all have fighter aircraft too.
No, but you claimed that NATO would be able to fight off the USA with all of the non-USA NATO equipment if the USA was to attack Canada.
Where would NATO be doing this fighting?
Sure European NATO countries have lots of tanks.
Getting them to Canada would take months.
I'm Canadian, if the US attacks Canada I expect the war to be over in a day.
How do you expect NATO to get all of its fighters over to North America to defend Canada?
Carrier?
That will take weeks.
Fly?
They won't make it without a mid air refuel, does NATO have enough tankers to facilitate that?
How well do you think a European pilot will do in a dog fight after a 7 hour flight against a well rested American one who just took off?
