They probably actually need ground troops; because they can't reasonably airstrike the area it'd only make things 10x worse (tho i guess scouting to see where things are is useful).
Or at worse better targeted drones.
Gangs are hoodlums akin to light infantry hiding in civilian areas.
So instead of relying on that, armed gangs control a neighborhood and will often have shoot outs with rival gangs in their preliminary lines.
The safest spots to stay in Port au Prince is in the center of a gang controlled area.
Looking at the amount of money (or lack thereof) compared to the cost of the arms the gangs runs around with in Haiti, is pointing towards upper echelons arming them.
Could be a way to make people lose focus of the real battle.
But really, from what I saw in a mini documentary regarding Haiti, it feels like neighborhoods are trying to guard themselves from problems because the police will react so slowly.
The 2nd largest city in Haiti (Cap Haitien) should be safe and is still fielding quite a bit of tourism.
