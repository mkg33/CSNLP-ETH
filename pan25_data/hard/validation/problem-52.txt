More importantly, how in the hell is anyone allowed to take secret documents home?
What is the process for all of this?
Shit.
If I don't return a book to the library, I'd never hear the end of it.
I'm a Democrat and as much as I don't like Pence, he's handled this better than either Trump or Biden.
Not only did he say mistakes were made, but he said the responsibility lies with him.
He admits it is his responsibility.
Nitpicking over whether that is "admitting fault" or not seems like a waste of time.
Taking responsibility is not the same as admitting fault.
He's using lawyers double-speak.
I know--I'm a lawyer.
He's employing a common PR technique corporations use when they want to appear repentant while avoiding liability.
Legally speaking, the argument goes like this: you can't take responsibility for something you are responsible for.
By definition, the act to assuming responsibility implies someone else is at fault and that you are taking on the responsibility of fixing that mistake even though you have no legal obligation to do so.
