"History is for all" is cool and all, but primarily it should be for those that take their heritage from it.
A sense of shared history is essential for a shared identity which is essential for a stable and functioning nation.
Cool... can a Nigerian just board a plane for the cost of a bus ticket, take a plane ride to London and just enter visa free to take a look at their OWN HISTORY?
Those aren't just "some statues".
The rulers of Benin commissioned them after any significant event in their history.
So instead of history books, their history is "written" within those statues.
And most of the Bronzes are still in London and THOSE people have the gall to say that the Bronzes are for "everyone" and that Nigeria shouldn't get them back.
Ah yes, Nigeria can't properly take care of their own history (that was violently stolen from them) so they should stay in Germany/ England.
Because only Europeans can take care of artifacts.
Homie you're saying if they get sent back to Nigeria they're going to end up "behind a berm next to 3 AK's" but I'm racially gaslighting?
Lol get the fuck out.
