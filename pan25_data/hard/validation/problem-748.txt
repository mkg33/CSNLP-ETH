No you usually watch live though, if you have a strong stomach search for and watch Apache combat mission videos.
Their fire is extremely accurate from far away and their thermal scope shows people in detail that look like they're dozens of yards away.
I'm sure he wasn't ordered to blindly fire.onto buildings where there's a slight chance.of hitting noncombatants, he probably could only shoot people firing weapons at him or ground troops (real rules.of engagements in some scenarios, even if an enemy uniform is holding a gun not allowed to fire on them until rounds.coming at you first).
Not to mention he isn't bragging about it... when most combat guys know their number they're saying it like "That's how many human beings I was responsible for killing" not like "Hell ya wish it had been more".
He doesn't seem like a sociopath and I think people are shitting on a combat vet opening up about their experience, one which is difficult for a lot of vets and keeps them up at night.
I've never been in combat but talked to a lot of vets as a nurse and the ones that talk about actually killing people are definitely bothered by it, it always sounds like a confession to me, never heard an ounce of bragging/celebration in it.
So helicopters are never shot down in wars lol?
He wasn't flying British Royals around, he ran combat missions in support of ground troops, which is usually RPG range.
He originally was an armor officer fighting on the ground.
Once word broke out that he was deployed to Afghanistan, he was taken out of theater.
He wanted to continue his military service, so the compromise was he was going to be an apache pilot so he wasn't as much at risk.
