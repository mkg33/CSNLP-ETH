I live and travel between the US and South Africa and the coverage is like night and day.
The media covers the war from a fairly neutral point of view in South Africa without taking sides.
But back in the US the coverage is obviously extremely lopsided and always takes the side of Ukraine and only pushes messages that are pro-Ukraine.
Propaganda; both sides Trump up enemy losses and underestimate their own losses, but if you are in a western country, you'll be pushed articles with a pro-ukraine bias.
In reality, the meat grinder is likely to be fairly even on both sides with some bad days for one side and not the other, which the governments all know but don't mention much.
Yup, the reality of it is that it's a shit war being fought for shit reasons with a bunch of people dying on both sides both inocent and guilty, and it's a complete waste of life and the only winners are Lockheed, general dynamics, the oil and gas industry, and a geopolitical agenda of both the west and Russia that we don't really understand the goal of anymore in a 21st century world.
