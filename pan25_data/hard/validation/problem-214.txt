Literally the statute she was convicted under.
It was trafficking for export.
Articles 228.1 and 229.1.
2.
Trafficking has a meaning.
You are trying to profit of it.
The specific clause is "1.
Illegal making, sale or sending of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or analogues.
Sure, then give her the 7 days jail and $300 fine for possession of drugs.
That's the penalty for the crime she committed.
We are arguing over the punishment for the crime.
Do you think 10 years in a slave camp is valid for small marijuana possession?

It is fucked people cheer for Russia here especially since most are sitting comfortably in a country whose legal system isn't explicitly cruel.
Even American prisons are kind in comparison to Russian gulags.
I can only imagine the people cheering for Russia here are young, lack empathy and compassion, or straight up so inexperienced at life they just guess at how to feel.
A sure fire mark of someone lacking empathy is an ultra hard stance on crime.
Even criminal psychologists agree that type of thinking helps no one.
