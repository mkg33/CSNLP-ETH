I think the ability for the Japanese to coordinate with South Korea and Taiwan is more what the recent developments are about anyway.
While Japans's general increased military buildup is no doubt a response to China, I suspect this particular purchase has more to do with North Korea .
Tomahawks are subsonic cruise missiles.
If you want something to actually not get intercepted by a near-pear you'd probably want supersonic ballistic missiles.
Unless these are the latest Block V which make up for being a sub-sonic cruise missile by being more stealthy, I suspect it's more so the US getting rid of their older inventory since the US is retiring a lot of their older Tomahawks currently.
What I'm concerned about is that Tomahawk missiles are actually pretty old, but still expensive to build (powered by a jet engine), and relatively easy to shoot down with modern anti aircraft weaponry (large radar and IR signature, and relatively slow).
Maybe it's just something for right now.
And given how stretched the Russians are, it would definitely be a great tool against Russian targets.
Yeah, they pack a punch, but against an advanced military like China, they'll just be shot down in the sky.
I'm not saying Tomahawks are bad, but 50 years after they were designed, their usefulness is more limited...
