Were there other specific individuals (judges or non-judges) from that seven person short list Governor Hochul was provided as qualified candidates that you would support or do you have other individuals in mind?
I'm just curious.
I've been following this somewhat closely (I live in New York too) but now I'm curious what Governor Hochul will do next - push for a full Senate vote regardless (she and her team believe that is an option according to an article I read today) or LaSalle withdraws.
Guess we will see.
Confirmation hearings for Court of Appeals judges here in New York have (historically speaking since we stopped electing them to the highest court in the 1970s) been quite bipartisan.
The statement that purely because republicans support the nominee, “tells you a lot about the nominee,” may be one’s opinion but (like I said) does not give the whole picture.
The fact that the Republicans in the NY Senate are pushing for this nominee (who is supposed to be a dem nominee) should tell you a lot about the nominee .
If all of the republicans are voting for the nominee and most of the democrats are voting against the nominee, which party does it seem like he aligns most with?
