in summary, scifi space man needs a potent and immediate dose of "grounding" and reality checking before he ever shows remorse, whereas trump doesn't have the capacity for remorse or empathy.
bullshit.
i don't know anyone with autism that has that, if anything people with autism RARELY get that big an ego cause they're terminally outcast from society.
It's a known fact that a great deal of autistic studies were poorly performed, designed in such a manner that very little input was taken from the autistic individuals themselves.
And autism is very commonly co-morbid with mental illness.
If you're talking about the effects of autism as a condition, mental illness is going to come up very soon.
It's not derogatory to talk about that, it's a needed part of understanding what autism is.
I was being sarcastic to the other commenter because they think they know with absolute certainty “what autism is” and “all empirical evidence shows” while dismissing your statements as wrong.
I know people with autism and your comment is much closer to my experience than their “overall have super low self esteem” and “you have a very rare anecdotal experience” take.
