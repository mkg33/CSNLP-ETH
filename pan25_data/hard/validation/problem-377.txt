"I've met with scientists, some of the top people in the world, that tell me that we have extraterrestrial craft in our airspace on a regular basis,‚Äù Burchett added.

Yeah.
So not outdated view.
Its still overwhelmingly likely to be optical illusion, natural phenomenon and/or sensor errors.
This is like crop circles.
Articles were written about the energy needed to make these circles and it must be some kind of alien tech.
Nope.
Just some guys with a board and rope.
When the explanation is "new kind of physics we are not aware of" the only scientific and rationale response is "doubt".
Skepticism must be the default stance when we're talking about these kinds of things.
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
New physics is an extraordinary claim.
We have nothing approaching extraordinary evidence to support such a claim.
That's powerful evidence that these craft are not extraterrestrial.
We must acknowledge that, given the local laws of physics, anything that is possible is possible independent of who's creating it (provided they have the requisite knowledge to make it), that we have no evidence of technologically superior civilizations that would have the knowledge where we don't, and that these craft are appearing here, where the only civilization we have any evidence of is us.
If the laws of physics allow one civilization to gain that knowledge and manufacture X, and the laws are invariant across the universe, then the laws of physics do not prevent any particular civilization from manufacturing X.
That means that either it does violate the laws of physics (and thus would wouldn't exist), or it doesn't (and thus any civilization with the requisite science could create it).
