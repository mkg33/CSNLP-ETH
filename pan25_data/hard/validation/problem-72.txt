That's what I'm wondering, too.
As of last night, the Ukrainian MOD was claiming that there were still somewhere around 10k Russian troops on the west bank of the river.
Crossing the river will require alot of Ukrainian forces to even attempt such a move, and then they run into the same supply issues as the Russians faced.
The regional council in Kherson is also reporting that many of the Russian soldiers drowned trying to cross the river, after Russia (reportedly) blew up the last bridge.
Holding Kherson was bleeding the Ukrainians more than the Russians, if you consider an army on the attack often takes more loses than a defender.
You clearly don't understand the military situation on the ground.
War is all about supply lines, and Kherson was completely cut off from the Russians supply lines.
They had been ferrying weapons across the river with pontoon rafts, but nowhere near enough supply's to support the forces they needed to hold the region.
Sustained combat requires hundreds of tons of weapons being constantly supplied to your troops.
Every shell fired from an artillery piece needs to be driven from a warehouse in Russia, all the way to the artillery piece.
If you can't get those shells to your artillery, they can't fire.
