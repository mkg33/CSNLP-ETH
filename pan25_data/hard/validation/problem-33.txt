They don't need to plant ideas, just ensure that they are tossed about and repeated.
They just repost it over more channels than it would usually reach.
But they are helping Brits do it.
It's so easy, all they need to do in encourage conflict wherever it arises.
They support both sides of the argument, as long as anger flourishes ... and Brexit was one of the results.
Basically, the actions of the Cameron Government show that they wanted Brexit, even if their words claim otherwise.
Either that, or they were even stupider than the Truss government.
Or so they claim, but when the so-called "advisory referendum" went marginally in favour of Brexit, Cameron voluntarily and immediately stepped aside to let the overt isolationists take control.
Had he truly been opposed, they could have shepherded us into EEA membership; or begun defining what Brexit means in advance of a third referendum; or declared that votes in border regions might have more "advisory" weight than rural Middle England; or used the significant rule-breaking as grounds to nullify the result.
And so on.
