Because there is hardly any country in the world seeding its territory just because without being forced to, and also, why would we?
What do we get for doing it?
Who's guaranteeing Serbia some other part of the country with ethnic minority wouldn't say they are leaving?
Maybe I'm wrong, but it was mainly the public opinion in Serbia that shut that plan down - or better said, the huge noise from Serbian nationalists, and ultimately Vucic got cold feet.
If both Serbia and Kosovo (and a majority of their respective populations) would have wanted that, who cared about what Germany wanted?
Honestly Serbia should just accept Kosovo as a independent country it doesn't make any sense not to, like clearly they don't want to be part of Serbia so why even try.
I just don't see the point in insisting Kosovo is still Serbian, it's clearly not.
It has a special place in Serbia's history and that should be recognized but so many countries in Europe have had land taken from them, populations transferred / expelled etc.
The historical significance of Kosovo to Serbia is super important but it's also important that Serbia has a pathway to prosperity now and in the future.
Sure I can agree with that, let's say 18th century then?
My point is that isn't not a recent thing where Serbs aren't the majority in Kosovo.
The century where they became the majority doesn't matter too much.
