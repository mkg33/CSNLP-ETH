Back when I was in college, a prominent Holocaust denier was going around trying to get his filth in college newspapers.
My school's newspaper actually published it.
To this day, I wonder if he'd have published a "there never was any slavery" article just because one person wanted to spread that "side of the story.
".
Oh they are.
Holocaust denial is just a PR exercise.
I don't believe for a second that any of them don't believe the Nazis systematically exterminated Jews, and approve of that.
Some of them might be 100% cynical propagandists, others might think the numbers are exaggerated.
But ironically, to be a Holocaust denier you have to support the Holocaust.
Denying the Holocaust, in my opinion, is probably one of the most hypocritical and cowardly things you can do.
Also most of them can't help themselves even when doing holocaust denial to eventually pivot into why the jews deserved it, hypothetically, if it happened.
They're trying to rewrite history to absolve the Nazis of any criminal activity and blame the Jews for "inventing the Holocaust" in order to get sympathy.
