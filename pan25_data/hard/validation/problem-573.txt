I think what made the dike burst was Russia's second mobilization announcement.
They're really going to try to flood the region with bodies in 2023, and it's given the West a sense of urgency that wasn't there before.
They've got a window of probably about 6 months to arm several powerful Ukrainian mobile armored brigades and train those units for a big push.
It was thought at the start of the war that it would take 9-12 months for Ukraine to develop the logistics to handle NATO vehicles.
It’s been 11 months and suddenly the NATO armory doors are being flung open wide.
So, it sounds like a lot more equipment from US surplus is about to be unloaded.
The US usually lists those items with the cost to purchase them directly, even if they are the US getting rid of surplus equipment and saving on maintenance and storage.
Still, great news.
I wonder what toys Ukraine is getting.
Ukraine’s favored tactic this war has been rope-a-dope.
Right now Russia is full of strenh from the mobiks raised in the fall.
Ukraine is letting Russia bleed men to get a few feet of ground, while generally preserving its own strenh.
Once Russia exhausts the mobiks, which should happen soon since the current wave of mobiks have been thrown at Bakhmut in heavy waves for almost a month now.
Russia officially raised 300,000 and sent half to Ukraine, concentrating them at Bakhmut and Soledar.
If a force is meaningless when it has one man dead in ten and Russia loses 500 a day, Russia can’t go much longer with the current wave.
That’s Ukraine’s cue to start pushing.
MBTs will happen for Ukraine and they will happen soon.
We will see large Ukrainian mechanized spearheads penetrating the frontline.
