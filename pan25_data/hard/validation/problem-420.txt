Amsterdam is welcome to keep their red light district and the associated industries they just need to move it away from the city center and away from residential neighborhoods.
There is a stark difference between the way tourists treat the red light district vs other surrounding neighborhoods such as the Joordan district.
And this was a few KM away from the red light district, which is even worse and a much heavier tourist area.
Moving the red light district isn't going to remove tourists who disrespect the downtown neighborhoods of Amsterdam though.
That's just what happens in heavily touristed cities... have you been to Paris, London, NYC, LA?
Vegas, which has legal brothels outside the major districts like youre saying, is probably the worst of all when it comes to shitty tourists.
They don't just stay at the brothels-- they spend most of their time treating the city as a playground.
And while Amsterdam could probably thrive without that tourism, it would still be a big hit to accommodate to.
I believe most of Amsterdams tourists are weekenders who come specifically because of the vices it freely offers.
