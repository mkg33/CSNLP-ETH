Nepal has a few high altitude airports that can be considered dangerous because of hills surrounding.
However, this flight was from Kathmandu to Pokhara, a relatively safer route.
It's relatively ok to fly in Nepal, and yes the roads are more dangerous, but do be aware you have a much higher chance than anywhere else of not making it.
Yes, it’s safer to fly than drive in Nepal, but neither is particularly safe.
The roads are very poorly maintained and driving is truly every man for himself.
Busses pass each other within inches at high speeds while laying on the horn on blind corners next to steep drop offs.
I was always surprised I didn’t see way more accidents.
I love Nepal.
It’s my favorite place in the world, but the transportation options leave a lot to be desired.
You cannot go everywhere easily by land transport in Nepal.
The roads aren’t exactly well maintained, and some areas are truly remote with little to no road access, especially during winter and/or monsoon.
Some areas can take days to get to by a combination of bus and walking.
Last village I lived in was a two to three day trip from Kathmandu, in monsoon, it took longer as the road always washed out.
On top of that, the roads are arguably less safe than flying, even factoring in your chances of a deadly plane crash.
The highway is pretty terrifying, and the mountain roads are often even worse.
