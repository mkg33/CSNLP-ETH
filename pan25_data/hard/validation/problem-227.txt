TL;DW: the current NBC model estimates Republicans will have 222 seats vs 213 for Democrats, but that estimate is plus/minus 7 seats.
So, Democrats could wind up with as many as 220.
(Control is 218.
).
There are a few ways that Democrats could get to 218.
It basically comes down to Democrats sweeping all plausible seats in California and Nevada.
Also, five Democratic Congresspeople who were expected to win in New York and New Jersey lost their races (including Maloney, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee).
If they had simply gotten the job done, Democrats would be estimated to win control as of right now.
If the democrats would secure the house and senate, it would be fucking amazing.
And the US could finally start the healing process, after the last president did everything he possibly could to undermine and discredit even the most fundamental institutions that make the country function.
GOP should be punished for their reckless and dangerous behavior, that they have been committed to for the last four years, where they have been spreading baseless conspiracy theories, and overall just muddying the political climate.
