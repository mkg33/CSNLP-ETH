Hes trying to make it seem like the workers are killing people but this was happening before.
They tried for YEARS to get better conditions and the government left them no choice but to strike.
You knows gonna happen since he refuses to even open dialogue to them and is banning strikes?
The NHS is suddenly going to find itself as worse as a third world country because their tired of having to do the work of 3 people and getting home to have to worry about paying the bills and which utilities they can't pay this month and that they will have to do without.
That was happening with the NHS before the strikes.
Lots of data on it that show these people are over worked and underpaid.
It's not unheard of for there to literally be no ambulances available so they have to tell people to find their own way to the hospital or wait 2 hours for the possibility of one showing up.
We also have people waiting 16+ hours for an ambulance and dying or their health treatment being put on hold due to staff shortages.
Nobody is expected to rent a house by themselves in London and you're using the most costly place to live with the lowest wage which is unfair.
34k also isnt the high end, 42% of Nurses are in band 5 and get this amount, band 9 even goes over 100k so no thats not the high end.
That also doesnt include overtime which is which is 1.5 times the hourly rate.
I'm not sure if its the correct decision but health care workers shouldnt be letting people die because they want a pay rise, there has to be another way to protest that doesnt put patient safety at risk.
