There is one bigger difference: no power sharing agreement.
Having 51 Dem senators doesn't require McConnell and Schumer to come to a deal on how to run committees.
And even better with 51 votes senate committees will regain their subpoena powers which is crucial since the Democrats is on the verge of losing the House.
Yes - committees are no longer power shared - the democrats are the majority.
There are various Senate rules of moving things faster when there is a yes vote in the committee - specifically judges.
Schumer can spend the next two years filling up judges at a crazy pace with none of the Republicans slow down they have had the last 2 years such that there are no vacancies in 2024.
They will also encourage all liberal judges close to retirement to move to senior status in the next year.
Yes it does.
It changes the committees from split even to Democrat majority.
That means judge nominations clear the committee with a yes vote and don't have to go through additional Senate procedures (wasting time).
They can just start confirming more diverse judges faster.
