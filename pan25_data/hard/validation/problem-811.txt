If you sanction A, well now the country needs to switch to B to keep things going smoothly.
After a while, when your country has swapped over to B completely, you sanction B.
Now that hurts more, and your country needs to scramble harder to fix that problem, so they switch to C, etc...
Also another reason for escalating sanctions as opposed to dropped every sanction known to man at once is to keep some leverage.
If you sanction the shit out of Russia with everything all at once, well there is not reason for Russia to listen to you at all since you threw everything at it.
But if you do it over time, it leaves you with negotiating power.
Even if Putin does not care, many oligarchs may get increasingly nervous with increasing sanctions that hurt them more and more, and that will cause instability.
Regardless, as opposed to China, Russia did weaponize our dependency in order to try and manipulate our politics which made them the bigger threat.
I as a european, want absolutely nothing from them anymore, regardless of the price.
The fact that they invested huge amounts of money to buy off some of our politicians, have an imperial agenda and have no issues with genociding people as close to them culturally as possible, makes them a way bigger threat than China could ever be right now.
Yep, thanks to profit obsessed markets, here we are.
Manufacturing jobs are returning to the EU though so that's great.
I don't know man, I personally don't blame you or people that want no part in it.
I just hope the russian public wake up and do something before we start WW3, because Russia (the largest country in the world by land mass) STILL wants more land mass at the expense of murdering innocent people.
Guess we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
For now the war must be stopped with Russia retreating behind their borders.
