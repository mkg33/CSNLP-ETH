A draft dodger is someone avoiding the draft.
Russian citizens are going to other countries so they don't have to fight in Ukraine.
Kazakhstan is a neighboring country to Russia, which makes it convenient to flee to.
To get to Uzbekistan, Russians have to go through Kazakhstan.
Am I correct in undersstanding that Russians feel the need to be two countries away from Russia?
I'm sure plenty of individual Russians don't support the war.
However, enough of them do that comments like "Russian people =\= Russian government" is misleading and letting them off the hook.
I can't tell if you genuinely think "some Russians don't like the war" is a grand discovery of yours or something worth fighting about but everyone already understood that.
It doesn't change that the Russian people do bear responsibility for the war because enough of them support it to keep it going.
Both of my comments say a majority of Russian civilians support the war, and that's true.
The goalposts seem pretty solidly immobile here to me but feel free to try again.
How many Russian civilians support the war?
Enough of them do.
The answer should be zero.
Can you do that math?
