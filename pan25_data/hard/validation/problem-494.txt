Democrats should take advantage of these moments to show Americans how Republicans are still very much a clear and present danger to our democracy, let alone that they don’t have any actual solutions for our issues.
Stay silent all you want.
The GOP is only making themselves look worse than we already thought every day.
Republican constituents are only told what they are told and their source of media is so incredibly biased that they hardly even entertain the other side’s ideology but instead intend to demonize it.
Aside from that, there must be a following of those constituents that truly lack any moral fiber in their being, and are instead emboldened by corrupt, hateful Republican values.
Literally everyone with a functioning brain already knows how corrupt, traitorous, and bigoted the GOP is.
I one hundred percent believe that anyone who’s not impervious to the truth realizes how awful the GOP is and that they hope to remove democracy, institute a religio-fascist dictatorship, and subjugate or kill anyone who isn’t a white, “christian” male.
