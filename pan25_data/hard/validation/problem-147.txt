'Red herring': most crime guns are smuggled from the US, police believe.
It'd help if the feds kept stats, but they won't.
This is not a domestic gun problem: registered, or 3D printed.
3d printing is a terrible tool for making a gun.
My 80 year old lathe is much better suited to the task.
(Well atleast the barrel and a few other critical parts).
Most any machine shop will have the tools and equipment to make guns.
It won't really be a cheap as guns smuggled in from the US.
But the point is it can be done and be totally under the radar.
3d printing a gun is really a bad joke.
It can be done but it won't be anywhere as good as a properly machined gun.
There are 3d printing processes that could possibly make a good gun, but they are very expensive processes.
CNC machining is far cheaper.
Prohibition just drives stuff underground where there is no oversight or even incentive to try to do the right thing.
"I'm already screwed if I get caught with this gun, so why would I keep it unloaded and locked up.
".
not really.
Zip guns are typically cheap, poorly made improvised weapons.
3D printing you're basically making the real thing if you use the right materials.
Metal 3D printing is powder based.
Not anywhere near precise enough to make a ready made barrel, even with "just" smooth bore.
At best you'll make a blunderbuss.
