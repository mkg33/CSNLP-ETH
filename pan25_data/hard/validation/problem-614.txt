Not to be a cynic but what does Cyprus have that would make Turkey interested in negotiation?
The Northern Cyprus issue isn’t helpingTurkeys reputation but they don’t seem to care much about that and even there this is hardly the primary one.
Turkey probably would like to lose Northern Cyprus in a way that doesn't make them lose face, but reunification isn't popular in Cyprus because Northern Cyprus is a mess and full of transplants, and it would harm the southern portion economically to try to fix it.
They certainly will make a deal… which could be finally letting Turkey to join EU… small price to pay for huge political pain in the backside (which is Occupied Cyprus).
It does cost Turkey quite a lot of money to “support” Occupied Cyprus… and I have a feeling that Turkey will have issues with spending money on anything other than rebuilding main land.
IMO this is delusional, it's not like Turkeys government is going to pull out whatever stationed troops they have in Cyprus, or stop spending "time and money" there.
There is no "positive" side effect to the earthquake except that it has brought the people of Greece and Turkey closer despite the differences the governments have with each other.
Ultimately nothing has really changed on the Cyprus situation, Cyprus/Greece and Turkey still have to come to an agreement/understanding and until then the status quo will probably continue.
One “positive” side effect of the earthquake could be that Turkey will not be able to spend as much time and money in occupied Cyprus… if left to own devices, Cyprus will have a chance for re-unification.
Also, it is not very likely but possible that aftermath of the earthquake would be regime change.
All this high rise buildings where build in such bad way because the current government allowed builders to do it for a “fee”… 100k dead people and many more injured are hard to forget.
And I would not be surprised if we will learn about many cases of “misappropriation of relieve funds” by people close to the government… all this is not a “good news” for current administration.
