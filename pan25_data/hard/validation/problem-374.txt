Raising interest rates is part of the problem, but itâ€™s this whole Islamic economics thing that is giving them problems.
Commentor above in the thread was right when they said turkey needs to go back to being the secular country that Ataturk gave them.
Erdogan's regime may lean on Islamistic values, but Turkey itself is not fundamentally an Islamistic country.
They're also notably the border between Europe and the Middle East, their geographical position is all around invaluable territory to NATO.
That'd be a terrible idea.
Turkey is far more strategically valuable than Sweden and Finland.
Turkey has the second largest army in NATO, which is fundamentally a military alliance, and they control the Bosporus strait which is the only way into the Black Sea.
Turkey is a buffer country between Europe and the ME, as well as controlling entry and exit from the Black Sea.
In geographical terms it's probably one of the most strategically important countries in NATO.
NATO aint gonna want to give up one of the strongest military powers and that incredibly important strategic location.
