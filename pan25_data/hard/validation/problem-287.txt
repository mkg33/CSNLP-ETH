And in this case we're not talking about a private corporation, we're talking about the federal government, the dollars they're spending isn't private profit, it's public tax revenues.
We're talking about spending taxpayers dollars here, not Elon Musk's.
Edit: Look, I'm not trying to equivocate, what I'm saying is that I can make an ethical argument in favor of free trade, too.
When you say "We'll trade with anyone but CountryX" we call that a sanction, right?
And it's intended as economic punishment, fiscal warfare if you like, one of the first things the world started to do when Russia invaded Ukraine was to being divesting themselves from Russian oil and pushing Russia out of the SWIFT banking system.
Consider that "We're buying American" is the mirror image of "We're not buying from CountryX," the twin of protectionism is the sanction, at least in terms of effect even if the causes differ.
Now, with that premise in mind, do you see how someone could argue that protectionism is, in effect, a sanction against small and emergent markets?
The whole point I was making was simply this: It's not black and white, there are benefits to free trade and there are drawbacks, there are benefits to protectionism and there are drawbacks.
Sure, except in this case protectionism would mean keeping money here in the United States (which is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the world) rather than buying from poorer nations where the money could do more good.
It doesn't benefit global poor, it just benefits global rich and encourages them to further exploit their poor where there's Lil to no worker protection.
This includes child labor.
