And since then, they've become the world's 7th (?)
country to independently send a 1 tonne payload to space... something like that.
Only about 2 years ago.
Trump wanted the Asian allies to be more independent (because "they aren't paying enough!"
as if the US is a mercenary force and not in Asia for their own benefit), so (finally) cut the restrictions on rocket / missile distance, meaning South Korea could focus on rocket / missile development.
It’s not really a fair comparison since South Korea was restricted on what high-range weaponry they could develop for years and only got the range ban lifted last year by the US.
I suspect they’ll be doing lots of catch-up tests over the next few years.
It was for South Korea, a requirement forced on them in order to be allowed access to US missile technology in the ‘70s.
It certainly should have been lifted years ago though.
Sort of, Trump agreed to relax it to 800 km in 2017, Biden eliminated them completely in March of 2021.
It was inevitable that they were going to get scrapped by the next president, no matter who it was.
