If you think about it, he can't run.
No country would take him and even if one did, asylum is a loooooong way down from stupid expensive yacht, not to mention he'd 100% get assassinated for "deserting".
These people have no option but to double down.
You kinda get the feeling that no one, not even Putin wanted war (he wanted Ukraine to just roll over as the first tanks came in) but now they have no choice but to double down for stupid ideological reasons.
if someone in Russia, an authoritarian state currently cracking down on any form of dissent, randomly comes up to you, aims a camera, and then asks for your opinion...would you give any other answer besides "Oh yeah I definitely support the war"?
Well it's not like Putin can draft people from Moscow - even the old babushkas that obsessively watch and even believe Russian state media might start to care about the war at that point.
Perhaps the Russian people are willing to overlook cruelty, evil, murder, war and tyranny in the name of loyalty to their leader.
There will be no point in seeking meaningless revenge against Putin's assassin, especially when that assassin will likely be a senior Russian official that takes Putin's place.
What about all the generals, the ones that Putin is right now blaming for their failures and throwing under the bus so that he can avoid being responsible?
You think the Army is going to avenge Putin, after being slaughtered in a war, their officers killed, and Generals being blamed for defeat after defeat when Putin himself is clearly the one responsible?
No, they'll rally to support their new leader.
