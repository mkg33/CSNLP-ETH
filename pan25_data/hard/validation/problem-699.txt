The article is about mitochondrial transplants, which are replacing the mitochondrial population and their DNA, not the main DNA we associate with our 23 chromosomes.
The study replaced the mitochondria of an embryo, as it’s not possible to do a transplant past that mark.
There is no one cell population to replace in anything post a certain level of development, so you would have to replace every cell, which isn’t feasible.
Even if they could transplant the mitochondria, your condition would be unchanged as the source of the issue doesn’t lie with the mitochondria.
It’s from your chromosomal DNA making a faulty protein.
Your mitochondrial DNA is working fine, it’s just getting a faulty protein that prevents the mitochondria from functioning properly.
It wouldn’t help as your condition is due to you lacking the ability to make an enzyme that mitochondria use.
Mitochondria have their own unique DNA that are separate from the DNA in our nuclei.
The majority of mitochondrial enzymes and proteins are made from this DNA, but not all are.
Your specific condition, if you are right, is due to a deficiency in your nuclear DNA, not the mitochondrial DNA.
I have mitochondrial complex type II deficiency (heterozygous) and I'm going to see a genetic specialist in March.
Should I ask her about this?
I'm a young adult so I don't know if it would work for me.
Whaaat?
I didn't realize our mitochondria had their own special DNA.
That's awesome!
Thanks for explaining this to me.
I appreciate your skepticism about my diagnosis--I certainly hope I'm wrong about it.
I'm seeking advice from a genetic counselor because I've been frail since birth and as an adult I'm still struggling to keep my weight above 90lbs.
My general practicioner ordered a whole genome sequence which flagged two "pathologic" mutations, including that I'm a carrier of MCIID and suggested I might have a disorder like MERS or Leighs' Syndrome.
My mom's side is french canadian so we've got a lot of weird neurological disorders in our DNA, lol.
Anyways, I'm so glad this therapy works.
I can't imagine the lives that will be changed from this discovery.
Not just for the kids, but also for their families.
This science is bonkers.
I'm so relieved to know there are scientists out there looking out for those of us with rare diseases.
Humanity's ability to empathize with one another is our greatest strenh.
