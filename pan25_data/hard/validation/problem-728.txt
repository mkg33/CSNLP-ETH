Jordan is likely to be the chair of the house judiciary committee, with oversight power of DOJ.. he's more likely to completely block an investigations into himself than cooperate and answer to anyone..
In case there was any doubt, GOP are master of delay tactics.. not to mention DOJ literally refused to charge Meadows for obstruction of Congress, and Bannon is still a free man somehow.
Edit : I get that he can't directly obstruct investigation.. but house controls the purse strings for DOJ, Jordan can drag the AG down for endless hearings and find other ways to slow it down for 2 more years, and if a GOP president wins in 2024, that's the end of it..
He can't block investigations into himself... Congress can investigate all they want, but they can't impact an investigation beyond trying to get knowledge of an investigation and leak it to the public.
They can try to pass bills to defund departments/individuals, but those wouldn't pass the Senate, nevermind get signed by Biden.
My guess is they will just turn shit into a circus, like usual...
