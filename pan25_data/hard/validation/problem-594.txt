Furthermore, he wants to significantly cut public funding for political parties - which favour established parties and those with money and resources.
Lastly, he wants to cut media time for political parties - again favouring the parties with a lot of money and resources.
Long story short; He wants to do three things.
The biggest is that he wants to abolish the non-partisan body that oversees the elections and ensure that they are free and fair.
He wants this body replaced with an elected body with the same function, which would in reality put upholding the fairness of elections in his own hands.
Politicians elected by the people should pass laws related to elections.
It's a bad idea to have elected officials with skin in the game overseeing the elections, as we see time and time again in the U.S.
So if the citizens vote an electoral board because they like the party's politics that's a problem?
I'm not seeing it dude.
It's still a democracy.
In my eyes it looks like it's expanding the voters' responsibility and giving them more choice on who is in power.
