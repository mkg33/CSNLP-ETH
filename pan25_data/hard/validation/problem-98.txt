Nobody loves Russia.
It's more about mistrust of the west for historical reasons and disdain for what some consider a condescending attitude towards South Asians.
Ironically though, the Modi administration in power since 2014 that gets a lot of hate from westerners is actually the most pro-west/US administration India has ever had.
They have been slowly reducing the heavy military reliance on Russia over the years and turning to western countries like France and Israel instead.
Such decoupling doesn't happen overnight though and is a multi-decade process.
For starters, I see you stating this over and over in multiple comments.

Would appreciate it if you stopped pushing this implied narrative of China having massively bigger trade with India than the US.
Not to mention the fact that many imports from China are critical, whereas India can and wants to move away from US dependence.
Its the reason why their trade is growing so fast with China.
They may say they hate China, and some reddit people will say they hate both but China more, but economically India imports fucktons from there and its only rising.
And due to nations past action, Soviet support and American antagonism, the relationship may be too far gone to salvage.
But this is very unlikely, as they love Russia and see it as more trustworthy and dependable than the US, and are very wary of relying upon the West in any way.
