I mean, it’s their home; their houses that they own, grew up in, maybe have lived in for generations.
It’s difficult to just pack up and leave your entire life and heritage behind.
Plus, that raises other problems: Where do they go?
How are they going to put their lives back together with only the few possessions they could carry with them?
Trying to pack your entire life into a suitcase or two is pretty rough.
There’s also the fact that Russia is trying to win by sheer numbers; they hope that if they can throw more artillery pieces and crew at them than the Ukrainians can destroy, that they’ll somehow achieve victory.
All it does is waste countless thousands of lives for nothing.
Far easier said than done.
They’re keeping their artillery mobile; firing a barrage, packing up and moving to (try) to get out of dodge before the Ukrainians can calculate where the artillery fire came from and return fire with a counter-barrage.
Modern systems can be moved to and from firing positions in less than 5min after firing but both sides are lacking in Anti-artillery radars making the threat of counter-battery fire much less likely than what it should be when two "modern western armies" clash.
