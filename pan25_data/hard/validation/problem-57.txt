What else is there to say apart from point to the prideful maniac in charge of the russians and wait for ppl to make the observation that I've already pointed out.
Dudes not wrong, i don't support what russia is doing..
But there's no version of this where russia decides to lose.
A Russian loss will be when they are kicked out of Ukraine.
When that happens it won't matter if Russia then will officially end the war.
Russia has lost other wars, there's no reason to think they can't lose this war.
Whether they want to or whether they decide to stop, has little to do with it.
At some point the machine will just stop working, unable to grind all the Russian bones caught in the cogs.
Even Russian dictators and oligarchs have to abide by the laws of nature.
Btw let's wait and see what happens when the middle and upper class in St. Petersburg and Moscow get personally affected by this war.
Because they haven't yet, not really, other than not having Macdonald's in their cities.
If they get hurt for real, things will probably change fast.
