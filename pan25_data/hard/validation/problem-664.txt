If Putin croaks, there will probably be turmoil in Russia for a while, but whoever ends up in charge on the other side is not likely to be a person of upstanding character.
It's reasonable to assume that Putin isn't in top health, but as far as I can see there are no serious indications that he's terminally ill or something like that.
I really don't see any reason why Putin's death should change things much, but of course one can hope for curbing imperialistic ambitions for some time.
Why?
In last 110 years there were only two periods of turmoil, when the whole political system was changing to something unknown: monarchy to "communism" (plus short trial of democracy) and then "communism" to "democracy".
Change from Yeltsin's oligarchy to Putin was smooth despite brutal war in Chechnya.
Introducing autocracy Putin took care to boil the frog very slowly, but now nearly everybody is quite used to it.
After all they had strong autocratic tendencies for centuries.
At all other times, when one Russian despot was taking the post of his predecessor, turmoil and killings (if any) were limited to inner circle of power.
The transition away from Communism also unleashed a lot of violence and poverty in Russia, until Putin took the reins as the next strongman.
Domestic affairs stabilized, and Russia again started playing a central role in international affairs.
- the best predictor of the future is the past.
Russia will continue being an autocracy.
But there will be a long period of violence and turmoil before a new autocrat emerges.
The period from Tsardom to communism was followed by a lot of violence and poverty and chaos until Stalin emerged as new autocrat.
It was only after that that Russia again started playing a central role in international affairs.
Successions after that were structured by the party.
