This is a medical termination, not that of a healthy baby because she so chooses.
This is not letting this life be in pain or suffer, and to be clear the only thing the court said was that it was the mother’s choice.
Weather she wants to give birth to a still born, wait weeks until the baby suffers and dies, or have mercy and terminate an unviable pregnancy.
Exactly, also the part where the mother is interviewed and she knows the trauma involved with any of her choices.
To wait and give birth to a still born is extremely traumatic for any woman.
If a Neuro surgeon was involved it is the assumption the baby after birth would have very little chance at life even after intervention.
Thats twisting whats actually written in the article: "The neurosurgeon said that it is likely that the child will have some handicap, but would survive.
The doctor added that he cannot predict the ‘quality of life’ of the child, but a surgery can be conducted to deal with some of the issues nearly 10 weeks after its birth".
they also said the doctors think they can ameliorate it by having surgery at 10 weeks and while he'd have issues for the rest of his life the baby could still live a full life.
