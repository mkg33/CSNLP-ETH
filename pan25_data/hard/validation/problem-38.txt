This generally doesn't happen if he takes strong red stances like DeSantis or Abbott.
I think there was a Republican governor of Massachusetts.
Indeed, the new governor of Maryland is a Democrat, one again.
He’s a Republican governor and I believe Maryland is blue state.
I can’t say that he was a critic in the beginning but he was an early critic.
It’s almost like claiming The Civil War was about states rights.
Especially when this specific claim never occurred to them until decades after the Civil War.
Regardless he’s not the kind of Republican that stands a chance in hell in todays Republican Party especially outside of a blue state.
He is better than many other current Republicans, and he did do some good things during the pandemic.
But ultimately, I think we can do better and I'm excited to see what Moore can do for the state.
He of course wasn't perfect, and I still think he isn't someone I'd vote for ever given that during his whole tenure he was kept in check by a democratic state super majority.
His covid response was flawed in that he let the counties decide on their own for mandates which led to a lot of confusion within the state.
At every chance he had he vetoed legislation that would help Baltimore, the African American community, the red line for the metro, etc.
Additionally, while he never voted for Trump he couldn't bring himself to vote for Hilary or Biden, instead choosing to vote for Reagan.
And he announced he voted for Reagan instead of Biden because he still couldn’t actually do the right thing for the country.
