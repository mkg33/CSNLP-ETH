I'm from Canada and we also had DARE.
I remember being told that when I got just a little older there were going to be people constantly offering me free drugs just to get me hooked.
I only had to hang outside corner stores trying to convince adults to buy smokes for me for about 5 or 6 years before I turned 18.
I have a hunch that public sentiment has shifted enough by now that it's even more difficult to convince someone these days.
If I had to do that every time I wanted to buy a pack, for literally the rest of my life, I probably would've quit by now.
Let us addicted assholes who aren't motivated enough to quit (yet) keep doing what we're doing, while preventing the younger generations from ever getting started (or at least preventing them from gaining a full head of steam with the habit/addiction).
Be cool if they tried taking a ton of the dangerous chemicals out of them and ban those instead because people love their cigarettes and will find ways to get them illegally anyway.
I hate cigarettes, but let's not outright ban substances people want to use, even if they are bad for your health, just banning something people actively seek out for enjoyment is a hard thing to stop.
I get the costs on public health, and I get that we should try to reduce smoking rates, but banning substances lead us to where we are with weed.
