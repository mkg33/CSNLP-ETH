Reporting by the Russian Telegram channel Baza described a very different series of events, however.
“Yes, Colonel Boyko committed suicide within the walls of the [naval college],” the unnamed sources were quoted saying.
The channel, citing unspecified sources, said multiple gunshots were heard outside Boyko’s office just before the desk sergeant went in and found his body with five gunshot wounds to the chest.

From the article that nobody read, the report is 5 gunshot wounds to the chest, and four pistols found at the crime scene.
