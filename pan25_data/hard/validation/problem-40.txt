What a shit article.
Doesn't provide sources but after some digging, turns out it is doing exactly what it says it isn't doing.
Using gross salaries across the board, without tracking what the jobs actually are or if the person is working part time.
It only takes into consideration the gross earnings, not the actual fields or positions, which makes said chart useless and pointless for formal analytics.
If a qualified neurosurgeon is unable to find a job BECAUSE of her gender, that is a problem.
If there are just no positions and both men and women are facing the same problem, then it isn't sexism or wage gap, it is a different problem altogether.
However if an in depth analysis is performed and a gendered wage gap is found within equal work scenarios, then that should be eliminated.
Gender should never be a factor for employment or wages.
Another thing to consider on hourly wage.
Even if you adjust for hours worked, you may still get discrepancies owing to scheduling.
Men may be able to fit their schedule to the company's needs, while women may not be able to, which would reflect in the hourly wage.
