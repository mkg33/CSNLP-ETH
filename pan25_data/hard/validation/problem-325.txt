Twitter had 7,500 employees before this...
I can't even imagine why that many people were required.
Of course you need people to code the software, advertising people to keep them happy, content moderation (not anymore, I guess?
), and then HR, accountants and legal.
I personally don't see how that adds up to 7,500 people.
I'd bet Twitter could operate with 1k employees and none of us would really notice a difference.
Exactly.
Why is this hard for people to understand?
Companies lay people off all the time.
They have every right to revoke access to offices and computers.
They just don't have the right to skirt local labor laws about payment and severence, and they almost always follow those laws because violating labor laws is a BFD in most places.
By the way, I think we're learning that most of the big tech companies are way over staffed and have very bloated costs.
It's not just Twitter.
No Twitter is just cutting the fat.
To be honest though it seems like there are so many stories being posted about being fired but it doesn't seem like these people actually did anything at twitter other than just fluff work.
