Nah, Austria has generally remained (genuinely) neutral, Hungary is run by a Putin-wannabe and is deliberately trying to sabotage efforts to support Ukraine.
Austria and Hungary (especially Hungary since they are actually in NATO) being jerks about supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion does damage the alliance and puts member states like the Baltics and Poland at significant risk of further Russian aggression.
Well don't forget Russia had Cold War plans to nuke Austria first in a strike against NATO ( so there's that for respecting neutrality.
I think you are trying to oversell Austria's "traditional neutrality" stance to make it seem more reasonable than it really is.
Ive not once mentioned my thoughts on Austrias neutral stance actually.
Not once.
(edit.... Actually i did.
I said i disagree with it.
Ooops) Im not trying to sell it and in another comment i stated i wished they would choose a side and join Europe properly.
But i agree every one is entitled to their opinions.
Im not saying anyone is not.
But comment like "they should be kicked out of nato for their neutrality show a severe misunderstanding of what nato is.
