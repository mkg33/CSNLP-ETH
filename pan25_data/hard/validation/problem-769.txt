Kyiv is hundreds of years older than Moscow.
Kyiv was a thriving metropolis while Moscow was all farmland.
Kyiv was the capitol of the Kyivan Rus empire while Moscow was a village founded under the empire's protection.
The fact of the matter is there was no such thing as a russian state until CENTURIES after Kyiv was established, which makes Novhorod a Ukrainian city.
Yes interestingly the city of kyiv and the eastern part of Ukraine have only been part of the same country for 30 years out of the last 500+.
If you look at the borders of rus, you can see why Eastern and western Ukrainians consider themselves so different.
The difference is up to about 1991 all of Ukraine was Russian territory.
Ukraine is a fairly new country, with some 30 years being independent.
So for the majority of the last 100 years that area was Russian.
Hell, they speak and write Russian.
Don't think South Dakota ever ruled in Russia or had them speaking English as a first language.
But I'm sure you might prove me wrong.
