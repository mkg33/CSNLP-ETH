We paid $400 each among 4 of us for a big ol 4bed 3bath 2-story house with a yard in 2002.
It was a magical time to rent.
Similar place costs at least double in that area now while college kid type job wages went from $10-12/hr back then all the way up to $14-16/hr.
now.
Just.
The frickin amount of articles shocked about millennials and gen z moving back in with their parents.
Like the concept of ‘oh wow a pandemic, and super high rent costs, being nervous no matter who i am because everything is shut down and if you’re paying attention you’re just watching the death toll of older people frickin sky rocket’.
Wow.
I can’t figure it out.
It’s shocking.
And then these young adults have the audacity to ….buy themselves nicer things….
The article was referring to people moving home during the pandemic and staying there.
You seem like you enjoy being correct.
At one point we hit what just over 5,000?
Almost like having 9/11 daily.
And if you cared about your old people you’d want to stay with them because like what if it happens to them??
And you’re in a different city just trying to make ends meet in a pandemic riot hellscape.
