> The main legal department of Ukraine’s Parliament also noted in an analysis published this month that it had been given little time to review changes in the bill and that the legislation’s language gave insufficient consideration to the risk of introducing censorship.
The headline tells the passing reader that Ukraine is cracking down on free speech (typically seen as a negative among the general population), when in reality they’re passing legislation to allow them to join the EU in the future.
“But Ukrainian journalists and international press freedom groups raised alarms about the media bill as it advanced through Parliament, saying that it went far beyond what the European Union requires and accusing the government of using the membership obligations as a pretext to seize greater control of the press.” No.
"The project “European Union and Council of Europe working together to support freedom of media in Ukraine” fully facilitates the implementation by Ukraine of the Association Agreement with the EU and the Council of Europe Action Plan for Ukraine 2018-2021.
One of the Project’s objectives is adoption of the media legislation of high quality, which would guarantee respect for the right of freedom of expression, as well as ensure the independence of the national regulator.
The Project provides expert support to the improvement of media legislation in Ukraine as well as initiates a series of discussions on the updated draft law "On Media".
The next discussions will take place on July 10 and 22," said Galyna Smirnova, senior officer of the Project “EU and Council of Europe working together to support freedom of media in Ukraine”.
The main novelty of the draft law "On Media" is the legal regulation of online media and platforms such as Youtube, Facebook etc.
In addition, Ukraine has an international obligation to implement into national law the provisions of Directive (EU) 2018/1808 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 amending Directive 2010/13/EU, i.e.
to consolidate at the level of the law an updated set of legal norms in the field of audiovisual media, which would meet European standards and modern level of technological development, simplify state regulation of the industry, define effective and modern principles of consumer protection, as well as legal mechanisms for determining and restriction of harmful content.
This is stated in the explanatory note to the draft law.
Online media, in particular, will also be subject to the requirement to properly inform the public about the potentially harmful content, for example for minors.
They will also be among the subjects to whom the right of reply may be applied etc.
