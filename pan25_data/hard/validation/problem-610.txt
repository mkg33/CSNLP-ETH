Maia Sandu, the President of Moldova, has said she sees no way to maintain constructive relations with Russia after everything the Kremlin has done to Ukraine.
Despite the fact that some of the developers of the game "Stalker" defend Ukraine from Russia, and , they to develop the game.
It seems that the Russians are lying when they say that they are "fighting Nazism".
Russia's war is unprovoked and unjustified.
The Russian army must leave the territory of Ukraine.
Looks like Russia once again closed the airspace over most of the regions bordering Ukraine.
All flights from and to Anapa, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Gelendzhik, Krasnodar, Kursk, Lipetsk, Rostov-on-Don, Simferopol and Elista have been cancelled until January 8.
There's still zero confirmation that any Su-27s were short down though.
And the Russian post he's screenshotting is saying just that, in response to the infamous Rybar claiming with zero evidence that "almost all Russian aircraft shot down in Ukraine were friendly fire incidents".
He noted that the Russian Federation used "everything that can move" against Ukraine - launched "shaheds" and fired from S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems.
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba answered the question whether Ukraine will might receive ATACMS missiles with a range of up to 300 kilometers: "Next year, yes.
But it will also depend on the situation on the battlefield.
".
Yes.
The question is when do you take it down.
If Ukraine takes Melitopol and closes the land route to Crimea, do you leave the bridge open so the civilians can flee.
If you blow the bridge to soon it will probably be about a week before the only source of food for several million civilians will be soylent green.
