We define Nazis as book burning burning, genocidal white supremacists.
They define nazis as just anyone who's against Russia, because they're okay with the other stuff.
Yup, most russians don't have any ideological problem with the nazis.
The only thing they care about is "they were people who were against us", and therefore anyone who is against them is a nazi.
Yes, say "there nazi" are One of the techniques that propaganda resorts, Under section "we good, there bad" and " we saving poor Ukrainians from nazi in their(but actually Our) land".
That this "special Military operation" supposed to be "save Ukrainians from the Nazis and Illegal Rule".
Not "enemy nation", but "old enemy, Against which great-grandfather fought And it's your turn, it's your pride and duty".
More like "old enemy, Who spread genocide, oppresion, hate, Against whom our great-grandfathers fought , and you must now too, it Your Duty and pride ".
I also remember a French The reporter found information that an radical anti-Russian group was indeed formed there.
