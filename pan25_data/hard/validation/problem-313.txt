yeah "give all weapons and we will leave in peace" tooootally doesn't sound like a trap.
especially after situations like "give back soviet nukes.
we guarantee to not attack" or "don't try to join NATO, we guarantee to not attack" weren't actually working.
we had situations like this so often.
russia offers "peace talks" with crazy demands like "give us the oblasts crimea, donetsk, luhansk, kherson and the one starting with z without fight and we stop attacking you".
obviously that's a laughable deal and ukraine rejects such "offers" and russia goes on about how they started peace talks, but ukraine rejecting them, because they want more bloodshed.
I mean Ukraine didn’t agree to the ceasefire , it only technically happens when both parties say ok so the most logical scenario was for the fighting to continue ….
It's not a ceasefire unless both sides agree to it, which Ukraine didn't, therefore there was no ceasefire.
To be clear, not criticizing Ukraine for this action, but for a ceasefire to occur, both sides have to agree.
It's likely Russia would've violated a ceasefire anyways, but in this case it's not fair to say they did.
