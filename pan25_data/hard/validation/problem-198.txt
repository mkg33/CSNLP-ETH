Except if NATO finds out they are trying to get nukes before they actually have them, they will have a hot war on their doorstep approximately instantly.
They have got to either be really confident in their sneak skill or be kinda dumb.
Doesn't really matter what you support, the Western powers will roll in there with as much force as they think they need to stop it from happening.
The current situation Russia has us in will only reinforce that course of action.
If Iran wants a nuke they are going to have to get it so secretly that the West doesn't know until it's far too late, or else they will get schwacked hard.
So even in the off chance that Russia sold nukes or nuke tech to Iran, they wouldn't defend Iran from the consequences if the world found out...
Russia doesn't want a hot war with the West, they know the only chance they have is nukes and if they used that button the country would cease to exist unless they fired everything... Because using only one nuke would invoke the world's wrath.
And yes, nukes are the only reason that Russia is not flying a NATO flag right now.. Nuclear weapons are fantastic at making sure you never get invaded ever, even if your military is defunct.
At this point, I’m curious if Russian nukes would even work.. or if they’d be nukes sitting in storage since the 60’s that spontaneous catch fire, like the rest of Russia’s military equipment and infrastructure lately.
