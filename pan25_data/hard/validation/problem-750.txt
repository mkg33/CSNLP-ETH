I wish Russia would have refused to sponsor internal political strife inside of the US.
We'd be a lot better off.
I agree we don't need to overthrow Putin though...Russia is so broken/corrupt that the next guy to sit in Putin's chair isn't going to be a significant improvement over Putin.
Putin is happy that Kadyrov, Shoygu and his chef are all busy fighting in house, it takes the heat away from him, what they need to do is get together and end Putin…… the big question though is what we get post Putin might be more rogue state than right now, even if that is hard to believe.
Otherwise they’re gonna be blamed for 100k deaths of soldiers due to incompetent military operations rather than the whole plan being a complete failure from day 1.
Putin has given all his power to the FSB and stripped the military of any real power within Russia.
The military are the scapegoats in all this and after dozens of generals have been sacked some must be thinking they are for the window jump of death.
Only a matter of time before they say enough is enough, they only way for them to really win is to defeat Putin.
