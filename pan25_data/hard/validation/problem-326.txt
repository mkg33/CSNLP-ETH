"Look, I know Lula has a proven history of reducing deforestation.
But that isn't evidence that he can accomplish this again in the future We have no idea what will happen in the future We certainly can't base our judgements off passed events, because reasons" - you.
Okay, so you admit that even though Bolsinaro promised to stop deforestation, and even though he had a plan to accomplish that, it never happened...
This means absolutely nothing.
You're judgement of a politicians "attitude" is wholey irrelevant in a discussion about the benefits of electing Lula to fight deforestation .
I mean, while deforestation wasn't as big back when Lula first took office (in 2003) his first term saw drastic decrease in deforestation, which held for his second term and his sucessor's (Rousseff).
Take your time to look into how deforestation was handled during Lula's time in presidency and compare it to Bolsonaro's.
It is, indeed easy to talk, but their actions differed greatly.
yes, some aspects of their attitude are very different.
It's just that their words regarding deforestation (just their words) are not that different.
So its the actions that make the difference.
