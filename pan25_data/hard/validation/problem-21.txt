20%-25% is where you start possible change in social convention.
That is to say, it's enough to get the majority to move to "we're ok with this.
".
So, hear me out.
We draw all the MAGA dipshits to Florida, encourage anyone sane to come for asylum elsewhere in the states, dig a trench to make Florida an island, and wait for global warming to do its business.
Maybe if we could convince enough of the crazies to move from purple states to Florida, the senate and electoral college would be less red tilted.
Just imagine if Dipshit Mecca Florida helped Arizona and Georgia cement their blue status?
Or perhaps NC finished going blue?
Maybe Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Montana could enjoy large scale emigration of their crazies to Florida.
Or better yet, what if Desantis’ magnetic fascism pulled enough right winger immigrants from Texas that we could finally have a competitive election.
(Did you know that people who lived in TX for longer than 10 years voted majority for Beto over Cruz in 2018?
The new arrivals voted much more conservative than the lonime residents.
I’d love that kind of new arrival to go somewhere else and good riddance.
).
This.
Any time the harm to my children and their future because of how my dad votes gets brought up, he either doubles down or changes the subject entirely.
Its frustrating as hell.
That's the most frustrating part.
Dems keep just sitting on their hands, trying to pretend like the entire republican party isn't at least corrupt while they chip away at the actual Fondation of democracy.
