Ok, fair, it's not always literally homelessness but it's always a "the government could be spending money on _____ instead", but then when you actually agree with them and propose that the government actually do it they flip out.
It's not like the money isn't already being spent, its more a question of how society prefers to spend it's homelessness money.
Then when you say, "ok, fair point, we could spend more money fighting homelessness here" they counter "No, that's socialism".
