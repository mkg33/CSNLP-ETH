Which I think are easiier for people to respond "yes" to than "should there be an end to separaton of church and state?"
Epecially since they'd still want to keep other religions out, even as they angle for Nationalist Christian rule.
Christian Nationalists hate the ideals of America and the freedoms of their fellow citizens.
They're wanting the antithesis of a free and open society; they want to control people's thoughts, because that's the only way their small-minded ideology can spread: to people who are too afraid to think for themselves.
It's an ideology that seeks to control cowards; to instill fear of a changing world; one that tells people their bigotry and ignorance is just misunderstood patriotism, and their desire to control others is right and natural.
Except they follow none of the things they preach, continuing a cycle of hatred and fear seems to be the only purpose of these sad people who have been brainwashed into thinking they have a common enemy, when their only enemy is themselves.
What really scares me is that extent of the purposeless rage, I really worry we're getting steered right into a society which will be constantly suffering from the cycle of violence and hatred (well to the extent we're not already, but it used to feel like it was getting better.
).
As for who "they" is, we need to address an ugly aspect of Christianity, particularly in American protestantism.
The Christian God judges humanity, those who abide will be saved and those who don't will face some undesirable fate.
Furthermore Jesus will return eventually, elevate his followers and bring heaven to Earth, which may coincide with an undesirable fate for the non-believers.
Unfortunately this results in many Christians feeling a sense of special purpose and entitlement while also looking down upon others.
For such Christians imposing their morals and beliefs onto others is just since after all they're acting by the word of God and helping people right?
Of course this alienates people, who become spiteful and bitter because of course they would, and since they're now outspoken against you, while look the enemy has revealed itself?
It's a nasty cycle, and it doesn't help that Christianity literally worships martyrdom.
