Plus there are around 5 countries at the tournament which have anti homosexuality laws.
Waiting for people to protest against them.
Especially if any of them turn into the plucky underdog team of the tournament story.
Add in Morocco which I think is bit relaxed but still has laws in place.
Senegal, Saudi Arabia, Ghana.
Have to check if there is any more.
So if people want to protest about Qatar hosting, shouldn’t you also complain about the other teams and current Rights issue?
Or just ignore otherwise well have less teams at the tournaments .
Except if every team did it then what do they do?
They’d end up with no teams left.
I mean I guess that gives Qatar a route to the final, which might be their ultimate goal now I think about it….
What a win for a world champion who wins the cup in Qatar.
Big nations should simply play their own cup inofficially.
Stream it for free and show what real football is.
Not this FIFA shit show.
Didn't FIFA say Russia can't be part of the world cup?
Isn't that political?
Absolute double standards FIFA are a shambles someone needs to make a new non corrupt fifa and have away with them.
They look so weak now.
Who cares about a yellow card.
Just give the armband to someone who isn't likely to get a yellow card such as Kane can also just change captain every game, and should get coaching staff to do the same.
Kane could still be the captain but someone else can wear the captain and one love armband easy ways around this, FA and England just being weak.
It's just silly.
If you get a yellow for wearing it then you should be allowed to carry on as you've already paid the dues for it.
Best thing to do now is wait until quarters and semis and all the countries supporting the one love all refuse to play and go home.
This will mean too late for any other country to step on and just show what a shambles FIFA has been.
They can't back down to FIFA bullying so need to beat them at their own game.
So does it say in the rule book how many seconds or minutes you have to remove it?
If a player takes 2mins to remove it will they be sent off?
