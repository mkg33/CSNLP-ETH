You'd probably recognize the names of multiple victims attacked over their race or orientation even decades ago.
Personally I'm not sure I'd know the names of any non-celebrities who were attacked for something other than one of those hot button topics.
(There's probably a better term for that.
).
So I couldn't find motives for most, but of those I did find motives for, none were about race, religion, or orientation, and I also did not find mention of race, religion, or orientation in any of the ones where I couldn't find a motive.
For example, see how much attention Jessie Smollet initially got for his reported attack.
Attacks happened all the time for other reasons without getting the attention.
(After it turned out not to be true he also got a huge amount of criticism etc.
).
(The above results were the exact results for my search; if they came back in the student search I included them even if they were no longer a student.
).
It is though.
There are sub-ethnic groups within Jewish people, such as Ashkenazi, Sephardic or Mizrahi, to give the largest ones.
Someone can be jewish and not practice judaism.
Someone can be "half-jewish" ethnically, and not be hallakhically jewish because only their father is jewish.
