Which was the only way the norwegian producers could get congress to accept buying it for the american forces.
(American jobs!
).
I say go for it.
Their caterwauling isn’t going to change anything in Ukraine, Joe sure as hell isn’t going to back down.
You’re just making Biden look even more bad-ass.
As the “strong on defense” party, your natural move should have been to criticize him for not doing enough.
But if you want to blow up your coalition?
I don’t mind.
Whatever the motive, be it envelopes of cash, reflexive opposition to anything that a Democratic President does, or a genuine support for despotism… when Ukraine finishes chasing the Russians out of their country, with support from a Democratic President, their “strong on defense” branding is going to look like a joke.
- If Ukraine looks like a hopeless cause, western democracies may be less inclined to keep funneling them weapons and popular support for doing so will erode (throw baby out with the bath water, etc).
They promote the idea that Ukraine is a lost cause and that any weapons given to Ukraine just prolong the war, it's mainly a play on beliefs that already fringe groups of people in the West share.
Obviously, after Russia ran away from Kherson and Kharkiv region Ukraine demonstrated it was not true, and that the only option is to deal with Russia with force or unavoidably you gonna have to deal with a stronger Russia later.
