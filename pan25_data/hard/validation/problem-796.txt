I suppose you're referring to 8 (beginning to count at the one closest to the ukrainians).
In the last frame before the camera pans away, it seems to me he's looking down again.
Also, in the aftermath he still seems to be about where he was (his head roughly at the hip of 7).
However...it wasn't.
A russian soldier opened fire on the ukrainians, turning the surrender to a combat situation which got all the russians killed.
Russian unit wanted to surrender then one asshole came out all guns blazing injuring (or killing?)
an ukrainian soldier.
Unfortunate for those russians who already put down their weapons but thats why perfidy (feigning surrender) is a warcrime.
Them russians most likely got killed straight away as soon as that one cunt opened fire, because ukrainians couldnt risk them joining back in the fight.
Just to clarify, a Russian soldier falsely surrendered then came out guns blazing immediately before the soldiers were killed.
In the video you can hear the Ukrainians open up as soon as the Russian starts firing.
The soldiers were killed in the crossfire.
Friends don't let friends falsely surrender - aka play stupid games win stupid prizes.
