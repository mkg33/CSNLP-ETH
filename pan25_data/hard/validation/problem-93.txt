The modern Russian empire is a lot smaller and older these days, they probably have half as many or even less suitable people to throw at this.
To be totally frank losing 1-2m in this conflict would most likely end Russia as a great power in the coming decades.
Russia is winning on the restructuring of the world order but losing on the battlefield.
No doubt western influence is being challenged not just by Russia.
Russia still has been able to do deals with nations willing to turn a blind eye to the situation in Ukraine.
Sanctions are not working effectively from the west.
South Africa just performed joint Naval exercises with Russia.
China recently negotiated and paid billions for an upcoming Gas Pipeline from Russian Siberian gas fields to China.
India is trying to convince nations this is not a war in Ukraine.
Putin likes the grind down approach and china wants that gas line so expect them to resupply weapons to Russia.
I saw a theory that Russia could sell Gazprom to China in order to pay for the war.
Their war chest of foreign currencies is rapidly being drained and they need that money for a whole lot of other stuff, not just buying tanks.
