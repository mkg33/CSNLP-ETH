Today was yet another pretty quiet day.
We had some country-wide air raid alerts, but it was just Russian MiG-31K as usual, which they mostly use to scare us, but also for reconnaissance, because apparently it is used in a pair with their AWACS aircraft.
There’s a pretty high chance that the next big missile strike might happen in the next couple of days, because it will be orthodox Christmas soon, and they will almost certainly try to ruin it for us.
The strikes on Russian bases and weapon/ammo warehouses seem to happen almost daily now, which is great to see.
Most of them are happening in the occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia oblast, it might have something to do with the next planned offensive by our forces, which a lot of our officials have been openly talking about recently.
I’m not sure why they are even talking about our planned offensives, I guess either you can’t hide it anyway, or they are trying to mislead Russia by talking about it, which also might be the case, it wouldn’t be the first time that it happens during this war.
"Russia no longer poses a military threat to the world, it's just a fiction, the only issue left is a nuclear arsenal and an uncontrolled regime that will make the whole world realize the need to denuclearize Russia.
