Agree.
Ukraine would request and require air defence either way.
In fact, rather than prolong the war can NATO get involved directly in a limited way to end it sooner.
Just for a point of argument - assuming it is actually a Russian missile that landed in Poland, what option does NATO have.
Will it really be willing to go to war with Russia?
That to at a time of economic and energy challenges.
I don't think even Ukraine wants that to happen.
Ukraine will probably want NATO to quickly supply it air defence capabilities.
It could mean air defence batteries on the polish border attacking any missile they can reach, even above Ukraine.
It could mean NATO manned air defence in western Ukraine to prevent any missiles from getting close to NATO members.
Can NATO forces land in Ukraine to defend the country in a limited sense without provoking a full-fledged war with Russia?
If the missile was launched by Ukraine, then Ukraine needs to be more careful when defending themselves from Russian aggression and they owe reparations to Poland.
Iâ€™m no military expert at all, but why would Ukraine be firing defensive missiles in the direction of Poland if they are defending themselves from incoming missiles coming in from the opposite direction of Poland?
You can see why it's in Ukraine's best interests if the missile was launched by Russia rather than by Ukraine, and why if they're certain it was Russian launched, NATO saying "no no no, YOU guys launched it, this is YOUR missile, no you can't see the evidence for yourself" might annoy them.
