Sadly that is true.
I don't understand what is going on in Florida, but DeSantis won reelection by nearly 20 points.
The judge in question is a piece of shit, but if the people of Florida don't want piece of shit judges they shouldn't vote for piece of shit governors.
The facts are that the local district voted out a judge of that position, because the will of the people didn't want that judge representing them anymore in that local district.
had chosen a different candidate for the previous office he held would be to say that the will of the voters of that district override the will of all Florida voters.
The will of the people was exercised, as Floridians voted by a massive margin to make DeSantis Governor, the office which appoints circuit judges.
To say that DeSantis could not appoint this judge to a state-wide office because a single district.
The judge was voted out of office.
DeSantis was resoundingly reelected.
In Florida, the Governor appoints judges.
He appointed this judge to a different position, one that is not elected.
A governor could take that district's voters into consideration, but he's under no moral or legal obligation to elevate their interests over the rest of the voters.
DeSantis appointing that same judge to a state-wide position, objectively a much higher responsibility and higher level position, but then saying in not so many words "it's not the same as the jurisdiction of voters"...is pretty backwards logic.
In what world do voters not have confidence in an official to perform a local-level job, but simultaneously that person would be adequate for a higher level state-wide position?
It's terrible (or more likely biased) judgement on DeSantis' part to purposefully fail someone upwards simply because he has the power to do so.
