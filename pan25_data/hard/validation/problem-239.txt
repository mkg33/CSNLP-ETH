In a total of 122 UN resolutions involving Israel, Ukraine voted against Israel in 95 of the resolutions and abstained in 27 of them.
It did not vote in favor of Israel even once.
Religious Zionist MK Simcha Rothman took issue with Zelensky’s reference to Ukrainians who saved Jews and tweeted: “I don’t understand Ukrainian, but if the translation I heard is accurate, Zelensky asked us to treat the Ukrainians like they treated us 80 years ago.
I’m sorry, but I think we will have to reject that request.
We are, after all, a moral nation.”.
Somebody will argue that was years ago but unfortunately Instead of teaching new generation about terrible past Ukrainian government proclaimed past Nazi collaborators as a national heroes.
Also the past is important, babi yar was 80 years ago, most survivors are still alive and thier children are all alive , to ignore what Ukraine did to us is stupid, cause they killed 150k Jews in WW2 alone, and almost a million in the 20th century Alone , we said never forget and never forgive, and we stick by our promise to our ancestors.
And saying that the massacres they committed against us are unrealvent is just disrespectful, my family got killed because of the Ukrainians in WW2 and my grandma lost her entire family because of them either way Ukraine is against Israel.
