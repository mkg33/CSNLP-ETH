I can tell you a lack of money isn't helping their competitors in those leagues.
Part of it is managing.
Top teams can afford good managers to keep costs reltively low to say china/middle east.
Who are keen on throwing money at the problem without fixing fundamentals.
So europe gets to buy everyone and everything becaue you find international play boring.
Ok, fo here with your uncompetitive premier league, bundesliga and la liga.
Compare it to Champions league?
Where are the best players?
Is Italy there Europe's best team and winner of ec, is the current strongest striker Haaland there?
No wc was fun then it started to involve a lot of sport washing, politics and racism.
Yes they hiring people who show promise and bring them in give them education why can't any one else do that, it's a smart way to do it no one is forcing any one to come and play for them and it's beneficial for both parts.
They meet about 4 weeks per year and play together compare that to the club where they play like the rest of the year together whit the team, its just better quality when playing club fotball and you don't have to deal whit fifa.
