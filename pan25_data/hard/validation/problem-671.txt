I wish.
You would think politicians would be better read in history, yet they keep making the same short-sighted decisions.
History keeps rhyming because people don't learn from history.
The EU has a super supermajority requirement for any and all important decisions.
This is not democratic.
This is not functional.
This is not reflective of the general will.
And the practice has and will continue to hamstring any EU decision-making during a crisis.
It could very well be the death knell for the EU.
The EU is not the EEC.
The EU is explicitly supposed to help west Europe prevent war and keep the regional peace.
Hamstringing the EU's ability to act in the face of war or threats does not seem so helpful.
The EU has the same issues as the Polish Commonwealth or the USA under the Articles of Confederation.
While the liberum veto encourages nations like Hungary to stay within the EU, it stops decision-making.
Getting major "Liberum Veto" vibes from Poland-Lithuania commonwealth which caused delays in reforms of the country and pushed it further towards the end.
