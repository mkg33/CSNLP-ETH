I might agree with you if I thought it was the only way Ukraine could win, but it's not, and sadly, the decision to use those mines will haunt Ukrainian men, women, and children now, likely for generations, until the last ones are found and disposed of, which is why they were banned to begin with.
So, you're new to Reddit?
If you think what I wrote was "quick and vile", you have been spending time on the most puritanical subs in this corner of the internet.
First, it wasn't quick.
It was actually fairly long and thought out compared to your "friendly fire" that hit me:
Yeah.
That was YOU replying to me.
How many people do you think would read YOUR reply and take it as anything other than you being a complete asshole to me?
Not many.
And it's not my job to investigate your poor communication skills.
Should they use them?
No.
But the way this article was written loses credibility for Human Rights Watch (or VOA) more than Ukraine.
And yet these people are questioning "Kyiv's credibility and intentions" instead of Russia's.
Ukraine is simply holding on to everything they can to protect themselves from the overwhelming invading Russians.
What else is there to question?
