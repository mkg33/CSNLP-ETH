We are at an interesting point for the environmentalist movement.
As the scientific predictions continue to look bleaker, our governments continue to offer almost meaningless solutions.
This raises the temperature as activists are starting to feel like their actions aren’t having the desired effects and new strategies need to be considered.
In their minds they're going to claim the achievement is raising awareness but I don't believe the current level of public knowledge and understanding about climate change has anything to do with extinction rebellion whatsoever and they're actually harming progress on action.
They can't reach their ultimate goal without popular support genius, to stop or slow down climate change, every member of society has to cooperate from the top to the bottom, extinction rebellion however has only achieved alienating the masses against them who now just want them gone.
The climate of the future is looking pretty fucking bleak and the fact that your bemoaning a group called extinction rebellion for ‘not doing enough’ is a good example of why nothing is ever going to be done until it is well past ‘too late’.
