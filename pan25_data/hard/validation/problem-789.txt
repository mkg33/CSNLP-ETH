I mean, politics aside, Russia was a top tourist destination.
Not much to see in Qatar apart from desert.
It’s also close to Europe, so it’s much easier for Europeans to travel to.
I didn’t watch a single game of Qatar WC.
I know what this WC succeeded at: showing me how ugly the Qatar RF really is (which I didn’t care to research before) and letting me know I should never visit.
It was pretty lame of Qatar to agree to WC sponsorship deals then pull a “nada we’re not gonna allow it suck it up” last minute.
What’s football without beer?
And it was especially lame that they still allowed alcohol sale, just not to plebs lol.
Thanks for all the stats!
You’re a better redditor than me for actually doing research and I was kinda just pulling stuff out of my ass lol.
I guess my point is more Russia vs Qatar since that’s the stats given.
(The popular and touristy part of ) Russia is still closer to most of Europe than Qatar, Brazil and South Africa.
Since, not everyone can afford going to Qatar.. comparing Qatar with Brazil/Russia is straight up mockery..
I mean, Russia are obviously whack but did they try and force strict rules on visitors like Qatar did?
I feel that’s what was the most off putting for fans this time around.
