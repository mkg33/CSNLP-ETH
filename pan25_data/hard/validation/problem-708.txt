Problem is costs of trains and mass transit are rising yearly.
I literally know people who had to look for new work closer to home because train travel ate into a significant chunk of their earnings and driving isn't an option because parking near their job was like 14Â£ per day in the UK.
Similar cost rises are present in most EU nations.
I'm not saying I don't want those things.
They are vital.
I am saying that those methods of transportation are rising in cost and many people can't afford electric vehicles.
Second, the infrastructure to charge millions of electric cars is simply not there, especially in remote areas, and it doesn't look plausible that this will be fixed in 12 years.
Electric cars aren't even remotely ready for mass adoption and all I can do when I see these headlines is facepalm.. hard..
I still don't buy it, and I'm almost certain that unless breakthroughs are achieved they'll have to go back on it.
First off all, depending on how your country generates electricity, they might not save the environment much in the long run, and that's especially true considering the ethics and problems with manufacturing lithium ion and lipo batteries.
