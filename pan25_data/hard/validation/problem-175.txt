If the US was actively involved in Ukraine, are you saying we would have soldiers in foxholes and/or CQC galore?
We let the USA do as they wished in the middle east, and we are trying to be Heroes in Ukraine, mainly because there is an opportunity to damage Russia.
Not to save ukrainian people.
I mean the money and guns we are giving are parts of this WWIII accusation.
I just find it an excuse.
And I found that we are blind and biased as the same way, we accuse russian population to be.
It is black and white.
But it is evident that US is not doing this for freedom or anything they are telling us.
They have the same reasons that Russia have.
Interests, about money about influence and about having a government that is influenced by them and would of course follow them in different choices and opinions.
I am not talking about the Ukrainian situation and I don’t want to enter in this dialogue, I am saying that causing a WORLD WAR as it has always been so, it’s about what nations thinks and want to archive and gain from it.
Economically, Politically and culturally.
So it would not be China fault.
Or Russian.
It would be everyone’s fault to not be capable to prevent this situation.
And let as always, simply greed and money and power blind every other interest, even people’s life.
