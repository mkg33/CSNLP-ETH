And it's one of the demands of Erdogan for Sweden and Finland to denounce and expel Kurds to give his OK for their NATO membership.
In Turkey's defense, they've never not been a strong NATO ally, but Erdogan has been openly hostile to EU interests after Turkey got rejected in the 00's.
This dick wagging is 100% on brand for Erdogan and is just about the only thing he can do to hold his elective base after running the economy into the ground, but once in, there's no reason to assume Turkey will be anything other than a cooperative NATO ally despite any lingering grudges.
If Erdogan actually managed to solve those two issues Turkey would be the biggest player in the eastern Mediterranean rather than being closely matched with the likes of Russia/Israel/Iran/SA.
While the first is rather unintentional and just a result of the ignorance of the Erdogan administration the second is a pretty cynical play that allows him to maintain power by playing the different groups in Turkey against each other.
Are we talking about Turkey, the country that is dealing with triple digit inflation because Erdogan is too arogant to learn basic economics?
