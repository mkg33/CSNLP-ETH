Republicans are slimey and will try to pass some variation of a law that doesn't explicitly say "you must be 21 to vote", but will try to put in some kind of rule or something that seriously restricts anyone under 21 from voting.
It’s amazing the efforts these pieces of crap will go through to restrict people from voting instead of creating any legislation that would make people want to vote for them.
There would be no way to write a law that would be able to frustrate voting because someone is 18.
It would either be overly broad, or vague, both of which fail.
While I am a newly minted lawyer, I assure you it is impossible to skirt around this particular amendment.
It would be the same as trying to get around the amendment that allows for a direct vote of senators.
How would you even do that?
Because they haven’t done it yet.
“Why haven’t they done it in the past?” Because the country was barely together and was at a constant threat of being ripped apart, so fear of congress acting on states would be seen as feds meddling in an area they ought not to be.
While the 26th is laser focused.
When asked, what age, the answer is 18.
When ask what constitutes infringement the answer is, denying them the right to vote just because they’re 18.
Meaning you cannot deny or abridge the voting rights of anyone who is 18years or older.
And it goes so far as to explicitly say, neither the United States congress, or any state.
As a side note, Technically Art I on the U.S. constitution allows congress to draw districts and a bunch of other stuff.
They just don’t.
However disenfranchising millions of people would immediately spur them stepping in.
Congress is, and has always been the most powerful branch people just notice the president because it’s only one person.
