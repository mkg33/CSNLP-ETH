I overheard a conversation yesterday where in a span of 15 seconds a person went from literally yelling at the TV (FOX news of course) about Biden being a traitor because of five documents to Trump was the President and can declassify anything just by saying so.
I feel like Biden is baiting the GOP into investigating him for less than 20 classified documents so they would have to explain why they are defending Trump at least 60 classified stolen materials.
Biden believes that some of his secret service are Trump loyalists, so I wouldn't put it past them to plant these documents in Biden's properties to derail the Trump investigation.
Also, Trump fucked up and gave Biden a roadmap in stonewalling and stalling the House investigations in the courts by filing lawsuits.
Trump and his ilk flat up ignored subpoenas and nearly ran out the clock on his taxes and other things the Democrat majority went after.
All 46 and Hunter have to do is stall things in the courts and cite precedent from Trump.
If the GOP wants to fight dirty, Biden has some tricks up his sleeve he can make use of if he choose to do so.
Trump, McConnell, and their idiot counterparts in the House just want to sow doubt and chaos to get people to stop trusting in the system.
They’re all corrupt as hell, thus everyone especially their enemies/political opponents must be.
I don’t doubt there are corrupt democrats (Bob Menendez for one), but they are flinging everything they can at the wall and hoping something sticks like they did with both Clinton and Obama.
Same old story.
And the whole point eerily follows Russia’s firehouse of falsehood strategy to try and induce apathy and cynicism in the political process.
