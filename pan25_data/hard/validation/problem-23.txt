If it is bad when China does military exercises close to other countries waters, then it is bad when we do it.
That's called basic consistency.
Not even like this is the only time they have violated another countries sovereignty, as the do it all the time, and in very serious ways (air strikes, drone strikes, assassinations, invasions etc.)
Can you imagine the reaction among the media and politicians if China was doing these things to the extent that the US is?
Okay, so say it was accidental.
What about all the times the USA has for certain intentionally violated other countries sovereignty?
E.g.
the assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, or the illegal drone warfare program.
Like I say, can you imagine the reaction if it was China doing these things?
And China is a rising power in a world moving towards multipolarity.
In the American media they have and will continue to get a ton of criticism and anti China propaganda.
Funny how when China does hostile and aggressive actions, western media presents it as bad, but when it is us doing the hostile and aggressive actions, they present as normal, and as if we haven't even done anything wrong.
