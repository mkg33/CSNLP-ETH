Of course it is.
Its not about him being a welder specifically, but more that he feels confident enough in his foreign policy knowledge as a laymen to shit on a lifelong diplomat.
Bet he couldnt point Taiwan out on a map.
The the other side of the strait is Taiwan.
If America and its allies control the strait, they can choke China.
No shipping means, effectively, that the CCP’s hold on power is not longer acceptable internally.
But do we really think that Americans will forever care enough about an island of 23 million people that’s 7,600 miles from America?
And only 100 miles from China?
Is it worth going to war with the only other superpower over Taiwan?
No way Americans are going to buy that.
Taiwan won’t declare independence because that would be provocative and the United States wouldn’t be obligated to defend Taiwan in that case.
China would actually be more alarmed if Taiwan dropped its claim to the mainland, because then Taiwan is no longer positioned as a competing faction inside China's boundaries.
China wants the whole standoff to remain framed as an internal conflict.
It's also a huge strategic thorn for them to have a large island with ties to the West positioned right by the middle of their coastline.
A little like the US, USSR, and Cuba, but more pronounced.
Cuba was never part of the USA.
A better comparison would be if the civil war happened after the American-Spanish war and their version of Lincoln fled to Puerto Rico.
