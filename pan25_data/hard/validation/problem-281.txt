Graduate students aren't herded into a room and basically lied to that their degrees will make paying back loans simple, the way freshmen are (with little to no explanation of the impact of compounding interest), so it's understandable and I hope it works out.
10% is the current level for IBR.
What will make a difference for graduate students is the planned increase the threshold of what counts as discretionary income.
If that works out, it will lower graduate payments simply because the 10% threshold will be based on a smaller amount of their income.
Side A: We should make it easier to go to college and lower the burden of paying back loans that many people can't afford.
Choose a community college for all gen eds and then some to cut costs before I go to cheaper university.
And then even with our degrees that is now no longer experience enough to get entry level jobs and so we can't easily or at all pay back what we were promised would be a cinche to do by all our most trusted advisors!
Still get told I need 3-5 years professional experience for entry level when I was told all my life that college covers that and get paid 15$/hr only.
