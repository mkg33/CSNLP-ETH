In 10-15 years we're going to hear news reports of Russians lamenting the loss of a generation as there will be no young men left to generate the next generation.
the opportunity for that has come and gone, Russia has been eviscerated in more ways than one, Now it's even a question on whether the Russian state will survive the decade.
Now they just want to take as many down with them as possible.
In other words, the Ukrainians never felt as strongly about the Russians, as vice Versa.
It's loaded language.
the reality of their history is that the Ukrainians have been occupied and vassalized by Moscow since there even were Russian and Ukrainians, or whatever you want to call them historically, cossacks, ruthenians, etc.
Rus' language (also called "ruthenian language" or sometimes "old east slavic") is a precursor to the ukrainian and belarusian languages, and actually I believe that a modified version of it, along with a society of modern ruthenians still exist in the western part of Ukraine, in Hungary, Slovakia and maybe other countries.
That trail of thought is corroborated by historians of many countries - except our one and only Russia Muscovy, which to this day calls it "proto-russian language" or "old russian language".
The term "Kievan Rus' " was specifically crafted by historians of the Russian empire in the beginning and middle of the 19th century.
That period of time was right after Catherine II's rule, and she was adamant on rewriting the history of the lands captured by russians - to solidify russian claim on them, and stregnthen their own history.
(Naturally, the usage of the term "kievan rus", meaning Rus' of Kiev, implied there existed "muscovian rus", meaning Rus' of Muscovy, which of course gives russians additional reasons to believe that history of Rus = history of modern Russia).
Prior to that it, along with all other claims of modern Russia on Slavic history, didn't exist.
oh sorry, but I used materials written in the russian and ukrainian languages, don't know about books in other languages .
I can't be called an expert on the matter.
