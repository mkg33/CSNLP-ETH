You are aware the DNC doesn't even field candidates in safe red districts due to Gerrymandering right?
That's a conceded seat like the good old look at this actually supreme court overruled map of the old Pennsylvania map in 2018..
Like not even every state was on the statewide election this year.
So if I'm not voting for governor, mayor, senator... Of course for house races I don't care as much.
Like overall turnout in the house is kinda meaningless because if it's always 65-35 you know it's not gonna swing your way in a midterm election.
Not necessarily, the midterms may very well be a wakeup call to the GOP that MAGA is dead and everyone is tired of their dumbass bullshit.
It's not likely going to be the outcome, but with such a tiny margin of majority, it's not a 100% chance the party is unified.
I'm hoping that with the tiniest majority the GOP will struggle to bring things to a halt.
There has to be a couple of republicans that are willing to side with the dems on getting some stuff done.
At the very least things like not shutting the government down and passing a budget.
