Russia does have more men that it can mobilise than Ukraine has, but taking into account the Russian population age structure, the very large prison population and the poor health of Russian men, I'm not sure this is as much of an advantage as it looks on paper.
Also, untrained and unhappy soldiers are a liability, not an asset.
Russia is unlikely to industrialise like it needs to, because of the lack of men due to mobilisation, and because Russia has a poor record of doing this effectively.
The West does need to increase its military spending very quickly, but when we really get going, there's no way Russia can match us.
West will need to create more weapons to accomplish its goals of holding back more Russian forces in coming years.
Finally, regarding nukes, I agree 100% that as of February 2023, this is not a war that nuclear weapons solves for either party.
However, if Russia is allowed to commit several years and a few million souls, and China is looming, and America is getting scared, well, things are looking very different and nukes become a discussion of saving lives from the side who stands to lose many more...
