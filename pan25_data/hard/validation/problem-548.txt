"Well my idiot has some problems, but they're nothing like THOSE people's idiots in their Texas districts!
".
Meanwhile all the GOP idiots vote lockstep in ways that harm the vast majority of people in the state.
Worse to me is that people can vote for candidates that align with their views on the grid, climate change, marijuana legalization, etc., but are in gerrymandered districts so their vote basically doesn't count.
If there are ten contests on the ballot, but you think your vote will only matter in one or two of them, it's easier to make excuses about why going through the trouble to vote isn't worth it, even when the ones that would matter are higher offices.
Higher offices are further removed from people.
You might never see your US Senators or Governor, but could regularly see your mayor, council members, etc.
And people might actually care more about the more local offices for that reason, because they're more directly affected by them, even though the higher offices affect more people, and sometimes even to a greater degree.
It doesn't account for all of the problem, but it does account for some of it.
It's part of why gerrymandering is so pernicious.
Add in all the other forms of voter suppression, disenfranchisement, etc, and they're an interconnected set of weapons, mutually supportive in the goal of helping elect the GOP despite only having minority support.
Every form of cheating makes every other form of cheating that much easier and more effective.
