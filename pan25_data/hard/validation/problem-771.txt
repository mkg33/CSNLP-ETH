Gross oversimplification but that's what De Santis and his idiots have a problem with learning.
That blacks, LGBTQ+, immigrants, handicapped, and people of different faiths or cultures have all contributed, greatly, to our nation.
"African people were taken from their homelands, forced into slavery in brutal conditions.
Eventually they were 'freed' but still treated like shit.
Eventually they weren't treated quite as bad, but still not great.
And now they have the right to exist.
".
"Additionally they have contributed greatly to our society.
Serving in our military, contributing to science and the arts.
And building this nation into a global superpower all while being treated as less than human.
".
LMAO.
Why are you so afraid of US history?
Do you understand many people in NJ aren't degenerate scumbag Republican cowards?
Not everyone sees what's happening in Republican shitholes like Florida and says, "Yes, I want to be a disgusting, delusional bottom-feeder as well!
".
Yes.
Republicans are scared of history snd science and are very, very mad their insane delusions aren’t catered to by people who live in reality and/or aren’t absolutely disgusting moral degenerate filth.
