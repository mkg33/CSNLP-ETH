So?
Whelan was dishonorably discharged for larceny, but we should still do everything possible to get him back.
The absolutely ridiculous histrionics folks are twisting themselves into to be mad about Griner's release is frankly pathetic.
Bout is a has-been who was near the end of his sentence ( I think he had six years left) so it makes sense to use him as a chit to get back whoever we could.
The other commenter is trying to point out that Bout was about halfway through his sentence, and importantly he will almost certainly not be able to do harm anymore.
Plus demand from Russian weapons is drying up faster than the Colorado river since potential buyers can see how fucking shit Russian arms are.
He better not say another fucking word about "gun control" when he's trading arms dealers for dumbass potheads who travel to Russia and give them an excuse to arrest them.
Absurd, we will trade a murderous arms dealer capable of running a network of illegal arms, but there are people in gulag in USA for this same thing.
Greiner was a moron.
She doesn’t deserve her sentence, but she also doesn’t deserve our pity.
She’s an adult.
She made the choice and knew of the potential consequences.
This blood is now on her hands.
