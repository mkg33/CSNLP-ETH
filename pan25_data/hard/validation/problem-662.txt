A lot of cough syrups contain glycerol, which is chemically similar to ethylene glycol (but safe to consume).
Glycerol is used for a lot of other things, though - it's an industrial solvent and antifreeze, it's used to dampen vibrations in sensitive machinery, it's used in skin and hair products, and it's even used as a fuel.
Sometimes industrial glycerol is mixed with ethylene glycol since it has similar properties... so if contaminated industrial glycerol somehow gets into the supply chain of glycerol intended for drug or food manufacturing, it can be deadly.
