Edit: you know what?
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt - maybe they didn't lie.
Maybe she truly got upstairs just to get the cat...but in the end - she stayed there to film them, and that what matters.
Secondly - even if somehow it was a sniper who shot her - it happened at night.
With IR vision you can see a person - but it's harder to understand what he exactly does.
It could even give him a false picture of someone on a rooftop pointing something at the soldiers that it's holding.
With a quick reaction you could definitely shoot on the thought that it was a terrorist holding a gun.
You say she was on the same rooftop and was involved with the shooters, so clearly she was then intentionally targeted and killed.
The essence of being a soldier at war is that you will be ordered to go into conflicts where the other side will shoot at you.
Ok, so now you admit that there was a battle, but now you're saying it has nothing to do with the shooting.
If I keep pressing, are you going to admit that you're making things up?
