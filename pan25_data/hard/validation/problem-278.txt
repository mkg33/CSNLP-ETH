People who are depressed can't get medically assisted suicide.
This is for terminally ill people.
Think of someone dying of inoperable cancer instead.

To me.
Depression makes you want to die, but it doesn't kill you.
You can keep a depressed person alive by denying them means of harming themselves.
I don't think it's reasonable to let someone use medically assisted suicide just because they're depressed.
Sadly it can be- other countries allow medically assisted suicide for what is seen as untreatable depression, I really have no doubt many will choose that over having to shell out cash for years and have no real solution.
I don't trust how uber-capitalist we are here and how easily one can feel trapped in extreme depression with little help to find some peace of mind (especially when in cases brought on by extreme money issues as you mentioned).
I feel like this will be bad to have in the current America.
People will 100% choose death over crippling debt forever and depression that cannot be treated correctly only due to lack of help/money :/ If we were actually caring about our own, ai'd be less worried.
