Yeah… I don’t think a lot of people from privileged backgrounds fully understand that a hard life leads to hard, unsympathetic, immoral people.
The abused become the abuser, as it were.
Oh for sure it can be organic.
I’m saying that people aware of their own suffering and powerlessness develop a certain darkness that would terrify a therapist.
And Russia is s country full of abused humans.
Russia has a long history of using mass rape as a weapon.
Rape happens in every war, it's a side effect of dehumanizing the enemy; however there are very few armies today that would instruct their soldiers to rape everybody they came across.
Russia is one of those and has been for hundreds of years.
This is how Russia has always been for hundreds of years.
The October revolution tried to change this but only managed to put a coat of red paint over it.
This is why Russia continues to try and support the world's "second largest army" despite having an economy smaller than Italy's, and this is why Russia has been unable to join the "global community" despite thirty years of the world bending over backwards to integrate them.
To a Russian fear and respect are entwined.
You cannot have respect without fear.
They never even considered building their economy like Germany did because they don't consider Germany respectable because nobody fears Germany.
This war is happening now because, ultimately, nobody fears Russia anymore either, even the "inferior" countries that Russia has traditionally bullied.
This woman is telling her husband to rape other women because exploring people and getting away with it is how you gain prestige in Russian society.
She's not upset or concerned about the fact that she might get raped (in fact she already has been), she's more concerned about her social standing and prestige.
If her husband rapes and exploits a lot of Ukrainian women then that makes: 1) Russia look better, for being strong and exploiting a weaker, "inferior" country like Ukraine, and 2) it makes the wife look better for being the wife of such a strong soldier who gained glory for himself by raping lots of women.
Another way to interpret her statement would be that she thought that there was a good chance that he would rape Ukrainian women and that she had no control over whether or not he did, but wanted to tell him to use protection.
