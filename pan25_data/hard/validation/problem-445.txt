It's a mix of opportunists and true believers.
It always is.
Watch Death of Stalin.
This all feels eerily similar.
Yes, exactly.
That's the justification given by a number of voters here as well; they thought Trump couldn't win but wanted to give a middle finger to Hillary Clinton and the "establishment" (which is always conveniently changing definitions).
I honestly don't think you'd see the party loyalty that you do here in the US if our electoral system wasn't so screwed up.
The electoral college, first-past-the-post, partisan gerrymandering, bicameral legislature (our Senate is horribly disproportionate and unrepresentative) - all of it rewards hardline partisanship.
Most of us end up voting for candidates without much enthusiasm, because all you have to do is not be worse than the other one.
Though, in the case of those friends above I mentioned, it was more that they are the people who just blindly vote for a party, not really caring about the candidates themselves.
They look just like the democrats they campaigned against - willing to vote for ideological preferences but never willing to utilize their positions to make life better for the voters that put them in power.
The reason DSA and its platform have no profile with most of the public is that its elected officials at the national level don’t serve as socialists, they serve as Democrats, and even as Democrats they act in the most submissive way possible.
They don’t vote in accordance with the platform (hell, they don’t even vote as a bloc) and they pass up on crucial opportunities to use the House floor as a platform for socialist agitation, like the Speaker vote.
The point of electing socialists to public office isn’t so they can work with the representatives of the capitalist class.
It’s to take the class struggle to the halls of power, which means acting in an oppositional manner and intentionally throwing a wrench in the capitalist state machinery.
