This isn't a case where the NFL is just playing games and the network sells ad space to random companies who just happen to be gambling sites.
DraftKings and the NFL having a partnership deal doesn't mean FOX and CBS have to sell ads to DraftKings.
\ If anything, I would imagine there are outlines in the contract that requires the partners to buy advertising from the networks on a schedule outlined by the NFL and the partners.
It's mutually beneficial.
We know what they told us - they would have no reason to withhold a simple thing like this.
Further, the partnership reduces the need for ads anyway as their branding is visible throughout the product as it airs.
The ads are icing on top because they get even more.
I could care less about the ads for the most part.
Whether it’s a gambling ad or a car ad, I couldn’t care less.
What does annoy the hell out of me is how much it’s invaded sports media, especially the local sports talk.
Regular segments of shows exclusively about gambling.
And if that’s not bad enough, other segments inevitably devolve into conversations on gambling.
Half the conversations seems to result in the hosts bragging about their wins, but mysteriously, rarely a mention of losses.
