The sanctions are not aimed at preventing Russia from selling oil (that would be a problem for the world economy and destroy developing countries), but to prevent Russia from making money.
I believe the sanctions prevent the west from buying from Russian oil from Russia.
But the west especially Europe needs Russian oil therefore the go around to India is the point I was trying to make.
Perhaps I could’ve been more communicative.
It’s all theatrics.
Cause they can’t control India in the same way as the west .
That the real complaint.
But the data is there to show what I’ve said above .
Governments don’t make real decisions anymore , bankers rule the world.
They own us all.
So sick of this phoney world.
Beginning to question if it’s all a simulation or not.
It is a big discount , then India turns around and literally selling in to the U.S for a big profit .
The sanctions are a big scam .
Europe is also buying Russian oil through India as well.
Few countries increased their russian oil purchases the way India did.
Not even Latam which is Russia-leaning.
Indians are basically saying invading and killing is ok.
