Getting to net zero will require carbon capture technology.
I agree that it should not take away focus from cutting emissions, which is also needed to reach net zero, and I think that is closer to the point you make in other comments, but I don't think we should be referring to it as a "myth" because we very much do need carbon capture.
Right, we need to build out our green energy capacity (wind, solar, etc.
), which is something that we both agree on, so that we do not need energy from fossil fuels to make up for it.
Again, carbon capture is not the single solution, but a necessary component, along with transitioning toward low-carbon energy sources.
Carbon capture will only become efficient once we dully transition to green energy, or green energy with a minor portion of nuclear.
Even if you run a carbon capture device on a green energy system, you are putting that green energy system to waste in your mission to reduce carbon dioxide emmissions, as that green energy could have been use to reduce emmissions directly, and more efficiently, instead.
Because you are now using that green energy for this carbon capture, somewhere else in the world, someone is going to need to use fossil fuels to compensate.
If you rely on fossils instead of renewable, becuse you're assuming you can just capture the carbon.
I mean, sure carbon capture is one of many solutions to fix climate change, in instances where it's hard to replace petroleum, especially in industry.
But I've got a feeling that's not what they are talking about.
