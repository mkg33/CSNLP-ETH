They said great lakes region in total, so I'm guessing it includes Canada.
But none of it really means anything, coastlines are fractal-like so measuring coastline lenh could lead to ever increasing numbers depending how closely you measure.
It's a running joke that basically any lake can claim to have more coastline than California, depending on how you measure it.
But that statistic only really rings true to me if you include the coastlines of ALL lakes in the great lakes region, and there's like a hundred thousand lakes out there.
Fun fact: the Great Lakes in total have a longer coast line than the combined east and west coasts of the contiguous US.
So really when you hear “coast” in the US you should think Michigan.
To be fair, this is the case in just about every country with an east coast.
In Canada, East Coast is used to refer to the maritime provinces and West Coast is used to refer to BC.
I'm confident this is the case in most countries, no different than the US.
Agreed though - people thinking NK landed missiles in waters East of the US is substantially more concerning.
If they tried to fire missiles over the continental US they'd be an irradiated wasteland before it splashed down.
