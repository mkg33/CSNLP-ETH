I think his point is that reducing the complexity of a war to “good guys” versus “bad guys” is a dramatic oversimplification of the facts.
You can support whoever you support, but it is never as simple as “good guys” versus “bad guys.” Indeed, your conception of it as such is largely a product of confirmation bias and the type of media you are consuming.
But what does “good” mean in this context, other than “the ones we feel we should be supporting.” There is some argument for the fact that NATO encroachment is threatening to countries that have been explicitly rejected from NATO.
If the CSTO is was powerful enough to threatening to US, and Mexico was poised to join the CSTO, would the US consider that a threat?
Certainly.
Not to mention you are a fool if you think Ukrainian soldiers would not be committing war crimes left and right if they weren’t worried about losing Western support.
Ukraine are the “good guys” because they are innocent victims acting purely in self defense in this war of aggression and attempted genocide on Russia’s part.
Therefore everything Ukraine does in this war is morally justified, and nothing Russia does is with the exception of fucking off and paying reparations for the war.
Militarily, in conventional warfare, Russia is losing but don't kid yourself, they're killing a lot of brave Ukrainians too!
Ukraine still needs our help.
