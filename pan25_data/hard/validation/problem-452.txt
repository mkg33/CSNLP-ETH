I mean when a group of soldiers signal their surrender but then one of them pops out a gun and starts shooting... no one surrendered... there were no prisoners of war... the people killed were, willing or not, active combatants in a war their country started and the guy who shot decided to actively continue.
It sucks to be taken out while laying on the ground with your arms up but it sucks a whole lot more to accept a false surrender and be ambushed.
Agree to disagree I guess.
When a bunch of guys surrender and one of them pulls a gun, no one surrendered and all of them are enemy combatants.
Every single one of the guys on the floor could, and should, be assumed armed with ill intent at that point.
It's not a war crime to save your own freaking life.
I would be able to agree with you IF they had all been searched and were all restrained.
As it was, any one of these men could have still been armed and all of them were still potentially dangerous as the surrender was being violated.
Accepting surrender is a life or death situation especially when restraining a force larger than your own.
If the situation degrades you need to eliminate the threat and secure the area, and it looks like this is what the Ukrainian/machine gunner did.
You cannot be certain especially in the moment that the Russian soldiers didn't have grenades or pistols hidden.
We will never know the plan the Russians had, if this was perfidy gone wrong.
Most likely this was a lone Russian who got the rest of his mates killed by committing perfidy.
