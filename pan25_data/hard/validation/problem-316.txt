The ironic thing from all this silly finger pointing without even knowing the full scope of the incident is that it was probably both conservatives and liberals, because there were multiple leaks.
As always, has the best take because they understand the Court best and, crucially, they remember the first leak, to the Wall Street Journal, that everyone forgets.
This is Scotusblog, not a rumor mill.
You still haven't read the blog, as it explains how we know about the WSJ leak from a WSJ editorial that seemed to know the decision, if not the opinion.
So you haven't read that editorial either.
Operating based on thinking there was only one leak is just unrealistic.
So you didn't read Scotusblog.
You should read Scotusblog because there were three leaks, one to the WSJ and two to Politico.
Here's an ultraconservative commenting on the WSJ editorial at the time and wondering if it is the result of a leak:
My theory is that the conservatives thought that by leaking it earlier than the scheduled announcement of the SCOTUS decisions, it would soften the political blow on the midterms.
Obviously that's not how it went from a political standpoint; but that was my theory of their intent.
There were other good theories at the time that they were trying to lock in a conservative vote and that may be right but I liked my theory at the time.
