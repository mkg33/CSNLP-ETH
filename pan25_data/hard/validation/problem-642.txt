I don’t know the answer to this to prevent a tragedy in the future but the unfortunate truth is humans herded into a small space and trampled/crushed each other.
While it’s difficult to tell from the ground what’s happening or to see the threat, there is certainly some responsibility to recognize that the crowd literally created this by everyone herding down a narrow alleyway.
I guess that the city should cordon off small tight spaces on a slope but can you imagine the logistics of just closing every street and alley x feet wide?
Closing the main road to vehicular traffic to give people more space and enforcing one-way traffic down the alleyway would’ve made a huge difference.m.
The alley branched off from a larger road, as the leg of a T-shaped intersection.
Crowds going in opposite directions met near the top of the alley and I believe the first chokepoint formed here.
As a member of that crowd, you have four options:
Looking at the topography of the area, it kind of was just a death trap.
I can’t fault people for inadvertently pooling in there.
In a scenario like this, bending sideways is actually the path of least resistance.
Unfortunately, the other end of the alleyway connected to a larger road too and that one I believe had Itaewon Station right there so there were a bunch of people trying to come up the alley from that end.
So, the same scenario repeats itself, crowds moving in opposite directions collided but inside the alley this time, a much narrower area with no side path out.
This second choke point turned into the deadly crush.
