Much more expensive to mount a national campaign than a state campaign.
Starting early can't overcome that.
Having all the primaries on one day effectually cedes the nomination to one of the biggest money candidates.
I've seen people switch their vote from their real choice to the "winning" choice purely because the "winning" candidate had more votes in a primary days earlier, thinking that candidate is inevitable.
More conservative states will go first, more conservative candidates will win in those states, voters in other states may be influenced to vote for the same candidate to be on the winning side.
Campaigning in a single state is much more affordable, and offers the low budget candidate a chance to make a good showing, build support and leverage that into a national campaign.
I'm in favor of serious campaign finance reform including public financing of campaigns, but very wary of having a single primary day across the nation.
Such an approach would heavily favor the candidate who has the most money up-front, and disadvantage any less well funded candidate as they would not be able to use early showings to build momentum.
