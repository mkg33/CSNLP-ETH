China, Russia, turkey and Algeria all named in the article.
So 2 countries in the midst of economic crisis, one thatâ€™s getting obliterated on the battlefield and running low on money and Algeria.
They can try liberalizing their economy and political system so they can actually join the global economic system like the vast majority of former Soviet bloc countries did.
Ah yes, the old "don't make any reforms because the alternative is certainly going to be worse" ignoring the fact that plenty of countries have successfully transitioned to market-based economies from communism.
The situation is no different in Cuba, except there literally is no choice on the ballot - only one party is represented.
Arguably, ending the embargo and having a better relation with cuba could very well help removing their dictatorship from power or bringing them closer to democracy.. its atleast a different approach since the one the US has right now clearly hasnt worked.
While you are correct that it will be nearly impossible to find a Cuban outside of Cuba that would defend the Cuban government, the majority of Cubans outside of the US do think that the embargo is worth ending.
Lastly the idea that they have an embargo on Cuba because the Cuban goverment is evil is hilarious when they have close ties to countries like Qatar.
The idea of the embargo is to put preassure on Cuban politicians, and to hurt them in the eyes of the public.
This tactic has clearly failed.
The Cuban goverment uses the embargo like a blanket to cover up any problem.
Literally anytime anything goes wrong they blame the embargo.
