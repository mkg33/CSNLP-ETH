True.
Right now it just feels like, as they grossly overestimated their capabilities etc, they want to regroup, get weapons etc, and then perhaps try again within Putins lifetime.
And we can’t be sure that his successor will be any better (for the Russians and the rest of the world).
Gonna be a lot harder to scrape together a large enough group of Russia supporters after all of this.
By the time the rest of the mass graves are found, I don't think there are gonna be too many people willing to admit to having Russian sympathies inside of Ukraine.
I don't think he will, I'd like to think he leaves the country in good hands and then settles down to a well earned fuckin' retirement with his family wherever he damn well pleases in Ukraine.
That’s not what Ukraine wants, and isn’t anywhere close to a good deal for them, but I think a lot of countries currently supporting Ukraine would be happy with a return to status quo along with a token admission of guilt by Russia.
Like, if Putin offered a full withdrawal of troops, a return to the pre-invasion borders (he still gets to keep the Crimea), and a token offer for reparations (say like $2 billion), I think most countries currently supporting Ukraine would pressure them to take that deal.
The fact that other countries (outside the usual suspects) aren’t harshly pressuring Ukraine to conclude the war and take a deal with Russia shows how unreasonable Russia’s offers are.
The crazy thing is, if Putin came to the table with an offer anywhere in the neighborhood of reasonable, there’s be a lot of pressure on Ukraine to accept.
