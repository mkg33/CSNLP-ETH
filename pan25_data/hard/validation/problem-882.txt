While we joke about our military, Oryx's list of what Canada has actually sent is actually quite extensive:
This is one of the reasons why Canada's been so strongly supporting the Ukrainian war effort.
A bunch of members of parliament are Ukrainian, including the current deputy prime minister (the US equivalent would be Vice President), who was once banned from the USSR after her time as an activist in Ukraine led to a KGB case study about how much damage a single person could do the Soviet Union.
Before the war, Canada had the largest number of Ukrainians outside of Russia and Ukraine, with roughly 4% of the population (roughly 1.4 million) being of Ukrainian descent as of 2016.
If you didn't know, canada already had the second largest group of ukranian diaspora in the world (first being Russia of course) so we already had a solid ukranian community before the war, so it wasn't terribly difficult to bring in ukranian refugees.
I'm particularly proud of the hundreds of Roschel Senator armoured personnel carriers that we're sending, as they're built in Canada primarily by Ukrainian refugees, of which Canada has accepted hundreds of thousands.
It's far too long to post here, but includes thousands of weapons, millions of rounds of ammunition, and hundreds of vehicles.
