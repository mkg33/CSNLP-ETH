Yes, that is what it means, you and the person I reply to just don't want to admit that.
The whole premise of the article we are commenting on is them not changing the filibuster for legislation.
When they had zero evidence of the GOP changing the filibuster for legislation, they just replied with judicial nominees.
Which is already something that Democrats have already done and were punished for.
We're talking about legislation here not nominees.
And you conveniently left out that this was in response to Dems removed the filibuster for judicial nominees during Obama's term.
A prime example of why Dems would be foolish to repeat the filibuster mistake again.
She’s not saying that removing the filibuster is absolutely wrong, just that the Dems tried too early.
So when the Republicans suggest removing the filibuster at some later date, I expect she’ll consider it no longer “premature” and vote with them.
Seeing as she’s using her elected position to fuck over the country, it’s almost a moral obligation to give up the dirt.
