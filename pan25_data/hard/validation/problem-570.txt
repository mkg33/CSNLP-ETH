Edit: to be clear, during the 2020 protests, we saw it was police / army vs the people.
But for some reason, Belarusians have a belief that if they are forced into a war, the army will turn on Luka almost instantly.
They are also terrified of uttering a word about anything in public, but the minute you sre behind closed doors, they are clearly anti Russia, anti Putin, anti Luka etc.
Just said this in another comment, but Belarus won't go for a coup unless they get pulled into the war or an attempted annexation by Russia (which they fear a lot right now).
3a) sign it, because Russia wants to invade via Belarus, and this is a super clever, super secret way of surprising them, because everyone totally believes that Belarus would keep to the pact.
Finally, signing such a pact would allow Belarus to allow Russia to launch attacks from Belarus, without allowing Ukraine to strike back.
Would he be willing to let nato station troops in Belarus to make sure he isnâ€™t violating the pact by letting Russian troops attack Ukraine from his territory?
