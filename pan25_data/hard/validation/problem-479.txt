I'll sum it up like I did in another comment: using anything other than the Constitution is inappropriate and tacky.
I can't imagine being in their shoes and having the hubris to think it's appropriate to bring my personal beliefs to a moment that belongs to the constituents.
Well I'm not going to have time to reply on every single reddit post about this, but I feel like my comments have been pretty consistent in this: anything other than the Constitution is inappropriate.
Edit: to clarify, I don't think a Superman comic is any more silly than the Bible, personally, but this whole thing where members are making statements by what they choose to swear on is very unbecoming.
I think it's neat that he likes Superman, but this moment doesn't belong to him, it belongs to his constituents and the people of the US.
He's chosen the constitution to swear on he is just also bringing the superman comic and another book that have sentimental value to him.
This article is trying to make him seem immature and just as bad as the Republican clown show when it's not.
