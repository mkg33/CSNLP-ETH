Like Qatar getting the World Cup is immediate bullshit.
It's a country most never heard of with no history of sporting success in a blistering hot desert.
At least Russia is plausible but Qatar?
No.
But nope.
No spines here!
Same shit as always.
These cultures don't respect civility, they see it as a weakness to be exploited, they see it as you being a gullible idiot that they'd be a fool NOT to exploit and abuse.
Same as with russians.
Had Germany, UK, France and Italy said "fuck off" you think Fifa or qatar would still enforce the rules?
It'd be a world historic failure of qatar if they did so they'd ofcourse change course and let people have fun.
all i hope for is nothing catastrophic happens to innocent people in qatar and we can just move on and forget about this world cup as soon as possible.
So if you actually care about these things, hold FIFA just as culpable as Qatar, and stop supporting them.
Qatar's human rights' violations and overall treatment of its people weren't some tightly locked secret that only now came to light thanks to increased visibility.
