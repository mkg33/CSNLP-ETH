They need a reel of a couple dozen microchips, and everything else won't be on sanction lists, and that'll already be enough for a thousand drones.
The chips required for the drones are likely less complex/don't need to be extremely compact, as Texas Instruments doesn't even make anything smaller than 45nm (and TI parts were found in shahed drones).
Honest question: you don't think a large redistributor of such sanctioned parts would scratch off the serial numbers?
It's done on cars, and those probably have less supplier scrutiny/combat use cases tbh.
From what I gather, I think it's mostly a large inconvenience/expense rather than irreparable damage.
Huawei used to get their chips manufactured by TSMC, which is no longer happening, but there are rumors that they've found a way to get their 12-14nm chips mass produced, to be used in the wearable devices, and allegedly planning to relaunch the Kirin (5nm?)
flagship phone chip manufacturing in 2023.
They ranked quite high in benchmarks at the time they were released, so my guess is China is mostly missing the manufacturing part, not the design/engineering part.
That sounds like a pretty huge assumption, imo.
Just because they currently use American parts doesn't mean they can't/won't invest the time to find alternatives when necessary.
