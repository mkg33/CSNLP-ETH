Shooting unarmed medics and civilians is ALSO a warcrime, Israel is gonna have to employ military forces on these fuckheads to save civilians and the holy place that is Jerusalem(before you ask yes I am Jewish).
I'm not going to pretend that innocent casualties haven't happened or that the Israeli government is completely bereft of blame, but Israel doesn't go out of its way to murder Palestinians.
The problem is that there is often no clear distinction between legitimate combatants and civilians on the Palestinian side, since many Palestinian civilians support violence against Israelis, if they haven't tried to commit violence themselves.
In any case, Israel has the right to defend itself from attacks.
The issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank is a politically thorny one.
But I don't see a good solution.
Either Israel leaves the West Bank alone, but Palestinian settlements there can serve as a base of operations for terrorists and threaten its Eastern border.
Either Israel expels everyone from the West Bank, and it becomes a buffer zone with Jordan.
Or it slowly colonizes the area, because of housing needs and Israel doesn't have a lot of room already.
Expand or die as in if Israel allows its neighbours to catch up itâ€™ll be in a bad position.
And I agree about the annexation point but in this case the annexation is the result of wars in which Israel itself was to be annexed so for it to not return captured territory seems reasonable.
I can understand, "not giving an inch" in terms of Israel's internationally recognized borders, but how do you figure that the Arab world's negative treatment of Israel necessitates Israel's expansion into territory that does not belong to it?
