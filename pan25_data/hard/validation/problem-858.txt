You know some people have never seen those jokes before right?
Just because you’ve seen them a lot doesn’t mean everyone has.
And doesn’t mean it’s the same people telling them either.
I don't know where you think you're getting your information from but you're wrong.
Go look up a list of the top 25 most prescribed psych meds.
You won't find lithium or depakote on those lists unless you dig back to about 2015.
There's a reason for that.
Lithium as a mood stabiliser is still used in some cases but it has been depreciated in favour of other, newer medications.
The reason being that long-term lithium consumption has the potential to damage the kidneys.
That and the drug is a teratogen, which is a known carcinogen.
Oh and it also increases the chance of birth defects in pregnant women.
Newer mood stabilisers like Lamotrigine and Seroquel do not have these problems.
As for Seroquel and Lamotragine, I just gave those as examples of medications that are newer than Lithium.
I just chose them randomly because there's a long list of meds that are newer than Lithium.
