A person that does something like that does not care what we think, does not feel remorse, and is incapable of joy and happiness and fulfillment.
They’re an empty shell of a human (likely from a horrible childhood of severe abuse and neglect) that needs to be kept away from society.
No one can undo their crime, so it doesn’t matter what happens to them other than we guarantee they can’t do it again.
We can save the feeling of justice and revenge for the movies where no actual people were hurt by the villain.
That’s what I’m saying.
I don’t think the suffering of criminals serves any purpose, especially if there is any uncertainty in the conviction, but it’s pretty important that we keep actual horrible dangerous people away from other people.
But I would have like to have seen a more simple statement that killing people (even bad people) is wrong absent the most extraordinary of circumstances - and getting retribution or exacting punishment is not such a circumstance.
Because the appeal process costs more than life sentences, occasionally innocent people are convicted and sentenced to die, it does nothing to deter future crimes, and the state shouldn’t be murdering people.
Did I get them all?
I don’t think our prisons are humane, and if we stopped using them to house non-violent offenders and people that need social services, they would be less crowded and a better place.
