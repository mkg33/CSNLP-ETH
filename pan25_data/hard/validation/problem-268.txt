I hate the reporting and focus on this.
What the hell are people supposed to do, the whole world is going to shit and nothing seems to work.
The point of protests is to cause inconvenience.
Granted this could have been done in a different way but the hyper focus on those cases and people who actually give a fuck to get off their asses is rediculous.
Not that anyone cares, but the report of the treating emergency doctor was just published I which is stated that the traffic jam due to the demonstration did not effect the rescue of the victim.
The fire truck that was stuck in traffic was basically a crane that could have lifted the truck off the biker's leg.
However when the doctor, who was not blocked by the traffic jam, arrived at the scene she immediately discarded that option and instead had the truck drive off the leg.
A firetruck was blocked that could have lifted the truck off the cyclist's leg.
However when the doctor arrived at the scene she decided against this option regardless of the traffic jam, so the stuck fire truck wouldn't have helped unfortunately.
The ensuing traffic jam fails to provide a rescue lane and a fire truck (not an ambulance) gets stuck.
The truck was called to help since the victim was stuck under after the accident.
Activists glued themselves to a traffic sign bridge above the Autobahn.
These are pretty secure so they were not in danger of randomly falling off.
