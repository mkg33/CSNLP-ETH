My parents were Holocaust survivors.
I have an image in my head of my grandparents sitting at their kitchen table in Paris in the 1930’s discussing the events in Germany, and the growing issues in France.
“Are we overreacting?
It’s not that bad.
It can’t get much worse, can it?”.
Is that what we do?
Attack and assault people for their presumed political views?
Do you support assaulting American students wearing hijab because they are presumably pro-Iran?
Criticizing Israel is not antisemitism.
Targeting Jews in general, because of Israel, absolutely is.
I think there are people that attack Israel that do not like Jewish people- it does not mean that legitimate and well deserved criticism of Israel is not valid.
Hating Jewish people because they are Jewish is antisemitism.
Disagreeing with and criticizing Israel for literally stealing the homes of Palestiniens and beating up or executing anyone that gets in their way is not.
In fact one can rightly criticize Israeli citizens directly for these actions, and still not be an antisemite.
Being Jewish does not absolve one from having committed atrocities.
It also does not absolve one from judgement.
The two are often falsely equated, and way too often used to defend or deflect from the actions of Israel.
No, but a lot of people lose that nuance or never had it to begin with and just use “Jew” as a standin and attack Jewish people because they don’t like Israel.
Yes but the antisemitism "about Israel" in the survey is for the most part not actually about Israel.
For example saying American Jews are more loyal to Israel than America is antisemitism.
Saying that Israel is not criticized in the media because of the Jews that control the media is antisemitic.
Saying Israel treats Palestinians the same way the Nazis treated the Jews is antisemitism.
There is a lot of far right antisemitism related to Israel.
There is also a lot of far left antisemitism related to Israel.
But you are right, there is more data here than they are revealing.
They identified 1000/4000 respondents as either right wing or left wing without breaking down how each group responded.
4000 people were surveyed and there seems to only be political data on 1000.
They should be able to tell you how these respondents responded though.
