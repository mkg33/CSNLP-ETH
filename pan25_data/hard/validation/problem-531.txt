What do you think is more important for India?
Giving money to a dictator like Putin or actually helping hundreds of millions of Indians into prosperity?
That's my side as well but it's utopic nonetheless, and sometimes the outcome is profitable, even if that means a dictator or a shitty regime makes money from it.
India would make a huge strategic mistake boycotting Russian ressources but y'all are too focus insulting everyone that doesn't align 100% with your side to see the whole picture.
It's wrong to buy Russian oil, it's a fucking war and the world is leaning on Russia, India is literally just being trash In this choice, be with the world or be greedy, India chose greed nothing else.
Basically this Reddit thread is all westerners saying how it’s wrong morally for india (a country with 1.3 billion people) to buy cheap oil from Russia despite forgetting that the USA themselves buy oil from Saudi, a big suppresser of women’s and basic civil rights.
Honestly all the know it all people here make me sick.
