That's not what they want.
They want the US to send M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine first before they allow Leo's to be sent.
Abrams tanks that will be virtually useless to Ukraine because of their massive fuel consumption, high degree of required specialized systems training, and the need for advanced specialized manufacturing to repair and maintain them.
They're actively hamstringing NATO to preserve their personal reputation with Russia.
Which makes it pretty clear that they just want to go back to doing business with them ASAP.
Could solve this problem real quick.
Germany should approve the tanks, or the US should pull every single one of their troops and pieces of military gear from German territory.
Refuse to contribute a dime to NATO if there's a chance it could be spent on Germany.
All issues that would not exist for the Leo2's, which is why that's what NATO wants to send.
Germany is no better for NATO than Hungary at this point, considering they won't even let other countries send their own stock of Leo2's.
That too is always the case in politics, but I suspect Germany doesn't want Ukraine to win because that would make going back to old normal order much harder in the future.
Also public opinion in Germany is shifting a little again, Ukraine always calling for Germany to do something but never calling for the US to do something seems odd.
