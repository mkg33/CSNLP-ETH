KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine spurned an offer from Russian President Vladimir Putin for a 36-hour ceasefire over Orthodox Christmas, saying there would be no truce until Russia withdraws its invading forces from occupied land.
Ukraine has previously dismissed the prospect of any Russian call for a ceasefire as an attempt by Moscow to secure some respite for its troops, which Ukraine is trying to force from territory Russia seized by force after its invasion last February.
It's a combination of it benefitting Russia much more, as it'd give them time for supplies and regrouping; and the fact that there's very little reason for Ukraine to believe they won't be shooting anyways, since they did during multiple civilian evacuation ceasefires.
Last time russia offered ceasefires in Ukraine for humanitarian corridors they used the opportunity to fire on all the civilians using it to escape.
But Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak tweeted back that Russia "must leave the occupied territories - only then will it have a 'temporary truce'.
Keep hypocrisy to yourself.
