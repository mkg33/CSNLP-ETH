The G-20 is a highly influential forum for the world’s most powerful economies, and South Africa is the only member from the continent, joining multiple participants from Europe, Asia and the Americas.
Biden will make the announcement during next week’s U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washinon, said Judd Devermont, the White House National Security Council’s senior director for African Affairs.
President Biden next week will announce U.S. support for the African Union to become a permanent member of the Group of 20 nations, a step that would give African nations a long-sought prize and could make it easier for Biden to secure their cooperation on issues like Ukraine and climate change.
“It’s past time Africa has permanent seats at the table in international organizations and initiatives,” Devermont said in a statement.
“We need more African voices in international conversations that concern the global economy, democracy and governance, climate change, health, and security.”.
If the UN and other international organizations hope to remain relevant they will have to start reflecting African representation and pursuing African interests.
This makes sense with the expected population boom in Eastern Africa coming this century.
Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to reach 2 billion by mid-century, making it the most populous place on Earth and outstripping even Asia.
