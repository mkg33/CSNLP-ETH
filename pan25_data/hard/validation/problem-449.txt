Crazy rightwing terrorist groups are kicking things into overdrive around the democratic world all at once and Im still wondering why more people arent convinced its Russia trying to divide and conquer.
My theory is that we’ll find groups that push far-right ideologies around the world are using a shared set of anti-democratic techniques pioneered by Russia’s model of managed democracy to bring to power groups that have a strong focus on establishing quid pro quo as their only factor driving policy.
Multiple nations only motivated by self-interest would make isolating authoritarian regimes nigh impossible, as the only deciding factor in establishing foreign policy would be, “What’s in it for me?”.
Appealing to emotion and using arguments from tradition, as well as demonizing the Other, becomes a heady salve to the suffering of those who are evaluating their opinions on things primarily intuitively and/or by how these groups make them feel about themselves.
It’s both overidentification with the group membership as a validator of self worth as well as a literal anger addiction.
These people are behaving like addicts who feel their very experience of self has been invalidated and attacked, refuted even, because being a Bolsonarista has become the primary focus of their identity.
Faced with this existential crisis, violence seems justified as they are evaluating the validity of the election based solely on how they feel about it - which in the media they consume, has become how they evaluate truth.
