No, I haven't paid at all and you really shouldn't have paid.
Instead, take what you would have paid and put it in a savings account and collect 3.4% interest then just pay out of that when they resume.
For 0% interest loans it's always better to save and make the minimum payments instead of paying it off quicker, and here the minimum payment is $0.
Like, take what you're paying monthly and instead lock it into a savings account that you won't touch until they resume.
When they resume you can take that money and do a lump sum payment but you would have been collecting interest on it for three years.
With daily compounded interest through a bank like Ally that's probably at least $1000 free.
But anyway, COVID isn't over yet according to WHO and the US national emergency.
I don't see Biden continuing the pause but instead implementing new repayment plans.
Resuming payments isn’t political suicide for Biden if he has no choice.
It would be political suicide for the Republicans, but they’ve made it so that they can’t lose elections.
