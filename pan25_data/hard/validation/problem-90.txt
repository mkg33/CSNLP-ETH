But the individuals who commit these violent acts will ultimately be indicted on different federal charges â€” hate crimes or weapons possession.
Here's why: Domestic terrorism is defined in the U.S. legal code but it is not codified as a law that can be prosecuted.
According to McCord, domestic terrorism was first defined in the federal code in 1992.
Prior to that period, McCord is doubtful domestic terrorism was even a part the public consciousness or law enforcement radar.
"I don't think people back then were even using that verbiage.
We didn't even have internal terrorism at that time," she said.
I don't get why its so hard for people to call it a domestic terrorist attack.
I dont care if they looked like "terrorists" or they were "normal" people.
They stormed the capitol.
Anyone in that building should be treated as such.
I cant believe the DOJ is being so lenient on people or why there arent more serious charges levied.
Anyone who stepped in there was also guilty of a felony when trump changed that rule to go after BLM protesters who werent even on federal grounds.
Also why hasnt biden pardoned all the BLM people charged with that or were they never?
It seems to go under the radar.
