People volunteer to be the guinea pigs for cancer drugs.
Drugs that have successfully cured cancer in animals and have been approved for human trials.
But guess what?
93% of cancer drugs approved for Phase 1 Human trials FAIL.
If you're a mouse or a monkey, scientists can cure your cancer no problem.
But those miracle drugs don't do shit for humans.
It probably wasn't a volunteer "instead" of animals.
It was probably a test done after animal testing was complete and the product was approved for human trials.
95% of drugs and products tested on animals fail in human trials.
That's why animal testing is stupid and old fashioned.
We have tons of alternatives now that are much more reliable.
And that ninety-five percent of all drugs and products that are shown to be safe and effective in animal tests fail in human trials?
B) Not test them on animals but run the risk of having your product line suddenly pulled and then have to test them anyway.
In the case of animal testing, if you don't like it, then stop buying things from companies and corporations who use animal testing.
Yeah but are they banning selling and purchase of products that was experimented on animals?
Because if they didn't companies will just set up the experiment somewhere else and sell them in canada.
