Disagree, there are a lot of people outside China who are looking to them as being an alternative geostrategic partner to the USA, one who provides equivalent economic/military benefits, but doesn't ask questions about election-rigging and stuff.
Having such an unsophisticated spying program being shot down makes them look foolish and behind the times.
I think that's a large part of the reason they're trying to fake the US having spy balloons over their territory as well, so they can look "on par".
Isn't it more the government knows the public knows they're spy balloons but they themselves can't outright call them spy balloons because of diplomatic whatnots and implications and logistics?
Like, they just outright admitting they do spy on China, but find the accusation of balloons specifically the baffling part.
Part of it is an indirect flex basically saying that they don't need balloons to spy on China which implies that there's something better suited to spying.
The other part is to maintain credibility by being truthful about the spying.
