It's not hard to say what will happen at all.
Even if this makes it past the court system in Illinois, the federal courts will nullify it because it flagrantly T-bones both _Heller_ and _Bruen_.
Furthermore, it will allow the SC to set the precedent that ALL assault weapons bans are unconstitutional because they criminalize guns which are in common use for self-defense and other lawful purposes.
It’s not like the existence of the 2nd amendment stopped previous laws governing ’assault’ weapons or machine guns.
Why even today machine guns remain limited (and ironically many gun enthusiasts would freak if the machine gun registry and ban were dropped tomorrow.
).
Nah, there are plenty of ways to interpret the second amendment, it’s really not that robust, if profits and lobbyist dollars suddenly dried up or went elsewhere, we would see a change, but there’s too much money to be made for people to consider goofy things like public safety or responsibility.
(Do people not realize we’ve had a machine gun ban for ages that everyone seems to be ok with because it’s made registered machine guns a speculators market.
).
I didn’t say this was the be all and end all solution, I said so long as there is profit, the deaths will continue.
