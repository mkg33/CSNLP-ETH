We are only just beginning to learn just how unbalanced the checks on judicial overreach are when a SCOTUS court forgoes any attempt to appear impartial.
They are only answerable to Congress, the same political body which appoints them.
It's a fundamental flaw in the system that can, and probably will, get much worse.
