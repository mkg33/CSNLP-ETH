Glad it has been relatively calm, but it’s disturbing to think that it could escalate even further again.
I am sorry.
Additionally, if this happens, I feel like it’ll tell us a bit about how confident Russia isn’t in terms of taking over more of or holding onto all currently occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia oblast.
On a different note, as you described, it’s wild how Russia accidentally bombed their own people.
Mistakes happen, but it sounds like Russia makes a lot of them (of course, let’s not forget that many of the things Russia does are also intentionally evil).
To me, this Russian fatal friendly fire says a lot about both Russia’s priorities and the skill of their military.
Ugh.
That’d be great.
While Russia will certainly steal everything they can and then some, at least they’ll be out of there.
We won’t have to worry as much about them holding this over Ukraine.
I cannot stress this enough; Ukraine will win.
There is no scenario where they do not.
But there's going to be ebb and flow and being too optimistic sets us up as vulnerable to Russian agitprop when they do pull a local victory or does inflict unexpected losses for Ukraine.
And that is when its imperative we stay behind Ukraine, and keep up support, keep pushing our politicians, keep showing the Ukrainians our love and support, keep donating and don't give in to defaitism and calls for negotiation.
The Ukrainians have chosen to endure, we must not falter a second in our full support.
You are not wrong there.
Obama was a brilliant politician but adversary foreign policy was his weakest point.
He faltered in Syria and he definetly faltered on Crimea and Donbas.
But thats just the US, we in Europe failed every bit as much.
While Russia is pretty much remnants of old USSR stockpiles that has been mostly sold, degraded, rusted, ignored or ill maintained, mixed in with a very meagre cache of newer Russian developments that mostly was short run protoypes.
And Russian troops that are trained to USSR standard, by officers who forgot even the lessons the USSR had learned.
