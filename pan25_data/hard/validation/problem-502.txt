That attack by the Palestinian man was revenge to the Israeli terrorist attack in Jenin a few days before which killed at least 7 people including a women..in one day.
Any ‘military’ can justify their killings and not be called terrorists, because they got the whole media on their side.
Think about it for a second, how easy it is for them kill people and use ‘they’re a terrorist’ as an excuse.
Nothing can be more dehumanizing than that.
You call it a clash, I call it continued ethnic cleansing.
The evidence of that is all over the internet, but if you decide to only consider RIGGED Israeli and American news sources, then I don’t blame you for your ignorance.
Check the Palestinian side of the story from their point of view, and I guarantee you they don’t even have the time and effort to fabricate stories as the occupation side does.
As far as Palestinian is concerned Israel is occupying on their land and Israel of course claim otherwise.
I'm sorry, do you forget the multiple nations that also border them that wants to wipe out Israel?
The only thing stopping them is Israel's military and if they didn't have that you cannot pretend that Palestine wouldn't ally with them to wipe Israel off the map.
But my comment didn’t imply Palestinians shouldn’t have guns.
I said “armed Palestinians” and I also said “armed Israeli soldiers”.
The Palestinians weren’t part of an army, so I didn’t use the word “soldiers”.
But since you’re bringing it up, no I don’t think Palestinians should have guns.
Nor do I think Israelis should have guns.
Nor do I think Americans should have guns.
