This is totally off topic, but my grandmother's maiden name was Zemaitaitis.
I've never come across it anywhere else in the US, so it's kind of cool to come across it here on Reddit.
I honestly don't know how common of a surname it is there.
Oh no!
Well, I'm hopefully not related to that politician and just another one of the other Zemaitaitis families out there.
But I'm hopeful to visit your country some day.
I want to know more about Lithuania and visit the land some of my ancestors hailed from.
it is neither a land of lithuanians, polish or german people.
it is the land of a baltic tribe called prussians, or so called “old-prussians” in the west, since germans killed all the real prussians and called themselved by their name.
lets make it a sovereign state and let them wave goodbye to the poor vodka of russia.
The only brothers are latvians.
These guys are neighbours who like everything the same as we do.
So we like them and fix the pavement together.
but dont forget only 100 years ago they took our living room.
We did.
Cool part is Taiwan shared a semi-conductor recipe with us a couple days before.
It might sound like we did it just because of it but the truth is we just don’t like Russia and their friends.
