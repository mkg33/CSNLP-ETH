It’s almost like rights that aren’t explicitly stated in the constitution should be protected by law, passed by lawmakers, and not left up to a body that’s supposed to determine whether or not laws are constitutional.
So what good would any of the rights in the Constitution do, if the legislature could ignore it and no one could tell them otherwise?
If the rights in the Constitution weren't enforceable, they would be meaningless.
And the only enforcement mechanism that currently exists is that a court can say "Nope, guys, this violates the Constitution, and that outranks a regular old law, so this is void and the courts won't enforce it.
If you want to make that change, you have to pass an amendment.
".
Lmao.
She's actually only in the widest frame photos and videos.
For the most part, you don't see her because she's off screen behind Harris and Dr. Biden with Dianne Feinstein and Sharice Davids.
Haha she is indeed instrumental.
Again, these four Senators put the bill together and got it done.
If she elbowed her way anywhere, she wouldn't be in the back, even behind Feinstein, during the actual signing and the photo ops.
She would at least be fully visible behind Biden throughout like Baldwin and Collins are.
What you're seeing is just everyone getting a chance to shake hands with the President at these things, that's how it goes.
