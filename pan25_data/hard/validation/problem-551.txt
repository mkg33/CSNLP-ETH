Well, that sounds similar to when people ask about 'reverse racism'.
To say that gender is socially constructed (and go ahead and shoot me down for being 'woke', but Simone de Beauvoir came up with this many decades ago....), just like that racism is 'systemic' means it's built into our societal values, and also built in to the way behaviors/actions such as domestic violence/murder are punished (or not - see Russia or conservative Islamic societies).
So that doesn' t mean roles can' t be reversed, it just means that most of the time, for reasons pertaining to these values and the fact that the majority of people adhere to them unconsciously, the roles are not reversed.
Femicide is a thing because in the vast majority of cases it is women being murdered by their partner/ex-partner, not men.
And this is the case because this thing called sexism exists, where one sex is being opressed by the other thanks to a complex and historically robust system of values (beliefs/accepted behaviors).
That doesn't exclude nor is it contradicted by the fact that there may be cases where women kill men!
Does this help at all?
Gender-based violence occurs usually when the man believes the woman has done something that a woman, precisely, is not supposed to do, based on his beliefs about how women, precisely, should behave.
Hence sexist.
Right it certainly can be sexist crime, but I dont think we should always treat it as such.
Wouldn't that be similar to treating all violence between different races as a hate crime?
Could the rate of murders not just be due to physical differences rather than sexism?
Generally speaking, itâ€™d be harder for a woman to kill a man, than the other way around.
