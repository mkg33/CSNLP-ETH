I mean you could just bring up how Trump deliberately turned down even attempting to free Whelan, or the fact that he’s an incredibly shady person that was given a bad conduct discharge from the marines.
Had four passports, a thumb drive of sensitive data, and openly bragged about having contacts in the FSB.
Putin is obviously a notorious compulsive liar and untrustworthy actor, but I think he was serious in saying there will be no deals for Whelan.
Comparing Griner/Whelan is like comparing apples to wrenches.
At the end of the day Biden brought an American citizen back that was otherwise left by the previous administration.
In exchange they released a Soviet era arms trafficker whose sentence was about to end, and whose contacts are going to be long dead, while also very likely being closely monitored by most intelligence agencies.
He was exporting Soviet arms to warlords, it’s not like he’s going to be signing contracts with Northrop Grumman to import arms to Russia.
Is it weird to anyone else that we are giving this guy a limelight when that’s exactly what Russia wants?
Don’t they want to use him as a propaganda piece, and are we going to start seeing constant articles about his opinion now?
