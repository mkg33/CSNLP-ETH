You say a "dog whistle" is something vague, that people "in the know" can understand and then deny hearing.
Let's articulate what is vague and what can be denied hearing, per your definition of a "dog whistle."
It's vague in the sense that to a certain constituency it can be taken literally while denying that literal interpretation.
Hence deny hearing that literal interpretation.
But people "in the know" can perfectly well understand and be in perfect agreement with that literal interpretation while denying they even recognized the existence of that interpretation.
So even by the standards of the definition of "dog whistle" you provided this perfectly well fits as a "dog whistle.
