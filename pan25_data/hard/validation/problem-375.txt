Uranium is common enough, energy dense enough, and can be stretched enough that we have enough for something like millions of years at current energy usage with current technology.
Nuclear energy is one of the cheapest forms of energy once it's up and running and is the only form of energy production where the waste products are properly disposed of.
Nuclear plants in the US are competing with dirt cheap natural gas plants, which is why they require subsidies to operate competitively, just like any other non-gas power source.
You could argue that Nuclear is a renewable given it's possible to build reactors that produce more fissile material than they consume as well as recycle spent fuel into new fuel, and increasingly economical methods of extracting uranium from seawater.
A significant portion of the costs associated with nuclear power have to do with aging reactor designs and limited construction; more widespread adoption of new nuclear plants would drive costs down dramatically, just like it did with solar.
Nuclear energy is just stupid expensive and requires the safe and secure storage of extremely dangerous material for an order of magnitude longer than any human governing entity has ever lasted.
