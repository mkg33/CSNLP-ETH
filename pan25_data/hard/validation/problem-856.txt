United States of America citizens need to change their Walmart mentality.
I will spend an hour finding the product they want.
Give them expert advice on installation.
Then then come back and want the lowest price they found online or will purchase there.
Price is their only concern.
But most of our budgets are built around those prices.
As is our pay.
I'd wager that most Americans don't make enough money to regularly buy non Chinese/Asian products.
Pretty much all the non-food stuff you can buy is made in China -- Just flatly incorrect, you can look up the numbers yourself.
Sanctions won't work.
-- If they don't work at all, then why are we even having this conversation.
They would be useless and have no effect, like they had no effect on Russia and Iran, right?
The only severe consequences that might work would likely be war.
-- Disagree, see other points.
China is deeply dependent upon food and oil imports.
Even a slowdown in the trade of those items could have a drastic effect upon them.
That would disrupt the entire worldwide supply chain ten-fold and hurt businesses here in the US as well.
Whatever is decided will take a multi-factored solution.
