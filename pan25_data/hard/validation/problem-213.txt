I remember reading interviews with Polish volunteers that fought for Ukraine in the first months of the war.
So you were told "you're gonna support the war in other ways so the trained troops can massacre Ukrainians".
It's the trolley problem, except the two options are a) you go to jail for a few years or b) you participate in a war when people are being raped, tortured, and killed.
Well considering these mobilized are given the choice between prison and likely torture for refusing to serve, or go to war but be told their.
If mobilisation came knocking on my doors, I already did choose to either flee or, worst case, go to prison.
I am not a killer to fight in a war of an insane oligarchic thief.
I won't be a killer, I won't go and fight unjust war at behest of corrupt oligarchs.
I have friends in Ukraine with whom we played Pathfinder TRPG before the war, for fuck's sake.
For anyone wondering - our government told people that mobilised conscripts would be used for border security, rear echelon duties, logistics and etc.
