Yup I know a lot of Republican voters who don’t consume any Fox News, Breitbart, AM conservative talk radio or shit in that ballpark.
But they also don’t consume barely any news at all, so when it comes to them talking about politics once a while, I can still tell that Fox News talking points have such a powerful reach that they can reach the masses as they get shared all over our media landscape.
Consider that both things can be true at the once - the “news” has fundamentally changed, maybe for the worse, and that right-wing news has done so in a much more extreme and harmful way.
I think there’s a decent amount of people in this country that genuinely believe “fake news” just means “news that I don’t agree with”.
Bias is more subtle than a lot of people think, you usually can’t see it just from reading or watching (unless it’s egregious), it happens more like what stories they choose to run and not run.
And don’t even get me started on the rights hatred of journalists.
So yes r/conservative all news is biased, but that doesn’t mean it’s all the same level of bias.
That’s the thing conservatives don’t understand, yes all media is bias but that doesn’t mean you can’t trust any media.
You just have to vary your sources and use critical thinking like you said.
Instead they use “all media is bias and lying” as an excuse to only watch media they agree with.
If every news org reports on trump shitting his pants except fox, then clearly the other media companies are colluding and fox is the only one you can trust.
Fox may have privately mocked the Trump conspiracy theories - but they had no problems with publicly distorting the media by publishing Trump bullshit!
And thanks to Fox News, there’s this “prevailing belief” that all news is inherently false/ misleading.
Of course they did, don’t believe these people are idiots.
The low level ones peddling these on Facebook are the rubes but the top level conspiracy spreaders know what they’re doing and get paid to do it.
