Now, I'm not an Ukrainian so take this with gigantic pinch of salt.
Since Minsk1 and Minsk2 were so successful in stopping Russia from seizing additional Ukrainian territory and invading Ukraine after Minsk1 and Minsk2, for Minsk3 to take place, Russia would have to pull back their troops into internationally recognized Russian territory FIRST.
You can't punch someone in the face, break the nose, take the wallet then turn around say "Ok everyone let's just calm down.
I will take the cash.
You can have the wallet.
How about we just go our own separate ways now?
".
Yes.
NATO was in talks with Ukraine past 2014, in reality they started in 2002 under bush.
The point of the article is to try to make people understand that pushing for peace should be a valid option, and that, yes, while Russia has escalated this conflict greatly, both sides pressing hard and not backing down is a bad thing and could easily escalate out of control.
My point in my original comment is that yes, Russia is the reason Minsk 2 fell apart by supplying dpr and lpr with anti air, but at least Minsk 3 would put a pause on the conflict, stop Ukrainian men from dying, and possibly allow for de escalation and an end to the very bloody war.
I agree that Russia is the largest reason that Minsk failed, they supplied some serious weapons to the conflict, but Minsk 3 should be an adequate temporary solution so we can stop poor Ukrainians from dying in the meantime.
The United States should not be using poor Ukrainians to further their own geopolitics, they should be fighting to end the conflict asap.
The Us state department is fooling you into believing Russia need to be existentially destroyed to end this conflict, when in reality all that will do is kill countless more Ukrainians.
