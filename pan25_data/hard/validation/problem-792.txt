The company will lose control over the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special favor given to Walt Disney World by the state in the 1960s.
Instead of Disney choosing the five members of the board, which acts as a county government, the five will be chosen by DeSantisBut the new improvement district will still have the same tax benefits it had before, such as the ability to issue tax-exempt bonds and other measures that have saved the company millions of dollars.
DeSantis gets to say he won against woke Disney, and Disney gets to use its already present lobbying influence to pick board members for the state appointed oversight committee.
My claim is that Disney is still probably going to pick or have massive influence in board members because of their lobbying power.
So the optics end up looking like the state picks members but Disney can back door lobby for whoever they want.
Nothing will change, Disney will operate as it always has and DeSantis gets more momentum for his culture war.
thank god, disney wants to be so much more than just a cartoon company and it literally wont stop until world domination lol.
They have no creative control over the Disney corporation.
All they control is what gets built and where in the parks.
Thereâ€™s no republican CEO.
The content that Disney creates has nothing to do with this.
