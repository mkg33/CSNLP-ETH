What’s even funnier is there doesn’t seem to be a viable route at all right now.
Those hold outs will never vote for him.
The people those hold outs want like Gym Jordan and Andy Biggs are never going to get the majority either.
There will be just as many if not more hold outs there.
They will never do that though since they have pretty much made their platform, “owning the libs”.
Instead they will choose to make America watch their internal dysfunction over and over.
Probably the best way for the GOP to save face right now is to reach across to the Dems and see if they could muster up enough votes between them for someone like Cheney or Kinzinger.
But there only needs to be like 6 Republican defectors to vote with the Dems right?
In fact, they could vote present if they really didn't want to have "voted with Dems" on their record.
As long as Dems could maintain total unity with a compromise candidate, which is certainly not guaranteed.
This is why the dems should support a coalition government with the most moderate republicans.
Get a speaker that isn’t going to support useless investigations and drive home the fact that the far right can’t leverage their small part of a small majority to control congress.
That puts immense pressure on the “never Kevin” caucus and unless they all kneecap themselves politically we would end up with a Dem Speaker.
If roles were reversed without a doubt Republicans would jump on the opportunity to force a rule change vote.
Like a pack of wolves on a 3 legged calf.
Dems could (and should, at this point I think) force a floor vote to change the rules from the Speaker needing 218 to the Speaker elected by simple majority.
You’re right, however apparently they can force a rule change vote to change from a majority to a plurality.
This was done in 1856 after 133 votes over 2 months failed to elect a speaker.
