nato and other have not sent their military because they dont want to escalate to nuclear, and russia is losing ,so the continuing to say that they are fighting nato wich is a way to threaten to escalate.
and they dont know any other option that escalating, or at least threatening to do so.
Ofc, Nato cant back down to the russian threat of escalation because that would be the open door to russia beeing even more of a nuisance in the future, and would also signal to other crazy dictatorships that its open bar as long as you have nukes.
I remember when I thought of Russia as a major fighting super power that needs to be feared, now that the Russians have been exposed as fabricating numbers and power, im highly skeptical of even their nuclear capabilities.
Not saying its something to take lightly, but i dont think they have anywhere near the nukes they say they do.
Ok so this is what NATO was the most afraid of - if they get involved directly there would be a nuke war.
Since they say we are already directly involved, and no nukes were fired, we can really start helping Ukraine directly now.
Check mate pootin!
