Mine too, and I know it’s hypothetical but I feel like those countries would like to go to war with other countries first cough Pakistan.
I still can’t believe China enforced the one child rule.
China had a one child policy for for decades.
If two parents have one kid, the population will half.
China's population will plummet over the next ten years.
China had a one child policy that spanned generations.
It's population is going to HALF and HALF again, and that's optimistic considering that it was girls who were aborted the most.
What impact do you think that will have on the supply chain?
We are still recovering from the pandemic, and that is a speed bump compared to the drop that is about to happen across the rest of the industrial world.
At this point it is down to math, and 3rd world countries with a high birth rate won't do shit for the countries supported by modern technology.
Europe's birth rate is below replacement rate and China kept a one child policy and favored boys for decades.
The population is going to drop drastically over the next decade or two, and will continue for a long time after that.
There is no such thing as overpopulation, we are seeing a decrease and a collapse in the coming decades.
The issue, as noted by OP, is consumption of resources.
