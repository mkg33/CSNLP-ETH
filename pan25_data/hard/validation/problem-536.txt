“We know from the analysis of the right outboard flap found on Kojani Island, Tanzania, that this was not an attempted ditching, where the flaps would normally be extended because the expert analysis showed that the flaps were not extended,” the report says.

The realistic possibility that the landing gear was lowered shows both an active pilot and an attempt to ensure the plane sank as fast as possible after impact,” the report said.

In the above case, the Jetstar was already configured at the 3rd flap position (Flap 2 in Airbus terms) yet they still had very high descent rates that the captain called it out and the FO flying had to take immediate action.
The problem with this analysis is that planes flown by perfectly functioning pilots that were not trying to kill themselves have accidently landed and taken off (almost taken off) with the wrong flap settings.
Here's an article about a JetBlue plane attempting to land with the wrong flap setting.
And also, on a swept wing jet, configuring the wrong flaps is very different than having no flaps at all.
