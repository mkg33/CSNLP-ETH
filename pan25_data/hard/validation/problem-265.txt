"Hong Kong, China has been a WTO member since 1 January 1995 and a member of GATT since 23 April 1986.
".
Yes there is.
You need to have independent sovereignty to be a member of the WTO.
Hong Kong used to be sovereign, and now they are not.
I never said they needed to be a democracy, but China destroying their democracy proves that HK is not independent and therefore they deserve zero recognition under the WTO.
Irrelevant.
The US does not need to wait for China to blow up HK's trade rules, just like China didn't need to wait until 2050 to blow up HK's democracy even though they agreed to.
In your mind, how does the US requiring a suit made in Hong Kong be labeled as 'made in China' make the US more secure?
And yes - please explain how requiring a suit to be labeled 'made in China' protects the US yet the US placed no restrictions on actually importing goods in Hong Kong.
If the US wanted to be more secure, why don't they just ban goods from Hong Kong that are a security threat instead of changing labelling requirements?
Do you really need me to explain to you why trade relations between the US and China are a security concern for either country?
HK and China are the same thing, sorry, no insultingly stupid loopholes will be allowed.
Go on, ask China if HK is a part of China.
The suit is made in China, so it should be labelled as made in China.
You don't get to have your cake and eat it too, if China wanted HK to retain its special status then they should have kept their grubby hands off of it like they said they would.
