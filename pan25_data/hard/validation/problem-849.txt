Not in the primaries though, and that is one of the things that the crazies in the GOP have done effectively.
They've either primary'd out a lot of your purple Republicans who would swing on a debt ceiling vote, or scared the ones that remain with the threat of a primary.
Theyâ€™re going to fail to find the government and probably push for a default, though Biden will probably be able to cite the constitution to avoid the latter.
They will try but with Democratic Senate protecting US, it is only the Debt Limit vote that gives them any leverage.
The Democratic Senate can stop most of it but US needs to prepare now for the GOP shutting down the government via the debt limit votes.
So when there is the vote to raise the debt ceiling this fall, all house democrats would vote for it and a previous comment mentioned only 6 or 7 Republicans would be needed to vote for it.
So then it seems the far right Republicans that were such a hassle in the speaker vote are powerless because the democrats don't need their votes, only 6 or 7 of the most moderate Republicans.
Is this correct?
If so, why are they making such a big deal about the far right Republicans?
