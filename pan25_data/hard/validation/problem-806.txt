It really is everywhere.
Every single fucking diocese they investigate has rape so rampant it’s almost like they have dedicated personnel for it.
were dedicated career rapists and abusers.
They were filming it for commercial sale, and passing children around with gold crosses to mark them as particularly rapeable.
In every single diocese in Pennsylvania, they were raping kids, filming it, and selling the videos.
You say not all churches?
Evidence says otherwise.
Holy shit get them OUT.
How can you look at headline after headline of kids getting raped in Catholic institutions on an industrial scale and brush it off cause it’s just nuns?
So what’s the magical number of kids raped and molested and abused before we get to burn down churches and force religious leaders to come clean ?
Well if you recall I believe two years ago in the US when multiple Catholic priests were arrested, many had a claimed that their sexual abuse was “an encounter with God”.
Years ago I remember learning that catholic clergy as a group were slightly less likely to engage in abuse than the general population.
In other words, grab ten priests and ten people you know and the odds of a predator amongst the folks you know would be slightly higher.
