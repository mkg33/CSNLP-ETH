Bullshit.
Luka sold his country to the devil to save his own ass.
Remember that he called Daddy Putin for help to be rescued from the 2020 Belarus protests after his own people were tired of his dictatorship.
Putin "helped", alright, but Putin's help has a habit of not leaving after overextending its welcome.
The "Russian invasion" Luka talks about already happened, Luka just surrendered without firing a shot.
Putin tried pulling the same shit in Kazakhstan in early 2022, until he was kicked out by China (the irony... even Xi is tired of Putin's imperialist aggression.
).
If Ukraine so far manages to push Russia back, imagine how much better the war would have went for it, had Belarus allied with Ukraine in a united front against Russia, rather than directly support Putin with territory and weapons (and possibly soldiers, too, now that Putin grabs Luka harder and harder by the balls.)
The West would have also been even more supportive from day 1, because it'd be clear Putin is going after Eastern Europe as a whole, rather than just "one country full of Nazis" as his propaganda claims.
So, fuck Luka.
He has no moral high ground.
He didn't get friendly with Russia to save Belarus, he did it to save himself, condemning his country to invasion and oppression in the process.
He apparently wants to be a Russian General but hasn't involved the Belarusian army in Putin's war of frustration.
What if, and I know its a big IF because he really does chew shit for fun, but what if Lukashenko cradles Putin's balls for the good of his own country.
Man, I love these quotes from Lukashenko, at just a glance you can see how contradictory they are and how full of shit they are.
Lukashenko said that his country is with Russia, but "as a sovereign and independent state," adding that it controls its own territory.
If your country must do everything Russia wants you to do like a good little pet, are you really a "sovereign and independent state"?
So you have all these Russian traditions, Russian support and Russian language inside your country and a veneration for the Russian state, but on the outside you're still a sovereign country.
To me that sounds like a puppet, because on the inside you have a hand filling your interior and being controlled by a larger body elsewhere, but the outside appearance can look like something else entirely.
