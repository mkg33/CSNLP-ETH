And yet at the same time, we apparently can’t hold politicians accountable for silly little things like blatant fraud, because “well, they all lie, so you’d have to arrest all of them” gotta love that doublespeak 🙄.
Right.
I guess my thing is, maybe it’s time to tailor our approach to the real world that we actually live in, not the idealistic one that people wish existed.
And then there’s the unspoken truth that if he were a Democrat, he would have been forced to resign by now, investigations would be pending, etc.
Ok, so you catch him before he takes office, yet still nothing is done and he will continue forward as a “typical” politician that lies, cheats and steals for a career.
I don't think we can hold Republicans accountable for anything because the people who elect them don't even care if they lie, cheat, or steal, as long as it's their team that's doing it.
In the real world we have people like Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, who stood in front of a podium and brazenly lied to the country on a daily basis for her entire tenure as Trump's press secretary, being elected as governor of Arkansas.
And people like George Santos, who apparently lies so much that we should probably make sure that his actual name is even what he says it is.
(In Santos’s case, he may have chosen to lie because the truth would be harder to communicate to “outsiders,” and it would be harder to spin as being “pro-business.”).
