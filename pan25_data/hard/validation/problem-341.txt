No ambition and inept.
I’ll keep voting for them because I’m obviously not going to vote for the ones who want us to be a theocracy, but it’s painful how tactless the modern Democratic Party is.
This was a giant PR/campaigning opportunity, and the Dems did nothing but sit there and giggle about how dumb the Republicans look.
Who cares about the reality of the situation - most voters would just remember democrats actively reached across the aisle to try and break up partisanship.
Regardless of it not being realistic, it is embarrassing for the Democrats to have not thrown some sort of compromise candidate into the mix.
You're disappointed in Democrats because they didn't indulge in what you acknowledge is a fantasy?
Blowing smoke up the American public's ass with a fake deal is the golden PR opportunity they should have taken?
If they had followed your advice, somebody else would be in here complaining that Democrats are engaging in cynical political theater instead of wisely allowing their opponent's mistakes to take center stage.
And they'd be right in the same way that you're right; it looks true if you squint.
