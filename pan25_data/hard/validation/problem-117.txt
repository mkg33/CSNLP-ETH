I understand the respect fighter pilots have for Hartmann.
Still, that's not the smartest call-sign choice when Russia is still pushing the "Invade to free Ukraine from Nazis" bullshit.
I have always told people from the start that Ukraine would not be a push over in this war.
I firmly believed and still do that Ukraine has a spirit of staying independent and that is why Russia attacked Ukraine first before all of the other countries because it was trying to show it could "crush a strong country".
That being said, I think people cling to Zelenskyy the strenh of Ukraine because he has shown the Ukrainian spirit.
Is he the source of the spirit?
Absolutely not.
However, when there were offers of evacuation and he says "I need bullets and weapons not a ride", it really shows that spirit.
He is more of the spirit that can be easily pointed to by supporters trying to justify more support such as visiting Kherson days after the withdrawal by Russian troops, visiting soldiers who are wounded (largely symbolic but it shows he knows of their sacrifice), and staying in Kyiv during the attempted attack on it.
He shows that Ukraine is willing to fight on especially given the fact that he can largely walk around without threats of assassination from his own people (see Putin for contrast).
That is because most countries had a policy of keeping most pilots who were high scoring on the front lines.
The USA and I think the UK had a policy of shifting them back to be teachers for the next recruits.
The front line strategy looks more impressive, but the rotational strategy is more effective as a skilled pilot might get 100 kills but could teach 500 pilots just as easily to get 10 kills each.
