I submitted a (n almost certainly pointless) comment on the White House website saying this.
If an industry with regular old labor problems is both fragile enough to fail and important enough to crash the national economy then it needs to be nationalized.
The rest of us shouldn't suffer every time some CEO decides to treat their workers like crap.
What these fucking C-level assholes don't seem to understand is that giving your employees time off when they are sick is a GOOD thing.
If that same employee comes in to work sick and spreads the illness around the office then you have the chance for everyone in the office getting sick and now you have multiple employees missing several days of work each.
If 1 employee gets sick and stays home until it runs its' course then 1 employee is out for 5-10 days.
Heck, my job itself permits me only 15 days of PTO a year (to be used for illness, vacation, anything.
It's a pool) I have to give 48 hours notice to take a day off -I cannot call out.
I've asked what if I get sick - "call out ahead of time."
3 non-consecutives call outs in a year = termination.
Anecdotal venting - I'm a therapist in a big American city, my clients are primarily folks with commercial insurance.
We constantly ask why mental illness is such a problem in our society - we should include our work life in this discussion.
The top issue I run into is burn-out.
People are overworked, have almost no vacation days, and are all but told not to take sick days or limit them.
How do you provide therapy for someone who comes in with anxiety and depression who is working 13 hour days, 7 days a week, with an always-on-call work cell phone?
There is only so much coping skills can do.
