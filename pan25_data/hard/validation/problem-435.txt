Can't they just say that this change, a governor appointed board, voids the original agreement and the state has to take over Reedy Creek with the debt.
I don't think that would make the politicians happy.
Not even that, they are supplanting the board with hand picked people and trying to leave everything else in place , so they don't have to assume the debt.
On paper Reedy Creek still exists attached to Disney.
Reedy creek is the same thing for Disney.
Disney paid taxes to it and in return got services and infrastructure built.
You probably live in a county/city/town and pay taxes to that jurisdiction.
And, some of those taxes are used to develop the land, and run services in your jurisdiction.
The proposed change is that the people who run this jurisdiction will no longer be appointed by the tax payers of the jurisdiction and will instead be appointed by the state.
Reedy Creek now remains exactly the same but instead of having its board members be appointed by Disney they are now appointed by the Governor.
