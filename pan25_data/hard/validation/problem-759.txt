Pfft.
Even with the most extreme ruling possible, they are no longer in a strong enough position in state legislatures to overturn a Presidential election, and when you look at how their internal divisions are now starting to cost them control of legislative chambers even when they hold majorities of seats, I think their position will only weaken further.
As I said, their internal factions are at each other’s throats and they’ve just lost — or come very close to losing — a quite a few “safe” districts on gerrymandered maps, and this during a year that should have been a walkover.
Gerrymandering only works up to a certain point, and when realignments happen we shouldn’t cling to old assumptions when there is plenty of evidence that they no longer hold.
And the Supreme Court would have to worry about Democratic gerrymanders, too, and what could be done with them.
I worry that the predictions of a "narrow" ruling are off and that the Supreme Court was only acting the way they were to appear impartial.
I don't think it's wise to look at one ruling and assume how the Court would vote on an entirely different issue.
This court was designed by McConnell to dismantle abortion rights, something the right has been working on for 50 years, and it did exactly that.
That doesn't necessarily mean that the same court will say "what if we just like, ended democracy all together?".
That's not what this court was crafted to do, and unlike abortion, it hasn't been a hot button political issue or something the right has been fighting for for half a century.
So if the supreme court is forward looking enough, it would realise that letting the republicans prevail in this case isn't within their own interests.
Smashing through checks and balances and it's gonna be the end to democracy and the end of the supreme court's power.
I don't see them doing that unless they don't realise the issues that can of worms that they let out.
