not even including the wounded, its mind blowing that a modern country is losing so many people every day.
The US army trains 50-60k soldiers a year.
Last year they fell short of their goals at 45k trainees.
If ukraines numbers are accurate enough, Russia has had a KIA equal to 3x the annual US army training for 2022.
9x losses if you include a 2 to 1 wounded to kill ratio.
No wonder Russia is having to snatch people off the streets and you know they are not getting even close to adequate training.
In Ukraines case it makes sense since they are playing defense to exhaust the russians that are desperate for gains.
As for russia they stopped making sense a long time ago.
You could make a similar argument about Kharkiv why dont they try and capture that instead of Bakhmut.
But it begs the question of why Russia would go ham on Bakhmut?
Why not commit those forces to the South (with a bit more effort than they did with Vuhledar) to try and create a buffer between the zero line and their fragile supply lines?
There's definitely formal a team of people within the military who are dedicated to counting and reporting all of Russia's losses, including materiel.
And they would definitely err on the side of caution to avoid overstating the achievements of the UA and coming up against forces they thought were liquidated.
