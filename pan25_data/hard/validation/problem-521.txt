Yes, African Wild Asses are critically endangered.
Read the article; these arenâ€™t just domestic donkeys.
Various donkey and ass species in Africa get processed for hides and other byproducts and sold to parts of Europe or SEA (especially Thailand) due to their value in traditional medicines where the information about the source is laundered and they are sold globally.
Donkey products can be used in some cases in the United States; however, because they are not considered food and fiber animals there are fewer regulations documenting medications that have been used in them, including drug residues which can kill humans.
The US Center for Contemporary Equine Studies is suing Amazon for selling products containing a donkey derivative, despite efforts from advocacy groups to halt the practice.
The lawsuit claims the e-commerce giant is illegally selling products that contain "Ejiao" a gelatin made from the skin of donkeys and used in various products like health supplements - in violation of California animal welfare law.
According to the Brooke USA Foundation, a group fighting against Amazon in support of donkey welfare, ejiao acts as &amp;quot;a hard gel that can be dissolved in hot water or alcohol to be used in food or drink, or in beauty products such as face creams.&amp;quot; Some advocacy groups and consumers claim companies are deceptively using the substance, contributing to the slaughter and skinning of millions of donkeys a year.
And I quote, "According to The Pegasus Foundation, an organization advocating to ban donkey hide products, an estimated 8 to 10 million donkeys are killed and skinned each year to meet demand for ejiao.
".
Since donkeys are not endangered (40M+ population in the world), there shouldn't be a problem eating them then, according to your logic.
Good that we clear that up.
Just eat the non-endangered kinds, and may be captured some and domesticate them.
Problem solved.
And yes, it is no big deal.
