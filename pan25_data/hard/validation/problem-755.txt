So why the fuck are they citing a mossad study?
Don’t they realize implying they’ve read a mossad study will make people want to fact check that claim?
Do you really think that a random Redditor will be able to produce a Mossad study that supports such a ridiculous claim?
Multiple people have asked them to provide a source and they haven't.
I am calling out the upper comment saying they've viewed Mossad documents and studies that prove this and that that is why Irael continued the practice.
Link to these Mossad studies you're talking about?
Mossad is know for being remarkably tight lipped about things so I'd love for you to actually be able to prove what you're saying as I'm highly skeptical of your comment.
I'd say it's because they're just making a very lazy lie.
Shabak is the organization that deals with terror/Palestinian conflict and Mossad tends to deal more with geopolitical issues than the Palestinian/Israel conflict.
If there was a study on what they're claiming it would 99% of the time be done by Shabak.
If the study they're talking about is real, it wouldn't be publicly available as it would be inarguable proof that Israel is acting in bad faith and attempting to further the conflict.
