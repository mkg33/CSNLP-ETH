I’ve always been baffled by the fact that a dude can register as a Republican a year before he runs for President, and then accuse people who’ve been in the party for 30+ years as not being Republican because they disagree with him.
Oh I know he’s a loon.
And I want to make it clear that I don’t agree with the Republican Party today or its pre-2015 values.
But it’s still weird to me that a person who’d been been a “Reaganite” Republican voter for decades could suddenly agree with the guy who just joined that someone like a Cheney or Romney isn’t actually a “real” Republican.
LMAO at Romney trying to make it out like Trump isn’t the prototypical contemporary Republican.
Trump IS the GOP, that much has been made abundantly clear, however much the more tepid traitors in the RepubliKKKan Party might try to distance themselves from him.
The GOP went whole hog on Trump and one need only look at the years of evidence about how much the rest of them covered for, and defended him, to see how in sync they all are in his sedition and bigotry.
