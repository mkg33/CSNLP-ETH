This is more a play to secure a neoliberal ideology as the future of the party than anything else.
They know they’re at risk of losing ground to progressives, that’s why they’re shoring up their defenses.
The DNC is making this the first stop of the primaries because they now see it as a safe place to give corporate Dems an early boost.
If they start in a place like California or NY then they run the real risk of progressives becoming front runners with an insurmountable lead.
Yeah, the media effectively declared a Biden win despite South Carolina not being reflective of the electorate.
Anyone claiming that the South Carolina primary isn’t reflective of the electorate should keep in mind that South Carolina picked the democratic nominee, and ultimately the president in 2020, while Biden came in fifth in the New Hampshire primary.
Anyone claiming that the South Carolina primary isn't reflective of the electorate..... despite South Carolina not being reflective of the electorate.
Well which is it?
Neoliberalism\ becomes the future of the Democratic party?
Oh hell no.
