One possibility is a retiring Republican moderate from Michigan.
Why?
Think the more moderate northeastern and suburban wings of the Republicans are getting sick of losing ….
I’m going to guess the major GOP donors get involved to prevent [further] disaster on the right (probably threaten being primaried or if applicable, funding a recall), … but it would be devilish fun if the Democrats helped elect a speaker alongside moderate Republicans.
Doomsday isn't that they'd fail but still have a Republican speaker, doomsday is that they'd fail so hard the alternative is that some Republicans join the Democrats for someone like Angie Craig for speaker.
It's "doomsday" because it signals that the Republican house caucus can't come together to do even the simple task of selecting a speaker between them.
That's a big deal, because it means irreconcilable differences.
It also means probably further division in the future when dealing with basic housekeeping bills.
If your party controls a house in congress then your party should also be able to select a leader.
Being able to do that is pretty bad in a rare way.
(Also using AOC here is a bad example because a lot of her branding is being uncompromising.
Republicans would probably be willing to work with moderate dems who talk the bipartisanship game).
100% the Democrats should be working with the moderate Republicans to elect a moderate speaker.
Hopefully then some fair legislation can be passed over the next two years.
Someone from the bipartisan problem solvers caucus would be a good choice.
