Which is still a weird thing for Republicans to attack him about.
There are only 4 years between Trump and Biden.
Next election, Trump will be as old as Biden was at the last one.
If he makes it a full term, great, the new VP can then be the nominee for 2028.
But he can't just ignore people's concerns about it.
Honestly, the problem isn't him, it's Harris.
She's not pulling any weight as VP and has proven to be a mistake.
Biden needs to replace her as VP in 2024 with a strong candidate that can potentially act as his successor if and when the time comes.
I hope we can at least agree that itâ€™s good Biden was elected as opposed to the only other possible outcome.
You can feel free to disagree of course but I read it as Biden's leadership was not the driving force in this election.
The better than expected results from this midterm isn't because of Biden and people being in love with his leadership and Democrats and Biden would be wise to recognize that.
Biden can eye roll all he wants but I'm in the 2/3's camp.
If he ends up the candidate, I'll vote for him but if there's a primary I'll give the opponents a listen.
I would even put it up to primaries, have Biden pick his choice of 3-4 candidates and let Dems vote for the next VP.
Great way to get people engaged and electrify the base for 2024.
