Milo, there's a First Baptist of Nowhere, Indiana out there waiting for you with... eh, more of a back pat situation than open arms, but still.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA so before posting I was like "wait is he gay?"
and I honestly didn't know he considers himself "ex-gay" fuck me that's great, spot on.
They only let him at the pulpit for special announcements and during special events.
His pic in any church bulletin is gonna be one of him in a baggy t-shirt during a charity event because it's the "safest" photo they have of him, even though it's much less formal than other staff photos.
He'd fit the bill so perfectly omg.
THAT PHOTO it's giving such "tertiary minister at a Baptist church where the congregation can't tell whether he's closeted gay or just cares about style trends way more than the rest of them.
".
This.
I see no trace of la cultura in that Nick loser.
His last name doesn’t mean shit.
His name could be even more Latino, like Nicolas Arturo Fuentes-Garcia and he’d still not be Latino because the culture isn’t in him.
He’s a fascist racist American.
