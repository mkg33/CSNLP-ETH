But no more.
If my people are out in the streets fighting and dying, the least I could do is talk about it and deliver their message.
Fuck this regime.
Fuck what they've done to our people.
Fuck what they've done to our perception across the globe.
Fuck them for getting rich while they beat the blood for the poor.
The Islamic Republic's enemy is not the US or Israel, it is their own citizens.
It always has been.
It's why until this movement, everybody in my life or family, no matter where in the world we lived outside of Iran, was silent about this regime in public.
Because they literally watch what those of us in the diaspora say.
And none of us could ever return if we said anything openly critical of them.
This government does not give notice when they kill you.
They just kill you.
So when 227 out of 290 members of parliament say Iranians should be punished with the harshest means possible - a government that executed the second highest number of people in 2017-2020 in the world according to deathpenaltyinfo.org - yes it is effectively a mass death sentence.
Hypothetically, I wonder how many of the Iranian officials who said that all the protesters should be sentenced to death, would have to be killed before the others changed their minds.
