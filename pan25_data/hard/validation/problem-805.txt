He Jeffries doesn't even need their votes - he just needs enough (10?)
Republicans to not vote, either by just not bothering to show up some day, or by abstaining.
And eventually, but vote 26 or so, a full dozen Republicans are either physically absent.
Now it’s a tie, but Boebert shows up drunk on the big day and votes for Trump instead.
Jeffries wins.
One of my Star Trek meme groups had a moderator post “please hold off on Damar memes for now” and I was super confused until I eventually realized that the football player who got hurt happened to be named after a character from Deep Space Nine.
That has basically been their strategy for the last 40 years, and it’s been working.
Where I live in West Virginia, people vote for Republicans not because they don’t believe in the policy ideals that the Democrats have to offer but because they don’t trust the government to competently accomplish anything, and the reason they feel that way is because Republicans have been going very far out of their way for the last several decades to prove the fact that government can’t function.
Those voters don't understand the government at all and don't try to, nearly all of their knowledge is based on the fact that a lot of politicians lie and therefore they believe all government is bad.
Many republicans that “starving the beast” aka not funding the government or just having it be so distunctional people defund it is the answer.
Also there are a lot of narcissists and idiots involved.
So it’s kinda hard to predict where it will go because if everyone is acting in self interest hard to track who wants what.
