BMW was testing this in car engines wayyyy back when I was a little VW nut.
I'm not an engineer but I think the project didnt work because the infrastructure to install hydrogen pumps...everywhere was too much.
Part of the problem with hydrogen as a straight fuel is that the infrastructure to contain it is a problem.
Gaseous hydrogen is extremely difficult to keep contained, it just sort of oozes through most kinds of seals used to hold it in.
Plus, gaseous hydrogen isn't very power dense relative to liquid hydrogen, but if you try to handle liquid hydrogen, you have all sorts of new problems relating to dealing with a cryogenic fluid.
Another problem is packaging - a Hydrogen tank capable of storing enough H2 to rival petrol in volumetric energy density would not only have to be extremely high pressure, but would also have to be cylindrical/spherical to be worthwhile.
Those sort of shapes are difficult to package into a car.
Wing tanks work for liquid fuels that aren't held at pressure - they can be any shape they want.
But H2 tanks suitable for flight, i.e.
both lightweight and high pressure to contain similar volumetric energy density as liquid fuel, need to be cylindrical or spherical.
These are very difficult to package into any vehicle, let alone a commercial plane.
It is in commercial aviation.
The tank volume plus boil off make it difficult to close the system design.
Rolls just modded an engine to run on a different fuel and got it to run on a sea level test stand.
It's not anywhere in the vicinity of the future of flight.
