That's me.
Work a full time job, still can't afford any place decent.
Meanwhile, landlording is so profitable that large companies are making it a priority to buy up housing.
Thinking that's not right makes me the jerk, somehow.
The "just build more housing" thing doesn't pass the sniff test.
It couldn't hurt, but rent is raising faster than the population.
In other words, this is driven by greed, not demand.
I am very skeptical that increasing the supply will cause the landlords to take a profit cut and lower rent.
If you think of it only from the "buy" perspective, companies buying homes to rent out hurts, but this actually adds rental supply and thus lowers rent prices (relative to what they would have been).
However, rent is still increasing, because we have a general shortage of housing.
Housing prices are only increasing due to a shortage.
There's tons of research on the strong relationship between vacancy rates and prices, between new construction and prices.
(More building = lower prices).
But the places with cheap houses also have lower income rates.
It's not the dollar amount, it's the balance between cost and income levels that's screwed up.
