About 90% of the civil engineering jobs advertised in the UK are not paying enough wages for me to even consider applying for them.
The low wages are across the board.
In the first paragraph of the article it explains this is mostly in low skilled jobs.
Non EU migration to the UK requires either sponsorship, family ties or highly specialised industry areas.
UK got alot of EU migration for things like working in hospitality, working farms, and alot of manual labour.
These are all considered low skilled jobs and are causing a gap in the workforce.
We can get Dr's and scientists in easy enough, that's not where the issue is.
Let me put it a different way : if you hire 100 doctors, who's going to clean the toilet?
We get alot of skilled migration - that's what you see in the numbers .
We don't get enough unskilled migration (previously temporary workers).
A skilled person isn't going to migrate to do manual labour in a field.
It only applies to future retirees here too.
It's been planned to raise to 67 2028, 68 by 2037 or 2044 (unclear if the plan to bring it forward 8 years has been formally accepted yet).
No one I know has any expectation of retiring.
Hmm I should clarify, I and most people I know dont expect to get to retire because we expect to die before its possible.
Given living costs we would not be financially able to retire before a state pension, and given there's talks about raising it to 75, the majority of us will die before it's possible.
That doesn't mean we will be quiet being worked until death though.
