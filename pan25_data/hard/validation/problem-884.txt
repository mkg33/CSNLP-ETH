Honestly, the contracting system is pretty broken regardless.
That all being said, I don’t appreciate being talked down to.
Do you have experience with government contracting?
It’s the free market.
Contractors are selling their services to the US government.
The customer can ask contractors do things a certain way.
They can refuse if they don’t want to, but the customer then doesn’t have to continue buying services from them after any preexisting contracts are completed.
The point I made is that there is a difference between customer requirements for a service rendered and forcing a company to abandon the way it does all of its business in order to secure a specific contract.
And then republicans go about pushing their requirements that entire corporations abandon their actions and investments in order to get a contract.
Dems want contractors to follow rules WHILE doing business that affects how they deliver services only to the government while republicans demand companies adhere in total to an ideology even if it is not affecting the service paid for by the government.
