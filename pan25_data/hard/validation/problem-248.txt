“The way they soften up the support for this kind of violence is essentially by making it seem morally justified in the minds of people who believe this,” Caraballo said.
“The way they do this is by constantly painting LGBT people as pedophiles and groomers, and so people feel morally justified in carrying out this violence.”.
If true, a self loathing LGBTQ is fed by the very same rhetoric by the right wing, the disgusting rhetoric is still disgusting and feeding this violence.
This sort of misinformation when intentionally spread has the same effect as all of the hateful right-wing rhetoric that also demonizes trans people.
As far as I know, no motive has been publicly announced but that certainly isn't stopping their rhetoric that normalizes violence against LGBTQ+ individuals and anyone else they perceive as others.
Are you arguing that right wing rhetoric impacts people in the LGBTQ+ community any less than in a cisgender heteronormative community?
If anything, I think it might impact them more than any group other than the people who actually believe the right wing opinion programming is news.
