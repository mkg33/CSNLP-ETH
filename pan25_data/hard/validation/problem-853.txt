For all those less in the know, all ballistic missiles beyond a certain range, are hypersonic due to their exoatmospheric flight which allows them to easily accelerate without any interruption.
A hypersonic ballistic missile is a missile that follows a ballistic trajectory at high values of mach.
If you just want to the missile to go very fast in a ballistic trajectory, you literally just need a round nosecone.
You only care about aerodynamics if you want the missiles to maneuver after the terminal stage - a feat only very, very few top end missiles can claim to do.
But yeah ballistic missiles have been hypersonic and much longer range for most ppls entire lives and much faster than the short range hypersonic cruise missiles in the news lately.
Making expensive fast missiles with shorter range that fly lower paths isn't really all that useful since they will be impractical due to coats and minimal need for such speed.
It's far more useful to just make missiles in much higher volume and cheaper costs that can be used in a wider variety of launch platforms.
Iranian Shahed drones/missiles are cheap, they cost like $20,000 compared to Russia's cheapest $300,000 missiles.
According to British military, they have maximum range of 1,500 miles and can be launched 5 at a time so even if 1 or 2 get's intercepted it still can go through.
Iranian "government" might be pathetic but their weapons manufacturers are not bad at all considering the sanctions and them having all the parts made locally.
