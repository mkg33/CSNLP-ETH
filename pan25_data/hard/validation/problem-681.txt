Acetaldehyde is carcinogenic in humans.
[42][43] In 1988 the International Agency for Research on Cancer stated, "There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of acetaldehyde (the major metabolite of ethanol) in experimental animals.
"[44] In October 2009 the International Agency for Research on Cancer updated the classification of acetaldehyde stating that acetaldehyde included in and generated endogenously from alcoholic beverages is a Group I human carcinogen.
[45] In addition, acetaldehyde is damaging to DNA[46] and causes abnormal muscle development as it binds to proteins.
[47].
Are they actively high?
Did you test their memory before and after being a regular user with an approved memory test?
Did you do the same with executive function?
Did you then test alcohol as well?
Or is all of this just anecdotal?
Yea it’s anecdotal.
You’re right.
But I do find it particularly interesting that of all those I know who are regular consumers happen to be showing behavioural changes that are seen backed up by research.
You also failed to acknowledge that my observations were not just observations alone, but also the evidence that was backed up by research that is publicly available.
If you want to do your own Google searches on the topic be my guest.
There’s plenty of research you can read up on.
On the other side, I find it interesting that you’re going after me when the original poster has used a blanket statement that it is good for the brain.
Is it really though?
Everyone I know who smokes pot has had an increasingly impaired memory and weakened executive functioning.
I’d say it’s quite the opposite.
