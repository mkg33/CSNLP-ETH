Every single retirement strategy I make has the assumption that anything I didn't start myself (so social security, job benefits, etc) is gonna be looted to the ground before I can draw on it.
I save everything I can for retirement because I know that social security is getting mugged at every opportunity.
I have a severely disabled son and I have to leave means for him to live after I can't take care of him any more.
If I save aggrresively enough, there's a tipping point where I will likely die with more money than I retired with due to interest accumulating.
in spite of paying in for all my adult life, I doubt I'll survive to be able to draw against it when it is time to retire because scumbags will have emptied the coffers or set the retirement age to be past the average life expectancy.
Same here.
I am vested in a pension that I assume won't be there, and have been saving 30% of my income overall towards retirement.
with all of the retirement calculator tools I always assume worst case and then save even more than that.
