With this deal, Poland is basically upgrading their tank factories from building Russian era tanks to fully modern, bona fide western style main battle tanks.
Something they cannot do with German tanks because the Germans are unwilling to transfer technology and potentially create a rival tank builder.
These Polish/Korean K2's will eventually replace the aging German Leopards.
And together with the American Abrams, will make up the vast majority of Poland's tanks.
And even if the Abrams tanks become a burden, Ukraine could just park them in a depot and not use them.
There's a lot of M60A3s still in service around the world, trade some weapons for the most serviceable ones and send them to Ukraine.
One country you could make a deal with would be Taiwan, they have 800 M60A3s in still in service.
Send them a few hundred Abrams tanks for the 800 M60s and send them to Ukraine ASAP.
Several other countries are sending tanks to Ukraine.
Several Eastern/Central European countries that are closer to Russia (and far more likely to be nuked) are sending Soviet era tanks.
The UK is sending Challenger 2s.
And France is sending light "tanks".
