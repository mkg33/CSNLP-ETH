There’s “encouragement” from the other side too.
The kind of encouragement that nudges you by posting your home address and harassing you in public for not being loyal enough to the dear leader.
This is what populism is for Republican supporters, intimidation and threats of violence to extract the desired behaviors from politicians.
It encourages moderate republicans to try to distance themselves from their more extreme compatriots.
It's Dems driving a wedge into the republican party and encouraging discord within the GOP.
Do not make the mistake of thinking the Democratic leadership and entrenched status quo are some genuine "resistance" to the GOP as a whole.
These are their buddies.
This is not to both-sides as if the Democrats are actively engaging in fascism, but Democratic leadership's head is in the fucking sand and desperate to try and pretend like Trump is some anomaly and not just what the GOP is with the mask off.
... you're forgetting the part where that other party is embracing fascist ideals and trying to to usurp our democracy because they are putting their party over country.
Why don't you take your own advice and actually watch media outlets that don't match your right wing opinion?
Because it's quite obvious that your only watching outlets that echo your political beliefs, and not the facts.
So I shall throw your words back at you, you are not doing yourself any favors by watching media who only confirms your beliefs.
