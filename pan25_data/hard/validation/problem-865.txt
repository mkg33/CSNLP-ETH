Which is why center-left must unite, form a coherent message people can understand and earn trust.
As opposed to Avoda-Meretz fiasco or Raam's "let me talk to my (real criminal) field commanders before I consider a vote", and here-and-there Gantz - who under different circumstances might've been a very good figurehead as far as security is concerned.
Also, let's give it to him, he keeps it on track.
I mean Likud, Shas, Yehudat haTora - they are around since forever, and their objectives - whatever they are - didn't change.
As to the centrist parties (which is our hope to form a coalition) - I can't even keep track of what they are called, let alone of what their position is.
The major parties won't form a coalition together, so the governing party is whichever one can make the best offer to all of the special interest parties.
The last few governments have even had a rotating cabinet and even rotating prime ministers in the same coalition.
And when they do, it really only lasts until the other party can negotiate a better offer.
That's why they've had five different coalitions in three years.
Israel uses an unusual form of government, proportional representation, where a party that gets 5% of the vote gets 5% of the seats.
But Israeli politics is very close.
Any one interest group can shift the balance of power.
So Netanyahu is basically beholden to a bunch of freaky weird caucuses with a mix of far right racial and religious politics, and the opposition can only win power by getting some traditional right wing allies to agree to a power sharing agreement with parties dedicated to Palestinian rights.
I understand proportional representation has some fans, but it's very obviously failing to produce a stable government in Israel.
