The US spends far more per person on healthcare than other nations with far superior health systems.
It's not the spending that's holding back the US healthcare system, it's the design.
Yeah but it's "some" corruption, not "overwhelming" corruption.
The West is far more transparent on many military costs/spendings and the 800 forms that need to be filled out to requisition anything makes it far far harder for corruption to get anywhere near Russian levels.
While cost overrun may be a corruption problem, it's still much less severe than those countries' because transparency is the best weapon against it.
If you know where to look you can find all the spending the military was and on what, down to every washing machine in the bases, every AC unit, probably even the fucking bedsheets.
Just go look up what the military pays for a screw driver or nuts and bolts, or toilet paper, not fancy high tech stuff plain old crap.
The western military pays way above market value for anything and everything and the money will fill the pockets of everyone involved.
You win those contracts by being the "lowest responsible and responsive bidder".
Usually the "cost-plus" model is used.
With this model, it's not just a guaranteed percentage of profit (say 10% of the total contract volume) for the contractor, it also means that the contractor earns MORE if they work less efficient (aka more hours).
