Notice how Morocco doesn't even deny it, they're just angry that they were put in the spotlight.
Typical for authoritarian regimes i guess.
Don't fall for their propaganda tricks.
The EU isn't selective, they've called out Algeria in the past as well.
Morocco is deflecting from themselves, it's just political posturing.
Except the EU has called out Algeria on its deteriorating freedom of press conditions several times in the past.
"It's double standard/but what about that other country, they do it too" is usually just a way from the country in question to deflect.
Also it's a non-binding resolution, the EU didn't pass or enforce a law.
It's just a resolution that formally recognizes the current state of press freedoms in Morocco.
That said, the media freedom in Morocco is definitely a serious issue and vital, though it is mostly internal.
The second part isn't really realistic under the current situation.
There is high tension between the countries and every bit of information is used against the other in an information war.
For example, despite Algeria loving football, they hid Morocco's name when detailing the World Cup matches on national TV, even when talking about the matches Morocco played.
Like Morocco did not exist, which is an insane level of bitterness.
That's just the tip of the iceberg of relentless daily informational aggression from all their media towards the country.
You can imagine Russian trolls and media spreading fakes, well Algeria does the same and it's intense.
