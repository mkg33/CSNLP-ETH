Heat seeking weapons don't give any warning.
You might be able to spot the missile launch, but will have no warning prior to that, and only seconds if you spot the launch.
Radar based weapons will give a warning in STT mode this is the one you know from movies, etc.
In STT mode the launch radar is basically behaving like a spotlight aimed right at the target, and the targets RWR (radar warning receiver) will notice that and warn the pilot(s).
Older radar based weapons like the Sparrow need constant illumination of the target.
However, modern radar based weapons can also be guided in TWS (track while scan).
In this mode, the search radar is still scanning the sky for other targets, so the targeted aircraft won't see a change in behaviour and doesn't know it's been locked.
The aircraft's RWR will know that there's a radar searching in the area which it will relay to the pilot, but the pilot will have to make a judgement call as to whether they're under attack or not.
They'll only get a warning when the inbound missile goes 'pitbull' - which means it's turned on its own radar for terminal guidance.
That only happens when the missile is close to its target, so the defending pilot won't get much warning.
There is, but it doesn’t automatically mean the other side is about to fling a missile at you or fill the air around you with steel.
It just means they have that option if they decide to.
There’s a bunch of information you can get by listening for radar emissions that aren’t yours.
If you’ve just been pinged once or twice then you know they know you exist, but they aren’t that fussed.
If you’re being lit up multiple times a second by high powered radar then you know someone is taking a very strong interest, but you don’t know what their next move is.
