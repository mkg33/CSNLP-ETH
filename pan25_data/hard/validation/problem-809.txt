Yet again, I don't even think you do have to engage them at all: the drop in living standards should be enough to let them know that maybe it was not one of the best decisions.
Hell, they don't even have to say that they changed their mind but just do better decisions when voting.
One would hope that if another vote came up people wouldn't double down on their stupidity... provided they realize it's stupid.
I wouldn't want to give them any positive feedback on their idiotic decision that might make them think they deserve praise for their mistakes.
Or point out that all the consequences of Brexit make continuing support of it idiotic.
You certainly shouldn't expect compliments for the people who decided they were better off leaving the trade union with all of their biggest partners.
If we discuss it they will just hear a bunch of reasons why their decision was bad.
What you seem to want is for the fragile snowflakes to get a participation trophy for being dumb so their ego doesn't implode.
