Setting aside this stupid law for a second, I actually don’t know which would be easier to maintain in an apocalypse.
But the point that you can fuck with the carb and points (two systems btw, diesels don’t need) is kind of the point.
With an electric vehicle, there is so many computer parts, it’s insane.
There are components to monitor the charging, components to ensure the back is balanced, components that ensure the batteries don’t go bellow freezing, etc.
an ICE is a dinosaur comparatively.
Good news for repairing electric cars today, if a component goes bad, you just replace the black box.
But if that happens with out a supply chain, you’re SOL, kind of like how GM and Ford have had cars sitting on the lots for a year because of the last chip shortage (and that shortage also delayed electric vehicle production too).
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I don’t know.
I think you can make biodiesel at home, but I’ve never done it and I’m basing it off the first Google search result under “homemade biodiesel.” I didn’t even read the article, I just saw the Google info lmao.
Biodiesel is a reasonable choice, because you can indeed make it at home, but you'll need a steady supply of methanol and lye.
Definitely manageable--you'll want the lye for soap-making anyway, and you can use the same still for grain alcohol as for wood alcohol--but not trivial.
Also, I'm not sure whether the process works with animal fats (since they're solid at room temp), and if not it gets a little trickier to supply in reasonable quantities.
If you're not growing olives, you might be SOL.
