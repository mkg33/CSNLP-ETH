Are they gonna prevent intermediary canadian companies from buying the homes FOR foreigners?
Because if the 6% foreign ownership statistic in the article is true, this won't change jack shit.
And at 6% foreign concentration in BC as an example, it won’t do much for your average home buyer with regard to prices.
How can it not be easy to get around when you can just find domestic intermediaries to invest through?
All you’re really gonna do is drive foreign ownership underground and make it harder to track.
It does seem like this is just going to drive foreign ownership underground and make it harder to track.
Without actually changing the prices in the hardest hit areas all that much.
I’d be happy to be wrong but I doubt it.
We have the same problem in the US these days especially in major metro areas.
No one has seriously proposed banning foreign purchasers because it doesn’t have much hope of succeeding at changing home prices.
The point is to stop the local property prices from increasing from foreign buyers.
Foreign by definition is non-Canadian here.
Personally i think the foreign investors arent the issue, most data shows in metro areas they make up 2-5% of buyers which is tiny, and probably of some higher end luxury builds anyways.
People just like to rail against foreign looking people as their neighbourhoods change, most of these buyers are either immigrant permanent residents or actual citizens,they just look different.
Essentially if foreign buyers are the real culprits, this comes much too late.
And if my theory is correct, house prices will not drop much bc economically no one can afford it, and citizens will prop up the market.
If prices fall then it will be because of a recession, and nobody is winning there.
Its just symbolic gesturing for the population + some small probability of upside.
