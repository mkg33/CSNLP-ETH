Speaking of problems.
We need to Federalize school lunch programs, and guarantee every kid in this country gets a free lunch.
A healthy free lunch.
It's criminal that we haven't addressed this in this country.
Maybe it is because we've had programs in the past but I'm sure there are more kids that have food insecurity these days then 20 or 30 years ago.
And something I figured out on here is that if some kids are getting free lunches and other kids aren't, there will be bullying about this.
Jesus fuck this is such a no-brainer.
This is the kind of bread and butter shit the Democrats should be running on.
Republicans are shitty people, but they are masters at turning the tides against them back on the source.
Remember when "fake news" was used to talk about ACTUAL fake news, like Alex Jones and Sean Hannity?
Now Republicans have used it so much, suddenly EVERYTHING is fake news, and it has lost its meaning.
I think that's the goal.
Trump was impeached twice, so Republicans are going to try to impeach Biden like 6 times or something so he has the "record" for most impeachments ever that no other president will ever top.
Republicans have been trying to make this stick against Biden for years, yet already said it's worthy of impeachment.
Wouldn't it be prudent for there to be an investigation, and actually finding evidence of wrong doing on Biden's part, before claiming that it was something he should be impeached for?
before this is done he's going to demand three backdated impeachments from when biden was obamas VP, so he can say he wasn't the first to get impeached multiple times.
Also, by doing that, it basically makes it so impeachment is no longer a viable tool to reprimand a president since it's basically meaningless, so future Republican presidents can do whatever they want and when they get impeached, everyone will just roll their eyes and say "Oh, this again?
So what?
It's just petty politics.
