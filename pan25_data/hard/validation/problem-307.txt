After decades of these kinds or attacks Israel continued to move further right.
Moving steadily away from the two state solution they had long pushed for.
This is the result.
Israelis see little reason to even attempt peace when this is what they can expect.
I don't think peace was ever really on the table on the Palestinian side.
The factions demanding the complete destruction of Israel have always prevented any compromise solution.
The 2000 Camp David Summit was a summit meeting at Camp David between United States president Bill Clinton, Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat.
No deal.
The Nobel Peace Prize for 1994 went to, in alphabetical order, to Yasir Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East.
Ultimately, Arafat refused the deal because he could not get support from the Palestinian people.
The 1978 Egyptâ€“Israel peace treaty was a breakthrough.
Signed by Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin as the result of negotiations organized by US Presudent Jimmy Carter.
No deal with the Palestinians was possible, but it did ease tensions.
