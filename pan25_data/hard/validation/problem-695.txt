"Non-rounded object that generates lift via lighter air or other gases inside than outside the object".
Could be.
A metallic skin would potentially be more durable in case of a rough trip across the ocean, and be able to handle a higher pressure differential -- and thus more lift from a smaller balloon.
to traverse an ocean you'll probably need to underfill it and put less weight on it, or larger balloon and have the same lifting capacity with lower pressure.
they're sent up in the early morning and that either happens every morning or every set period (can't remember) edit: 12h.
the weather balloon packages are tiny and expendable therefore can be lost if someone doesn't find them.
Many will be spy balloons, garbage, mundane things, but many will not, theres always that other category ðŸ˜‰.
Pilots, both military and commercial are raising their concerns as many have had run ins with objects that definitley are not stationary.
Planes are rarely damaged but the craft seem to, fuck with, the flight crews quite a bit.
