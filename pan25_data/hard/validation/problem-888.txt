Not what I said.
So I’m going to ignore the rest of your comment where you rant about something I didn’t say, and instead ask why you think that subconsciously associating “the west” with whiteness is racist?
Why would it be racist to subconsciously associate “the west” with whiteness?
At the moment I’m most concerned with why you felt I was accusing anyone of racism, when I wasn’t.
It wasn’t implied or intended.
You are offended over something you decided I meant.
There’s no reason why.
There’s no way to include greece and rome as the origin of western civilization that can exclude egypt.
That’s unintuitive to most people because they associate “the west” with whiteness.
It’s not racist that they have that association, it’s just historically inaccurate.
The underhanded accusation of racism you piled on top just made it just that extra bit more anglocentric and rather arrogant.
I’m not trying to turn anything you said into an accusation of racism.
Certainly not “another” because I haven’t done so previously.
I’m asking a simple question.
Why won’t you answer?
