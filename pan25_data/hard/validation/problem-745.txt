This is my thought as well.
I don't think Walker is a popular candidate, and I think those that voted for him were largely just there to vote for Kemp, and couldn't stomach giving anyone but a Republican their vote for Senate.
If it is the difference between 50 and 51 Democratic Senators, I think Warnock wins by 5 or more because no Kemp on the card and the people willing to vote for Walker to ensure Republican control in the Senate but can't stand him won't go vote.
If those that voted Libertarian thought anything like 2016-me, there is nothing that'd motivate them to show up and vote for Walker in a run-off against Warnock, even if it means Dems retain the Senate (especially since the GOP basically already won the House).
Republicans like to imagine that the libertarians would default to Walker, but if they're motivated to show up and vote 3rd party in a close election, they're not going to bother voting at all with a runoff when the third party is not on the ballot.
I live in GA, so I can definitely explain to you how Walker has a chance...almost all of my republican "friends" (in quotations bc the relationships are very strained) didn't vote for Walker or the third party candidate.
They either skipped it or wrote-in someone else's name in protest.
These were younger voters (40 & under).
All of the older people voted for Walker.
So here's why that's important, and this is more than anecdotal, bc I've heard several political analysts toot the same horn of warning: If control of the Senate comes down to the outcome of GA's runoff, then every Republican in the state is going to vote for Walker, no matter how much they dislike him (bc they fear for their lives if democrats are in power, and I mean, literally, they think the world will go to hell).
And despite the fact that GA is purple, there is real voter suppression on the democratic side and a shit-ton of people, who normally don't vote, but will vote Republican in the runoff to "save real Americans & babies"...they'll be coming out of the woods in frightening numbers like zombies, and the sad fact is those votes will outnumber the Democrats, who will be hardpressed to find more voters than they have, bc it's one thing to scare poor people into voting against their interest, and an entirely different thing to educate them in only a month's time.
So seriously, I'd curb your expectations, at the very least, but still hope for the best... we will do our best to win, so wish us luck!
You don't have to worry about Democrats in Georgia being unmotivated.
I guarantee that, bc we don't lack the will to fight or vote.
We've turned Georgia purple in recent years, so please give credit where credit is due...the actual problem we face involves voter suppression laws, gerrymandering of districts, and the fact that the state is nearly equally matched in its political division.
Walker isn't popular, no, but Republicans will vote for him if the Senate is on the line...I'm really hoping that it won't be, bc it's basically a coin toss as to who will win (and depends entirely upon the will of Republican voters to turnout, not Democrats, bc technically they outnumber us in all areas outside of Atlanta).
There is always the risk though, that Walker seeming like such an unlikely win, makes Dem voters overly optimistic, and less driven to vote, and Walker wins due to low turn-out.
Voters in Georgia need to remain vigilant and motivated.
