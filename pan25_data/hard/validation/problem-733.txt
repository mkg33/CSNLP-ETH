I remember watching that play out live back when I would still watch the news on occasion.
I was so depressed at the outcome because I thought that the secularists were actually making a strong move for control of the government.
But then it all fizzled out in just a couple of hours.
So I’m happy to see this headline and I think the Turkish people have a lot to contribute to the world without the yoke of religious oppression.
Which is wild because any abroad living Turk I’ve met HATES Erdoğan, but these are all young progressive people, so I imagine the support comes from the older traditional crowd.
And its good to add that Erdogan is losing every election when taking only the In Turkey votes, but the diaspora massively votes for him.
82% of around 4 millions turks voting in Europe voted Erdogan despite not living in the country, im always blown away by that fact.
If they are voting for Erdogan they aren't nationalists, since Erdogan isn't but the opposition is.
Erdogan is an islamist.
That doesn't mean he doesn't deny the armenian genocide, but it does mean the first unedited books by Armenian authors that included the genocide and/or their fleeing from it were published after he took power.
They don't like the nationalists, the current opposition, which may be a reason they left, they probably don't hate the concept of Turkey if they continue to vote.
Voting is mandatory in Turkey, and you have to pay a fine of some sort if you don’t show up; so the majority of the country does vote, but that doesn’t mean they all have concrete political opinions.
