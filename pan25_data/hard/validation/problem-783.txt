Lol bullshit.
No one goes to jail in Russia or China for dancing and they are without a doubt strictly authoritarian.
There's levels.
And religion takes things to a whole new one.
Thatâ€™s a different kind of cult.
That started as a cult of personality around Mao.
Quite typical of communist dictatorships to replace the original local cult(s) with a cult of personality.
Same difference.
I have no issues with faith, but putting a name on it and framing it within a non-democratic organization opens it up for exploitation, just like they were designed to be.
Religions are just personality cults around personas that can no longer die and thus render themselves useless as tools of oppression.
Reducing Religions to "just personality cults" is disingenuous to the history of faith based structures of thought through history.
I have personally had many "supernatural experiences", though I would not use those words.
I call it "The Experience".
I have the benefit of living in a modern society where I have many tools at my disposal to provide context to my experiences.
In attempting to describe it to myself, I began to find many references to what I was seeing and experiencing in religious texts.
I believe humans through history have had The Experience and have attempted to describe it through the iconography of their time.
Or in some cases, like Akhenaten, just coming up with their own, new religion.
Some Religions are that way, not all of them.
Even when you do frame it within a democratic organization it opens it up to exploitation and corruption.
