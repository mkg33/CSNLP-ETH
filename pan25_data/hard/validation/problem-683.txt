All they have is Democrat leadership saying please don't post dick pics.
Big fucking deal.
All the idiots eat it up.
Kinda funny.
Republicans dangle the dirt carrot for the mouth breather republican voters, they'll float a date out or some code name and it gets people going.
Then when the date comes, they'll just push another date out or another story.
It works every time.
How does it feel to be led by the nose by Steve fucking Bannon, who by the way, looks like a diseased wart on Trump's tiny mushroom dick.
You mean like how Steve Bannon has never denied being 5 lizards in a skin suit that loves to smell Donald Trump's farts.
I mean people are saying it, so it must be true.
What you do is make a big deal out of true, but pointless, stuff.
Then link it to scandalous or illegal made up stuff.
Put of bunch of hacked stuff on a random computer.
Some of the content is true and verifiable.
Insist it’s hunters laptop (unproven and probably bullshit).
Insert a bunch of fake incriminating stuff.
The dick pics are great, because it makes it seem like private stuff on a personal computer.
And we know it’s impossible for people’s data (especially celebrities and other high profile people) to be hacked and exposed /s.
So must all be hunters stuff and it’s so incriminating for….
His dad, who didn’t do anything illegal and possibly wasn’t even involved at all in any of the alleged activity.
But, oh why the cover-up and all that….
Because it’s all slanderous staged BS.
