And while we're at it, when can we start tracing back contact across social networks, from each inciter to the next and find the source?
This should not be rocket science, it's fairly old and well-understood data science, but it appears nobody in law enforcement or intelligence is making these connections.
Utter dereliction of duty.
So when can we begin to have the discussion that western european christian rightwing fascism is just as bad if not worse than middle-eastern muslim terrorism?
No, their scope was comparing “middle easter muslim” extremism to “european christian rightwing fascism”.
To say the actions by Christian fascism is worse than what we have seen from the middle east is a laughably bad take.
i agree with what you are saying, however to call christian rightwing facism worst than middle-eastern terrorism is a bit of a strecth.
Daesh were beheading people, throwing transgenders off roofs, raping women & conquering territory.
All this has yet to come from rightwing extremists.
