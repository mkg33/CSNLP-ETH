Which is part of why Iâ€™m hoping this creepo hangs in there and pollutes the GOP House for the next two years.
He may be, but is he more evil due to knowing how to work the system to get the results the GOP have been clawing for decades.
If you ask me who is more nefarious; Trump or Ryan and I will tell you it is Ryan or any GOP member who is willingly to hurt this country to fluff their own pockets.
It's sad when Republicans who used to represent the ultimate of Republican scumbaggery, like Paul Ryan, are now the principled voices of ethics and reason in comparison to the current crop.
Isn't it weird how all these Republican politicians seem to rediscover their balls and their principles the very minute they leave politics?
It's almost like they have no identifiable principles that they're prepared to stand by when it matters, but love to grandstand and virtue-signal when they no longer have any skin in the game, just like... well, just like they're constantly accusing Democrats and the left of doing.
