I'm as anti-gun as can be, but to address the violence problem in the US you need to address all of it, simply banning guns for instance would definitely help a lot, but I'm increasingly convinced it's far from being enough.
I agree with your first part, i think more than simply banning guns there needs to be a cultural shift from being "ok" people die as long as it's not you/yours/your property, to respecting human lives and others.
And given Trump's popularity over the past 6 years, it's clear there's a good amount of americans who have zero compassion and empathy.
These people will find a way to murder if it's "convenient" for them, even without guns.
However, I agree with you in the US it's definitely a huge factor and it should be addressed.
But it can't be only gun control.
Switzerland, I believe Serbia and Canada also have guns.
Not to the level of the US of course, they're far ahead of everyone in that respect.
However their gun deaths are through the roof proportionally, which means it's not just a gun issue.
Guns are a serious problem in America.
I understand the whole "having a gun empowers me" point of view, but with power comes responsibility.
Gun ownership is in dire need of better laws.
