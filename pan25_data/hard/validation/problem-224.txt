The ACA is a great example of party differences - it insured millions while saving the government money.
Republicans tried like 60 times to repeal it which would increase the deficit and leave millions uninsured.
They don’t give a shit about governing.
Edit: since this has blown up, please vote for a Dem in your next election to help stop this shit.
If they’re not left enough, vote in your primary as well.
Write your current and desired representatives to help them understand your beliefs.
Also consider volunteering and donating to the candidates that best represent your ideology so they have a better chance at winning, or joining local activists groups to try and pressure politicians to change.
They’ve never passed fiscally responsible legislation.
Republican policy has been responsible for a huge portion of our deficit increase - increased military spending, tax cuts for wealthy people, and unfunded bills.
Increasing the deficit gives them justification to cut social services.
They’re already planning on cuts to SS and Medicare.. probably to “reduce the deficit.”.
The Republicans will be super budget hawks when it comes time to pass the appropriations bill and they want to savagely cut medicare and social assistance.
They will likely play the government shutdown game to get it done.
They need to take a cue from the GOP on this, unfortunately, and never shut up about it.
Asked an unrelated question in an interview?
The GOP is trying to raise the deficit.
What’s your tax policy?
Fight the GOP approach of aiding tax cheats.
What time is it?
It’s time to tell your representative not to help redistribute wealth to the rich!
Repeat repeat repeat.
