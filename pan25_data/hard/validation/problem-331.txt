"The Wyoming Republican Party is seeking to kill a bill working its way through the state Legislature proposing to raise the state's legal marriage age to 16, arguing that putting "arbitrary" limits on child marriage interferes with parental rights and religious liberty.
".
Yep.
Children are not people, they are property, lumps of clay to be molded.
They must never be allowed to have their own agency or will, any showing of either will result in a punishment that dehumanizes and traumatizes into obedience.
They need to be indoctrinated that might makes right, that they will always need to listen to someone stronger, with more authority than they will ever be granted.
They even treat their adult children like they are still young enough to be hit.
They pressure for your career and childbearing, they withhold based on what decisions you’ve made they don’t like.
Conservatives MUST be willing and able to believe two things at once.
It’s how they can throw blood on a woman entering an abortion clinic but sneak their daughter on through the back.
It’s how they can have a gay brother but also think that gay people are pedo.
Unless the parents bring their kids to a family friend drag show, then they are pedophiles who are grooming kids to be gay.
Sick, yet not unexpected from a party of pedophiles.
You would think they would be smart enough to at least avoid the optics of this, but nope... they double down yet again and want to marry children.
