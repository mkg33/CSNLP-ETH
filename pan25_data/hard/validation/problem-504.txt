You have your mandatory Lithuanian classes, followed with mandatory English classes.
At (I believe, been a while) 6th grade (12-13 y.o.)
you are supposed to pick up a 3rd language.
It is mostly a toss-up between Russian and German or if your school is posh enough, French followed up with really rarely Spanish.
Majority of the pupils take Russian because everyone takes Russian (herd mentality, you don't want to sit in class without your friends) and because smaller towns with smaller schools wouldn't even have a teacher of another language in the first place.
Also kids are "slightly" motivated by their parents, because majority of them know Russian to a good degree of fluency, therefore can assist with homework and whatnot.
Russian is being selected not because young people are interested in learning Russian, its because there are no other alternatives that would be "logical" to a child.
I myself nearly chosen Russian when I was growing up, solely because of the fact the majority of my friends/classmates took Russian.
According to the Russian world view native Russian speakers are Russians, even if they have never lived in the borders of the Russian state.
It is the preview, therefore of the Russian state to firstly protect them, and secondly expand the borders of Russia to fit as needed.
Because everyone knows the more people in your country who see themselves as Russian the more likely Russia is to invade.
I'm sure there were a lot of Russian speakers before the invasion of Ukraine but there are a lot more in Kazakhstan now due to the exodus from Russia during the mobilization.
One of the flimsy excuses Russia used as a reason for invading the sovereign nation of Ukraine was "to protect Russian speakers" from some imagined genocide.
Thus, it's important for other neighboring countries to not allow the language to be taught in school, lest they suffer the same fate.
