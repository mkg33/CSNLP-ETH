No one likes Sinema.
She's too Democrat for Republicans, and she's too much of a liar for Democrats.
Who, exactly, is supposed to want to vote for her?
Sinema will attract more voters who already voted against her than she will lose voters who voted for her.
What would make you think Sinema would pull Republican votes when they didn't vote for her last time?
Also, why would Sinema run a republican?
She is choosing not to caucus with them, which isn't exactly putting her in their good graces.
They can’t really primary her now that she’s no longer a democrat.
Which is probably a big reason she left the party.
Because she knew a primary challenge was coming and she’d lose.
Basically she’s all but guaranteed that a Republican wins her seat in 2024.
Neither conservatives nor liberals like her so she likely can’t win a 1:1 race against the GOP, but if a dem runs against her in 2024 as well, she’ll split just enough of the vote to ensure they both lose.
What is most likely is running a Dem - even a moderate Democrat - will likely peel of a good chunk of Sinema’s support, but not all of it.
Unhappy Sinema R’s will vote R, and the R will win.
A progressive will almost certainly guarantee a R win.
