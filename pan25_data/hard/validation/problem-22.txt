It is OK to hate a Jewish politician or government.
But it's not OK to hate them just because they are Jewish.
Only by their acts may they be judged.
Ridiculous.
There is a Jewish lobby.
AIPAC is a Jewish lobby.
There's a drug industry lobby called PHRMA.
K Street in DC is filled with lobbyists of every imaginable and some unimaginable causes.
The problem arises when lobbyists use illegal methods or otherwise violate the law (and I am not saying the Jewish lobby has done so).
AIPAC is not "the jewish lobby", it's an Israeli lobby, "the jewish lobby" comments were just an extension of antisemitic conspiracies on how jews control the world.
Anyway is the term 'jewish lobby' anti semetic by itself or is it just the general context it usually gets used in?
Miloon Kothari, one of three members of the UNHRC’s Commission of Inquiry on Israel, had said in a public interview that social media was largely controlled by the “Jewish lobby.”.
America and Europe, one of them subjugated by the Jewish Lobby, and the other by the sense of guilt about the Holocaust remain on the sidelines.”.
