Did Donald Trump intentionally hoard documents that he knew he shouldn't have?
Yes.
Did he lie about it?
Yes.
Did Joe Biden do the same - intentionally hoarding documents and then lying about it?
I see nothing that suggests that is the case.
It does appear that someone, either VP Biden or a staffer, was careless and made a mistake somewhere along the line.
It also appears that the right things were done once the mistake was discovered, which is what led to discovering additional documents.
No search warrant was needed.
The Biden administration has always been run 'by the book' (sometimes annoyingly so), so it's highly unlikely that this was in any way intentional.
It's not even clear if it was Joe Biden himself that stored the documents.
Simply put, Biden is showing that he can be trusted to do the right thing and Trump proved he cannot be.
It is not a gift for Trump.
Biden is showing what one should do when this happens.
Trump tried to lie his way out of having intentionally taken some extremely sensitive documents.
Trump even declared the documents at Mar-a-Lago his personal property, then lied and said the FBI planted them there, and later tried to assert that he declassified them “with his mind”.
Trump, on the other hand, lied, signed false statements saying he had no more when he did, took hundreds of documents including highly sensitive nuclear secrets, and refused to return them when asked.
This is very different from a person who accidentally commingled some documents and promptly returned them upon discovery.
