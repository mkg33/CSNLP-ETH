Do you think that we should allow nazi flags?
Or would europeans be too outraged to allow nazi flags flown throughout Europe?
Muslims think that this is hypocritical and racist.
European nations are capable of understanding why flying a nazi flag can be a sensitive issue, because it directly affects them.
But they ignore the burning of Quran, because it doesnt affect them.
And on top of that they ask other people to not be offended by it.
And burning the Quran is a symbol of all those crusades, etc.
It implies that you dont want Islam and muslims to exist.
Quran burners are right wing bigots that want to show their hate and agitate muslims.
I never said or implied anything about it being ok that muslims overreact over Quran burning, some of you guys made that up and get at me for it lol.
The point is that yes, you can burn the Quran and you can burn the books of any religion or any discipline.
So Muslims arenâ€™t being especially prosecuted, the law is fair.
Also i am not even Muslim , i act like one because abroad it doesn't matter i still get treated like Muslim by edgelords like you.
