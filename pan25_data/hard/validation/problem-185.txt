Uhhh PT ruled Brazil during the majority of the last decades and they are socialists / communists.... in fact the commodities production peaked during LuLas and Dilma rule (I was working there).
Nothing to do with capitalism, this is just pure greed and corruption that happen in many many countries worldwide and where most of them are the opposite from being capitalists.
Late stage capitalism definition comes from the Marxist point of view.
In you definition basically every country in the world is capitalist even the ones that have socialist or communist political systems (even Cuba have private business).
Yeah, capitalism is literally just "an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit", according to Oxford Languages.
Even if you include the presence of free market competition in the definition of capitalism, monopolies and oligarchical rule can very easily occur in a perfectly free market without any regulation to prevent it.
