Weird, seeing how Zionism was widely a leftist position with the socialist Labor Party dominating Israel's politics to basically the late 90s.
Palestinians have been saying this for 70 years and people like Ehud Barak just pretended that it was antisemitism instead of a genuine description of Israeli politics.
At this point I am worried if Israel is not already stuck in a self-perpetuating cycle of right-radicalisation.
I really hope it is not, and that it is just a temporary weakness of the pro-peace majority.
I would argue that it has less to do with Zionism itself, but rather with the failure to achieve peace.
The continuing violence causes the populace to move to the right, the right eventually gets into power, and has no reason to solve the violence, since they only gain from it.
You repeat that for some time, and eventually you end up with fascism.
Zionism does not necessarily mean "violently taking over all the land we can".
Obviously it can, and it does mean that for some, but I do not see a reason why the two-state solution should not satisfy Zionism's goals.
Zionism is compatible with a two state solution, therefore I don't agree at all that the current situation is the logical conclusion of Zionism.
Had the peace talks in the 90s and early 2000s been successful, we'd be in a very different reality, fully not fascist and fully compatible with Zionism.
The reason we are where we are is because fascism is the logical conclusion of a prolonged, slow cooked hopeless conflict.
Israelis aren't only the one getting more militant and extreme, so are the Palestinians, the process unfortunately works both ways.
