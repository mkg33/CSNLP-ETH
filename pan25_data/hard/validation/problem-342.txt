Let’s keep in mind a lot of this aid is part of a military budget.

Maybe not that much but it’s a lot.
Sure, it does.
While Trump is in Ohio visiting Americans in need, Biden is in Ukraine checking on the progress of our proxy war with Russia.
Not that I think Trump would have stopped Putin if he was re-elected, but I do doubt that Putin would have invaded at all.
I’m pretty sure we can all agree that Trump would have taken a more drastic approach to respond to Putin invading and we’d be balls deep in a much worse conflict than we are already, but again, Putin wouldn’t have invaded if Trump was in office.
That Obama regulation everyone wants to point at that Trump undid…wouldn’t have applied to the type of train and chemicals on board the Ohio train.

Yeah, probably...but it's a little sophomoric to make such statements.
It was published by dailybeast, so basically red meat.
