Maybe the DOJ was specifically waiting on the referral and is already planning to make some big move (even if it isn't necessarily outright arresting Trump) within a few days or even immediately after getting the referral.
Supposedly it's going to be "insurrection" and "conspiracy to defraud the United States".
I just saw this on another comment on a different post so I'm not 100% sure.
But it seems likely.
Maybe?
The FBI and DOJ are already collecting evidence to pursue charges for his harboring of TS/SCI and NDI documents.
I could see them adding this to the pile of charges.
This is the final hearing which means they will be pushing the charges with the heaps of evidence they've collected over the last 2 years.
Trump isn't getting away with it.
Hey, cases take a long time to build.
Specifically the type they've been compiling where they have compiled every single event that occurred that day to the second to back their charges.
Not a single prior-president has been charged like this before.
It's a first for American history, so it's a process.
