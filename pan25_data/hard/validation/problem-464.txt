I went to a speaking event hosted by one of the guys they're calling a terrorist.
Former editor of the Daily Zaman.
Guy isn't a terrorist let a lone a radical by any stretch of the imagination.
Just a run of the mill editor/journalist.
But hey, maybe I'm misinformed.
Maybe Turkey was also right to arrest the Turkish head of Amnesty International for terrorism.
Maybe Amnesty International is also a terrorist organisation, because they suggested his arrest was a travesty of justice.
Absurd, really.
Daily Zaman has(e: had?)
something like half a million readers.
Mainstream paper, used to support AKP but became critical of Erdogan.
Well, we know Erdogan has very thin skin and no respect for freedom of speech, so his reactions are as predictable as they are sad.
Sweden and Finland are light years ahead of Turkey in development, democracy, and human rights.
The Biden administration needs to step up and do what it takes to end this nonsense.
Yes, Turkey is strategically important, but the West is strong enough that it would still get along just fine without a Turkey that continues to regress.
So long as there's not actual armed conflict between the two major geographical areas that Turkey straddles...
Yes.
But if there ever was (and for some reason the USAF couldn't dissuade the situation from coming to tactial movements) turkey plays a key role.
