The unwritten agreement for many years was the farmers could hire undocumented workers who would move from farm to farm as needed for the season.
At the end of the season, these workers could be suddenly caught and transported back to Mexico on the government tab, where they could spend the rest of the year with family back home.
The farmer could then complain about "illegals taking American jobs" and vote republican as a way of virtue signaling.
These same Texan ranchers and farmers will surely vote for sensible immigration reform as well as social programs to entice these hard workers to come to our country to work, right?
Guess those ranchers and farmers will just have to start learning how to do their own work since they’re not willing to 1- pay someone a living wage to do it for them legally or 2- stop being racist bigots to the illegal immigrants and their families who they’ve been paying low wages to do the work in the past.
I don’t know where they think they’re going to get workers from “abroad” to fill positions legally (because remember, they’re against illegal immigration) for what they’re paying.
Suck it up, my mans, and get to work.
