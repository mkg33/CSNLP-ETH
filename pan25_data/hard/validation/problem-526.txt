It's because these people let tribalism dominate.
I have a Shiite friend from Bangladesh.
His whole family in Canada (except him) supports Ayatollah Khamanei and goes to a mosque that secretly preaches anti-semitism.
They think criticism against Iran is fake and that Jews are evil.
Russia dangling its nukes again.
What's their end game really?
There seems to be none other than defeat or nukes unless somebody offs Putin and end this nightmare.
I've heard 3 separate Russians say they wish Putin would just use nukes and "finish it", and more say equally nuts non nuke related stuff.
Once they started losing so badly all of them started saying "yeah, but we are only losing because we have one hand tied behind our back and can't use our full force and power"...
So as messed up as all the "accidents" are, I'll take that over the open defying of any last shred of pretense of trying to act humane, and wanton cruelty/horrific actions that a lot of people would apparently be ok with.
I'm honestly surprised (and somewhat grateful) that they are at least still operating under the pretenses of things being accidents, rather than just throwing the rule book out the window and openly doing awful stuff that is admittedly on purpose...
