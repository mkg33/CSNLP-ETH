He's trying to keep the message alive and a priority.
But if the terrorist attacks on civilian targets are allowed to continue without a direct response, Putin will feel empowered to continue and escalate.
NATO is afraid of escalation, but they are encouraging the same by not responding as Russia does.
People like you were saying a year ago that Putin wouldn't attack Ukraine, and that any reports of such an invasion were fear-mongering.
Its upsetting to see the pro war stance people are taking doesent matter if you support ukraine or russia the innocent are the ones who pay the price here.
Edit: Oh, and "fight to the last Ukrainian" is literal Russian propaganda.
I see where you're getting your talking-points, bud.
Putin thrives on weakness, and he is a gambler.
Every time he is not confronted with serious push-back, he ups the ante.
In his twisted mind, NATO is a paper tiger.
He believes he has been proven right on many occasions, when he did insane things and saw almost no consequences.
Following that logic, if he is not stopped in Ukraine, he will keep pushing.
First the Baltics, then perhaps Poland.
Poland was a puppet state of the Soviet Union, which made it nearly in the same boat as the Baltics.
Poland was an Iron Curtain country.
Against its will, but nevertheless.
