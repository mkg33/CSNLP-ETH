“The official added that the White House has been told she will continue to caucus with the Democrats, becoming a third independent to do so, along with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine”.
Dems already have 2 independents that caucus with them for the purpose of committees, etc - Bernie Sanders and Angus King.
As long as she doesn’t caucus with the Republicans, Dems still get majorities on committees.
It was actually 50 R - 48 D last session.
She’s pretty dumb so maybe she does it anyway, but there isn’t much advantage to doing that in terms of power to get what she wants (money).
She would lose a lot of power doing that, it wouldn’t make a ton of sense.
Even 50-50, Dems get the tiebreaker and there would need to be a power sharing agreement which wouldn’t necessarily allow her to keep her committees and privileges that come as being part of a legislative majority.
Some stuff still remains to be seen but this doesn’t necessarily change the committee setup or require a power sharing agreement like last session.
