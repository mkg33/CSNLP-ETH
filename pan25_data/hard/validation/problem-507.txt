I mean, it's already well into American airspace and was in Canadian for quite a while.
It would be a bit of a pain in the ass to shoot down at that altitude but it could definitely be done.
I'm not sure that anyone actually cares that much though.
It's a balloon.
It isn't like it is going to get any surveillance data that satellites couldn't already provide.
Can one of you mega smart people who think this is some sort of a spy device explain why they would do this rather than use the many satellites they already have looking at the globe?
But use your brain.
You think they sent an unguided intercontinental balloon to just randomly grab some LiDAR imagery (that they can get from satellites), risking international incidents with whatever countries it drifts over?
Every country in the world has satellites up in the sky, legitimately able to manouver and literally SPY on anything they want in the world, but China is going to use a balloon, something almost completely uncontrollable once it hits high-altitude air streams, to spy on the west.
You mean they're actually going to ASK China what happened instead of immediately assuming it was some intentional act of malice?
Perhaps they didn't tell you about a Chinese spy balloon because the very idea of a SPY balloon is utterly ridiculous.
It is kinda funny cause you have to imagine there isnâ€™t much of any useful new data that balloon could get for china, and if it went anywhere close to restricted airspace we would shoot it down.
So now we just have this balloon watch going on across the country lol.
