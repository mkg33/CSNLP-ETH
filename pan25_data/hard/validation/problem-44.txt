This is really great if you live in Munich.
It's cheaper than the normal monthly pass for just the inner-zone of the transit system and now you don't have to pay 25 euros extra to go to the mountains for the day.
If this ticket works across Germany, that’s super cheap, even if it doesn’t include intercity trains.
1.60 for a day ticket is as much as you pay here for 1 hour ticket if you’re not local.
I believe the monthly ticket here is 35 or so.
Considering Germany’s size, population and income, that is dirt cheap.
I’m honestly jealous.
I get it too - it’s a great plan, I think.
You want people to use public transport more and use less of their personal vehicles?
You need to make public transport plentiful (so the using of private vehicles doesn’t make sense) and you need to make it cheap.
This is the cheap part.
I’m not sure if the schedules are frequent enough but that is a great step in the right direction.
Then that’s a great idea!
I wish we had something similar here, but it’ll never happen I’m afraid.
But I’d really use that option when I visit Germany again.
