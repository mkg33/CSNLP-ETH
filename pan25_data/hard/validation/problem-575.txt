Why should anything be done?
This has only been going on in earnest for 25 years, right?
Can't be that bad, right?
/s.
California?
Last I heard they have a problem with NIMBYs blocking desalination development because most plants don't take care of the brine discharge.
It adds more cost.
Just one example is that California has a climate that you only find in 5 places in the world.
Arizona ain't doing anything special expect for farming in desert.
Sorry but California actually isn’t the ideal place to grow everything.
If they stopped growing almonds alone it would cover 87% of the states water supply.
Almonds use 17% of the agricultural water in CA.
Most of the crop is exported.
A lot of the acreage is also been planted in the last 20 years so it’s not some 100 year old family farm.
It’s a for profit pillage of the natural resources.
That 17% is more than half of all drinking water.
Drinking water only makes up 20% of all water.
While almonds make up 13% of all water.
The almonds alone would buy quite a bit of time.
Why are we producing foods that are not native to areas.
