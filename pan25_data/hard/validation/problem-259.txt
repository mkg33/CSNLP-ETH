Taiwanese here.
I would do a simplified version of explaining this.
Ever since China became aggressive with its ambition to reunite Taiwan in recent years, the consensus of the public, like 95 percent of people, all agree that we are a sovereign nation and there is no way for Taiwanese to give up freedom and democracy.
So the differences between two parties are like marketing schemes rather than any practical difference.
DPP isn’t going to abandon the ROC constitution and KMT are not going to bring up any suggestions of reuniting with China, unless they want an utter destruction in the next election.
As much as the DPP wants to monopolize the idea that they are the sole embodiment of Pro-Taiwan independence and use it as means to leverage their political dominance.
You misread the post.
The main thing that we cherish is FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY.
You can go run a poll if you ever get in Taiwan.
I mean what else can taiwan do?
They have to be practical, not torpedo their economy because china bad.
It’s not like any other country that is hating on China is stopping trade with them.
America/Japan for one.
