as also does a willful destruction of government property or endangering it ie.
hollywood style "I just steal this airplane/tank etc.
and do heroic suicidal shit with it" actually carries a death penalty if you make it back.
Especially this part is troublesome in my opinion, soldiers who put their lives on the line should have the right to question orders that sound suicidal or otherwise idiotic and/or dubious.
Blind obedience is exactly the thing that makes the Russian army fair so badly, -they're essentially denied the right to use their own judgement on how to achieve their set goal in the field.
And now Ukrainian Generals want to do the same?
Looks like the Ukrainian Army wants to model themselves along Russian guide lines.
Do as you're told and don't question orders.
Will it or will it not limit the ability of Ukrainian soldiers and commanders at the point of contact to disregard obviously stupid orders and/or take advantage of opportunities they see?
Other militaries (such as in Russia) would see much of this as disrespectful and historically do not allow much to happen without the direct order being given.
So even if something was helpful it could be considered disobeying a direct order or disrespect.
So it really depends which system Ukraine's military is more akin to, a modern Western system heavily reliant on NCOs...or more of an old-fashioned do what I say and only what I say to the letter of how I say it.
This is difficult to say.
The US, for instance, built much of its military success on a bottom-up system in which individual units are free to make tactical decisions on the spot or change how they proceed with orders to suit the mission.
Means they thrive with broad orders where the experienced troops can decide on the best way to accomplish the task.
