Sometimes prosecutors are also smart, already have the evidence, and want to use your evidence to confirm the evidence they already have.
Which means they can also figure out if you’ve done anything to manipulate or destroy it and use that to impeach your credibility and/or prosecute you for further crimes.
Any person willing to commit a crime, or is reasonably implicated in a traitorous coup, is likely smart enough to destroy anything of interest.
(Yes, these people are morons, but they also have access to smart people who are likely telling them to destroy what they can - see: Secret Service).
The thing that frustrates me with this is how much lead the persons of interest have to destroy evidence.
It's like, "I"m going to come get your phone.
Okay, in a few months I'll be getting your phone.
I'm looking on your phone for xyz information.
I'm coming for your phone soon.
Ready?
Almost there.
Okay, now turn it over, hope you didn't manipulate anything.
".
Oh.
Now I see.
You wanted to use the 1st amendment to hide your crimes?
Sorry, it doesn’t work that way!
