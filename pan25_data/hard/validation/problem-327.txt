They are successfully keeping McCarthy from taking over and preventing the house from doing GOP stuff, like obstructing investigations.
This is some of the GOPs best work.
That is probably the best outcome we can get from this.
As much as I would love it if Jeffries was speaker, I don't see it happening but it's feasible that McCarthy could get the Dems to support him just to protect the house from the worst of the lunatics in the GoP.
The odd thing is that McCarthy gave concessjons for the "freedom caucus" and all was well until today when they decided that whatever he gives them they won't support him.
So this leaves McCarthy to either get democratic support which is impossible, make even more extreme concessions to the far right but they seem stubborn enough to refuse any concession, or finally which is probably the only choice left: for him to step down.
"the democrats, by not voting for Kevin Mccarthy, are refusing to accept the results of the 2022 election.
you could even go as far as to say they are trying to steal the election from him, in broad daylight, on live TV, in front of the whole country, and for that, Joe Hunter Biden must be impeached.
