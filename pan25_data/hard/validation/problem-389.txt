Is it extreme?
Yes, but history has shown time and time again that allowing authoritarianism to flourish only ever ends one way.
It'd send Turkey, as well as any other nations flirting with authoritarianism a message, as well as reinforcing that NATO stands by its principles - even those that were members won't get off easy if they stray down that path.
They want to join NATO but they made protection deals, and clearly they doesn't want to give Turkey any "power", accepting their terms is basically a humiliation for Sweden/Finland and they are not desperate enough !
You do know that Turkey (and Hungary) could simply ratify just Finland's application if Sweden was the only problem for Turkey ?
I did not know that, I always hear about Turkey demanding concessions from Sweden but not from Finland.
Ultimately, I care because I want both Sweden and Finland in NATO, especially since both countries would support Ukraine more if they were.
Namely Sweden who expressed they'd be able to send 12 Archer self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine but haven't done so yet, I think its because they believed they'd be in NATO by now and able to comprise a bit further on their own defense needs if they were.
I have no evidence to prove that's the case but I don't see any other reason why they'd talk about sending Archers but not do it after so many months.
But I agree neither country should break their rule of law or respect for human rights just to appease Erdogan.
I feel like Finland and Sweden 'being together' in this regard is just undermining both of their applications.
Turkey is demanding concessions from Sweden when really its Finland who benefits most from NATO membership, it would be extremely hard for Russia to invade Sweden without going through Finland or other NATO countries anyways.
