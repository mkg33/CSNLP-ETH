He’ll get banned from office and that’ll be it.
That’s the strongest punishment that the GOP and Democrats will both agree on.
Like it or not, it’s going to take the consent of the establishment Republicans to get anything done regarding this case.
1-Politics-If Republicans win the big 3 Executive, House, Congress, before he is convicted.Trump will never get in trouble.
Bottom line.
This means two things.
First, when charges are brought, they need to be air tight.
Absolutely zero speculation.
Second, every large step within the process needs to have at least two of the big three behind it so it won’t be ignored or buried.
It’s not a coincidence that Trumps tax forms were released after the Dems kept the Senate.
100% that release would have been halted of Reps won congress and the investigators would have kept continuing to build a case hoping that the 2024 election would turn out different.

SCOPE-Money buys time and not just because of expensive lawyers.
If you or I get charged with, let’s say bank fraud for cashing bad checks.
Lets say it was a lot, like 100k over a year period with 200 checks over 17 different banks.
It may take 6 months for the DA to have each and every check counted, were the money went (is the car you bought legal or did a cashed check pay for part of it?
), who else benefited?
Was your spouse involved?
Any employees at the bank?
You got caught for 100k but did you do more?
Lots of work right?
Now put that into billions of dollars with hundreds of thousands of checks spanned over hundreds of banks.
That would take years of investigating.
Btw, if any part of the years long investigation is done illegally (chain of custody, false confession, new guy goes into an apt.
he shouldn’t without a warrant) the investigation is set back a year.
1.LAWYERS WHO PLAY THE GAME-Lawyers have a lot of ways to postpone cases of given the opportunity.
Depending on the persons history (convictions), evidence, and charge, cases for a lot of white collar crime can be put off for years until defense council has exhausted every avenue of getting affidavits, discovery, and so on and so forth.
It’s pretty normal for a judge to grant a 6-month continuance for almost anything.
Starting with the investigations (wire taps, warrants, and motions) to make sure everything is in order or if the judge requires a higher level of proof to protect the case on appeal.
Once charges are actually brought it’s the same thing every step until trial (I assume the US Gov will go to trail and not plea).
