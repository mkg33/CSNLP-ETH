That's a ramification for not taking it, but what are the ramifications for not following it?
Here's the oath:
You can take that oath and then spend all day every day arguing for a republic, or a restoration of the House of Hannover, or any other thing you want that directly goes against interests of the king and his heirs.
And how are you gonna vote for people who will get rid of the monarchy if the same office you're electing them to requires an oath of personal fealty to that same Monarch?
Regardless, Canadian parliamentarians do not take an oath to the King/Queen of England, nor to the United Kingdom, but to their own nation under that same mutual monarch.
In Australia it’s to the King of Australia, and in New Zealand, the King of New Zealand.
Same for Canada.
Nobody is swearing an oath to a foreign nation.
These countries just happen to all share the same monarch as fully and functionally independent realms.
Same King, yes, but different realm.
Canadian parliamentarians do not swear to the ‘foreign’ King of the United Kingdom, nor to the King of Australia, New Zealand, etc.
That is for those of those countries and to the others respectively.
Canadian parliamentarians swear their oath to the King of Canada.
Anyone coming to Canada and applying for citizenship still has to swear an eternal oath to the British king.
Many of us find it distasteful to say the least, considering that we’re here fleeing oppressive regimes that demanded our allegiance.
