And if a Democrat does respond to one of these subpoenas walk out after 60 minutes of questions.
Hillary Clinton was very foolish to let herself be questioned for over ten hours.
Don’t play GOP games.
When the questions become silly and conspiracy inspired get up and walk out.
Yes, she did look weak as portrayed in right wing media.
The purpose of these GOP performance hearings is to make Democrats like Hillary Clinton look bad.
Hillary and Bill Clinton have been subjected to a campaign by the right wing since the 90s to portray them as corrupt and evil.
You can deny it all you want but right wing media has been very effective in characterizing Democrats as weak.
There is currently a very persistent campaign in right wing media to make Joe Biden look weak, evil and dumb.
Then they will run one of those scummy campaigns where its Biden vs Biden on the ballot to confuse voters.
…or Biden get so pissed that it starts affecting his instincts and he goes off half cocked, it could go either way .
I hope Biden doesn't show up for any of this nonsense.
If they subpoena him, he should ignore it.
After all, they've set the precedent.
