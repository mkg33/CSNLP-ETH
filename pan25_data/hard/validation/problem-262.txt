Russia is a joke better have a good enemy like Azerbaijan because even enemies can become friends (japand and US) than traitor friend like Russia.
So Russia is a guarantee to bring more wars on Armenia to have the conflict going, its a goof business to sell weapons to oil rich Azeris and good media points to act peacekeeper.
US stopped Azerbaijan from expanding the war on Armenia in September and US doesnâ€™t have the same guarantees with Armenia like Russia does.
As the article points out, Russia isn't helping Armenia, so right now there is nothing stopping an invasion.
Russia doesn't even have the ability to stop it even if they wanted to, since they're bogged down in Ukraine and can't spare any troops for Armenia.
Russian allies should take note and realize that Russia is not a reliable ally.
Russia will not rescue them when they're in trouble.
Russia will abuse its allies and drag them into wars they don't want (like Belarus).
A Russian "ally" is not really an ally.
It's a vassal that Russia will benefit from but will never defend when under attack.
