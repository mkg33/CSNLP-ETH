There is deffo a bit of subliminal messaging going on there with that headline from the Telegraph(also called by some the Torygraph) over the impending strike by the NHS.
To provide context, the Telegraph is nicknamed “The Torygraph” in the U.K., because of their constant shilling and bootlicking of the Tory party (the pejorative nickname for the Conservatives, the U.K.’s …right-leaning main political party) and their political lines.
The Tories are notoriously anti-worker, so any excuse to promote hatred towards any worker, including our own nurses - the same nurses they were celebrating and clapping for just a year ago, will be immediately jumped on by these clown shoes.
The wording was a deliberate attempt at rage bait against our nurses in the U.K.. OP is u/TheTelegraph, so it’s also shameless self-promotion.
To provide additional context, our nurses union, the Royal College of Nursing, has decided for the first time in its over-100 year history that nurses will strike soon.
My claim about the for the Telegraph?
It’s apparently been in the Urban Dictionary lexicon since 2011.
