Can someone explain to me exactly what ilhan Omar said that was antisemetic?
Is she wrong saying that it’s all about the Benjamin’s?
She specifically referred to aipac, which is ran by a bunch of right wing Christian zionists (which by the way, the reason for Christian zionists supporting Israel is highly antisemitic in of itself).
It is a common conservative talking point to conflate criticism of Israel with criticism of Judaism as a whole, because that way they can paint opponents of Israel as antisemitic.
a non comprehensive list of antisemitic tropes, you will find that she oftentimes refers to jews as a very powerful lobby, more loyal to themselves than to their homecountry, who are able to control government and private institution alike (very similar to the The Protocols of the Elders of Zion which is one of the text used as a basis for nazi antisemitism).
What she basically does is criticise Isreael which is not antisemitic per se, using antisemtic tropes, which is antisemitic.
Being anti-Israel or anti-zionist is not the same as anti-semitism.
Rep. Omar has consistently advocated for human rights and her time on the foreign affairs committee has been spent holding the US accountable when we are complicit in or actively commit war crimes abroad.
That is exactly the behavior I would expect if her criticisms of Israel came from a consistent moral framework, rather than adhoc attacks driven my antisemitism.
