Yes, that'll require a lot of renovations and zoning changes though.
It's not an immediate solution but a long term one if we continue to WFH and businesses don't force people back into offices.
There's just no way to do it at only the federal level though with all the zoning laws and local policies to overcome.
The complexity of housing is partially why this is so challenging.
Certainly the federal government can provide money, which it does somewhat, but ultimately those in need will always move to areas with more services.
Cities, states, and even the federal government are not being realistic about the amount of money necessary to solve homelessness.
We have multiple studies that show the amount of money that it would take to solve homelessness both nationally and regionally.
In fact, one just came out about what it would actually take to solve homelessness in CA which is according to actual experts nearly 100 billion total between now and 2035.
For example, to address homelessness in CA they would need according to multiple studies by researchers to spend nearly 100 billion dollars by 2035.
That's because the true cost of solving homeless according to multiple studies that have come out is a lot more than the amount that state and local governments are putting in.
It seems like they are always asking for more money because we have collectively decided even if just through inaction that the amount to solve homelessness is too much and therefore we do not allocate enough money at the city, state, or federal level to solve the problem.
