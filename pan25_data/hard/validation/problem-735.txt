Because he's an attention starved narcissist, and the war in Ukraine reminds him of the good old days when he was able to do just all the war crimes and then convince the public that he's a good diplomat that just loves to make peace (he doesn't, he loves blowing up babies.
).
yup.
the borders the Russians signed on for and promised not to invade Ukraine if they surrendered their nuclear stockpile.
Ukraine tried peace when they gave up their nuclear arsenal in exchange for the signed guarantee that russia wouldn't attack Ukraine.
That said, the notion that Ukraine and Kazakhstan "gave" the nukes to Russia is fanciful at best.
The nukes were in Ukraine and Kazakhstan geographically, but remained under Soviet military control.
Even if Ukraine and Kazakhstan took possession of the warheads physically, they did not have the codes to fire them - those were in the Kremlin.
They also didn't have any infrastructure or expertise to maintain the nukes.
So, Ukraine got the best it can possibly get from 'giving' the nukes in that circumstance - a paper guarantee.
Nobody, including Ukraine, was under any illusions about the enforceability of this paper guarantee, everyone knew what it was when it was signed.
This is indeed something people have thought about before.
The collapse of Russia or the US would be a dawn of the age of nuclear reproliferation.
