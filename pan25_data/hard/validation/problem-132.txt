There are a couple of problems: no birth control method is 100% effective, and there's no way of knowing whether the man taking the pill has actually done so, unless the woman watches him do it, or whether the pill is the right one.
As you said, no method is 100% effective, so when you employ more than one method (safe sex/condoms in addition to birth control, which can now happen on both sides) then that is the best you can do all around.
yeah, but the courts aren't cooperating.
As much as religious fanatics would like it to be otherwise, it's still perfectly legal.
The EU is more akin to the US Federal Government, and each state is more akin to a European country in that they are somewhat similar in size and have their own government but still has to abide by the guidelines of the higher authority (US Federal govt for the states, EU for Europe).
The taliban comparison was a very accurate one.
The "Christian Taliban" as you've coined them are just about as successful at spreading their views to the whole of the USA as the Islamic Taliban are at spreading their views to the whole of Europe.
Yep, there's parts that they've successfully converted.
But it's a small minority of the whole.
