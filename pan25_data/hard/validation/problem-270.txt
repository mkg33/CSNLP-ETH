EDIT: and to clarify, I interpret "declare war" to mean that we do more to ACTIVELY defend Ukraine as opposed to the "passive" support of equipment & intel.
By no stretch of the imagination was I thinking we would be invading Russia or anything like that.
But more realistic: Without nukes there would have been no war at all, since Russia would have known that the West is going to interfere directly.
Itâ€™s pretty much a given that MAD is the only thing standing in the way of an all out nuclear war between the West and Russia.
Conventional warfare is whole different ballgame because in the past 10 months Russia has shown they have a weak paper tiger army.
The only thing they have going for them is Putin and his useless nuclear saber-rattling; otherwise, NATO would steamroll their military with air power alone.
If Russia didn't have nuclear arms, it almost certainly would never have been confident enough to violate international norms by launching a war of conquest on a neighbouring sovereign country.
And if Russia hadn't invaded Ukraine, nobody would have any reason to declare war on them.
The only reason anyone's even talking about whether "the West" would or would not declare war on Russia is because Russia has nukes, and that emboldened them to the kind of belligerence that calls for foreign intervention.
(Especially since Russia has already signaled that would be viewed as ur declaring war on them, etc.
).
