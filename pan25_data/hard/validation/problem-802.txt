That is a bullshit quote popularized by Russia to push its propaganda that Ukraine is fake, and Russians can't destroy the country and genocide its people if the country doesn't exist.
They claim Ukraine is an artificial country created by.
khm-khm, Anglo-Saxons, and the most Anglo-Saxon of them, Bismark, apparently, somehow, and use this quote to prove it's not against Ukraine pootin fights, but against all the west.
Edit: I'm pointing out how dumb Putin's claim that "Ukraine belongs to Russia and there is no Ukrainian identity.
".
Sort of.
We’re just in the 13th Baktun.
I think thematically the Baktun will have similar characteristics as the first.
Baktuns are grouped into units of 20 called Piktuns.
So we haven’t even completed the first Piktun cycle yet.
If the event was “strong enough”, but at that point we would be dead anyway many times over.
The wires in your home aren’t very long and are well insulated.
You can touch live wire with insulation and not feel a thing (don’t).
What always gets attention in the Carrinon event is the telegraph wires.
These were thin, bare wires (I don’t think most of them had insulating sheaves at that point, I think that is how they boosted distance later) stretching up to tens of miles.
They were designed to use milliamperes.
Some of them melted or caught their poles on fire (this gets the attention), but most of them were fine.
The operators just disconnected the batteries from the send/receivers and used the energy of the event to power the system.
Also they were our forebears and are us.
Understanding them, helps us to understand ourselves.
The cause of the collapse of the Mayan civilization is something that has real world implications for us today (climate change).
