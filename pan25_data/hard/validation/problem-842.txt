Russians don't seem too bothered taking all those losses, I wonder how much longer the Ukranians can keep it up.
Not so long ago, you'd be called a Russian shill for suggesting a Ukrainian victory wasn't imminent.
Because Russia is looking more threatening now, pro-Ukraine Redditors (of which I am one, that's how I know lol) are starting to feel backed into a corner.
If both of those towns are in Ukrainian hands come March, Ukraine will be primed for a counteroffensive in the south and northeast come April and Russias situation is going to become very desperate.
Russias new offensive is likely going to begin this coming week.
They rushed a more limited operation to get it in before western tanks arrive.
They want to push to the river line west of Kreminna where the Ukrainians are applying a lot of pressure.
They have a month or so before the weather turns to rain.
Their goals are the towns of Siversk and (surprise surprise) Bakhmut.
Siversk is a supply line for the Kreminna offensive which, if successful, will compromise the Russian Svatove-Kreminna line and allow Ukrainians to attack the Russian Bakhmut group from behind and effectively end the Battle of Bakhmut by ending Russia’s ability ti launch offensives in that direction.
Bakhmut is a goal for propaganda purposes.
No strategic value but they’ve lost tens of thousands storming it endlessly for months.
