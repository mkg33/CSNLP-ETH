The problem is that because we in Europe have neglected our militaries, we also are struggling to supply Ukraine.
Russia is firing far more shells than Ukraine for example, due to our failure to supply Ukraine with enough.
Ukraine has never posed an existential threat to Russia.
Ukrainians are highly motivated; Russian soldiers don' even know why they are fighting other than the lies they've been told; when they get to Ukraine, they want to know where all the Nazis are.
Russiaâ€™s population is collapsing.
After the USSR collapsed, their birthdate went into decline.
Russia does not have an endless supply of warm bodies to throw at Ukraine.
Russia's military configuration has never worked well.
The NCOs are technicians; it's officers who lead actual combat; it doesn't work well.
Their training is poor; mobilize, join their unit, and off to the front lines.
Lots of untrained soldiers don't make for a good army.
We're seeing that now in Ukraine.
Russia's military is so bad they have to rely on mercenaries made of criminals to make any headway.
