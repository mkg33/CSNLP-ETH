This is also Trump's rationale for why he cheats at golf.
"Because everyone else is cheating, so you have to cheat to keep up."
"[Donald] believes that you’re gonna cheat him, too.
So if it’s the same, if everybody’s cheating, he doesn’t see it as really cheating.
".
Very much this.
The rest of the media have fucking coddled Fox for far too long, and it's complete horseshit.
It's even more ridiculous when you consider that Fox is busy savaging all the rest of them constantly.
To be more specific, they were created to be the defenders of a future Nixon, so that Republican Presidents would have a friendly press outfit spinning things.
Roger Ailes was a Nixon aide, and was one of that group who believed that the reason Nixon had gone down is because the Press was against him, and that had something like Fox existed then, Nixon wouldn't have been forced to resign to avoid impeachment.
Thus I'd argue it's even worse than just being created to elect Republicans - they were created to elect Republicans and shield them from the consequences of illegal actions in office.
His kid, or at least the one that's going to take over, unfortunately, is just as big of a piece of shit though.
The other one that stepped up to call out the bullshit, won't get anything.
