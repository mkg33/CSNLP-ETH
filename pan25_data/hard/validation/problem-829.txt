This isn’t a regular phone sitting in an office that regularly rings.
This is a phone that almost never rings, and if it does your asshole is puckering up.
Lol, if that red phone rings they are adhering to their policy of picking it up.
Because if it’s ringing, the strongest military in the world is extremely interested in discussing what the fuck you are doing.
The implications are that despite the shit talking from politicians the Russian military and US military are still talking to each other.
It's almost like Russia figured the U.S. military superiority level was just all talk like theirs was.
They decided to test that with one of their "best" forces and realized no, the U.S. when unleashed is not lying about its capabilities.
It's just not as demonstrative against the Taliban who mostly hid.
I think it seriously terrified Russia to realize that the U.S. wasn't simply chest pounding like we found out they've been doing for a long time now as evidenced by what a joke they've been in Ukraine.
Lol I think it’s funny how contentious the US and Russia are but they’ve got a special line dedicated just for each other.
Like “hey babeeeeee I didn’t want to wait on hold oo oooo ooo”.
