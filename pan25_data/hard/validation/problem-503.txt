Indeed but the Pilgrims main history with Native Americans is the Thanksgiving story which paints the Native Ameircans in a good light with Massoit and Wampanoag saving the Pilgrims.
At grade school level you use an example, the Pilgrims story, fleeing religious persecution in Europe usually leaves out interactions with Native Americans other than the Thanksgiving story.
