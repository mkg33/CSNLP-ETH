Because a domestic violence order requires no burden of proof and you can’t just strip away someone’s constitutional rights without due process.
And the reality is that most states won’t allow police to even collect weapons in DV cases and they just rely on the accused to turn them in voluntarily.
Unsurprisingly, collecting the weapons leads to lower murder rates for women.
So, this decision is a serious step in the wrong direction, IMO.
They’ve already been given a chance to respond before the OOP is issued.
Judges don’t just blindside people with it like you see in the movies.
People under restraining orders have already received due process when the matter went before a judge, determined them to be a threat, and issued the restraint order.
A person goes in for a restraining order, if it sounds reasonable to a judge they will issue a temporary restraining order that is often only good for 10 days.
Then you get a notification that there is a restraining order against you, and the court date to argue why you shouldn't have one.
That court date comes and you go in front of the judge, with your lawyer if you have one, and argue the reason you shouldn't have the restraining order against you, and reasons certain conditions shouldn't exist.
While I have no doubt restraining orders have been granted unnecessarily, and it would depend on the Judge who rules on a case by case basis, I'd have to push back a bit on two points though.
'Basically nothing' is not the same as 'nothing'.
Also the 'no facts', just your word.
You'd have to submit a petition in writing and have to notarized or sworn to.
One more - restraining orders are an emergency action to take place until the case can be fully heard.
They shouldn't take long.
