First off patriot missiles isn't the answer to entrenchment/mines or whatever, it's to shore up Ukraine's defenses against Russia's missile barrages.
Instead tanks are how you spearhead an attack and break-through, which is also what NATO is sending more of in preparation to the end of muddy season.
Secondly Ukraine has already proven they can take back territory even with what they have now, and that will only improve while what Russia has will only get worse through attrition.
6% is a fucking massive chunk of Ukraine's territory... Drop it in Pervomaisk, and the entirety of Ukrainian held SW Ukraine is safe, because to get beyond it, you'd have to go through it.
Don't need to protect Uman from drone attacks out of Crimea, if the drones can't get there in the first place... Drop the second gifted battery in Dnipro, and all of eastern Ukraine is now covered.
You don't need to protect every square inch of Ukraine to provide credible air defense cover to every square inch... unless you think Russia has a teleporter that can send drones right into the middle of Ukraine where there's no air defense systems that is...
A battery is 6 launcher units, radar, comms array, and 4 platoons; fire control, launcher, HQ, maintenance; which total to around 70-90 personnel...
