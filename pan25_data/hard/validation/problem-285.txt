There is no scenario in which Republicans join Dems to give Dems the majority because, the simple fact is, Dems don’t have the majority.
But there could be a scenario in which Dems can support a reasonable partner, act as a powerful minority, and actually govern.
But there is no scenario in which Republicans, no matter how reasonable, from the majority, agree to a Dem speaker.
If the choice for them is an MTG backed candidate or a Dem, they are going to eventually cave to far right and pick the former.
If the choice is an MTG candidate or a more moderate Republican who will govern reasonably, not pursue frivolous investigations, and work across the aisle with the Senate leadership, you can probably pick enough to get the latter.
This is silly.
The Democrats are the minority without a compromise like this.
The question for them is this: is it better to be in the minority with a reasonable partner whom you can govern with or be in the minority and held to the whims of Marjorie Taylor Greene and her ilk?
Because if this continues and the Republicans have no other off-ramp, they will eventually cave to the far right and concede to someone like Jim Jordan as Speaker.
„Sane republican“, I’m sorry but the last 10 years have convinced me that IF there were such rare creatures they willingly followed their parties mantra and acted like cowards in the face of inhumane behavior.
No what's silly is thinking that Republicans are "reasonable" and give a single solitary fuck about Democratic concessions.
The Democrats have absolutely -nothing- to gain by trying to save the Republican Party.
