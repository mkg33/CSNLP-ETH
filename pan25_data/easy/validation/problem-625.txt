US officials had warned over the summer that Iran was preparing to send drones to Russia, and then the weapons first saw battlefield action in early September.
These weapons included the Shahed-136, Shahed-129, Shahed-191, and Qods Mohajer-6 and were used in "hundreds" of attacks against Ukraine in the following weeks, Britain's defense ministry said.
Most notable of the weapons has been the Shahed-136, which Russian forces have used to terrorize Ukrainian cities in attacks against the country's civilian areas, civil infrastructure, and energy grid.
Russian forces appear to be out of Iranian-made drones that have been used in recent weeks to terrorize Ukrainian cities and civilians, Western officials say.
One unnamed Western official said Tuesday that while Moscow has run out of the Iranian drones, it still anticipates "a resupply," according to an ABC News report.
The comments come amid a drop in usage for the deadly systems.
