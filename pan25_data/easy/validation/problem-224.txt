How's Russia going to go on bullying its (former USSR) allies in neighbouring countries, or committing atrocities in Ukraine and Syria, or exploiting North Africa without conventional ground forces?
Work?
By which metric?
Russia being trapped inside its own borders, unable to trade and unable project any amount of power outside is the dream of us, they can become NK 2.0 all they want, that's a dream.
No one gives a shit about NK, it is essentially the personal farm of one family that occasionally begs for food.
Works... No one was going to invade Russia anyway and what does it work for, exactly?
At least NK would actually be invaded and its rulers deposed if not for nukes.
Ain't nobody gonna play nation building with Russia even with conventional weapons only anyway and they cannot use nukes to deter separatism or terrorism either.
"Works" he says.
The day Russia has as much say in the world's affairs as NK is the day we are rid of the Russian menace.
I whole heartedly welcome NK-ization of Russia.
