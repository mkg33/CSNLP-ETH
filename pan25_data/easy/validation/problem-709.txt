Not uninformed, just unwilling to look past headlines, the critical part is that Bout was an international arms dealer not a Russian one, he very much preformed extensive work for many countries including the U.S. As per his Wikipedia page, he was described as a linchpin for American supplies lines during the invasion of Iraq, and was paid at least $60 million essentially directly from the U.S government.
This is of course likely the tip of the unclassified iceberg as he has reportedly had extended contact with both the CIA and GRU.
The second part is that he was not an importer, but an exporter of arms for the entire time when he was working for the Russian government, looting massive easily accessible soviet-era stockpiles to sell to African despots.
The movie "Lord of War" goes over this nicely, note who frees him at the end.
So unless Russia is trying to traffic their own weapons to themselves, he has substantially less value than say the actual GRU operative they are also trying to free.
The people describing this in Pok√©mon card term, quite unsurprisingly, can't quite grasp that nuance.
