Ya, a clearly insignia covered medic was not shot, a man in civilian garb was.
Come on, its not even like the article is a long read or written at a advanced level of English comprehension.
How much do you people get paid, per hour or post?
Post per hour?
Article 1(4) of Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions extends the scope of application of the Geneva Conventions to include armed conflicts in which people are fighting against colonial domination, alien occupation or racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination ( and original article source ).
It's Jenin.
Most combatants are residents (affiliated or otherwise) who grab a gun and go out to fight when the Israelis show up.
As such, there is little resembling a uniform past a general trend of militants covering their faces (ex.
black balaclavas) to preserve anonymity.
Yeah but I think you’re just wrong here.
If I’m in a war, and I see someone running towards a wounded enemy without wearing any “MEDIC” outfit, I’m gonna assume they’re an enemy too.
And I wouldn’t let an enemy just run around until they start shooting at me.
I would take care of the assumed threat before they have the chance to cause casualties to me and my fellow soldiers.
And yeah I suppose your point about the medic not knowing whether it was a militant or just a civilian is a good point.
