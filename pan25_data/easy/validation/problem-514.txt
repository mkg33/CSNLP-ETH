They will certainly be able to operate closer to Ukraine's air defence without detection, and relay data back to other aircraft, but they can't get as close as F-22/35 etc.
But that still gives them a much larger window to operate safely, and with AESA radar lob long range AA missiles at Ukrainian jets.
Even during WW2 diplomatic communication persisted.
The Germans sent representatives to Britain while their bombers attacked British cities.
You have to maintain avenues of communication for when the war eventually ends.

The fact that Macron recorded and then later released the calls covers the West's ass because it demonstrates that efforts were made on the part of world leaders to try and talk Putin down.

Hmmmm...
Unlikely.
We do t have many, they are mostly in the Baltic nations backfilling for Soviet tanks already forwarded to Ukraine.
And they don't use NATO standard ammo or barrels.
