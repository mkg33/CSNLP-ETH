Kherson has been part of Russia on paper only.
Actually invading real Russian territories or attacking its capital is very different situation.
the US/NATO would not use single drone missile strikes, it would be an all out air assault.
ukraine is hitting the staging and delivery systems used to hit their civilian infrastructure, they aren't hitting russian nuclear capabilities.
I am saying that if russia broke the seal and launched a nuke, they would be completely vulnerable to american/nato retaliation, they would be powerless to stop it.
a nuke won't help putin achieve anything tangible though and it would be a hellstorm for russia if they launched a nuke.
You think a country that cant defend its strategic military bases within arms reach of its capitol can afford to play the nuclear stand off game?
russia is a sitting duck and launching nukes would be the end of russia let alone this war.
Putin isn't actually launching anything himself.
Even if he gives the order, Captain Ivan and Lieutenant Dimitri would very much like to go home to their families at the end of the day.
Odds are decent they won't launch a suicidal strike even if ordered.
