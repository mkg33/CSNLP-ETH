But yeah if a full scale Sino-Indian War breaks out whoever starts losing is going to have a change of heart over their policy.
Exactly.
I totally agree.
This policy is so wise.
This is about the only way to disarm manipulation.
The best is they are continuing and using it wherever appropriate, so it seems to be a central political position of this administration regarding external affairs, something I don't remember seeing before from the US or from anywhere else.
BS.
US and China co-operating to send 1200 strike forces that will succesfully complete their missions before russia launches their nukes?
Not gonna happen.
China and India would be primarily concerned about the geopolitical consequences, not the environmental.
Well China would for one.
If we announced that nukes are off the table unless they use them first, their strategy in dealing with the U.S. would probably change overnight.
Yeah I think it just kinda leaves the door open for China to attack nuclear armed nations with conventional arms and not start a nuclear war, the reason the U.S. doesn't codify the NFU is because of those possibilities.
