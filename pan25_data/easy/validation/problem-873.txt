Most people in this world just want to live their lives in peace.
They don't want to be disturbed, or have their quiet lives interrupted.
If that means responding positively to polls about war acceptance in a regime as oppressive as Russia's?
I have no doubt that many would voice their favor.
They're made to feel isolated there.
Alone.
To sum it up, Putin's and his fellow silovarchs in the Kremlin favor actions (even long-term one) that aim to maximize apathetic disassociation among its opponents' members when engaging an opponent (foreign or domestic), as opposed to direct attributable engagements/events.
That said, while the Pro-Kremlin hacking group KillNet has claimed responsibility for the cyberattack, its surprising that in Putin's Russia this attack would occur without the big boss giving the go-ahead, and if one thing can be certain as a result of this event, its that there appears to be an emerging sentiment among the Russian leadership, or perhaps even the leader himself, that the current battle plan might need a few minor adjustments.
Unfortunately for Putin, other than the temporary downing of online EU services, one of those improvements might have inadvertently inspire a deeper sense of resolution and unity among European NATO members to the Ukrainian cause and is coincidentally the last thing in the world Putin needs at this moment.
Nah.
Hack their television stations.
Set every channel to broadcast video showing the devastation in Ukraine, as well as what's happening to their own soldiers.
Show the Russian people how much senseless loss of life has occurred as a direct result of Putin's genocidal campaign.
