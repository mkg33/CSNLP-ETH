Plato's allegory is actually a fascinating way of representing how different our frames of reference are that hadn't occurred to me.
Thanks mate, glad that's in my head for when I talk about it in the future.
Probably the USA numbers of teen pregnancies are the entire population, whereas the Tanzania numbers are only people in primary or secondary school maybe even in particular areas only.
In the USA, the number of children in schools is probably almost the same number as children at all, the number of children not in school is nonzero but small.
In Tanzania, it might not be true.
If most of their school-aged people are in fact NOT in school (as might be likely with country of PPP GDP \= $3300) that might explain the disparity in rates.
There is probably a reporting disparity as well; in the US almost every single birth of this nature is going to be recorded, maybe not so much in Tanzania.
It's kind of hard to believe that USA teen pregnancy rate is astronomically higher than Tanzania, and you kind of know that Tanzania's population is going to skew younger than USA population which should further skew the numbers.
What?
European countries are much smaller, and often Europeans are unaware of how a person can drive for 6 hours and still be in the same country let alone the same state.
I live in Alaska, it's astounding how small countries are in comparison.
Ceramics, jewelry, carved ornaments, clothing, etc.
Stores and such run by volunteers, with profits going to back into the program to invest in more product and other craftsman.
Nepal, South Africa, India, Philippines, Peru, Thailand, etc.
Similar to how you can buy Free trade coffee or cocoa and know the farmer is getting a good price, except craftsmen, and it's primarily volunteers so all kinds of margins are reduced to go back into the programs.
