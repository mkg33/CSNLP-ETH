Etc, etc, etc.
- believe me, there are many more of Israel‘s duplicity.
I just don’t have the time to dig it all up.
Most Israelis who believed peace was possible soon changed their position after the Palestinians rejected Camp David by launching the Second Intifada and those who still held out hold gave it up after the Palestinians elected Hamas following Disengagement and then turned down Olmert's offer in 2008.
It wasn't Bibi who walked out on Obama in 2014 or rejected Trump's plan before it was even released.
That was Abbas.
Clearly Bibi's new government isn't going to make a deal but given the history of Abbas and Hamas's rejection of any and every deal, no Israeli government would be able get peace now.
I don't think the current Israeli government wants a two state solution but it is the Palestinians who turned down peace in 1937, 1947, 2000, 2001, 2008, 2014 and 2019.
After Israel withdrew from Gaza and voted in a government based solely on withdrawing from most of the west bank, the Palestinians voted in Hamas to step up the war.
Criticize the current Israeli government all you want (it's garbage) but the Palestinians have a pretty clear track record here.
It won't happen with the current Israeli government but blaming it is ahistorical.
Solutions very close to that were offered multiple times and rejected by the Palestinian leadership with violence.
The people in charge of both Palestinian governments aren't against the occupation, they're against Israel existing in any borders.
Until the Palestinians and people like you recognize that the Jewish people have a right to statehood in at least part of our homeland this needless war will continue.
So you admit the Palestinians don't want peace with Israel now?
Which is it?
Palestinians want peace or they're right to reject peace because Israel has no right to exist in any borders?
Pick a talking point and stick with it.
