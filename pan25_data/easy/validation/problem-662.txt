That's already the case.
NATO countries (the one's that matter...) have already ratified the membership of Finland.
This means that these countries will come to the aid of Finland in the event of russian attack.
Turkey can suck an egg as its approval is meaningless.
When Finland gets attacked, all the OTHER NATO countries will respond as if Finland was already in NATO.
The US does have a defense agreement with Finland.
And although this is NOT a full-on NATO defense pact, it can be taken as de facto.
The US will assist Finland (and Sweden) if russia attacks them.
Usually he is pretty good about diplomacy, specially in international setting.
But I guess he got caught deep thinking aloud (I don't know... ehhh explaining the situation in deeper detail for "home audience", since it was on Finnish television morning show interview).
He should be little bit more careful.
Well now he had to do meaculpa and go around damage controlling all day.
the international quick news cycle doesn't do nuance, so one has to be carefull to "stay on message".
Defense agreement?
You mean the part about having a "bilateral defense cooperation"?
Does that specify what defense cooperation means?
As in does it explicitly state that will entail military aid?
