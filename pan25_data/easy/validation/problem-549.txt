There's better ways to get other countries to share some of the burden that Turkey and Lebanon faced from the Syrian-Iraqi Civil War that's much more constructive than just washing their hands of everything and dumping them on Greece and Bulgaria, two of the EU nations least economically equipped to have handled a mass migration of people in.
A better approach would have been getting a massive amount of EU and NATO officials to Turkey and show them the underlying humanitarian situation and how that it was unfair for them and Lebanon to have faced most of the cost of it.
I mean Germany could have also done a much better job of it all as well but it was a screw up of multiple parties and Turkey had a big portion of the blame in how poorly planned the migrant situation unfolded.
Definitely.
It’s more about the rhetoric generated throughout the party.
They pander to a hysterical public if it’s good for PR while understanding that sensible border policy is more complicated than “brown person arrested make nineteen year old white woman mad.”.
