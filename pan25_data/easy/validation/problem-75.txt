I've lived in Florida my whole life, seen first-hand the changes that have gone on the last 10 years or so.
This state is done.
The people here have become hateful, disgusting bigots.
None of this is going to do anything.
Almost everyone here supports the cruelty and the bigoted policies.
They love it.
Best thing these kids can do is leave, go to a state that has decent human beings and don't look back.
And anyone outside of Florida that wants to do something, don't come here.
This state relies on tourism.
Don't spend your money here propping up this hateful state.
Go to California instead.
They have Disney and beaches.
Republicans hate state university systems.
They hate all public education.
They don’t want people to be educated.
They don’t want government paying for education, or requiring testing, or allowing tenure.
They don’t want sex education, they want people to choose who they go to school with.
If whites don’t want to go to school with a lot of blacks, so be it, say white conservatives.
Let them move to white neighborhoods and send their kids to white schools.
