This would have been an awful bill to pass.
If anything, it would've encouraged aggregators to only post links to sites that did not charge, which would probably be the bottom-of-the-barrel disinformation sites that are propped up by wealthy right wing fanatics.
Despite the headline being about Facebook, this bill would've bene detrimental to all news aggregators (Reddit, Google, YCombinator, etc).
This is pretty close to a law that passed in Europe which empowered news sources to charge sites for displaying links to their content, after which Google promptly delisted any of those news sources, and shortly after, the law was rescinded.
Yes and no.
Fake news coming from disreputable or propaganda sites is a big problem on Facebook.
That content will continue to flow like the mighty Mississippi.
What will be put behind a paywall is legitimate news by organizations that, rightfully, should be compensated for their professional journalism.
Uh, good?
Facebook shouldn't be a news site.
Besides the fact that it's an empty threat, their right wing user base/cash cow would leave the platform.
