People seem to be missing that she is pointedly using their own words because everyone knows they were, and are, liars.
Finally another major celebrity boycotting.
Everyone around me makes fun of those who boycott the games, but it shows real solidarity and morality.
Everyone should boycott Qatar and this might be a hot take but FIFA in general.
Both are incredibly corrupt.
> an average is a single number taken as representative of a list of numbers, usually the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers are in the list (the arithmetic mean)… Depending on the context, an average might be another statistic such as the median, or mode.
Idk.
That’s asking a lot of people.
If you can manage that then good for you.
The more people who absolutely boycott it the better, but there’s a lot of people who won’t be able to resist watching it.
Pirating or watching with other people is better than nothing, then boycott all the advertisers and cancel your subscriptions to streaming services carrying the game.
That will still make a huge impact.
She knows, and everyone else knows, that Qatar bribed FIFA, they didn't win it, that they never had any intention of addressing human rights abuses, and that FIFA is directly responsible for funding slavery because how the fuck else did they manage to build all those stadiums in a country where the national median income is $400,000/year?
