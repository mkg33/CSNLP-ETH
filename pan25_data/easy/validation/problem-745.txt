I disagree.
French and German prime ministers were completely surprised when Putin attacked (despite the many warnings issued by basically every intelligence agency and despite Putin placing his troops on the Ukrainian border).
IIRC one of them said he couldn't believe Putin lied to him.
It really amazes me how little people understand about international diplomacy.
Being allowed to do something doesn't make it the correct or beneficial thing to do.
You agreeing with some dipshit arguing no "treaties" were violated doesn't make the first comment a lie.
it may just make them misinformed.
But siding with dipshits on semantics just makes you stupid too.
> Iran agreed to eventually implement a protocol that would allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, unfettered access to its nuclear facilities and potentially to undeclared sites.
Inspections are intended to guard against the possibility that Iran could develop nuclear arms in secret, as it has allegedly attempted before.
The IAEA has issued quarterly reports to its board of governors and the UN Security Council on Iran’s implementation of its nuclear commitments.

I bet the corruption in their army is every bit as bad if not worse than RuZZia .. the only leverage they have is the strait otherwise they are a paper tiger .. we literally smart bombed one of their generals inside their own country and right now Iran is almost in civil war.
