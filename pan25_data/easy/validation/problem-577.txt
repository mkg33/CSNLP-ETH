Harbaugh gets recruiting classes solidly in the top 20 and usually in the top 10.
With that style of recruiting, a great coach would have been besting OSU and MSU every year largely without question.
A good coach would be competing with OSU (usually to a draw but winning at least 1/3) and usually beating MSU over 2/3 of the time.
A decent coach would win 1, but usually compete against OSU and would be average at best against MSU.
Also, the 2018 anti-gerrymandering proposition added same-day voter registration and no-reason absentee voting.
In this election we voted yes on Prop 3, which adds into our constitution most of the things you mentioned - same day registration, 9 days of early in-person voting, after voting no-reason absentee once you can request to receive an an absentee ballot with state paid postage for all future elections, increasing the number of drop boxes, signing an affidavit to verify your identity when voting, and most importantly, require the state canvassing board to do certify elections based on official records of the votes cast, which should eliminate the sort of ratfuckery attempted in 2020.
