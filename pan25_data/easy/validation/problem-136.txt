I relatively recently finished book of memoirs from people (mainly from Belarus and Russia) who were sent to Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion "Zinky boys".
Two things that struck me the most was the sheer quantity of casual war crimes and how each and every last one of the soldiers were more angry at people who condemned the war (even in USSR), than at those who had sent soldiers to Afghanistan.
And make no mistake the experience of those soldiers was truly horrible in Afghanistan (everything you read about Russian experience in Ukraine, but worse).
I had previously known that Afghan-Soviet war was horrible, but as nobody was really talking about it, I had always had a very distorted vision of the war.
In that way the book was quite eye opening, not just in the context of the war, but also in how Russians perceived the world.
I had thought I understood it.
No he means the anticapitalist left, self described socialists, communists, left anarchists, anti imperialists (particularly ironic in context) etc.
Zizek also identifies himself as a communist, though in a weird way.
Almost assuredly correct.
Also correct: Americans had the freedom the create a cultural movement based on getting out of Vietnam.
Russians can be put in jail for 15 years for disagreeing with official casualty counts.
Mad because completely avoidable.
Don't sleep next to bombs.
That building used to be a college.
During that time it housed 600 plus people.
So it probably killed about that many soldiers if they were at max capacity.
