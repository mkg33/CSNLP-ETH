This is great info, but it’s also important to add that there are so many things to carefully research for each country as well.
I’ve been downvoted before for mentioning this, but Ireland is in the midst of an extreme housing crisis.
Housing for the Irish is already insanely difficult to get.
So, to help people planning such a huge and expensive move: make local connections, investigate or hire a solicitor to help you with laws/regulations that differ abroad, and know that it is not as easy as getting a job contract and moving - that it could be months to years before you get a proper accommodation sorted.
While anecdotal, my neighbours moved over last year (wife is a doctor, husband is an engineer), and conversations we’ve had with them revealed that, while they were offered a great opportunity via the wife’s job, husband hasn’t had a lot of success finding work and finding a house took them over 10 months They have two children on top of it all, and I can’t imagine how difficult it was living out of hotels and relying on friendships with others to have places to live, even if it was temporary.
To add, they only got the lease on the house next door to us because the prior tenants (both nurses) were their friends and gave them the lease to take over.
The previous neighbours went back home when their contracts were up.
You can Google and read more about it, but it is a serious issue that anyone should prepare and plan for.
That said: Ireland is a wonderful country and there’s a lot of positive things, too.

I’ve been trying to leave the US since around 2005.
I’ve had ZERO luck and I have a phd in biology and my other half is an RN.
It’s extremely difficult.
You basically have to have family there or a job that’s trying to bring you in.
