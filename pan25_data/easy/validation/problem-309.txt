If, say, universal suffrage would make us stronger, finding "balance" by accepting something less than universality only makes us weaker by comparison.
That it's possible to be still weaker than that is of no consequence.

The reason there are few elected Republicans in California isn't because California Democrats made it so it's not possible to elect Republicans, it's because Republicans have made it impossible to elect Republicans by becoming increasingly extreme and alienating increasingly large shares of the electorate.
Contrast this with Wisconsin, where Republicans have made it impossible to elect Democratic majorities, and to oust Republican incumbents voters are unhappy with.
Agreed.
Republicans are full of shit, and have gotten worse the past 6 years.
I lean liberal now, but think ACTUAL fiscal conservatives are needed for a healthy government.
This might be a hot take, but America needs a strong Republican Party to help balance the government.
I left that party because of their denial of scientific facts like COVID and global warming, and refuse to ever go back.
But we need more decent people like Mitt Romney in that party to help push back on the crazies.
