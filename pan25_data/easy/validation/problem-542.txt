When Putin rose to power, lots of people in the West saw him as a technocrat, the kind of person who could engineer a Japanese-style rise from the ashes of defeat to a peaceful economic superpower.
And if he'd bothered to learn the lessons of how Japan did that, he could have engineered that.
Instead, he decided that his ideal model for how to govern would be the USSR, and never was smart enough to realize that the USSR failed, and doing the same thing over again was just going to lead to another failure.
Yeah him.
He didn't think putin would turn out to be such a machiavellian figure ans try to be a conqueror and tsar.
Incredible.
There's nothing I can say to open his eyes.
Ah, to quote him "by the way they say Putin is a dictator, it's not true, things work differently there but here people don't understand it" ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Very different people/situation though.
Just population density would make a huge difference, plus Japan was thoroughly defeated and the allies completely took over and set the agenda.
