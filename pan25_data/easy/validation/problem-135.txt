This assumes that Putin is 100% responsible by himself without this being orchestrated by a group of government elites which is much more realistic.
In 2022, one single human doesn’t on their own accord create this whole plan and manage it on their own.
There’s a group of government agents all close to him and his circle that are pulling a lot of the strings.
This isn’t a “one man job”.
Russian nukes probably can’t be armed without authorization, so even if they fired a missile with a nuke still attached by mistake it would be like a small dirty bomb where it would ineffectually spread radioactive material in a small area, but would not cause a nuclear reaction.
Thank you very much.
If that's really MoD official account they are laughing stock now.
No one stores live warheads on the missile airframes.
As I said before - they are coming in a form of kits.
Mission is confirmed, airframe is prepared, warhead is programmed and installed, bomber is configured for the mission, bomber is generated.
That's how it works in UK, US and Russia.
