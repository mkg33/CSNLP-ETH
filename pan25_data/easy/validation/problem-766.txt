The most unabashed liars and egregiously fake politicians are conservatives.
Pretty interesting how he played the fake race card for conservatives.
I thought they'd prefer not to act too woke by voting for a "Jew.

Side note, I made a crack on Twitter about the status of the other members of the Republican Jewish Caucus that Kevin McCarthy cited last month given the GOP’s dishonesty and knowledge of Santos lying, got a reply telling me I’m naive and that the Democrats are a wing of the same bird as the Republicans, and when I asked if they condemn Santos and the GOP, they said they condemn it no matter what party.
But stayed silent after I asked what they think of Santos and the party.
I am laughing a bit at just how they’re going full “what about” to deflect, and I want to see what best they can come up with, like a drinking game.
