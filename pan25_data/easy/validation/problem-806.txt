Well technically, Tokyo Olympics were held after the original invasion in 2014.
The elite athletes being employed by military/police/some parts of state is not out of the norm since USSR days.
Almost half the medals Russia won at Tokyo Olympics were won by athletes "employed" by Russian military or police.
It's a joke that they were allowed to compete by IOC AFTER the systematic doping/cheating scandal.
Ban them and ban them all.
IOC want to make this about international policy but without any consideration of the personal realities of the competitors.
There are a number of possible outcomes potentially fatal for the Russian athletes.
If they go back home and tell the truth about the war they will all fall out of windows.
They could defect either individually or en masse.
To prevent this their families will be held hostage.
Indeed the athletes will have to have family that can be held hostage.
But if they do return to Russia they will have won gold medals and be heroes.
Putin will view them with suspicion and distrust.
