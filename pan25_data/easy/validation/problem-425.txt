US (and UN for that matter) have a million and one reason to deal with Iran once and for all in backlog.
They don't need to manufacture a pretext.
They actively chose not to.
I see, you are just a red apologist and anti-americanist and switch the truth anyhow, so it fits into you anti-western and pro-"communist" - so pro Soviet-following-states - following decades of propaganda and falsification of history and reality.
I don't bother myself going further in that "discussion" with you.
You obviously are not interested in facts, but in anti-western and pro-communistoimperialistic bull crap.
I’m not sure what to think.
First of all I question the source.
The article sources “German media outlets” but doesn’t name them and the only other news about this is almost verbatim for this article, from Israeli media.
Second, the recent talk about designating IRGC terrorists mentions acts that many countries have been guilty of, and I don’t see any discussion of designating Saudi Arabia or Israel as state sponsors of terrorism.
This article reeks of propaganda.
