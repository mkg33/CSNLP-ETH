Depends what you're looking for.
I tried Argentina because I speak enough Spanish but I absolutely hated it - the food (outside of steak and ice cream and wine) is awful, restaurants don't open until 8 PM (with a baby, that was hard), and every restaurant has the same 3-4 bland things.
Now I'm in Malaysia which I absolutely adore and am sad to leave.
Everyone speaks English, but if you can get a gig in one of the international schools, you'll be paid well (extremely well for the local cost of living, which is super low) and can live well and save bundles.
I know China is always hiring and pays really well for the cost of living, but it is China and there are associated issues there.
I had a friend who adored Cameroon when she taught there and it allowed her to pay off her 30k credit card debt in a year.
Exactly.
If they lowered professional qualifications for doctors and nurses to fix the shortage, how do you think that would end?
Funny there’s never a shortage of CEO’s.
Wonder why that is.
