They've lost THREE THOUSAND tanks???
300 aircraft????
over 250 Helicopters???
Wtf?
How are can afford all these losses?
And how can they replace them?
3 fucking thousand tanks???
?
That wouldn't include training which is the biggest part of a operators value, but using the Value of Life for Russia at $40,000 each soldier at 4 people for a tank is $252,640,000 meaning total lost is $1,277,870,002 but even then you still need to calculate the ammo and equipment of onboard.
Since I used the minimum value for everything I would take a guess and say the total value of Russia tank losses would be $2,500,000,000 but this is a guess.
So, I guess Russian tanks are actually pretty cheap a T-62 is only like $300,000 and a T-72 is only $500,000 - $1.2 million, this is what Wikipedia tells me at least.
I used the Oryx blog and Wikipedia to calculate how much money all the destroyed/damaged/abandoned/captured costed Russia.
I did not include the unknown tanks in the cost.
