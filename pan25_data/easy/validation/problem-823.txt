My pet theory is that what isn’t being articulated is that once the democrats abandoned labor and traded it for heavier identity politics (neo liberalism), a lot of workers who harbor angry bigoted stuff anyway are spite voting to send a message to the democratic establishment that isn’t being heard and gets turned into sOcIaLiSM.
This didn’t happen in a vacuum.
The Democratic Party is infuriatingly inept and the Republican Party was cunning in helping engineer all this.
So now you have workers actively screaming and voting against their interests they cared about in the first place, and that conclusion is nothing that anyone hasn’t said before.
But how we got there is worth understanding and I’m just theorizing.
