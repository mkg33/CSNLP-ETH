To be honest any lawyer that takes in any work for Trump and or his organisation and doesn't charge time and a half and get funds on account all the way through, together with a retainer that allows them to put a lein on his assets for any liability incurred by them in the course of carrying out his instructions has almost a little intelligence as Trump has.
Step 3.
When the lawsuit is inevitably thrown out of court, Trump pockets the money his supporters "donated".
When he is forced to pay reparations, like in this most recent case with Hillary Clinton, odds are his supporters probably donated far more money than what he is being forced to pay.
So Trump simply pays the reparations from donated money and still makes a profit.
Interesting idea.
If trump sues her for the sanctions, that would trigger the malpractice insurance coverage.
It wouldn't cover her liability to the court for the sanctions because, like car insurance, it's there in case you get sued.
