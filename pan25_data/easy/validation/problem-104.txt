Jordan only had six votes in the first round.
Some other republicans besides McCarthy also received votes.
Jordan endorsed McCarthy in an address after that first round saying they should toe the line to get a republican in.
Gaetz then spoke and said he’s still voting for Jordan on principal.
By the third round Jordan had 20 votes (I heard 20), I think because all the other non-McCarthy votes consolidated their effort onto Jordan, and possibly because McCarthy lost one.
He had 203 votes in the first round and 202 in the third… stay tuned for more casually incorrect speculation from someone who watched the stream.
