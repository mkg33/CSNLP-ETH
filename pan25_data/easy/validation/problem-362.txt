Third is the playing of the history card by the Polish government.
76 years after World War II ended, it wants to create a War Losses Institute to pursue ‘the [financial] balance of the German and Soviet occupation’.
Such an institution is not only a tool of instrumentalising history for political goals but also a manifestation of the geopolitical imagination of the Polish national-conservatives.
‘Lifting the country from its knees’ is the guiding principle in the making of their foreign policy.
Theatrical as this might sound, these claims will long taint Polish-German relations.
Net contributions don't really matter, %GDP contributions matter.
Do you have those numbers, just curious.
It'd be like arguing that the USA is putting its fair share into NATO if it cut its contributions by 1000%.
It'd still be putting in more than poorer nations.
But the actual amount isn't what matters... it's the amount vs gdp.
Obviously Iceland isn't going to put in as much as Germany, but by only looking at total amounts, you are overlooking that vital part of it.
Polish victim and inferiority complex.
Someone wronged them 80 years ago and ever since, Nationalists are milking that for votes.
