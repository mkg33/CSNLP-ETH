I don’t think we can, really.
Green energy sources are becoming cheaper and more common everyday.
Hopefully the transition to electric vehicles and better public transportation will make gas consumption either obsolete or of minor consequence.
But until that day arrives, the world’s gotta keep turning.
And ceding control to Russia or SA in such turbulent times just isn’t acceptable.
But what matters is we’re still moving forward.
Time and context matters when discussing our evolving environmental policies and geopolitical relationships.
How?
You do realize we still need to drill for oil as we also transition to EV.
Most cars on the road are still gas.
Companies will be introducing more and more EV cars in the near future, and eventually you'll see more EV pumps at gas stations.
This is when we'll finally see a slowing of oil production.
This could be 10 or more years away.
Limiting oil drilling now just puts the world in a global energy crisis.
