Trump’s success relied on the heavy and still present distrust of media and government, and he clinged onto that to say he was not a politician and was an outsider to drain the swamp and change the system.
The polls said he didn't stand a chance against Hillary and media personalities made fun of him.
This fueled his win.
I dont think FoxNews appearing to reject him and MSNBC not airing his announcement is going to hurt him as bas as some are hoping.
He will use this to constantly say (especially on twitter) that it is more proof that he is anti-establishment.
Now, there are many reasons why sensible people would not fall for this but a lot of Americans, including Democrats, are not very sensible and also vote against their own best self interests, especially if they have enough fear thrown at them.
Trump is going to try to hit back harder if he is ignored.
His past is a consistent showing of him turning on the people who have helped him if he thinks throwing them under the bus will help him.
He is a man who demands unwavering loyalty while he is loyal to no one.
Remember, when he finally could come up with his favorite passage from the Bible, he chose the very un-Christian passage about revenge (“an eye for an eye”) that Jesus said would no longer be the way.
There’s no telling what he will do or who he will ask help from to win again because he fuckin’ has to, egotistically and financially.
