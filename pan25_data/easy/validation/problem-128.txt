Iâ€™m not just referring to the states.
Germany, UK, Canada, etc.
all should have gone with nuclear when we knew climate change was staring us in the face.
We could have let developing countries use gas as a transition fuel instead of coal while we eliminated co2 from our economy entirely with vehicles and other production (similar to how Montreal agreement was structured to have developed countries lead the way while developing transition).
Where are they taking that average from?
What language are the IQ tests written in?
Which IQ tests are they using in the study?
Do you have a link to the study in question?
>Following alarm over the loss of ozone in the 1980s, the ozone layer has been steadily improving in the wake of the 1989 Montreal protocol, an international agreement that has helped eliminate 99% of ozone-depleting chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that were used as solvents and refrigerants.
This right here.
It's possible to fix issues on a global scale with small incremental changes towards a future goal.
Today's climate issues are reversable but the collective will is lacking by the biggest contributers to the problem.
