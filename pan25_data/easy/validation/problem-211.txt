These exist and are called mobile substations.

Getting 6 million people back on in 24 hours seems like transmission line repairs to me.
It’s an insane amount of customers to get back on in that short of a timeframe.
It’s believable.
For example, one line or switching box could be replaced and restore power to millions.
But it’s also propaganda.
Reality is never this easy to repair damage from missile strikes in less than a day.
Power plants are not quick or easy to build.
There may be patchwork repairs, but over time the spare parts are going to run out.
We shouldn’t be downplaying this as if Ukraine is just shrugging off the attacks like they’re nothing.
It’s serious business and people will die from lack of power and water - especially if water freezes in pipes.
Unsurprisingly.
As many volunteers as there are for their military, there's bound to be even more for the many civil and infrastructure projects necessary to keep up the war effort.
With a well-motivated populace like this, the only bottlenecks become material and transportation, both of which appear to be helped by Ukraine's benefactors.

At least in Bayamon, i havent heard about any huge blackouts around the area, but maybe ive missed it?
