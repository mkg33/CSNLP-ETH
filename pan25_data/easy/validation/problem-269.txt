I wonder what the USs playbook is here.
Either there is legit Intel of this happening, and they're throwing it out in the open as a passive aggressive message to China to not go through with it.
Or there is currently no actual evidence of such intentions, but it intentionally creates the narrative that there is, pressuring China to prevent even entertaining the idea of arming Russia.
Same here.
I'm in an already low cost of living state and have no problem shopping across multiple stores for the best deals.
Over this past year, Walmart has definitely made it into my grocery rotation.
In my area, Walmart was the only place that still had decently priced eggs and milk while Aldi, literally across the street, was almost double.
I think most people would much rather buy local, they just can't afford to.
> Remember the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)?
That was intended to partner with Asian countries to counter China, very helpful in situations like this.
When the former guy cancelled the initiative, those same nations partnered with China against us.
The smaller nations just needed a big brother to keep everyone honest.
It's ridiculous to think that war is the only option.
