Plus 2010 really scared Putin, he was afraid Orange revolution (Ukraine), Roses revolution (Georgia), and others like that would find their way into Russia.

It’s small but it’s a start.
Edit: USSR restored diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia in 1955, which they had previously severed due to ideological difference between Stalin and Tito.
