Even worse.
Exxon Mobil in like the 70s did their own scientific studies into fossil fuels and climate change.
Iirc they predicted earths atmospheric concentration of CO2 and the effects it would have as a result of fossil fuel use.
The data showed their industry would be devastating to our climate and humanity itself writhing 100 years so they hid the data and lied for decades before it was unearthed.
Then they started lying about being climate conscious and as of fossil fuel industry communications between execs released a few weeks ago we now know they have 0 interest in climate conscious solutions and will milk every dollar out of the air we breathe while building bunkers because they’re afraid of what they’re bringing upon us.
Twice my fucking age.
It’s been 40 years, and I’ll have to watch the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands people die and suffer for another 40 years.
They knew they were killing the planet and continued to.
Far as I’m concerned, life in prison only barely approaches justice.
For all the people who’ve suffered and will suffer, they’ve taken away thousands of years of life, and they can never give it back.
