this is a trend that's been building for 21 years.
right after 9/11 we were told we had to pass the PATRIOT Act to stop future acts of international terrorism.
The first thing Ashcroft(AG at the time) did was send out a group of DoJ lawyers to every state AG and a lot of DAs in big cities.
The point was to teach these people how to use the PATRIOT Act to go after run of the mill criminals and how these extreme sentences could be used as "Enhancement", extra charges that force suspects to take plea deals.
most of the people the PA has been used against are just normal criminals doing normal dumbass crime shit.
it's is not shocking at all the the Georgia AG is doing this.
when you're facing life in prison for terrorism you've got a hell of an incentive to take a plea regardless of your guilt, the gamble is just too big for sane people to try and fight these charges.
