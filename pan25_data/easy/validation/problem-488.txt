They're told from the time they are children that if a man has a sexual thought about a woman then it is the sin of the woman.
This is not the extremists, this is normal Islamic thought.
I have lived in Islamic countries, and this is totally normal.
It is no wonder that the extremists are able to feel devoid of responsibility for their actions.
They just say, we wouldn't be this way if not for the evil women, they deserve it, it is their fault.
This is why you can't have a religion based on inequality.
Everyone needs to stop with these backwards ancient sexist violent fairytales.
Everyone.
Please.
You mean ppl in a position of power in a human right violating religious extremist country that suppresses sexuality are molesting prisoners?
!
You can blame atheists all you want(I'm not an atheists, it is as ridiculous to say there cant be a god as it is to say you know exactly what the god wants), but show me where any large group of atheists claim that women are subservient to men and that if they aren't then they deserve to have an infinitely powerful force torturing them for a long, long time.
You can't.
You need religion for that.
Help save this boat or f out of the way.
