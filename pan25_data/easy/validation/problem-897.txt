You laugh, but technically it is part of their doctrine that you can't retreat without specific orders to do so: if your communications are down or your commanders are dead you're just kind of expected to hold on to your position until you die or run out of munitions and weapons.
Sure.
But the main reason the US runs theirs on JP-8 is for simplified logistics, because it's the same fuel that their jets use.
The Australians for example run their M1s on diesel.

True.
Though I guess the Asian tanks did not only have Russians in mind.
And not European geography.
And Leopard 2's aren't exactly light on the fuel either.
An M1A2's operational range on the road is 426km with a 1,909 liter fuel tank.
A Leo 2A6 does 340km on a 1,200 liter tank, that's only about 21% less fuel per kilometer.
And the M1 can use almost anything that is liquid and burns, while the Leo 2 requires diesel.
