not sure what that has to do with this article.
If the restaurant can't say vegan chicken then they will say "protein strips" or something.
you still won't know what it is.
We need to stop the torture/abuse of animals, stop the PTSD of slaughterhouse workers, Reduce our GHG emissions, Recover land being used to grow crops for livestock and cattle grazing, Stop the pollution of rivers and oceans, Reduce our risk of ANOTHER zoonotic disease that can grow/thrive in animal agriculture.
It's just about branding.
You want the title to be short and not a mouthful.
And sometimes it's hard to make a good sounding noun if we can't use the words from meat, steak or burger.
Like "chicken flavoured pea-protein slab"?
Yum lol.
Same bullshit in France, meat industry lobbies pressure lawmakers to ban packages saying "vegetal steak" or "vegetal bacon" because it allegedly misdirects consumers...
It does happens sometimes yeah.
everything happens eventually.
I bought some Quorn "chiqin" patties once thinking they were chicken.
they were really good lol.
Would legislation forcing vegan/vegetarian/plant based to be in the title in equal sized font to whatever the meat is (or in this case "burger") not be a much more reasonable solution than trying to cripple their ability to brand effectively?
