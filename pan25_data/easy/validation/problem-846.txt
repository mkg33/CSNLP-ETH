But everyone does not like the war, and the actions of the West to close from the Russians are incomprehensible to me.
It is easier to accept good Russians, to bleed Russia in this way, to accept several million directly, than to impose sanctions.
Yes, even if you accept all Russians, even ideologists of war.
If the USA, Canada, Australia, and European countries would accept all 147 million Russians, then there would be no one to spy on someone.
At the same time, out of 147 million, send war criminals directly to The Hague.
Of course, I sympathize with the Netherlands, there will have to build a lot of prisons.
And I hope that Ukrainian channels will be turned on to all prisoners there, but at the same time, the same situation as with Breivik in Norway will not be allowed.
Breivik killed many people, and many years ago he demanded to replace his PS2 with a PS3, otherwise he would starve to death.
What I'm saying is that think about the fact that a person who is fighting Putin's regime clearly deserves some understanding and compassion.
There are few who will hate you, because any non-violent person clearly cannot support Putin.
Here you have nothing against Russians in general, and I, as a Russian, have a lot against many Russians precisely because they continue to destroy my brain by saying that Ukraine is a terrible country and it needs to be destroyed.
Of course, I try to stop communicating with these people, because arguments don't work, and I don't like to shout.
