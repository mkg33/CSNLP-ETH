I am staunchly pro-choice, but one would have to be delusional to truly think that having an abortion is merely a minor medical procedure like any other.
Terminating a pregnancy is not the same thing as having a mole removed from your backside.
For many women, it is a traumatic experience and more than a few end up dealing with strong feelings of guilt, or even remorse, after having one.
Making sure that every would-be patient has a chance to have all the information they need, has a chance to have all their questions answered before they put on the hospital gown, and is compelled to spend a few days making sure it is the right decision for them before they step into the clinic for the procedure seems pretty reasonable.
No.
This is still a completely different scenario than having it be illegal to receive or perform.
Not to mention that traveling to another region for a procedure if needed for the reasons listed is vastly more accessible due to cost and distance, and even trying to do so would also be illegal in some of the US states we're discussing.
