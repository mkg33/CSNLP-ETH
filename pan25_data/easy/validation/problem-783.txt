The irony of course is that Trump's incompetence, hubris and unwillingness to listen to expert advice probably also kept the US from starting any new wars during his Presidency.
It's funny that the moment Biden becomes President and he re-establishes the practice of listening to US intelligence and "expert" advice, the US ends up in a proxy war with Russia.
This was the same expert advice that led the US Govt to engage in wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya - which were all disasters.
Maybe there's something to be said for not listening to the experts.
If only we could find a President that was competent, thoughtful, had good ideas and could act independently of the establishment experts, especially on foreign policy.
100%!

I think we all needed a bit of a mental break from the orange shitgobblin but I can’t stand these hypocrites.
I’ll never take a single word they say seriously.
