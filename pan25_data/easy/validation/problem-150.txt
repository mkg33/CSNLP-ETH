100k people...
I can't even imagine that.
A football stadium of people just turned to meat... 100k people like people I have met in my life.
All of them.. the best... the worst... drug addicted... rich.. poor... and those just trying to live.
Exactly.
There's been too much raping, torturing and murder for me to have any sympathy for those soldiers.
They've been offered every opportunity to surrender, or just have the basic humanity to, you know, not rape torture or murder the civilians.
But they do it anyways.
Fuck em.
Russian governance has historically amazing at causing the unnecessary death of thousands of its own citizens in almost everything it does wether it be a war, economic restructuring, political purge, intentional famine, unintentional famine, population transfer, ethnic cleansing, infrastructure project, thursday etc.
etc.
I wouldn’t have gone, straight deserted.
I’ll be damned dying for a despot.
Hell I wouldn’t die for any war unless attacked on my own soil.
Screw that noises.
