A 'mess' is a polite way of putting, paint the streets in viscera and bone.
Let's indulge a nightmare scenario where on January 6th rioters got to VP Pence.
Let's further indulge that every person in his security detail is sympathetic with the rioters and don't paint the walls with pieces of their internal organs.
Let's imagine what effect a VP hanging from a noose would actually have on a nation.
I'm not sure there are words in the English language to appropriately describe the bowls of Tartarus that would be unleashed at that point.
At that point, I'm pretty sure the intelligence agencies and military are no longer taking direction from POTUS as he's just removed his own VP from the census for not defying his constitutional duty to approve the electoral count.
Blackhawks, unholy arbiters of death called in by well connected members with the MIC, and 'contractors' would flood to the Capitol.
The bodies buried that day, would form a foundation of reform that would have made America something notably different from what we know now.
