I don't care at all about Hunter.
I got in debates with conservatives at the time because I don't care at all about Hunter.
What I do get concerned about is when it turns out twitter had censorship policies towards the story and when the media acts as clear partisan cheerleaders for Biden and does not present the story as true (which it was) to their audience and let them decide for themselves if they care.
Thank you.
Your opening sentence answered a question I've been asking myself... "what type of drug would/ could Elon be strung out on ?
".
I'm a moderate conservative.
I don't want people saying racial slurs and russian bots on major social media platforms.
I also want to ensure that the left does not use its power of censor to close off discussion of conservative talking points.
The left has done that when it had power the i.e the Hunter Biden story (proven true) Lab Leak (has fairly strong evidence to point to it being at least plausible).
If thats the situation I'm going to vote to prevent the left touching anything speech related with a 10 ft pole.
So whats your proposal that I could reasonably support?
