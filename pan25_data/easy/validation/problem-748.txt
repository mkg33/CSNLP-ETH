There's also another video about of some Ukrainians laughing themselves to death as they test like 2-3 captured Russian plates stacked on top of each other and they failed to stop a 5.56 round.
There's a vid about of some Wagner guys comparison testing their own body armour and captured Ukrainian stuff.
The Wagner guys are genuinely shocked that a ballistic plate can stop 5.45 point blank.
Their own plates didn't.
I agree and it's a good point, but last I heard Russia is starting to run a pretty substantial deficit, which - I think - will eventually limit their ability to import key components without simultaneously forcing the general population to lower their quality of life in very notable ways.
And the Leopard 2s.
Very similar capabilities but the Ukrainians will probably have an easier time maintaining them.
Abrams has a turbine engine thatâ€™ll need different tools, parts, and expertise to maintain than the diesel one in the Leopard 2.
Tons of diesel vehicles already on the ground there.
