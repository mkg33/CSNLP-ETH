Most of the right wing nutjobs in our political system are at the moment doing what they can to distance themselves from the terrorists, not because of any moral wakeup but because they are fully aware that there will be criminal consequences for this.
The governor of our Federal district, has already fired his security secretary, the very same guy that he was warned NOT to nominate to that position by our supreme court because of his utter and complete lack of action against right wing terrorists when he was Minister of Justice under Bolsonaro, he did this not because he realized the guy is a traitor to the nation, but because he needs someone to take the fall so that the blame doesn't land on his desk.
Oh, good.
A J6 in other countries due to disinformation and fascism soaking up brains of idiots.
Fuck these people and the cults they create.
Looking at you too, MAGA.
President Lula has declared a federal intervention in the security situation of the Federal district, this effectively places the security forces of the state under the command of the Federal government.
