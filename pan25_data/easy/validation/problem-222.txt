Hey, thank you for caring about her She's on medication, she is depressed but she is also aware of it and we're working on it.
As I mentioned, I'm her sister-in-law, but we have a pretty great relationship because I wanted to make sure she had "an adult" to talk to if she needed that isn't immediate family.
I'm 30 ftr, and she's called a few times Being away from home is a first for her, so we're trying to give her space and freedom while also making it clear that we love her and are around and will help.
My husband (her big brother) and my best friend/other SIL also live in the same town so she has a safety net here.

The "youth vote" is characterized, specifically, by not being "jaded", because they necessarily can't have participated before.
The reason they don't show up and vote is because they don't have experience doing so.
The "youth vote" will always be people who don't have experience voting.
They are the people you get out for the first time.
To paraphrase, "that's what sucks about youth voters, man.
You get older, but they stay the same age.
