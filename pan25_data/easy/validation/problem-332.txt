putin, during these cold months, has his maximum leverage to trade nearby countries, giving gas in return for loyalty and troops.
putin is amassing hundreds of thousands of other countries' troops, N.Korea is providing troops and arms, China is providing tons of winter gear for the troops.
By February, putin will swarm Ukraine from all sides.
Watch if Hungary signs for gas (they need heat) and watch the Black Sea for Naval and ground troops to storm Moldova into Ukraine.
Just before the swarm you will see training in other countries and war games.
Kick putin.
Another interesting question could be regular law enforcement (police), when is the military at a point at which the regular police might be better at holding a city they effectively already control?
Puti is a gambler.
He won in Georgia, Chechnya(twice), Syria, Africa, Venezuela (politically), took Crimea.
Where else has he poked his nose?
Now Ukraine.
The body count to date is over a million souls!
The ground at the Kremlin will be shaking when he passes on...
