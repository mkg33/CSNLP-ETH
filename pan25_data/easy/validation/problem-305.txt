This is why I fucking hate social conservatives who point out JAPAN-JAPAN-JAPAN GREAT EXAMPLE OF LIBERAL POLICY SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PARTY IN POWER IS THE Japanese Liberal Democratic Party!
Look man Japan is fucking conservative, and the Japanese Liberal Democratic party is Conservative as well despite their name.
yeah, the problem with Japan is their conservatives wanting to keep Japan homogenously Japanese.
Compare and contrast with another WW2 loser Germany, They also had great big economic growth and the same population pyramid problems as Japan except their liberal policy of letting the migrants in is effectively keeping the shrinking population pain away.
A home is the primary one for me.
Owning a property without a mind grippingly mortgage just isnâ€™t attainable without huge inheritance, or other financial help.
Yeah I know.
I have an income that is much above minimum wage, and even I am struggling to find houses I can afford.
I legitimately cannot fathom how people on minimum wage get by, it needs to go up.
Basically capitalism demands it.
In order for old people to retire (getting money for doing nothing) there needs to be young people working and paying for the old people.
