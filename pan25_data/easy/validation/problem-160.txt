Iâ€™ve always favored the ego explanation myself personally.
But the thing is, showing those documents off to a pretty woman (spy) or a more open representative of some strongman he wants to impress is also on the table in that scenario.
And very likely did happen.
Nowhere is ego mentioned as a defense or mitigating factor in the statutes or case law pertaining to theft of government documents, possession of classified material, etc.
Just an FYI.
Do not EVER report any rule-breaking content on that sub.
Reddit admin will suspend your account, as they did mine.
I'm lucky, that it's a temp ban, that will be lifted on Monday.
It would seem Reddit is siding with that sub, since they won't even respond back to my appeal.
Even their suspension message included the rule-breaking comment (which got that user permabanned).
So, again, if you see any rule-breaking behavior, just block the user, as Admin are fucking useless.
