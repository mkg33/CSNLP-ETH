In a weird round-a-bout way, this bill might help poly marriages get recognized too.

Please if you have any questions or concerns.
California has a somewhat similar law, that says "a legal marriage from another country will be recognized as legal marriage in California" The California law has been used to get California to legally recognize the marriages between a polygamist man and his wives as valid under the law.
