Not quite.
The problem is that the state attorney is a state official, and while the judge found that DeSantis violated the first amendment, another part of federal law gives states supremacy in appointing or electing state officials- so as a federal judge, he had no authority to provide the requested relief (reinstatement) - doing so would have been a constitutional violation on the judges part.
Had the case been about a normal citizen of the state (not an official), the judge would have had authority to grant some sort of relief.
Terrible headline.
The suspension was not upheld, which suggests that the suspension is lawful.
The court said it was unlawful but that the remedy has to be sought in a state court; it said federal courts do not have jurisdiction over the issue.
