I haven’t been able to find the source, but after the losing the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton gave an interview in a Netflix documentary where she shared a story about Putin’s family.
In the story, I believe the father or grandfather that came back after the war, and he wasn’t able to save one of their family members.
I believe that Hillary Clinton shared that she was of the opinion that Putin saw himself as the father, and Russia as that family member.
For what it’s worth, Putin DOES see himself as representing the Russian people, and he does see the Russian land as a kind of motherland.
He is in that sense closer to, say, Hitler than say or Stalin or Mao.
He doesn’t see the idea of a “motherland” as functional to himself, but as a function of itself.
Including Russia.
It would make Russia the enemy of the whole world.
There would be nobody left in their camp.
Not India, not China, not North Korea.
