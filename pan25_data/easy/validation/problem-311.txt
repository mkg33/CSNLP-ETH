It likely did provide some form of protection at the time.
I remember seeing entire flocks of Canadian Geese dead or dying and people in hazmat suits disposing of them.
The thing about influenza is that its RNA is so fragile that it mutates quickly.
It's called antigenic drift and when influenza gets into a significant population (significant human-to-human transmission) it's enough antigenic drift for former vaccines to be less (or not at all effective).
This is why every year there is a new vaccine for the prevalent flu strains.
Luckily influenza almost always mutates into a lesser virulent (and less deadly) version but what is worrying especially about H5N1 is that it is almost completely novel to humans and there is no built-in protection from it.
I think it was 1999.
It's been nonstop polycrisis since 2000 when SCOTUS stole the election.
They ruined so many opportunities for a better world, and now we're stuck in a non-stop polycrisis carnival.
Not to be all doom and gloom, it should be noted that science and technology have made amazing progress, and if we get lucky have the potential to solve a lot of our most intractable crises (imagine what limitless fusion energy/clean hydrogen alone could do for the world --not more oil wars for starters).
