I'm surprised nothing as large as this has happened before.
I guess Palestinians killing two civilians, filming their bodies mocking them, then dancing in the street.. crossed a line.
Still, cars can be replaced.
Let's be thankful that the settlers have not copied the Palestinians and started shooting at Palestinian civilians at bus stops, restaurants or stabbing them to death in their bedrooms.
This year the Palestinians have killed a 5 year old and 6 year old at a bus stop, a 15 year old at bus stop, a 14 year old in a synagogue, a 16 year old and his older brother yesterday and then filmed their bodies as they mocked them.
And that's just the children they have killed this year.
Exactly.
That’s why there are jewish archeological sites in Israel/Judea and Samaria that are dated thousands of years before there was any Palestine.
LMAO.
It’s “funny” that “leftists” Israeli who blocked highways and burned some woods in the middle of the road last Saturday night to opposes the Israeli government anti democracy plan were called as anarchist and throwing tantrum and all the bad stuff by probably the same people who supported this settlers violence behavior burning random cars on the street.
And they probably praise this settlers behavior as an act of heroism.
