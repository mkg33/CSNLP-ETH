Also I don’t think it’s fair to compare actual dictators to political families.
Although there are certainly similarities.
The KMT had a lot of issues even before the Japanese invaded.
The Japanese invasion exacerbated those issues.
I know, I've also read the article.
The KMT also transformed Taiwan into a democracy, under the leadership of Chiang's son.
Not exactly a very fascist thing to do.
Sure, but how does that make them fascist exactly?
And if you are living in Taiwan, you would also know that a lot of the young anti-China crowd voted against the ruling DPP this time.
Just check the discussions on Dcard.
According to Academia Historica's curator of the related historical documents, it's highly likely that US pressure due to the assassination was the main factor that forced Chiang to change course and head towards opening up and democratizing Taiwan.
Yep.
That’s pretty much the case for every dictator that came into existence outside of the usual monarchs.
Populism regardless of ideological beliefs and leanings tend to do that.
