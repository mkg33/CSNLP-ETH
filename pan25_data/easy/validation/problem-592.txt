…that’s how strikes work.
If workers could strike and it wouldn’t affect the business or consumers then what leverage do they even have?
That’s why this is so fucking disgusting of Biden and the government and media and selfish people.
The workers had the company RIGHT where they wanted them and would finally get the benefits and compensation that they deserved.
But then the government says “whoa, this will affect other people.
Let’s force them to sign it”.
That’s an awful precedent to set.
It’s almost like saying as a worker you will NEVER have anything good happen to you.
The employer will ALWAYS have the leverage.
What Biden should have done is framed it as “the rail companies are willing to hold your Christmas hostage and raise inflation just to avoid giving out sick days to hard working Americans who don’t have any sick days.” Because yes, if the company gave out the sick days then this would be a non issue.
But they are too fucking greedy and sadistic to treat their employees like people.
