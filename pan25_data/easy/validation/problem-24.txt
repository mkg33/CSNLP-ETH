I grew up in the Midwest and various science teachers throughout the years would give lessons on creationism.
My middle school science teacher said "the state requires that I teach you about evolution, so I'll go over that really quick.
But then I'll give a lesson on creationism just to keep your minds open to the options."
my 'Family and Consumer Science' teacher gave a lesson on how evil abortion is, every school event included more than one instance of the principal getting on stage and asking everyone to pray together, I had classmates who wore Nazi memorabilia and rolled their eyes during history lessons about the Holocaust, there were only five or six students who weren't white, students would sharpie out the science textbook's chapter on evolution while the aforementioned teacher watched and said nothing, I could go on.
And this is a public school.
I had no other school options because everything is so spread out in the Midwest.
This was the closest and only option, and it was about 10 miles from my house.
The next closest was like 45 minutes away.
