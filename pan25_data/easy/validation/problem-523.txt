Still that's no excuse to close the legislative Power, besides, there's no way to ensure a dictator to renounce to it's new powers or to avoid an abuse of them, just look at Lenin, Castro, Pinochet or Mussolini.
Long live authoritarian rulers who controll all aspects of the states because obviously that´s what Peruvians want, release Pedro Castillo and give him the powers to make all the laws that he wants without supervision, give him total control over the military and police, destroy the courts and screw the constitution.
many in Perú don´t want Castillo back, neither they want the new president, the want presidencial elections, after all, they didn´t choose her, She was put as vice-president by Castillo and they are both from the same party, It´s logical to at least for the goverment to renew the democratic mandate and restore order choosing a new president.
It´s way more funny to see how you support a guy who wanted to become a dictator and close the congress without the approval of the people, there´s no guarantee that he will renounce to his new powers in the long run, also the new president wasn´t elected because you can´t organize an election in one day and someone must occupy the office, also She was the vice president who was put in charge by the same Pedro so It´s still the same party in power.
Let´s see your reaction if trump or some far right extremists does the same.
Chinas democracy is peoples democratic dictorship.
They do treat people well based on the hash conditions made by the west, sanctions, military aggression, and political sabotage.
The west would and did do the same things in the name of state of emergency.
Yes something we agree and feel the same upon the Scandinavian countries who welfare society made by exploitation of third world countries.
