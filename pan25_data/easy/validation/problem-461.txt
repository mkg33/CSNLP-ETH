We shouldn't be.
The sale of vital infrastructure to foreign nations is a national security risk.
Even if they don't use it against us directly, if we ever have to forcefully nationalize a company and seize it from a foreign government, it will impact our ability to trade in the future.
Lol.
What a brain dead take.
Iraq was about preventing Sadam from cornering the oil market with non-petrodollars you twit.
Realpolitik.
At best, the extremist green stance of 'just invest it _all_ in solar and wind' can say 'told you so': We are 2 orders of magnitude away from being capable of replacing the energy needs of the world, certainly of 'the west', with renewables in a short time span, it's __utterly__ impossible to do that.
We can do it in a decade or two and we should do that (and we are, and we should probably go faster).
But that is __irrelevant__ for the short term political reality of the situation the world finds itself in today.
"Just freeze to death for 9 winters but then we might be able to unthaw you with our fancy new solar and wind systems" is cold comfort.
