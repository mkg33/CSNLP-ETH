Correct, the religious right's racism was how the GOP enticed them to into their fold (where previously they were mostly apolitical).
That's why I said a big part of the schism is internal to individual GOP congress members; their racist side wants a weaker federal government while their religious sides wants a stronger one.
Right now a big issue is there's a fundamental schism within the Republican party over the role of the federal government.
Ever since the civil rights era, the GOP has been against the federal government because they're mad all their states' Jim Crow laws got invalided by things like Brown v. Board of Education and the Civil Rights Acts.
They want to weaken the reach of the federal government so they can revive Jim Crow.
Big business interests have also latched onto this goal since it means they're more free to act as they please without as much government interference.
