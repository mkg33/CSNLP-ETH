It's a reminder of the ever-present potential for a tumultuous geo-political situation in the Middle East, and of the need to be aware of the security situation when travelling in the area.
Personally, I found my visit to Tel Aviv just a few weeks ago to be a pleasant one, despite tensions in the area.
Not necessarily.
Ballistic can fly within the atmosphere, but at longer distances they probably won’t because it’s not practical.
Arrow 3 would intercept like above Iraq, whereas Arrow 2 would intercept at much closer distances to Israel.
Just for the sake of completeness, Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 would be used against long-range ballistic missiles.
In particular, Arrow 3 was designed for exo-atmospheric interceptions, which would never involve a cruise missile.
The problem is more related to the fact that Arrow 2 is designed to intercept in the upper atmosphere, whereas cruise missiles fly much lower.
David’s Sling and Patriot have targeting systems and maneuvering that are more suitable for that.
