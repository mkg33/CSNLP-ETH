'He said, "Sir, Sir!
I know I'm not deserving, Sir," He really told me this people.
He was wearing boots, big boots, white as the Adderall I snorted before coming on stage people, and we love our whites folks, believe me no one loves whites like Donald Trump.
"Mr. Trump, my campaign is sunk without your endorsement, sir.
Will you please, please give me your blessing?"
He said this with tears in his eyes, whiny tears, like his voice, snot was all over his face - it was really quite something, folks.
Certainly not strong like I am.
Which is hilarious, because Glenn Youngkin didn't run in a primary (VA GOP held a state convention with the explicit purpose of avoiding a Trump-style candidate), and Trump didn't endorse him at that convention nomination fight.
Ah.
Is this like that episode of the Simpsons where Bart has a catch phrase that dies?
I thought the “sir” and “tears in their eyes” trope was a joke now.
