White male supremacists.
It’s becoming almost bizarre that the virulent misogyny of the far-right is being ignored, Nick Fuentes is a self-declared incel that is all over youtube in podcasts and videos, he has never slept with a woman, he says women are irrational, they see everything as being personal and it’s because women were “made” to have babies, so of course women should not have the vote, and the Taliban isn’t so bad at all.
Yes he did.
As far back as 1973!
Trump has a long history of not renting to African Americans and then there was the The Central Park 5.
Trump's racist and corrupt ways have been public for decades but most people just knew him as the celebrity tv guy.
This racist, conman should never have even been close to the Presidency.
Dumbed down America voted him to the highest office in the land.
And we're still paying for it.
For somebody who supposedly a very stable genius and incredibly knowledgeable about important political issues of the day, much more so than anybody else (many people are saying it), he sure is clueless it's white supremacist organizations or persons.
They do.
I bartended for a trump event (I don’t choose my clients) a few years ago.
I had to send in paperwork two weeks prior before being in the same location as him.
