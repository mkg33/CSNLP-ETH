Foundations of geopolitics is a well known piece of Russian political literature that calls for the fracturing of other nations along different groups.
Literally textbook.
Canada has let the CCP walk all over it for decades.
The previous government talked a tough game but then behind the scenes signed the country on to a deal giving China one-way access to Canada's resources for generations, bypassing the courts, and Canadian industry got zero such access to China's market.
This was when everyone was rosey to China and the current Prime Minister openly said "There's a level of admiration I actually have for China.
Their basic dictatorship is actually allowing them to turn their economy around on a dime."
Canada's intelligence agency began giving loud warnings about CCP interference into Canada's industry, and democracy, but the warnings were ignored until recently basically.
It's coming to a head.
There is a reason Canada is not in the latest security agreement with USA, UK, Australia and New Zealand.
