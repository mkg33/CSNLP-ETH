In most places around the world stock buybacks are either illegal or regulated to the point where they are a rare event that is only used under very specific circumstances.
In the US it is just used to boost the value to stockholders and executives.
Stock buybacks should be on the whole illegal because they allow for market manipulation.
Market manipulation is a far greater ill than the benefit gained from recapitalization.
Stock buybacks should only be allowed as part of a buyout, worker co-op formation, or taking a company private.
They shouldn't be used for purposes that allow companies to manipulate stock prices and create bubbles that benefit themselves.
Unless you plan on regulating CEO and executive compensation to a percentage of worker compensation with strict market regulations you aren't going to get rid of the downsides of buybacks.
I don't think that solution is as realistic as just banning stock buybacks just because you can't sell Americans on policy wonk details.
