ya i should have been more detailed with the F4.
If I recall, due to the higher loses in Vietnam, a new fighter was needed, also better tactics than the korean war style.
I think thats when they developed the fligher school.
Lots depended upon the EWO or rear seat pilot to keep the F4 flying.
The dumb part was that they built the F4 without any guns for close up dogfight, and the buttheads in the DoD (dudheads) thought dogfighting was the thing of the past.
Even the gun pod mod was a pos.
Thus the high failure in the F4 when it went up against the Mig 23s (flown by russians & chinese).
My friend did tell me that the begining basic plan was if they encountered a Mig (radar had it limits in the F4) was to keep distance and try to finish the mish then fo.
The Mig was faster and could catch up but it also had a very limited range, so the plan was just out run it & zig zag or lead it toward US air defenses.
The story he told me was that the Migs avoided flying close to the S. Vietnam border., never chase after a Mig or your arse was to get an AA up it.. later he was transfered to West Germany and did the berlin corridor escort work where he got shot down over east germany, & held for a prisoner exchange.
decades later as we was at an air show, he went up to an old F4 wanted to show me the inside , pointed to a few places and and then he just got silent.
Exactly.
The more Putler complains about western weapons, the more we know they're working.
Let's give Ukraine everything they need to not just stop Russia but win the war.
