russians already think that they are fighting against NATO and Europe and USA so that's just straight up bullshit and another russian cope for their poorly executed offensive of Vuhledar which is not going well for them at the moment just like how Kyiv was supposed to be a feint and russians gave up Snake Island as a gesture of goodwill.Plus after all the tanks, vehicles and soldiers they poured in especially with the recent rumors that Ukraine has destroyed an supposedly advanced invincible Terminator BMP and corruption running rampant in russia and changing their economy into a wartime economy i highly doubt they are holding back unless they are talking about using nuclear weapons which is extremely unlikely that they'll resort using them as they'll gain nothing and sign their death treaty by using them.
