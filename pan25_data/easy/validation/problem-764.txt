You seem to suggest that raping is ok if you were ordered to do it which is, well, not true.
Just following orders has never been a valid excuse for war crimes.
And since there is significant evidence that Russian soldiers commit war crimes wholesale everywhere they go, I don't think it's wrong to generalize, even though if a few don't go to the extremes.
But the article does undermine that idea.
Your hope is misplaced.
I might be sorry but it’s russian collaborator Stremousov (already dead) ex governor of Kherson who first pushed biolab conspiracy, so fox news just little changed narrative of >soviet fan+man who wanted russia to conquer whole world+anti vax+ guy who tortured own underage daughter+ participated in few demonstrations with russians far right+ member of KOB sect+ man who had few public assaults on small rank politicians and lucky not to be jailed before war<.
That’s a great book.
I read it 20+ years ago and I still chuckle at Orwell writing that the side he was serving on didn’t have uniforms they had what he described as “multiforms”.
A simple phrase that perfectly illustrates the raag nature of the Spanish Civil War.
