As for regime change, why am I supposed to look at the riots in Iran again?
I didn't say that Iranians can't change their own regime - they obviously already did that, in 1979.
I'm saying that Israel can't enact a regime change, in the same way the US did in Iraq, Germany, Japan, etc.
If you're saying the Mossad can covertly support the protestors, and help them change their own regime - sure.
But that's not related to the plans to militarily attack Iran we're discussing here.
So what if it's going to use a nuclear penetrator bomb?
Even if Israel completely vaporizes every single nuclear facility, which is not at all a given, the Iranian still have the knowledge, connections and institutions to develop it again.
Lol, have the knowledge?
The knowledge is vaporised along with the scientists in the nuclear centers.
Knowledge isn't in country's hands, it's in people's minds.
Russians are constantly killing Ukrainian civilians.
Ukraine hasn't threatened Russia in the past and not seeking to produce nuclear weapons to threaten Russia.
Iran has constantly threatened the Zionists (Israel) and provide money and weapons to Hezbollah and Hamas.
