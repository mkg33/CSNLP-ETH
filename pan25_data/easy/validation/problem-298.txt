If Ghana sells Ghanaian gold for, say, dollars, then buys oil with those dollars, Ghana is not buying oil with gold, but with dollars, the same as if they liquidated government cacao stocks and purchased oil with the proceeds.
To me, buying oil with gold means agreeing to tender a weight-certain of specie or bullion in consideration of a barrel of oil.
At the instant the trade is consummated, the market price per barrel in dollars for WTI, Brent, or any other of the benchmarks will have a direct relationship with a weight-certain of gold.
Will this necessarily be the price per ounce of gold in the commodities market?
Will there possibly be a disparity?
Obviously the Ghanaian currency is less valuable that gold, is it possible that our xeroxed dollars are also less valuable than gold as an exchange medium?
Will this kind of trade expose a fundamental weakness?
Exactly.
This isn't a money making endeavor.
This is influence peddling.
The USA does it with defence pledges (note all the US bases around the world).
