They used to have mandatory quarantine for all incoming travellers, but they dropped that in October after ending their Zero COVID strategy and subsequently suffering a wave of infections that ripped through the country:
It's much better to do both.
Someone who was on a plane that had 20% COVID positive passengers is likely also infected, even if the test doesn't show it yet.
That's ridiculous.
Millions of doses went bad because they sat around, and bill gates was allowed to refuse to share vaccine tech with poor countries.
Do you recall what Gates said?
"They would probably make mistakes in producing them, so that's why we aren't sharing.
".
Sending covid globally actually, and calling it racial profiling to test chinese travelers, this is the same way covid originally spread globally, chinese people needed to be healthy to travel domestically, but international flights had zero restrictions.
America \is\ the bad guy.
America \is\ the oppressor, the human rights violator, the pseudo-democracy, and america is the big problem the world must solve.
We face numerous existential issues BECAUSE of late-stage capitalism and america specifically, including global ecosystem collapse, global nuclear war, global fascism and tyranny, economic hegemony and false scarcity, and pretending ALL OF THIS is someone else's confusion about history, lmao, is just a dead-end narrative that you cant possibly expect anyone to listen to.
You are a great example of this.
Ofcourse the vaccine went to the host country first, then the paying countries, and then to everyone else for little to no cost.
No country is going to ship valuable resources to the non paying countries first.
And now that there is plenty of vaccine China is REFUSING the shipments unless the west gives them the recipe and they manufacture it themselves because "china number 1".
Chinese government is treating its people like farm animals.
