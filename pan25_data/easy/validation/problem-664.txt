The point of garantuees is that they are revoked if the treaty is broken.
The intend is that they get depended on the garantuees and don’t do shut.
Russia even stated at the beginning that they felt that (not verbatim) „the west has let them down and betrayed them over the last decade or so“.
Must not be true but that’s what they said at least.
I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that Russia feels like they can’t keep up economically with the rest.
Russia's security demands are totally unacceptable.
If Putin was insisting that NATO and other European countries don't invade Russia then that would be fine - no one was going to do that anyway.
But he's asking that Europe does not organise itself militarily to protect it from Russian aggression.
After Georgia and Ukraine this is now more important than ever for Europe.
Vietnam, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, China, Syria, Burma, Guatemala, Indonesia, the Congo and Laos.
We have a HORRIBLE track record or interfering and making things worse than they were before.
