“The White House thus initially opposed any attempt to include paid sick days in the contract it was hell-bent on imposing.
Facing a backlash, Nancy Pelosi soon after announced the dual votes that ultimately took place: one, on imposition of the tentative agreement, and another on the insertion of seven days of paid sick time.
Pelosi did so knowing full well that the latter would never get the necessary support to pass in the Senate.
Had she and Biden actually been serious about trying to win railworkers their sick days, she could have refused to decouple the two issues and tried to rustle up the votes to avoid a strike and score a victory for workers at the same time.”.
“Even with the genuine threat of a nationwide rail strike, Republicans and (very likely) many Democrats as well could well have refused to give any ground — thus compelling workers to go on strike.
This underscores another important truth in all of this, which is that Biden and the Democrats could simply have refrained from doing anything at all and instead hammered away at the message that the railway companies’ refusal to grant basic dignity to workers was risking a disruptive shutdown only weeks before Christmas.”.
How do we know that?
Biden didn't include the 7 day sick leave provision in his initial deal, nor did he support the amendment.
What makes you think otherwise?
