I remember when they immediately announced the cause of the crash....
When it was still dark and no investigation had been done.
That was essentially an admission of guilt imo.
Probably.
However, Israel clearly feels that it is worth it.
For example, Israel assassinated the head scientist of the Iranian nuclear program and bombed facilities in Iran before.
Iran subsequently attempted to attack Israelis in Turkey and Cyprus, but were - as far as publicly known - prevented.
It is unlikely to spin into Iran openly bombing Israel though.
Israel is just too powerful for that right now, especially if it is an attack from Syria.
For all intents and purposes, Israel and Iran are sort of in a war.
Israel frequently bombs Iranian military systeks in Syria, targeted Iranian ships, and assassinates people in Iran itself.
At the same time, Iran has attempted to assassinate Israelis, bombed Israeli commercial ships, and armed internationally recognised terrorist groups that target Israel.
"Guys.
I have an idea.
This will totally trick everyone.
Let's just say whatever the opposite is, of what happened, ok?
".
Whenever it comes to Israel (even possibly having any involvement) everyone suddenly become political scientists with very strong opinions rooted in absolutely nothing.
