We aren't Jewish, but once sent one of our kids to a Jewish preschool.
The place had security built into the building and the architecture, staff trained on security and an armed roaming security staff member.
When the kid started going to public schools I felt like we had lost so much security.
School shootings are still a threat but the public school buildings can be ingressed or egressed by ANYONE from 365 degrees and no security guard.
If something were to happen it would just be "call the police and see how many victims were created until police showed up.
".
Democrats are against the current Israeli administration, and the current form of mainstream Israeli 'Zionism' (a complete bastardization of Zionism, into a far right wing authoritarian imperialist doctrine, far removed from what devout Zionist Albert Einstein practiced back in the 1940's).
Albert Einstein and dozens of Jewish leaders during the time wrote and signed an open letter warning about the extremist faction that would become the current Israeli administration.
But they give full support to jewish people and will call out any fascist bullshit against them, for the same exact reasons they are standing up to what israel is doing.
If a pro israel supporter wants to do to Palestinians what the far right wants to do to Jews, they WILL be called out.
Again, for the same exact reasons.
It's wrong.
It doesn't matter WHO does it.
