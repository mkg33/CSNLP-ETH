I'm no substitute.
But I do think there's value in summarizing daily news (which I read anyway and keep notes).

Unexpectedly, Russian diplomats are lying again.
They also lied that "", for example.
Russian diplomats are clowns.
This is how a terrorist country works.
Pure insanity.
Russia has already lost close to 100k soldiers between killed and wounded.
And they’ve failed in every offensive they’ve done… they couldn’t take Kyiv or Kharkiv and they were kicked out of Sumy, Izyum, Kherson, and other liberated areas.

Oh and let’s not forget that Ukraine is more armed to the teeth now than they were nine months ago.
Those Russian troops are being sent to their deaths.
They receive monetary assistance and humanitarian aid upon arrival.
Bus departures au gratis has been provided since liberation, with the busses going to Odesa, Mykolaiv, or Kryvyi Rih to stay temporarily in a shelter, before moved to a safer region.
