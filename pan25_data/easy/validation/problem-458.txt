I wonder though.
He did try to kill him with Novichok.
After that Navalny and Bellingcat exposed the plot and I think he made that YouTube video before return.
So if he was killed right upon re entry or second attempt, this could have triggered a revolt, who knows.
Him being alive keeps opposition nice and hopeful (i.e.
yes very much martyr situation just more nuanced I think because first attempt failed).
Just theorizing.
Did a lot of good for Socrates.
You know he never wrote a single book and you and I both know his whole life story?
Wow!
Denying visits from loved ones for over a year, along with contaminated medication causing a painful infection and weight loss, highlights the disturbing inhumane conditions in Russian prisons.
Oh no.
I stand corrected on my opinion.
Dumb of me to assume that just because he’s anti-Putin that he is a decent human.
That makes me kind of sad actually.
And it revolutionized his entire civilization to boot.
It’s just courage.
Life is meaningless, but this guy makes it mean a lot.
Edit: this guy being Navalny, not me pointing my thumbs at myself.
