You need electricity to pump water to cool the reactors while at the dock.
Instead of creating infrastructure to run electricity from the port to the ship, they left the ship idling.
It’s reactors boiled water spinning turbines in boilers.
While it sat at dock.
They didn’t even establish infrastructure so the electricity could be used by the city.
It’s been a piece of shit it’s whole life.
Two major vessels of the Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet – the heavy nuclear cruiser Admiral Nakhimov and heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser Admiral Kuznetsov of the Soviet Union Fleet – are deemed inoperable.
Thank you.
We have now reached the 50,000 mark on postings of the "Russian ships are now or will soon be submarines" joke.
You have put us over the top.
Congratulations!
No, but the roles dictate it.
Carriers are usually the flagship of whatever unit they're attached to.
And a heavy cruiser such as the Nakimov is the biggest class of modern ship after carriers.
They would be the ship the the Admiral sets up his command in.
