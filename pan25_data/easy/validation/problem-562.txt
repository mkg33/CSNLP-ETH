Up until now China was fine closing everyone off from visiting China but now all of a sudden when other countries ask for precautions be taken (not fully ban mind you, just precautions) itâ€™s not cool?
Bunch of hypocrites.
When I, a Chinese national, tried to fly to China from Canada in late 2020, they had set up all sorts of insane requirements for visitors, including negative results for both a PCR and a serology test within 48 hours, a timeframe so tight that it was only possible to book an appointment with one of their designated testing centres in Toronto to get a "go-home package" for $360, to say nothing of the mandatory 3-week quarantine upon arrival which costed another $2,000.
They also kept randomly cancelling flights, intentionally jacking up prices for certain routes, and haphazardly adding new requirements every once a while (my flight usually costs something like 1k but went up to 10k when I bought it).
Now they have the fucking guts to call others discriminatory, ridiculous.
