1) Nationally funded, locally available, free gun safety classes for anyone who wants them.
This is voluntary to attend.
This would also be offered as a high school class similar to Driver's Ed.
Focus will be on how to make safe/unload common weapon platforms along with basic marksmanship.
It should also discuss common types of self defense scenarios, situational awareness, verbal de-escalation, and the legal consequences of using a defensive firearm.
A hunter's safety course and stop the bleed component should also be included.
Any range that offers this course gets a tax rebate per person who takes the class.
Americans should be familiar with gun safety, we have more guns than people in our country.
Hopefully this also helps some people realize that they are not magical murder machines, and others that they are not a talisman that gets you women and makes your dick hard.
Return firearms to the category they belong in: tools.
This benefits the children of both the anti-gun crowd, since their kids are not often actually taught this factual information, and the pro-gun crowd, who tend to fetishize firearms.
Information kills bias, start that process early.
