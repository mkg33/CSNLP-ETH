Republicans have run their mouth from the pulpit for decades.
Until the IRS actually applies the law, I dint Give a shit what less insane pastors say from the pulpit.
Same for gerrymandering.
Until the Supreme Court says: you can't do that, democrats SHOULD gerrymander the shit out of every state.
In politics the ends justify the means- is how conservatives have always played it.
Meanwhile democrats keep getting punched in the face while they tie their own hands behind their back.
The only way to get conservatives to agree their position is a bad idea is to meet them with power- they understand no other language.
Use every legal means to change the discourse and gain control- the SCOTUS or IRS or whatever federal entity can start imposing moral rules, or we can just lay down and lose getting bloody.
There is no ultimate good beyond the good we make in the world.
