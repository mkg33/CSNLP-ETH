If he lied in his filing documents to run as a Congressman, that's a felony I believe.
There's also a question of whether his claim of being a NY resident was true or not, as he does not own the property that he claimed to be living in, and was living with a relative at the time.

Look, politicians have always lied — as George Carlin famously joked, the reason we can’t display the 10 Commandments in a courthouse is you can’t post Thou shall not lie in a building full of lawyers, judges and politicians - but we seem to have reached another level at this point in history, when an entire percentage of our country dismisses a pathological liar as the President of the United States, and now this guy comes in, and appears to be a total fraud with crickets from the republican party.
In NY state?
Not sure about that.
Anyway, having a legal residence in the state is a requirement.
It all depends on what he claimed in his filing, though, doesn't it?
I feel like the lies about his finances are going to be harder to handwave away.
