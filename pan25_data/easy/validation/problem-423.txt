Many people here are talking about encryption and security as if they know absolutely anything.
Encryption exists to so you don't have to trust centralized services.
However the Twitter protocol is closed source and there's no guarantee that your messages arnt being double read by storage services AND point to point.
Let alone another million vulnerabilities.
He's already done good things.
New satellite internet paradigm, new space technologies, new rocket engines, accelerated electric car adoption, groundbreaking solar tech, autopilot, and self-driving, etc., etc.
No.
The code to encrypt messages does not need to be hidden to do its job.
The only thing that needs to be private are the private keys generated by the code - unique to each user - to decrypt messages using the code and the recipients public key.
Absolutely!
It's almost like people think "encryption" is a magic key to data security.
Clearly they never worked as an information/operations security roles.
I haven't used Twitter since 2014.
The business I work for doesn't use it either.
I have no problem living a Twitter-less life.
I know a lot of folks and businesses are going to be impacted and I'm sorry for that.
But it's Twitter.
What was the long term plan?
No matter how much packet analysis and systems probing you can never know for sure if it's truly encrypted, the data isnt still available in memory somewhere or intentionallytransmitted in secondary channels.
Encrypting data doesnt guarantee all copies are in cyphertext.
Saying that, if a single Twitter developer with proper access leaked dev code or db showing this kind of behavior they would instantly cause a true shitstorm, it's just not worth it and the likelihood is that Twitter is acting in its own interests which is to cater to free speech absolutists.
