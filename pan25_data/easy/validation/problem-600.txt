Not really??
If you actually know who she then you know that this isnt really a celebration time when it took giving a literal arms dealer mid war called “the merchant of death” to bring her back… griner’s cool but realistically all she does is play basketball and complain like from the nba to the government she just has problems w everything, and it just kinda leaves you thinking “was this trade really worth it?” and you gotta remember she didnt have a life sentence she had 9 years, the arms dealer we traded was already in for like 15 and still had a life sentence for a list of violent crimes… dont get me wrong either im happy for her, but i dont think any of this was worth it and imo it only happened bc she went on a press tour when she got arrested.
