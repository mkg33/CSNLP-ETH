Without CSTO guarantees, Armenia gets flattened by Azerbaijan in a war, territory gets stolen, and there is an uninterrupted resource corridor.
Based on current events, it appears that Russia cannot control this corridor any longer.
Expect to see a very bloody war and land grab from Azerbaijan in the southeast of Armenia in the near future.
This will also be one of the final nails in Russiaâ€™s coffin, and will contribute, along with the Ukrainian invasion, to the end of Russia as we know it.
And maintaining Syrian operations.
Russia and Turkey absolutely require agreement and relations with regards to that theater.
I'm sure Syria has something to do with Russia not bombing a Turkish ally.
Armenia is strategically located and prevents Turkey from directly connecting infrastructure with Azerbaijan and the greater Turkic World (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan).
Turkey has been making inroads with these countries (due to their similar languages and culture) with the ultimate goal of accessing their natural gas resources and transporting across the Caspian, through Azerbaijan, and into Turkey for processing and sale into Europe and beyond.
