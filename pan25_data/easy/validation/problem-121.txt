Later Putin corrected the mistranslation by saying "He wants to solve the Ukraine conflict by continuing to get their(Russia) ass kicked while Ukraine decimates their whole military into oblivion".
Fine.
Have all Russian forces retreat back to Russia, release all POWs and trafficked civilians, return the stolen children, restore all damaged and destroyed buildings and infrastructure, overpay reparations to every single Ukrainian citizen who has suffered a loss due to Russia’s “military action” against Ukraine, give up ALL nukes, relinquish all claims (present and future) to Ukrainian territories and guarantee that no such aggressions will ever be taken against Ukraine again.
If there’s anything left of Russia after all this and if the world can stop laughing for 2 seconds at the thought that Russia has any interest whatsoever in a peaceful resolution to the war Russia started, there’s a bridge in the desert for sale.
Best offer.
“… as demonstrated by our ceaseless cruise missile strikes, rocket artillery strikes, destruction of infrastructure, rape, torture, and slaughter of civilians.
We just want peace!”.
