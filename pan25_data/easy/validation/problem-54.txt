California is not to the US as Ukraine is to Russia.
Also Californians identify as Americans.
The Ukrainians I know do not identify as Russians neither do their ancestors.
I think I understand what you are saying : Older Russians may view the Ukraine as a succeeded state.
But Ukraine has had its own language and culture since the 800â€™s CE.
Probably before.
(With perhaps a total of two centuries of conquest and division between neighboring states during that time.
).
Russia has crippled a generation of it's youth, become an international pariah with crippling sanctions, shown to be an untrustworthy source of energy and doesn't have any of it's objectives comfortably secured.
100%?
I doubt it.
And people that says the oligarchs will betray him probably thinks the oligarchs are some warlords with their own private army or something.
Let's be clear, within Russia, Putin has all the power.
Oligarchs with money but without power doesn't mean shit else at least a few of them would have tried something significant by now.
Our best bet is to hope Putin renovates his office/home and change his window since there seems to be a "people falling out of window" problem in Russia.
Exactly.
It's why they are forming their own army's.
They are prepping a force to take over.
Russia is going to be an uuuuugly place to be by the end of the year.
