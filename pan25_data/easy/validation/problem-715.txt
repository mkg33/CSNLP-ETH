Assuming causalities are even significant on either side.
A failed invasion could just be China being turned around, after seeing how serious the US is about Taiwan.
This being only actually possible with a distracted or absent US-led defense of Taiwan.
Thus my point above.
Well yes but that's not all that happens because now China and the US have officially become enemy combatants in a theater of war ( technically we were enemy combatants in the Korean war with the People's Republic of China but at the time we recognized the Republic of China as the true China so we could easily spend it as not being at war with China just a rogue Chinese faction but now since we recognize the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government of China we wouldn't be able to hide behind that facade anymore) which would cause a massive realignment in terms of foreign policy and trade policy.
Look.
Taiwan is about 100 miles from mainland China.
If they want Taiwan, it's theirs.
End of story.
Taiwan is just too far away, barring a total US commitment.
More likely scenario is that they gradually increase influence in Taiwan until its defacto theirs until some "vote" or series of votes legitimizes it.
Nuclear war is bad for business.
Exactly.
The world will be screwed in any case so the U.S. might as well try to defend Taiwan and push back against China, instead of just doing nothing.
