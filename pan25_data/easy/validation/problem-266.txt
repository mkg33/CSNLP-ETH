Trump also tried to dismantle the Federal executive, installed his family and friends at the highest levels of government, appointed extremist judges and justices, colluded against our Allie's with Russia, took money from foreign governments, raided the coffers for his family and cronies, etc.
You don't think DeSantis can do more damage than that?

I disagree entirely.
Trump doesn't run 3rd party if he loses.
He won't endorse him.
He'll say the election was rigged and that they should not vote for the nominee because he's a pretender to the throne but he won't run third party.
He may prop someone else up or latch onto someone else but if Trump loses the nomination he won't run third party he'll just hold rallies talking about how it was stolen and tell people not to vote.
