The Wall Street Journal had reported Tuesday afternoon that the U.S. is considering the delivery of Abrams main battle tanks in not insignificant numbers.
France is also considering supplying battle tanks to Ukraine.
Recently, the Green Party and the FDP increased the pressure on Scholz to supply battle tanks to Ukraine.
Only recently, the chancellor decided to provide Ukraine with Marder infantry fighting vehicles.
Not really.
Despite the US and UK making more of a fuzz about it, accumulated the EU and Germany have already done more to help Ukraine and maybe more importantly, actual Ukrainians at much bigger economic costs.
The L is in communications, and mostly in US-based internet platforms.
Let's be clear here, there is more than one game being played, and one of those games is that Blackrock et alii are using the conflict to buy large parts of Ukraine on the cheap.
There's a lot of cynicism at work, and it's dangerous.
Another example is how PiS in Poland tried to use the tank question to stir up anti-German sentiments to bolster their chances in their upcoming elections.
It's not like all of this doesn't get noticed.
And here's the thing: in Germany some good old stubbornness is a proven way to gain votes.
Sentiments can change quite quickly, when people feel like they might be taken advantages of, and Germany is no exception when it comes to a complete lack of shady politicians happy to play that card.
