""U.S. citizens residing or travelling in Russia should depart immediately," the U.S. embassy in Moscow said.
"Exercise increased caution due to the risk of wrongful detentions.
".
I agree daft prick is subjective, personally seeing an abandoned village vs potentially taking a statistically significant dose of radiation is not worth the risk.
Doesn't the state dept website e.g.
the state dept have today's date on the post?
Though I can't say I've looked at the state dept website for Russia.
Honestly, as an American who needed the US embassies support to report a crime that falls under their purview (in a country allied with the US)..
I can't say I was impressed.
Wouldn't even meet with me.
There obviously are Americans with family etc.
in Russia.
But the thing I donâ€™t like is when Americans are in some country working and making lots of tax free money and refuse to get out when they are told to.
Then they get arrested on some bullshit charge and then we have to either pay a ransom, or make a trade that is a bad deal for us to get them back.
