Makes sense, people used to die soon after retirement, but now individuals can live 20-30 years post retirement.
With shrinking younger populations, and incredible benefits for people not doing much contributing to the system financially anymore, how the hell we were thinking this was going to pan out in the future anyway.
I’m in my 30s and I know full well I’ll probably have to work til my 70s if not further.
Every generation has voted for more benefits and better support in retirement which is draining welfare systems to the point where budgets are blowing out.
This literal government structured pyramid scheme with young people/immigrants supplying the older people will end at some point with less young people to support the older generation, it’s not really whether it’ll happen but when.
No shit.
But there's two ways to keep it solvent: raise the retirement age, or raise taxes on the rich.
The people are saying, quite rightly, that they refuse to let the deficit be balanced on their own backs.
They would prefer the rich pay more than for tens of thousands more people to die in their 60s before they ever get to see even one retirement check.
