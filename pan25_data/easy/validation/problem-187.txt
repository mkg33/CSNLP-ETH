I work as an industrial mechanic, which as you imagine, attracts a specific type of person.
Before trump started his campaign for 2016 most of the people I worked with were fairly normal, kind, understanding, accepting people.
Over the course of the last six years I've seen a horrific shift in those people where now all of a sudden they express their desires to be violent, intolerant nut jobs to a degree that is extremely frightening.
I've heard so much proposed fantasy violence against government officials, the LGBT, Blacks, Jews, and literally just everyday Democrats.
I've had to endure every wacked out Q-annon conspiracy out there first hand in order to safeguard my only means of income, while also burying myself DEEP in the closet to hide the fact that I am trans (which I won't get into here because that's a whole other can of worms).
I managed to land a new job in a different-ish field where most people are in their 20s-30s, which has exposed me to the small population of gen Z conservatives I was referring to.
Outside work I've lost nearly three quarters of my family to Q-annon, seeing my Aunts and Uncles who are otherwise normal people go through the same frothing hateful transformation.
Even my father started buying into a lot of it before he passed, due to their influence and the TV he consumed, and only started softening up as he got sicker.
Precisely.
If one subscribes to the Straussâ€“Howe generational theory, they would (correctly IMO) predict that conservatism in general will be on the downswing for a generation or two.
Which is really the only hope we have in reducing the impacts of climate change and the risk of global conflict.
