On election denial: “oh, Stacy Abrams did it, too.” Yes, she complained of election rigging and refused to concede.
But how many people are there running for election right now with an explicit platform of supporting Abrams’ claims?
Zero.
By comparison, how many repubs are there running right now who willingly admit the election was free of major, result-changing issues?
Not conceding, complaining of election rigging unless they win, vowing to change election laws in the favor, etc.
are all part of their platform.
My wife and I are adamant about not raising our children in a nation run by liars and bigots who denigrate women, encourage political violence, and refuse to take action on the climate and to serve the entire country, not just corporations.
It'll be tough since we're both lawyers in practices focused on domestic law, but the GOP is openly fascist, has already launched a coup attempt, and we won't have our families live under the party of hatred and dishonesty.
It's sad that this is what the country has come to, but it's all too clear that the GOP and conservatives will do anything they can to disrupt the democratic process, including sedition, insurrection, acts of terror, violent threats, voter intimidation, and fraud.
