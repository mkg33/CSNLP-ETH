not talking only about the chinese ones but in general.. dont think anyone ever thought about other air junk.
im sure other countries do meteorological research and since its just non military research never reported that "hey we're launching a giant floating balloon" to any intel agencies jus to the local air traffic control.
im sure these thing do get lost when their tethers break.
plus where they float up to with the lower pressure, they dont lose the lifting gas as much as a normal balloon.... so would they just float about in the jet streams??

Hardened or reinforced Mylar films are commonly used in a variety of applications, such as electrical insulation, packaging, aerospace, and industrial applications, where high strenh and durability are required.
Expect more of them too.
Luis Elizondo, Chris Mellon and others have urged better evaluation of American and Canadian airspace for sometime now.
Could be.
A metallic skin would potentially be more durable in case of a rough trip across the ocean, and be able to handle a higher pressure differential -- and thus more lift from a smaller balloon.
