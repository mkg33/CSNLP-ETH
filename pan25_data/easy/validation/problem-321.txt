Russia had their way in Crimea.
We're we supposed to just lay back and watch while he did it to the rest of Ukraine?

Europe was, or still is, very dependent of Russia and China also, that doesn't mean we aren't trying to find other countries to have economic relations with, I'm sure Brazil could do the same, there are other Asiatic or European countries that could replace that supply of fertilizers to Brazil, I am also sure that you could have better economic partnerships with some African countries, I'm sure that some of the ex Portuguese colonies in Africa could be great partners, like Angola, for example.
Like what?
Giving money to Argentina (that probably will not get paid)?
Supporting dictatorships?
Or maybe the attempt to end the autonomy of our Central Bank that is going on these days?
His idea of regulating the media and the Internet?
Or maybe you're talking about things that he did in the past, like buying out Congress to approve the laws he wanted?
