Perhaps these Republicans can finally get to work on confirming some nominations and the the governor will then be adequately equipped with all necessary advice to give due consideration to the merits and potential negative implications of their request.
I do think they can't expect the governor to be in a position to get all due advice and give all due consideration to such a significant request when a third of his cabinet are merely in acting positions because these same Republicans keep neglecting to vote on the governor's nominees.
The tool should be fixed.
No need to go scorched earth.
You can literally just change the algorithm.
These programs are not slabs of stone immutable for all of time.
They can invest in some dev time to suppress extreme content.

Yes, that's right: Tony Evers begins his second term in January, but 1/3 of his first term cabinet members remain in acting capacity due to the Republican legislature refusing to vote on the appointments, using any looming rejecting vote for the entirety of Evers' first term as a cudgel against Democratic governor policy.
Their logic is absurd.
For someone making false statements like this the point is purely for outrage.
They are obscuring the truth.
