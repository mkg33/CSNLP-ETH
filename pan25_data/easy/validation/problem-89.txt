Chinese prepare for war so openly and we continue to pay for his war machine against us with every Made in China purchase.
When do we move our supply chains home?
After he attacks ffs….
Some years ago, French observatory detected a Russian satellite changing trajectory to come close a French telecommunication satellite.
A sniffer.
Since I’m 70 % sure there is an another war we do not know about, a space war, long distance satellite jamming or sniffing or disrupting.
Space X isn’t charity and humanitarian business only.
Via starlink and other « secret « dod satellite I’m again 70% sure that a part of the military fiasco of Russia is due to a large disturbance in the force.
Space force.
The tech is helping, but to conquer any country, they need troops to land on that country, how come they want to land troops on the country that they want to invade if the did not have sufficent transport over the air or water, because its imposible for any group of troops to swim or fly by theirself over ocean to conquer a country, hmmm i think it would be disaster for them before they even have make a single step over the conquerer country, if china use only long range missile or nuke they only create a terror for any other country not invade or counquer them.
Well… it is a little more complex.
China ain’t Russia even in international propaganda.
They are more than equiped especially for modern warfare, drone, intelligence and space.
Most components in your everyday devices, even Apple, Cisco … are build in china, the real realm of reverse engineering.
DJI ?
This is them, they own the drone market by a large margin.
Old world war such as aircraft carriers, navy cannons … maybe not a efficient a top notch naval drone.
To be frank I do have some suspicions over the whole situation, even in Ukraine.
