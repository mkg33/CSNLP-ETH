In a 138-page order, chief US district judge Mark Walker blocked state officials from enforcing a central piece of the Stop WOKE Act, which he dubbed “positively dystopian” and says violates the First Amendment.
Citing George Orwell’s 1984, Walker wrote that DeSantis and company seem to believe that “the State has unfettered authority to muzzle its professors in the name of ‘freedom,’” which is quite obviously not freedom at all.
Zeroing in on the fact that the law targets freedom of expression that DeSantis and his fellow Republicans don’t like, Walker wrote: “The law officially bans professors from expressing disfavored viewpoints in university classrooms while permitting unfettered expression of the opposite viewpoints.
Defendants argue that, under this Act, professors enjoy ‘academic freedom’ so long as they express only those viewpoints of which the State approves.”.

Yes, this is how media works in a post-capitalism world in which the value of content is in the IP value and not the value of an object version in physical format of any given article or medium, and not coincidentally precisely how the media company we are currently using makes enough money to support itself without collapsing into bankruptcy/or being sold to pissy billionaires who are super mad Reddit users keep making fun of him.
Yeah, that’s exactly what he did.
He just banged his gavel and said “sit down and STFU, Ron!” Judges do this kind of thing all the time and only quality, high-intellect publications like Vanity Fair report on it.
