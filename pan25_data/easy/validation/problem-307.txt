This is getting to be like the monkey see, monkey do antics on tik-tok--even though there is absolutely no connection between paintings in museums and global warming, it's become a fad to toss soup on paintings as if the average person would even understand the connection, let alone empathize or take action based on this.
It reeks of out of touch coddled Western ignorance.
This is purely performative activism.
These kinds of stunts never change anybody’s mind and may very well swing people the other way.
It’s the worst kind of virtue signaling.
“Loctite is an American [1] brand of adhesives, sealants, surface treatments, and other industrial chemicals that include acrylic, anaerobic, cyanoacrylate, epoxy, hot melt, silicone, urethane, and UV/light curing technologies.
Loctite products are sold globally and are used in a variety of industrial and hobbyist applications.”....
So?
Next time maybe they should throw shit at museum exhibit because it is protected by glass.
Or maybe they should throw crap at their neighbors house because it is protected.
