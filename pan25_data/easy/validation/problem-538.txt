TBH it is weird the cartoonists went for "terrorists".
If they'd had the Qatar team being chased by men with whips it'd be more direct and harder to criticise as simple racism.
Satire usually is one dimensional.
You take a complex issue, dump it down to one dimension and reapply it to the problem.
The result can be pretty funny, sometimes insightful.
It shouldn't be taken as a source of information, tho.
U don't like satire, fine.
But it's not nonsense.
It is a reflection of what we really think of Qatar, overall.
We think their culture or at least policies are pretty barbaric, overall.
That doesn't mean an individual is, that would mean taking satire literally which would be a mistake.
Qatar absolutely deserves criticism and derision.
But not for immutable characteristics (race), and also not with a super shitty picture that looks like an edgy high schooler drew it.
Get more creative with your political cartoons, France.
That’s just ridiculously hypocritical.
Maybe the cartoon is out of line — but I’ve been to Qatar and they literally have a soft apartheid system to segregate their migrant workers from everybody else.
