There was evidence of thousands of foreigners being held in Qatar against their will and forced to build stadiums before the world cup and nobody gave half a shit.
For-profit corporations generally don't have values beyond maximizing shareholder revenue, and if this world cup is an example of blowback from the morality of the average consumer, I don't think large corporations will really care.
Really only time will tell.
Their main goal is to increase tourism and diversify their economy away from being just a pertol-state.
If this increases their tourism long term then it may be seen as a net positive, however it remains to be seen what regions these tourists would come from especially given the Qatari regimes views on things like alcohol anywhere in the country much less just at stadiums.
Did it really though?
It also gave them massive tourism, exposure to global media and advertisers, funded tons of new infrastructure, etc.
Come on it's 2022.
You should pay employees a living and have proper housing for the population and workers included.
Not torture nor slaves.
Qatar is wealthy as heck, they can afford both with a fraction of their fuel wealth.
