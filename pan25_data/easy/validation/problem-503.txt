When will Blair or Bush go to international court for their genocide of million Iraqis and their fabrication of evidence of WMDs in order to start their illegal and unprovoked invasion and still lasting occupation?
?
No one credible believes there was an American/British ("Anglo-Saxon" if you prefer) genocide in Iraq, since there is zero evidence that they intentionally planned to kill even a thousand Iraqi civilians, nevermind a million.
Dude does not matter.
The dude is a sick criminal and will end up in prison because, unlike serbia, in kosovo the law works for all equally.
The kids survived, and we can be happy about that.
Million Iraqis are dead cause of WMDs fabrication by USA and it's illegal and unprovoked invasion and still lasting occupation, up to 400k Yemenis starved to death and dead to otherwise curable diseases and war, including 85 000 children younger than 5, cause of USA and their "moral", "human rights respecting" ally, Saudi Arabia blockade and war in Yemen, and so on, illegal wars and occupations all around the world...
We will soon find out.
If roles were reversed, people would celebrate this in Serbia.
we saw what happened in Wien and the serbian soccer team and countless more...
