Absolutely!
Biden wasn't actively trying to risk national security by hiding classified documents, yet classified documents were still discovered, even after his own lawyers did their own search.
I can't imagine how many new documents would be discovered if they were able to search all of Trump's properties.
Exactly.
I'd bet they all have some documents they shouldn't, and not even through any malfeasance.
How many thousands of documents of all kinds does a president or VP handle in the course of their duties?
It isn't hard to picture something getting casually put atop a stack of books on the corner of a desk in the VPs home office, then overlooked when the books are put away, and so on.
That's the way years-old classified documents end up in a box in Biden's garage.
Totally.
I won't say this shouldn't be taken seriously but the fact that he's openly cooperating is a huge contrast to Trump.
Cooperating with an investigation really does help make the case that you aren't trying to hide things or act with malice.
