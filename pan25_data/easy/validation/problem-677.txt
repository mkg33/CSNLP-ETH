But I submit to you that we are in a right now, and during political realignments the old rules suddenly go hang because politicians’ and voters’ incentive structures become rearranged by some event — such as, well, everything that’s happened over the past six years and especially Dobbs — and simply for the purpose of pursuing self interest (if nothing else — I assume politicians are selfish machiavellians and go from there), individual actors find themselves in positions where unusual decisions are clearly and obviously beneficial to them.
