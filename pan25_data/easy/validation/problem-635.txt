An immediate question is whether Ukraine will now encounter unexpected resistance as it tries to push south, but with the reconnaissance drone technology it has available it should be able to detect if there are any substantial remaining forces.
Serious battles appear unlikely – although Ukrainian troops will have to be wary of mines left by the retreating invaders.
Russia has been preparing its exit for a month now, moving command and control across the river and at least some of its experienced forces, before finally evacuating any sympathetic citizens and the bones of Catherine the Great’s chief minister Grigory Potemkin.
But Ukraine will want to disrupt the Russian retreat as much as possible, capturing soldiers and above all equipment – turning the withdrawal into something like the near rout that took place in September when Russia made a similar decision, to withdraw from near Kharkiv and Izium in the northern part of the front to behind the Oskill river, in an attempt, only partially successful, to consolidate its position into the late autumn and early winter.
Me reading this: "Wait... what the...?"
I was gonna say that Russia steals the most random-ass shit when they loot the places they're retreating from, but then I looked him up and now it makes sense.
Dude annexed Crimea in 1783, so Putin annexed it in 2014.
Dude used 1783 weapons, Putin used... weapons that were just about as good as what they had in 1783.
I see where Putin went wrong here.
