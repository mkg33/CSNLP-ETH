I read this book back in 2010 as a high school sophomore.
I was young and such an idealist that, yeah, I didn’t think it would ever happen.
But every year since then, I feel more and more like I’m living the prequel series to 1984.
Nowadays, there’s a real world analogue for a lot of what occurs in that book, and it’s getting closer and closer to home.
It practically predicted smart phones and NSA spyware with the “telescreen”.
Zero reading comprehension calling someone fucking stupid, amazing.
Stop turning red at the slightest hint that I might be saying something you hate.
I'm saying I don't like either option.
I don't like options that hyper aggressively punish innocent lives.
I don't want nuclear warfare for that.
I don't want to punish Russian citizens as some kind of "example to the world" forever, slowly starving them all out for decades.
I want to punish the governments as a warning to the world, to not emulate this, and free their citizens from what is obviously tyranny, that a lot of Russians clearly don't like or support.
