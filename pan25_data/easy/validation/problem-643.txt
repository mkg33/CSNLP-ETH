Alright people, the report made by the FBI/DoE is of "low confidence."
As someone who went to college for a degree in Intelligence Analysis, this is fancy talk for "We're taking a shot in the dark and we don't really believe this."
Saying you assess something with low confidence is also something frowned upon in the intelligence community as it means you're not sure of what you're even trying to say is true.
Speaking from the viewpoint of someone who went to college for Intelligence Analysis, I can confirm that a report assessed with low confidence is little more than speculation/is a technical way for an analyst to say "Yeah this shit is unlikely to be true."
Hell, one of my professors straight up told my class "Don't start a report with 'We assess with low confidence' as it means the opposite of what you're trying to claim is true.
