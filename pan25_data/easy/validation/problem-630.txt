its a bit gray than that.
There are cartel style groups that are illegally mining in parts of the Amazon, they operate massive "draga" dredge boats and whole armies of miners and laborers, often indentured into working in mines as a way to pay of debts for drugs or loans.
These groups mean business, anyone in their way will be removed.
On the other side of the scale are the artisanal small scale miners who basically have no other option but to mine gold, usually with basic tools and sluices to feed themselves and their families.
The Brazilian government openly allowed the latter groups to go into the Amazon in prospecting parties, to locate areas where mining could be done, than planned to kick them out and bring in mechanized mining later on.
Edit: 1.
I didn’t fully appreciate the mob aspects of this.
I’m not worried about them.
2.
I was thinking of people at the bottom having to start over, not about the jobs themselves.
I’ll take my lumps though.
Seems like a solution would be to work with the indigenous groups there to make them beneficiaries of any mining operations, and giving the handful of small-time miners an opportunity to work for a legitimate operation.
The former is what has been happening in BC, Canada (thanks to the Supreme Court forcing indigenous rights to be respected), and the latter is just good political sense.
