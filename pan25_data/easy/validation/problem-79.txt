We should be avoiding this kind of thing.
It is what we have been trying to do since the genie was released in the 1940s.
While the US and the USSR (along with some very limited work in the PRC) did develop and even deploy some limited BMD systems, the technology was prohibitively expensive, the numbers produced minimal and expansion was limited by treaty.
The US withdrew from the treaty in 2002.
The reason being that leadership has determined that the threat from rogue states had sufficiently grown to require building more substantial defense systems than allows by treaty.
Basically, the US and NATO have developed a fairly comprehensive missile defense system.
It is probable that some weapons will slip through.
But, there are significantly more interceptors than there are delivery vehicles.
Heck, there are more missiles than their are warheads.
Obviously.
Whenever it gets serious US deploy aircraft carrier in agean and germany start mediating between both sides.
It is same shit going on for decades.
