Despite all the lies, money, voter suppression/intimidation and gerrymandering Democrats out preformed almost all projections.
In fair and honest elections, Republicans would never win.
It shouldnâ€™t be this close.
I don't know what the actual election results have been historically for the south Texas counties but in my experience usually if a Democrat is winning a congressional seat, it's because it came down to some rich republican white guy who's stayed within the relatively small and insular Anglo social circles his whole life until the election, vs a Hispanic conservative Democrat who everyone knows and would fit right in with the republicans, but they or their parents have been blue since before the party shift.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
This is anecdotal but I'm from South Texas and in my lifetime most Tejano families have been very VERY republican because many Hispanic families are extremely socially conservative, extremely racist, and small business ownership is a big part of the culture (and for some reason pop culture has decided that Republicans are the party of small business???
).
