While she was letting her speak, it was hilarious to watch Stephanie's body language, holding her breath, arms crossed, raised eyebrows, squinting her eyes, basically making all the facial expressions of someone using all her strenh to suffer through the torrent of inanity that was coming from Boebert's mouth .
