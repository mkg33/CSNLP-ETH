Yes, the headlines for online sites are chosen to maximize clicks, even if the reporter hates the headline, because clicks mean ad views and ad views mean money.
In this case I'm wondering if they are thinking like this: the reader will suspect that "neighbor" is "Belarus", will saying "neighbor" make them more likely to click to confirm that?
They'll even do A/B testing, give different readers different headlines, and then choose the one that produces more clicks.
Relax everyone.
There's little chance Belarus would invade Ukraine.
Their military is too small and weak to make a real dent.
Also, there is no clear viable axis of advance for any ground attacks.
Not to mention that most Belarusians don't want to fight a war against Ukraine.
In fact, many of them are against the war in general and sabotaged railways to hamper the Russian supply movements early in the war.
Many Belarusians actually volunteered to fight for Ukraine and are there fighting right now.
Belarus is doing its job by simply keeping the Ukrainians stationed near their border.
It costs nothing and achieves the same results.
