Hi.
I'm from the future and I've brought you a headline from my time as a warning for those who truly want to get rid of Ted Cruz in Texas.
So, ahem.
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.
If you want to help make this community a better place, consider !
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GOP is a bona fide, de facto, corporatized.
Why is that?

Either you believe the people and the country are better served by term limited Senators or you don't.
If a new face every 12 years is good for the people, then why are you refusing to let them, your constituents, have that benefit?
