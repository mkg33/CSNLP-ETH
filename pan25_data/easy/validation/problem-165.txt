It may accept to end the war on the grounds it incorporates the eastern Ukraine regions in to Russia proper and Crimea as is.
With Ukraine acceptance that this is what it will have to concede.
In this scenario Ukraine will want insurance against another attack down the track for NATO intervention (no nato bases in Ukraine but a mutual agreement to assist, if not Nato then a coalition of neighbours such as Poland, Finland, Latvia etc).
I agree.
Unfortunately NATO is doing what other countries did before WW1 and WW2, they are acting as though by averting their eyes they will not be attacked by Russia.
So probably NATO will be late to the war in its role to defend against Russia.
NATO is not sending troops yet to Ukraine, so when Russia overwhelms Ukraine, NATO will have Russia as a neighbor.
Neither Russia nor NATO will stand for that.
