Israel just committed to a pause on settlements in the West Bank.
Guessing some very interesting negotiations with the Biden Administration are happening.
Why though?
A nuke is the the modern day equivalent of the walls of Constantinople.
Its almost pointless to use offensively because you bring your own doom on you.
Sure they kill a lot of people in a confined area but it doesn't win a war for you anymore.
Having the nuke pretty much guarantees you won't get invaded because nobody wants to risk nuclear war.
Why shouldn't Iran pursue one?
If you look at it from their perspective, stopping them from developing the nuke means they are still on the kill target list.
Ukraine gave up their nukes.
Guess what is happening?
Unlikely.
While the populace disagrees with the government, most of them would like a nuclear Iran, if only to secure their future.
A future without US boots on the ground I might add.
Seriously.
We have killed so many fucking people over fake people in the sky.
And or just because they were born somewhere and we were born somewhere else.
