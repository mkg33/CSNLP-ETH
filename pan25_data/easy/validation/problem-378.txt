I agree that countries should have ownership of their own cultural artefacts and the British have done way more harm than good when it comes to destroying cultures they don't see as valuable (literally any non European culture), but it's also hard to argue that a lot of countries, including Greece, didn't see value in preserving historical monuments or cultural artefacts until relatively recently.
I mean, the Parthenon was used as gunpowder storage and blown up.
As shit as the British were, there's no question that a lot of existing stuff wouldn't be here if they hadn't stolen it.
Should it be returned to those countries now?
Absolutely.
What on earth is the British Royal Museum.
In any case the Marbles were put in sand in the underground.
What about China's Cultural Revolution?
That was intentional destruction of a countries history and culture on a massive scale by it's own people.
Even now, China is losing thousands of historic sites due to building expansion and unregulated development.
