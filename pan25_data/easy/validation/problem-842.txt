The majority are unlikely to be illegal occupants, but culturally they made identify and side with Russia.
When the Ukraine left the Soviet Union they were likely considered countrymen, but now they may not be and may be considered a threat.
Absolutely not.
Having any additional ethnic Russians there is just asking for another invasion.
The Russian state will just use that as justification in 10, 20, 30 years to attack Ukraine again if they think they can get away with it.

They knowingly moved into an area that was illegally taken over by Russia.
Invade a city that isn’t yours, you should expect to get the boot.
I have no sympathy for them whatsoever.
You should use not only “not russian” but also “I don’t actually aware of illegal crossing borders+ illegal staying laws anywhere” or at least read article beforehand to figure one simple thing out — that this number is number of people who illegally entered Crimea via russian territory since annexation.
There is this thing called history.
Territorial boundaries are easy, but cultural boundaries are not.
Lots of places in Europe have cultures that overlap territorial boundaries.
The Crimea and Ukraine are just one.
