The already tense relations between Poland and Belarus were further strained on Wednesday when a journalist of Polish origin was sentenced to eight years in prison by a Belarusian court in a trial Warsaw says was politically motivated.
I distinctly remember Cichanouska saying "Belarusans are being trapped by the regime" and considering the immigration to Poland slowed down immensely I assumed the law I mentioned is to blame.
The border was esentially inactive anyways since Belarus considers Poland to be an enemy state and enacted laws that prevented people from crossing the EU border.
WARSAW, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Poland is to close a key border crossing with Belarus until further notice, the Polish interior minister said on Thursday, as relations between Warsaw and Minsk sink to new lows.
I was born in that area.
Ku≈∫nica and Bobrowniki were the main crossings.
The last big crossing will be Kukuryki and Terespol and there were already MASSIVE queues there.
This is essentially making cargo transport between Poland and Belarus commercially unviable.
Laws enacted in June 2021.
Belarusan citizens with temporary residence permit in EU can't leave Belarus.
You can leave only if you have full residence permit.
Visa based movement is halted until further notice.
Additional laws from October 2022 lets KGB enact a full ban for any of their citizens regardless of permit "if the security of Belarus is threatened".
Look it up.
Considering that cargo queues were already damn long, very reasonable answer to prosecution of Polish citizen that actually happened in Grodno.
