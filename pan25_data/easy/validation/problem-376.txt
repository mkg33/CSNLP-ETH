y'all are grasping at air trying to defend this Russian propaganda actor because Miss Ukraine said she didn't even show show sympathy before trying to take a selfie with her.
>"Until the very last moment I hoped that Miss Russia would come up to me and say sorry, but she only came up to me to get a selfie for what I think were propaganda purposes," Apanesenko told the Daily Beast.
"Miss Russia did not say a word about the war.
People told me it would be dangerous for her.
".
edit: to clarify, I think a display of solidarity would have been a great gesture, and I think it's fucked up if Miss Russia is using the seemingly innocuous selfies to push some propaganda back home, just saying that expecting an apology from someone who's ostensibly your coworker for their government's actions that they had nothing to do with is ridiculous.
Yes it is.
But she certainly doesn't owe it to anyone.
Most of us can't control our countries actions.
Refusal to abandon our homes because we don't agree with the actions of the government isn't wrong either.
Y'all are ass hats.
