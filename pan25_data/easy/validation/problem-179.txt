Very true, but off-cycle elections in general are a tricky prospect because demos who don’t always vote (which skew Democratic) have to be prodded even harder to go back to the polls once again after doing it the first time.
And this time they’re doing it on Dec 6th - less than a month from now - so they’ll need to go into overdrive to remind GA voters they have one more task to complete.
I have hope though.
GOP also benefits from an outdated political system that wildly over favours them relative to their actual numbers, extreme gerrymandering in many key states and laws that specifically depress the democrat vote, massive national news infrastructure that delivers extreme right wing propaganda 24 hours a day, incredible luck in being able to appoint most of the Supreme Court, transparent interference in the election from foreign allies who want to see the nation fail and lax regulation that allows billionaire fascists an unprecedented ability to flood elections with money.
Yet they still rarely turn all of those advantages into easy wins.
