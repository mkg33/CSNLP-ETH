i did read news, where there was a minister recently died suddenly, maybe its this country.
we'll at least they're still in one piece.
for everyone, reason, will to survive is different.
i believe not many will choose the harder path.
& outcome of Ukraine choosing same path as Belarus.
have to see what happens.
"I am saying this absolutely sincerely: with all the difficulties, if the Russian Federation—the leadership—wants to build relations with the sovereign independent state of Belarus, if Russia perceives us as a sovereign and independent state but a very close one, very reliable, where everything Russian—from the language to Russian traditions—is venerated, we are ready to build the relations," Lukashenko said Friday.
"Yet we should always proceed from the premise that we are a sovereign and independent state.
".
If Ukraine so far manages to push Russia back, imagine how much better the war would have went for it, had Belarus allied with Ukraine in a united front against Russia, rather than directly support Putin with territory and weapons (and possibly soldiers, too, now that Putin grabs Luka harder and harder by the balls.)
The West would have also been even more supportive from day 1, because it'd be clear Putin is going after Eastern Europe as a whole, rather than just "one country full of Nazis" as his propaganda claims.
Do I?
Most people aren't heroes.
They'd lay down, adapt or flee rather than take the hopeless fight.
You'll come to realize that once you get through that youthful idealism phase of yours.
