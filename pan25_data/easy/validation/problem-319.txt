2018 was particularly bad for the Democrats.
They were defending twice as many seats.
2020 should have been a great year but they underperformed in the senate races.
2022 gave the democrats a mathematical advantage in seats defended but the midterms generally favor the party opposing the president.
If Trump had won reelection we would likely be seeing a greater result for democrats.
2024 is another election where democrats are playing defense.
It will be a tough race, but a lot can happen in two years.
Any prediction at this point is mostly guesswork.
Absolutely.
Dems are defending like twice as many seats as Republicans in 2024.
Fortunately being a presidential election year dem voters are more likely to come out.
Yeah, you're probably seriously misevaluating Jon Tester.
He's a reasonably solid Democrat most of the time as long as you stay away from guns (it's Montana... you'll _never_ see an anti-gun candidate get elected here.
