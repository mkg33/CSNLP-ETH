Now, are there unusual or escalating wars and tensions that can reflect a worrisome trend?
Sure.
This just isn't one.
The only reason why I am worried about the US going isolationist is that , the US has made the world too dependent on them , once they step back , there will be a huge power vacuum and chaos before the world settles down again and I donâ€™t want to live through that period of time , there will be increasing chances of war as multi polar blocs try to expand their influence like in the pre US hegemony days like the imperial colonial times.
What?
I'm having trouble understanding them absolute nonsense you're spouting, and can't see how it's related to this article, which covers an Israeli retaliation that targeted a terrorist group's weapons facility.
While as a generalization war ought to be avoided when possible, of course, in this article Israel isn't escalating anything, just doing the good deed of destroying a weapon facility in response to an attack on civilians.
Everything.
Everything you know will fall apart.
How do I know?
Open a history book and see what happens to empires as they lose control of borders or become more isolationist.
The next thing that follows is more wars, loss of territory, and an economic collapse.
That's the good case scenario, where you don't get taken as a slave like Ukrainian kids are being taken by Russia right now.
