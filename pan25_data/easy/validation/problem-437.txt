Or the models are just broken.
Not sure I'd give 538 the benefit of the doubt, they are consistently wrong.
And yes, you can always hide it behind probabilities, but this isn't baseball where you have thousands of innings per season and the probabilities can actually be shown true over many, many games.
This is one big event every few years and there's no reason to believe or verify that a 60/40 prediction from 538 is correct.
It's basically non-falsifiable and utterly useless.
Wait, what?
I’m only seeing 205 called for Dems.
I’ll be excited if Dems take the house, but I’m curious as to where you’re getting your numbers.
Any direction appreciated.
Thanks!
semitism.
You figure that’s be enough.
But the cross-dressing photo and the “cousin conundrum” was what broken the camels back.
I guess “everything goes, but don’t do a gay if you’re republican”.
But then again, you have Lindsay Graham, so IDFK.
