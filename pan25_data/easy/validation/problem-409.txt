Have you ever lost someone to suicide?
I have.
Transgender people have a much higher rate of suicide than the average person.
I've talked down my trans friend more than once because they hated the body they are in.
I'd rather not go through that again because them having breasts isn't "imminent" enough for you or their insurance.
Yeah cancer fucking sucks and yeah that needs taken care of (and in a timely manner) but that doesn't stop someone else from needing treatment.
Giving trans person gender affirming care doesn't take care away from cis gender people except tying up a doctor for the duration.
If there is someone in need of a mastectomy because they have cancer by all means do what you gotta do but once that's done a trans man should be able to hop up on the table themselves with just as much coverage.
Just because it's not actively killing them doesn't mean that it's not a threat.
