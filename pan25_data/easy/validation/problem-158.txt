This has nothing to do with supporting Cuba.
I was obviously saying that the right echos that the US & NATO are to blame for Russia invading Ukraine.
Russia invaded Ukraine, so obviously Russia is to blame.
Russia blames NATO expansion.
A sovereign country is free to choose who their allies are, we don’t need to invade or force other countries to join NATO.
We should not be expected to appease tyrants in Russia because they object to their neighbors warming up to the West.
These countries shouldn’t have to live in fear to placate despots.
It’s literally forcing them to be a buffer state that’s greatly influenced, if not completely controlled, by Russia for Russian oligarch’s peace of mind.
It’s those countries who suffer, because increasing ties with Russia is their only option, lest Russia throw a pissfit.
They expect countries near Russia to stay in fear of Russian invasion rather than ensure their security through joining NATO, so it was wrong of the US & NATO not to appease Russia.
Multiple reasons.
One they were allies due to circumstances.
The soviets weren’t much better than the nazis and even allied them briefly.
Two the soviets made puppets out of Eastern Europe and essentially enslaved those areas when they should have freed them.
NATO and the Cold War was to stop them from enslaving more countries which unless you are fucking evil will agree is the right course of action.
The Warsaw Pact wasn’t even a thing really given those were just the soviets puppets so it was like allying with themselves.
Countries have joined nato so stuff like Ukraine doesn’t happen to them.
