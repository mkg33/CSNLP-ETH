Translation: "I need the $12k per month from being in Congress.
I refuse to quit.
You'll have to rely on Republicans to get rid of me, and they won't as long as I'm a guaranteed vote.
".
"As a life-long Californian, I have fond memories of my time at Beverly Hills High School with my friends Brandon, Kelly, Brenda, Dylan, Donna and Steve, to helping out after school at the family farm in the central valley each day, and then going to watch the sunset off the coast with the sun coming down over the Golden Gate Bridge.
I will do everything in my power to fight and restore traditional Reagan values to our failed state and push out things like groomers in drag.
".
If anything these charlatans that continue to win elections are drawing in more Republican voters that have absolutely no issue with having lying, cheating, uneducated idiots running this country, so long as they vote R and make "owning the libs" their sole mission.
But, Republicans with ZERO integrity continue to win elections, and they are needing to pretend to care about the lack of integrity less with every politician that is allowed to stay.
