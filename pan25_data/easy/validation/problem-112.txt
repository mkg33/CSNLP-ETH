Zooming out.
College is a major institution that serves the population overall.
It’s affected by demographic trends in the country and well I encourage you and everyone to inform themselves on demographics because it helps dispel a lot of the noise.
Anyways, the country’s population is growing slowly due to a steady stream of immigration.
The national born population that are in the schools and on their way to college is shrinking.
This a natural process- in line with other peer countries (and really the majority of the world, irrespective of income level).
Boomers having been the largest generation had the most economic dynamism during their time given historical events and the economic floor they began their economic lives at.
Millennials are the second most numerous generation and have had a large college participation rate and their attendance in college has coincided with the rise in major economies around the world - and many of those places affording and wanting to educate their kids here.
Millennials also saw the ‘08 financial crisis and the shrinking of federal budgets related to domestic priorities.
Moving forward the picture isn’t pretty and hard decisions follow.
But it is basically a fait acompli in the current model.
I would expect Zoomers to be a smaller cohort than millennials - we’ll have to see how things play out for families and births in the millennial pop.
It’s already an aberration in the world stage.
Most other countries had a large boomer generation and then have subsequently nose dived.

For whatever reason the glaciers did not touch this part of MN, IA, & WI.
Rolling hills and deciduous forests.
Really is a little slice of heaven.
