Nope, China needs to change its grid too, not build more coal plants like it is.
They produce a third of the global emissions currently.
That has to change or we're fucked.
Invest heavily in nuclear energy or other near non-contributing energy sources as the only acceptable power generation barring extreme outliers, heavily restrict or forbid trade with countries that fail to keep below a specified emissions limit, refuse to permit manufacturing or transport of goods in excess of that same limit, rigorously control agricultural production and force production of less climate affecting foodstuffs.
Tax the everloving piss out of everyone (though primarily the most wealthy) until this shit is under control to pay for necessary infrastructure shifts.
Act like a fucking government with a looming crisis.
We've proven that emissions aren't directly tied to economic gain, like previously thought, but many of the renewable technologies that are now widely feasible in wealthy nations are still prohibitively expensive elsewhere.
You've got to consider their wants and needs, alongside basic human nature, before you just demand they shut something off.
