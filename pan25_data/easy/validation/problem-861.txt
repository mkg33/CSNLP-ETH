What would possibly give him this idea?
Except getting away with everything he has done for decades.
I'm glad we finally stood up to him but damn imagine Ukraine got the military support it asked and begged for years ago.
How much suffering could have been prevented.
More likely Putin's assumption was that the Kyiv operation would be the exact same as the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia or 1979 of Afghanistan in which elite troops took control of the presidential palace/residency, arrest (Dubcek) or kill (Amin) the head of state, whilst airborne troops would seize the main airport (Ruzyne/Bagram) to enable supply and secure other key objectives in the capital to throw the country's military into disarray and cut off chain of command.
Are you arguing in bad faith for some reason?
This protracted war is definitely in the interests of the same military suppliers who helped prepare for it.
Lots of Americans are making money and no Americans are being killed.
WTF is Zelensky gonna say?
"Oh yeah, we had to make it look like we were undefended so Russia would overextend themselves.
I got us the hardware we need, but I had to make us into a proxy for US interests.
Go ahead and keep dying for the cause, though".
Unfortunately it doesn’t actually work.
It would be very satisfying, but it’s a huge strategic mistake.
