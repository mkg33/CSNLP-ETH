In the same way China triggers you, you see injustice you feel triggered.
But your sense of injustice is conditioned to a certain ideology, which is kind of worrying.
What a sociopathic society.
I have.
And asking people to mask and vaccinate is not a dictatorship.
Nor is putting an end to a occupation of which the police are doing nothing.
Or stopping illegal border blockades that not only harmed our economy but our national reputation.
Me?
I got my shot, I wore my mask, and I didn’t take weeks out of my life to go to a different city and terrorize others.
I made great money during that time, I had great sex, I cooked great food, I bought a house, I went to weddings, etc.
Unlike these losers who made others lives incredibly difficult just because they didn’t want a lil baby shot.
Exactly.
People that wanted to disregard mask and vaccine mandates had to go way out of their way multiple times to have anything enforced on them.
Even then, the most egregious violators got their cases dismissed or a slap on the wrist at best.
