Remember that pence is a man in the vein of Gilead.
What he envisions and has done during his time in office has been viciously misogynist, bigoted, and cruel.
Women of Indiana had a campaign called Periods for Pence where theyâ€™d call his office and explain how their menstrual cycle worked, since his legislation was harming them and their bodies in ways he did not seem to understand.
Not so much.
He tried hard to find a way to make it happen.
Called Dan Quayle who told him that he had no clear path to doing it, and that he would not survive the legal consequences intact.
If Quayle had gotten that wrong, things would have been much worse on 1/6.
Pence might seem like he heroically did the right thing - and he definitely wants you to think that - but it was selfish self preservation more than anything.
Pence enabled and excused and participated in trump's reprehensible behavior for 4 plus years.
He is definitely part of the problem.
His milquetoast repudiation of trump now -after saying NOTHING for almost 2 YEARS!- about the armed insurrection that he contributed to and was nearly executed by, is utter bullshit.
