Sweden and Finland abandoned their longstanding policies of military nonalignment and applied for NATO membership after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February, fearing that Russian President Vladimir Putin might target them next.
Their rhetorics have changed, to save their own faces in public.
Their campaigns are trying to erase their pasts, they’re more aggressive now than ever about having political power.
They’ve just become sneakier and people are falling for it in droves.
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson held talks with Turkish parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop on Tuesday before being welcomed with an official ceremony at Erdogan's presidential palace, where two were scheduled to discuss Sweden's NATO membership.
Sweden still has "many steps to take" to win Turkey's approval for its NATO membership bid, a top Turkish official said Tuesday as Sweden's new prime minister visited Ankara in hopes of eliminating the hurdle to his country joining the military alliance.
Sentop said the Turkish parliament welcomed Sweden's decision to remove restrictions in the defence industry but said groups that Turkey considers to be terrorists were still able to conduct "propaganda, financing and recruitment activities" in Sweden.
"We believe that the Swedish government's bowing to Turkish blackmail contradicts the principles and morals of Swedish society and the humanitarian attitudes that characterized Sweden," she said.
