I am literally writing from China- if you weren’t in Wuhan in 2020 or didn’t travel outside the country, you weren’t likely exposed to it.
Im not justifying any policy of the CCP but it is also true that more people than ever are now having their first exposure to the virus.
Period.
Facts.
Maybe, but I would argue federated democracy with some decentralized power is more stable than any dictatorship or monarchy, and far more better for the population than any form of communism.
Its pretty rare to see any other form of government with a peaceful transfer of power save democracy.
Monarchies and dictatorships etc have internal succession wars all the time.
Communism and dictatorships leads to genocide and scarcity.
lol, am there also.
Even if this is hyperbole, it seems only barely overstated since they closed all the testing.
I’ve been a rare apologist for both extremes of reckless and cautious policy and lockdowns in China, am vaxxed but understand people’s fears, but I’ve always been pro-reading testing.
It aliens never be hard or expensive to get a regular test.
