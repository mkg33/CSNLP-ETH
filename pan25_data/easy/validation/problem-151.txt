I lived in China and while it wasn't at all Syria, there was a balance to be struck between staying in and rushing out.
In a very severe earthquake, I'd probably do what I (realistically) could to escape the building.
There's a blurry line of intensity I'll sort of accept before trying to escape the building, as the kind that hit us wouldn't pose any real risk to the building structure.
Best in those cases to roll under something sturdy and stay put.
Seriously, nature is insane.
We all live in rickety shacks when nature is concerned.
Fortunate to live in an area that has fairly strict earthquake protections.
Heck, the Mormon Temple is refitting all of its earthquake protection as we speak.
Say what you want about the church, but they definitely use some of the latest tech in their buildings.
Entire situation is terrible.
They're definitely not made to withstands earthquakes when they should've and government has to be blamed for it.
But two 7+ earthquakes in the middle of the night are no joke either.
