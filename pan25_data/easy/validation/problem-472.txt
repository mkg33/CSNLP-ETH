Lmfao you know Russia invaded Afghanistan and weakened their government so much they had no way to prevent religious groups from being co opted by extremists.
America was right try and shut it down.
Mostly Pakistanis as they were so happy that Taliban took over and even one of their top minister or isi member was the first international delegate to visit kabul right after the takeover and had tea with the talibani leaders and even some Arabs were happy as they claimed this is the victory of Islam over western democracy.
The Pakistani angle is so sad because they were the first ones to celebrate the takeover of Afghanistan but now the TTP an offshoot of afghan Taliban is carrying out daily attacks in Pakistan from the past week and almost 30-40 people are loosing their lives daily because of it.
It hasn't worked since 1893.
Too fragmented a land, too fragmented a people, too little control possible from Kabul, too little incentive and desire for civilization outside the main cities.
P.s.
the Taliban were giving Safe Haven to the man who organized, planned and funded the 9/11 Terror attacks.
The fact that you can't answer that question tells me everything I need to know about you.
