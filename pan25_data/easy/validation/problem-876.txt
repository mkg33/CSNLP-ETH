Your observation is consistent with Stalin's death.
Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin's ruthless henchman, suddenly turned into a progressive democratic reformist.
Alas, it didn't save him from being executed by other former Stalin henchmen in their struggle for power.
Another of them, Nikita Khrushchev, won and proceeded with reforms and a mass destalinization in which Stalin's atrocities were publicly exposed.
Maybe.
Pundits overestimate how much of this policy is Putin's personal dictate; there is no anti-war force with any political power, it's all imperialist conservatives.
I said this from the start.
People like that actively want to stay out of public scrutiny, and are perfectly happy with the previous status quo (hell realistically they are most likely "fuck crimea" as well) the problem is their smash and grab of the russian economy means putin has his hands on parts of their bank accounts/assets.
No?
I'm just arguing that one should occasionally experiencesome things rather than expecting them to be perfectly described to you by a stranger and getting pissy about it.
