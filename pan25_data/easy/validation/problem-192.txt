The translation here is idiomatically incorrect.
He didn't say Putin is a "nobody" as if he was a loser.
He suggested that Putin doesn't exist, being either dead or incapacitated, and therefore cannot possibly meet to discuss terms with Ukraine.
It could be, but in this other interviews this week he more directly said that Putin is possibly using a body double to hide the fact that he's dead or dying.
One possibility?
is that Putin is suffering some sort of disease that would be publicly visible, and forcing him to make a public appearance might make that visible?
I'm talking idiomatically not literally.
He's not saying Putin is "nothing" as if he's a loser like most people in the thread are implying.
He's suggesting that Putin isn't the decision maker in Russia.
This is the second or third time in the last week that he has alleged Putin is dead or at the very least, not making decisions in Russia anymore.
Yeah, after winning the war, taking over the country, rewriting constitutions, de militarization, Westernization, denazification and forcing societal changes.
Russia won't change unless it's by force.
