I think part of the issue is in these places it is so expensive and so many people working and busting their butt can’t afford it so it is hard for people to want to keep throwing more and more tax money at when the people working to pay their own bills are often just getting by.
Empathy is needed on both sides and it shouldn’t be hard to understand the frustration of those taxpayers, especially when they live around this.
Also we don’t force compliance which is part of the problem.
People say housing but what they don’t like to talk about is the small percent of the population that really needs to be committed.
No amount of free housing and voluntary social services is going to get those people back to being contributing members of society in some way, or even just significantly less of a burden.
That small percent that uses a tremendous amount of resources needs involuntary care.
