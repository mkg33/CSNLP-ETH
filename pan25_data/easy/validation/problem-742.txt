A huge point that everyone needs to know is that gerrymandering is a fundamental foundation of the Republican Party, it is literally called "Project RedMap", it is in their party documents, developed by the Republican State Leadership Committee, and the Republican Party spent 30 million dollars initially to start the project.
Yeah.
Like in virtually every election.
The state courts rule the maps unconstitutional, but they just keep submitting more unconstitutional maps then the courts finally say it's too close to the election so we have to use them.
Blatant cheating.
Gerrymandering wouldn’t impact senate or presidential elections.
That directly impacts the house and state elections.
However the conveniently long lines and lack of precincts in “certain” areas is just as egregious.

Regardless, Gerrymandering is an absolutely un-Democratic, horribly corrosive tool to systematically subvert elections and the will of the people.
Two wrongs do NOT make a right.
