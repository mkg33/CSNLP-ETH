With this deal, Poland is basically upgrading their tank factories from building Russian era tanks to fully modern, bona fide western style main battle tanks.
Something they cannot do with German tanks because the Germans are unwilling to transfer technology and potentially create a rival tank builder.
Inferiority complex.
There’s a meme that pops up now and then where it’s EU saying they hate the US and the U.S. saying I don’t even think about you and it’s quite accurate.

Happy to hand over whatever is needed for Ukraine to win.
But if they're not trained up on Abrams or otherwise can't use them right now for whatever reason, I am also happy to find a symbolic dozen busted M1A1s and drag them over the border where they can rust in a Ukrainian warehouse instead of a Belgian one, if that's what it takes to get the SPD to get its collective head out of its ass.
