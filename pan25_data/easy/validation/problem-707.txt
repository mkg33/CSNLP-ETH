I can tell you that making enough money but still living like you are poor because you are saddled with an insane amount of debt due to things out of your control is awful too.
I could add some new insights to your study.
When talking about Joanne, It’s her own charity and political causes - stopping Scottish independence/terf behaviour etc.
Not really true charitable giving especially considering with any of these billionaire established charities - even if the intentions are good (seldom are) - they target the specific issue the billionaire cares about and are guided in how to do it by that individuals goals.
Meaning that they often don’t solve problems/solve the wrong problems if they solve anything at all because it’s about optics and vanity.
Yeah, seriously.
No one needs 110B.
If he is just going to donate it in the end don't pay him in the first place.
Raise the poverty wages of those that work for the billionaires instead.
He obviously doesn't need the money but his employees sure as hell do.
