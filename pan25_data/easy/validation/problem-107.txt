I'm not sure about that.
India has conducted military exercises with both West and its allies, and also with China and Russia.
India is that seductive woman that everyone is lusting for, but never gives them any of the chance to sleep with her.
I remember years ago when pundits repeatedly say China and India are going to clash as authoritarian vs democratic respectively, but it never really escalates apart from border clashes.
It is though that Western pundits are prodding India to take up role of keeping China on check, as the West's influence in Asia Pacific wanes.
But India always manage to normalise relations with China.
Democracy vs authoritarian rule.
See, we are disappointed India, as a democracy, is too short sided to support other democracies when they are invaded by authoritarian regimes.
You bitch about American authoritarianism, but we vote here, and regulate our politics the best we are able, something with which Indian voters can sympathize.
Yet to not give a fuck about Ukrainian people, leaves us asking why would we care when China comes to eat your lunch?
