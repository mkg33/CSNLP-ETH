I don’t really see any reason to suggest that Oryx’s Ukrainian losses are underreported at a rate significantly higher than Russia’s losses.
Realistically they started the war with far less tanks than Russia did and have been using them more conservatively.
Losing 900 tanks would be absolutely devastating to Ukraine, even with the donations and captures and imo reinforces how absurd the 2x discrepancy is.
Important to note that Ukraine has received a significant number of donated tanks as well as countless captured and unknown amount reactivated.
Their active number is far greater than 850 at this point.
I tend to think Onyx is heavily under-reporting Ukrainian losses, because losses while in defense that resulted in keeping the territory and offensives that resulted in territory gains are less likely to be photoed.
Yes.
It's about wrongheaded ideas about escalation.
It doesn't even make any sense, its not like Bradleys can shoot missiles all the way to Moscow.
If Western leaders are serious about Ukraine taking back all of its occupied territory from Russia, then Ukraine needs a huge increase in armored and mechanized forces.
3.
Following the above, the highest losses, almost all of which will be documented, come from the failed assaults.
