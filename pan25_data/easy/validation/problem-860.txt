What I came to understand about her is that she didn’t necessarily gravitate towards conspiracy theories, debunked information or hyperbolic/false rhetoric - she just regurgitated what her political party leaders, family members and rightwing “media” told her to.
She didn’t believe all, or even most, conspiracy theories or junk journalism.

But that’s only because that’s exactly what local GOP politicians and right-slanted media outlets were hammering to the public at that time.
I realize that not all conservatives are like this, especially the die-hard MAGA crowd who will almost always choose the conspiratorial path, even going so far as to boo their dear leader for his mere mention of getting vaccinated.
