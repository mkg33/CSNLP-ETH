Happy I live where I live north of the Mason Dixon line where I have enjoyed a drag show or two in my life.
It was fun, entertaining and energizing.
Back when I was in college in Daytona in 1991 there was a drag club right next door to a straight club and at the end of the night everyone mingled in the parking lot and went to the 24 hr diner.
NO fights.
NO homophobia.
We all got along cause who cares if some guy wants to wear a dress.
I wish we could go back to those days.
IMO ignorant boomers need to die off completely and take their fear hate w/them.
Such sad insecurity.
Reminds me of the movie American Beauty where during the whole movie actor Chris Cooper is a mega anti-gay veteran who repeatedly beats his son only at the end to express interest in homosexuality in attempt to kiss Kevin Spaceys character then upon rejection kills him.
It says it all.
I feel like conservatives think of the risque adult oriented drag shows, when maybe someone could correct me, but the ones where they are reading children's books are basically just anatomical men dressing up in women's clothing and makeup reading books as women.
Like I feel like that's the disconnect from reality and causing the violent response?
