Yeah, I get like three occurrences and on the fourth, it’s supposed to be a write up.
I think the fifth or sixth in a rolling calendar year is a firing.
Luckily, management doesn’t really punish people usually, although you do get penalized/punished by management (thrown on extra weekends or holidays involuntarily) if you call in on a weekend or a week that a holiday falls on (even if you don’t call in on the holiday).
Truth to that!
I recently switched careers at age 42, stressfully enough.
I had a 90 probationary period, then hired in with benefits.
I'd say like 3 weeks away from me being hired in, I ended up with Covid.
Im a pretty healthy guy, but it did me in.
I had to pay, out of pocket, to go to the Dr. just to be able to prove to my employer I had Covid.
Well, it pretty much kicked my but.
They told me to come back into work after 4 days, because 4 days is what they allow during your probationary period.
Well I was still sick.
I contacted the HR department and told them what was going on.
They said to go back to Dr for more documentation, which I did.
I was positive for like 13 days, maybe more.
I ended up getting let go even tho I had 2 Drs notes, that I had to pay to see the DR.
