Yeah except brasil has a history of picking bad presidents.
Also half of them are very right this time.
Lula nearly destroyed the country last time he was in.
It would be like if the UK re-elected Elizabeth Truss if she ran again.
Holy, propaganda, Batman.
Close to half the country voted for the other candidate.
Can we not pretend that the part of the population that voted for the loser disappears when they lose?
Like literally EVERY commodity exporting emerging economy.
And Brazil grew under BRICS average, so that was far from anything special.
Right place, right time.
So setting aside the fact that the vast majority of corruption taking place in Latin America is directly our fault stemming from policies and actions we’ve taken less than 60 years ago at this point that will likely continue to leave its legacy long after our children and grandchildren are dead- we’re being massive hypocrites in pretending that A.)
corruption free politics can exist at the executive level in any democratic country in the Western Hemisphere at this point or B.)
that the corruption inherent in these countries is actually that much more corrupt than the things we already take for granted at home (aside from political assassinations being more commonplace.
That’s kind of a huge issue but the CIA also literally helped write the political assassin’s playbook for this region of the world and the school that trained these operatives still exists today).
No.
Idiots take to the streets.
He’s literally a convicted criminal who couldn’t read until adulthood.
He was in prison until some idiot changed a law that means you can’t go to prison until you’ve exhausted every possible court ruling.
I.e.
if it’s a civil court and you get sentenced for whatever reason you can’t go to prison until you take it the whole way to the brasilian Supreme Court.
