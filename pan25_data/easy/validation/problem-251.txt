Most of the Youtube Ch's I subscribe to are smaller in terms of size, very few baring maybe Game Theory are reely big time plays in the grander for lack of a better term youtube hierarchy, and a most of them have gotten in trouble at some point or another and I'm not talking about when Google's content ID system flags stuff witch is a different issue in and of it's self, but when chanols are directly targeted by so called "copyright holders", I've seen a lot of Ch's just die off cos they were unfairly targeted and the Ch's owner effectively decided that it was'nt worth it to fight back.
And most of the time, unless a Ch.
has a lot of influence Google will just hand out the strikes and when the Ch.
owner sys there innocent Google quickly sends a response saying that they've reveawed the targeted video (witch is more then likely BS most of the time) and that they will uplohld the strike, refusing to elaborate as to why the strike was issued, usually taking a major twitter backlash, threats of google getting sued for acting in bad faith, or that Ch's union stepping in in order to have the decision revoked.
This article makes no sense.
If copyright law is such a “powerful tool” for censors, then why does every case they mentioned end with the would-be censors losing?

On top of this even when the "copyright holder" loses it can take years to get threw court, and wile for a major company like Google or Amazon that is a minor inconvenience, for smaller company's / independents this can potentially destroy them if they lose or if things drag out for to long, and even when the big company's lose they usually just have to pay a fee that amounts to a day or 2's worth of profit's at most and stop trying to steel that praticuler thing.
