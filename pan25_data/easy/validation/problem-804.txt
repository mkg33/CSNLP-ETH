I see pretty good reasons for an arrest if she was, say, sending bomb threats.
I discard hammer threat cuz article says it's alleged.
Someone allegedly killoed someone is meaningless statement.
I don't say her arrest was just, I only want to know the real reasoning behind it.
But somehow I can't see it anywhere.
No court files not even links to the posts no video of an arrest.
>According to Natalya Krivtsova, police burst into an apartment on December 26 where her daughter was living with her husband Ilya, forcing the young people to lie face down on the ground and allegedly threatening them with a sledgehammer, which the officers told her was a "hello" from the Wagner Group, a private military contractor headed by Yevgeny Prigozhin.
That could.
But the court of law decided otherwise and the trial was pretty public.
I am not a judge, lawer or prosecutor.
In my oppinion the judgement was just (I have a family and would be horrified if someone threatened them).
But some people may rightfully think otherwise.
This is the only thing I disagree.
Justice requires cool head.
It is the reason court have prosecutor and a lawer.
That statue should be blind and scales should have two cups.
