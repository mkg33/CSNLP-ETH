I sort of agree but I think liberals are a bit to cynical about conservatives.
The old Republican Party was basically a corporatist party.
(Pre 2010 tea party but really up to about 2016) It was just the elected representatives of the business community with some ideological window dressing to rally the rubes.
The old Republican Party in many ways was the system it had no real interest in revolting against anything besides cutting welfare payments and saving rich people taxes.
However the generation raised on Republican propaganda actually is genuinely anti-system.
They hate the corporate world and actually want to enact the Christian nationalist agenda the old party dangled in front of its more gullible members.
They have to square their desire to bring down the system with 50 years of pro business propaganda which creates this weird form of populist libertarian which is paradoxically both anti big business and anti any government regulation but mostly genuine in its convictions.
Mitch is playing the long game.
He knows when to hold them and when to fold them.
He is extremely crafty but most of those in his group do not possess the skills that he has.
Not even on a good day.
The democrats already know it.
The majority of them are not capable of negotiating with a paper bag.
I have to get more popcorn and some good beverages.
The silly dog has finally caught the car!
