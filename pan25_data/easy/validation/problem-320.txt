we could do Nikola Teslas wireless free powergrid idea, power it on recycled nuclear, drive cars or ultralight aircraft locally powered by compressed air tanks and 3D print things with miniature automotive assembly line robotics that use hydrogen-oxygen torches to melt and work with almost any metal.
Fuck, it could even be entertaining giving it some chatGPT bullshit algorithms and some kind of bongsmoker personality that does all that while looking like its smoking a bong, just diddling with that form of modern recycling in areas of town deemed "lost and found".
What?
There's nothing wrong with high consumption if it's sustainable.
High population is fine too - the pollution output of a billion humans is relatively negligable.
A billions humans pollute very, very little, naturally.
Producing the things they consume CAN pollute a lot.
There is nowhere on earth that is predictably safe because this weather/biological/geological event is literally unprecedented.
The climate has never changed at the rate it's currently changing.
