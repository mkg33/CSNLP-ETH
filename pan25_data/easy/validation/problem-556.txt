So, I feel there is a difference between "audit" and "investigating specific offenses" in general.
Like, audit's happen all the time.
But "investigation into insider trading", "investigation into nepotism", or "Investigation into misuse of funds" can ruin a career with just the investigation, even if they don't find anything.
It's part of the reason people don't want to have the risk of scrutiny sometimes.
I absolutely agree.
I work for a vendor that supplies devices to hospitals.
A vendor cannot provide anything that appears as a gift to healthcare providers.
Even a lunch during a training event.
Obviously, it is to not lean decision making on how much one vendor rewards a hospital over another.
The fact that this is happening potentially with the supreme court is unbelievably unethical.
We as Americans, should demand change and support our representatives that will be challenging this.
As they should.
