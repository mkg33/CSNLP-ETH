ETA: you're absolutely right it can be considered a national security violation.
It sure seems like the professionals at NORAD and the Pentagon aren't treating it like such, and are using a wait and see approach.
So, to someone like me who has worked in missile defense and on UAVs, that demonstrates that they'd rather gather potential information from that balloon and its payload rather than just shoot it down.
The more assets we point at it to potentially listen in, the more intercepts we may be getting that can give us a picture into Chinese aerospace communications, encryption and spread spectrum/counter-jam methods, and other valuable intelligence.
They've likely planned for that are are watching the watchers, and we're likely watching the watchers doing the watching.
It's electronic warfare chess, and shooting the balloon down ends the game and cuts off any meaningful data we can scrape from it for now.
If and when it is shot down, then the interesting parts of trying to salvage and reverse engineer hardware might come into play, but that will probably not be made public if it happens.
