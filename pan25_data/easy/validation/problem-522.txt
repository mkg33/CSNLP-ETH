Please correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to remember that when Argentina's currency devalued by a considerable degree, the Argentinian government asked foreign governments to do something like that (can't remember the specifics of exactly what and how) to their citizens's foreign holdings overseas somehow.
PS.
It wasn't long after our custom game was made that Argentina literally just cancelled the currency, and started a new one.
If you hadn't traded in your "Australes" for the new "Pesos," they were literally garbage.
Of course, trading them in was pennies on the thousands, or worse.
Hence our new game was born.
Exactly.
That’s what people are not understanding.
As long as inflation is higher than rate that USA pays on their debt, then it’s fine because all of US’s depbt is in $$$.
In addition US can just print money whenever it wants.
Possible.
I'm certainly not familiar with banking in south america, or any banking outside Sweden for that matter.
I would expect some loans to go out tho, maybe not mortgage's.
