, SCOTUS isn't forcing this policy and dropped the title 42 case after Biden told them that the public health emergency (which title 42 requires) would be ending.
The violating of international law and abuse of asylum seekers which includes separations of families could have ended with the end of that public health emergency but the Biden administration has decided to continue it with this new policy.
The article under the headline "Asylum seekers face decision to split up families or wait indefinitely under new border policy" that says, "many families like Jeyson’s have found themselves confronted with a seemingly impossible decision: Wait indefinitely for enough appointments for the whole family, or split up... '... what you have is a system that privileges single people'” makes it really clear that the Biden administration's policies are separating families.
Edit: i am correct.
Even on the app directions on the cbp.gov site it says you can use kiosks or paper forms.
Republicans lying?
Well, that's unheard of, I'm sure that'll come back on them when people find out /s.
