“As is now clear, January 6th was only one event among many that together constituted an extraordinary campaign to overturn an election.
The scale and audacity of the campaign is profoundly troubling.
Among the most alarming findings is that various members of Congress participated in it,” the letter said.
“Nearly 40 former members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter to their current colleagues requesting ethics investigations for members “who played a role in the events leading up to and on January 6th.”.
“Based on the facts and findings to date, we urge you to demand that the Office of Congressional Ethics thoroughly investigates those members who played a role” in the Capitol riot, “and if appropriate, that the House exercise its disciplinary functions.” The letter continued, “At stake is not only the institutional integrity of the legislative branch — to draw and enforce bright lines of ethical conduct — but the principle of accountability upon which our democracy rests.”.
