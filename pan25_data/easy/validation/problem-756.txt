That video was absolutely chilling.
Can’t see anything happen, but the sound of her screaming told you everything.
I’ve seen the worst of the worst videos on the internet and am completely unaffected by them most of the time, but that woman’s agonizing screams really struck a chord with me.
I’m sure they raped her, probably continued to torture her and kill her unless she was sent off to die in a work camp.
I wish I could know more about that woman and what happened, because that video brought up a lot of visceral emotions for me.
Just pure, tangible pain in her voice.
Rivers through deserts are great cradles for civilization because they forced people to live in a density, form cities, and at the same time be mostly defended from outside invaders, but these desert-river based societies made for poor empire builders as a single drought in even a small area would disrupt their entire food supply.
Sure they do.
Everything you do is a choice.
Just because the choice is not good, or is a choice between two terrible things, does not mean you are not making a choice.
Just because you have to choose between two terrible things, does not mean you have no choice.
There's where the term "lesser of two evils" comes from.
