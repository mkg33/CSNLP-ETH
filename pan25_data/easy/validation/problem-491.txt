The ypg or Kurdish people have fought to make their homeland for a very very long time, in the Middle East they stand for religious freedom and equal rights, a truly remarkable people considering the geopolitical location, oh and did I mention they stood their ground against isis and several other extremists groups time and time again.
Agreed!
A few Americans have definitely made great sacrifices for the Kurdish people.
But if the Kurds saw just a fraction of the committed support that Ukraine for example is seeing, they would be independent by now.
There have been so many significant opportunities to provide that, or at the very least to prevent their genocide, and these have all gone wasted.
It's frustrating-- there are so many examples of stateless exploited people that have no hope of gaining determination-- but the Kurds have had genuine, realistic potential to achieve their freedom and nothing but their mountains will stand for them.
Fucking deplorable.
the other group is the ypg which many foreign fighters have aided over time.
At one point they were a hot spot for foreign fighters.
