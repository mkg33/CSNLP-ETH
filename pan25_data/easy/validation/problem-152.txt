The Russian dictator is the one discrediting his army by treating them like mere insects.
He has no natural feelings for any of them and when they die he feels nothing.
They're trying, actually.
Or at least they claim they are.
I don't remember seeing it anywhere here since it was minor news even in Russia, but a month or so ago, I think, I read Prigozhin claiming there are lots of volunteers in women's prisons that wish to go to the front lines to be nurses and the like.
He claimed it's not being done yet, but that "he's working on it".
Haven't heard anything about it since, though, so no idea.
Nobody.
Nobody knew or could believe the guys who spent 20 years stealing money and building mansions would actually be dumb enough to invade Ukraine.
Yes, there are assholes who believe him.
I’d say about half.
Nobody asked or even told people.
Hell, they didn’t even tell the soldiers.
They thought they were there on an exercise.
They had food to last only that duration.
They couldn’t coordinate, they didn’t have proper plans.
This helped Ukraine in the first days and weeks.
