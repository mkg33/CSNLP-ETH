“There will be times when the struggle seems impossible.
I know this already.
Alone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy.
Remember this, Freedom is a pure idea.
It occurs spontaneously and without instruction.
Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy.
There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they’ve already enlisted in the cause.
Remember that the frontier of the rebellion is everywhere and even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.
And then remember this, the imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural.
Tyranny requires contact effort.
It breaks, it leaks.
Authority is brittle.
Oppression is the mask of fear.
Remember that.
And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance, will have flooded the banks of the emperor’s authority and then there will be one too many.
One single thing that will break the siege.
Remember this.
Try.

Nemik from Andor.
"Russia has said it will pull out of a UN-brokered grain export deal after a dramatic attack by Ukrainian airborne and underwater drones on its Black Sea naval base of Sevastopol in the early hours of Saturday morning".
Think about it like this.
These drones don't need air.
Battery operated propulsion, no crew.
So the lower it goes the harder it is to detect.
However diving deep below the surface interferes with remote control, radio doesn't work underwater.
Also requires depth control systems, unnecessary cost and complexity.
Ha.
And it's not even friends as in other governments but in people from around the world lol.
I'm pretty sure the Russians aim was to isolate Ukraine not gain them allies.
