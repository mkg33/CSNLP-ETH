Thank you for helping complete the quota, we simply cannot have discussions about Russia and Ukraine without a troll "America bad too!"
type post.
“and genocides by Christians, but that wouldn't prove Christianity is evil.” It would if Christians could quote their authority, Jesus as God incarnate, as doing the stuff that Muhammad (by Allah's authority) did and preached, even according to universally-recognised Muslim sources.
If a Muslim starts killing black people or if they start practicing cannibalism, that of course has nothing to do with Islam, because it’s not part of any scripture or old, widespread tradition.
That particular kind of atrocity i.e.
not commiting atrocities in line with, or required by, an ideological basis but IMPOSING their ideological (or pragmatic) baggage on a contradictory ideology, is what Christians started doing, only when it became hijacked by imperial authority in the late 4th century.
They thus preserved its texts and traditions, but governments twisted their meaning, or arbitrarily used the O.T.
paradigm when it was convenient, or just outright ignored the whole thing.
Christians at all times contested these de-facto heretical acts and teachings with a solid doctrinal, scriptural basis for pacifism, for example.
Islam, by contrast, DOES have different types of atrocities unambiguously justified in its still-binding sources, which have exacerbated or directly caused untold misery in the world for centuries.
And less violent or hostile interpretations are not only far harder to get from the Quran and Sunnah by nature as compared to the New Testament, but (largely because of this very reason), have been extremely rare.
Even in the more mystical interpretations like Sufism, these hostile concepts are still largely kept.
These are uncomfortable facts, but facts nonetheless.
And please spare our time and don’t try to bring ahadith that nobody recognises as authoritative, or the Old Testament to prove the Bible is violent too... You have to learn the basic theological position that Christians follow a new covenant - indeed this theology of different dispensations for different communities or at different times is also in the Quran (e.g.
Sura 3:50).
You can disagree with the validity and logic of the Christian’s view of the covenant (and criticise the aforementioned hypocrisy of “Christian” governments in using what you could call a more “Old Testament mentality” inconsistently with the new covenant mentioned above), but what you CANNOT do is pretend this distinction doesn’t exist, that it has no scriptural basis, and isn’t recognized by the oldest records of orthodox Christianity (Although even by the time of tradition-forming guys like, say, Saint Augustine, it was already arguably different from the views of the N.T.
itself in stuff like war.
But for the purposes of this discussion, this is only very marginally relevant).
