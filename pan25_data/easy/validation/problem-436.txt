A "far left nutjob" in this case is one who puts his own vanity and his own person (and potentially his own message) over this overall pragmatism.
Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with people on the left wing of the party run in primaries to accentuate their message and gain support with the base and/or even bring their own base of support into the party.
But running on the left, while someone else with a higher chance of winning is running in the center?
That's a no-go for me.
And, naturally, democrats that are the farthest away from Joe Manchin are on the left wing of the party and tend to rather vote for someone that vows to represent more of their interests than Manchin.
Terrible idea.
Ojeda is way too far left to win in this, one of the reddest states of the Union.
Manchin is likely to lose, but anyone else would be guaranteed to lose, and as we saw in the 2020 Senate race in the state, the whole "red voters are just holding out to be flipped by a progressive populist rather than an establishment Democrat" idea is a massive flop.
