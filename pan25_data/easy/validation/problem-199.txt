My 7yo says kids his age already use them to watch TikTok on the bus to school.
My kid recently asked why one of the kids in his school says “lick my balls, daddy” with a weird voice, and when I asked if the kid watches TikTok, I received a confirmation that the kid uses and talks about it a lot.
Finally, someone reasonable.
The fact that so many kids are using unsupervised smartphones is jaw-dropping.
I'd wager only a fraction (5%) of parents use parental controls on their kid's smartphone today.
Which is just mental, considering how much you can protect yourself and your child with such services.
Limit spending, screen time, access and whatnot... At this point it becomes immediately clear which parents just gave their kid a phone to 'shut them up', and which actually care about their child's safety on the internet.
Obviously.
My niece and nephew are 12 and 14 and they are only allowed one of those super limited phones that can only contact approved contacts and access super limited internet shit and that’s what I plan to do if I have kids.
I was a product of unfettered internet access at that age and I saw some fucked up shit.
Like both me and my parent have a massive interest in parenting to met the needs of our three kids via Maslow’s hierarchy of needs ( We both work three jobs (my partner is a therapist and in community development; I work in community education with senior school students, counseling with clients at a sexual assault service, and run various group work programs like healthy relationships, men’s groups and others), we both study and have studied relevant degrees which would assist in knowing evidence based practice.
