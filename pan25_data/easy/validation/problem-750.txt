Nowadays I just go straight to the scientific paper honestly.
Usually its only 2-3 hyperlinks away from an article if its got any legs, but the AI can pull general information about those papers existence from the few questions I asked it about theoretical physics and enclosed biospheres.
It can't do the science for us.
Edit: Im curious who's going to be writing all these AIs, who's going to be writing the pipelines to funnel the data to the right ones, who's going to be creating the models, working out the business logic, who's going to manage the databases the AIs operate off of, etc.
etc.
etc.
etc.
Programmers and Developers, that's who.
Certainly not middle-fucking-management.
Nothing new.
As in you've already been exposed to it.
It clearly hasn't finished proliferating the markets.
It is actively disrupting new fields every month or two now it seems.
Text to video is coming out soon...
Ridiculous.
I'm gonna be fine.
You're imagining a future where CEOs and the super billionaires are the ones telling AIs what to do, and that's plum dumb.
Just unabashedly stupid.
I know you're not actually imagining that though, your cynical brain stops working after two steps.
But that's the end result of your cynical outlook and as with all cynicism, it's way over blown.
