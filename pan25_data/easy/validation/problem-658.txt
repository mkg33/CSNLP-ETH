True, surveys point to Europe and Oceania overall being the least religious continents in the world.
Poland is one of the more religious countries in Europe, although their number still isn't particularly high on a global scale.
An easy comparison between European countries and the US here:
Except for a few Balkan countries and microstates, all European countries were surveyed.
Among the 34 countries that were surveyed, 16 countries have 10-25% who say they believe in God with absolute certainty, 10 countries have 26-50% who say they believe in God with absolute certainty, and only 8 countries are at +50%.
Among those 8 countries, only Greece and Romania are in the EU (with the remaining being non-EU Balkan countries, Moldova and two that are in the Euro-Asian transitional zone in the Caucasus; Armenia and Georgia).
In comparison, the number for is 63%, meaning that only the two highest EU countries are in the same high range.
Poland is considerably lower at 45% who say they believe in God with absolute certainty, but that's the third highest among EU countries.
BS.
That's no democracy.
That's just popularity contest where winner has no obligation to own voters.
It's just blatant propaganda made by these corrupt liars.
Polish (similar to many other western countries) people have virtualy no real power over politics.
Polish corrupt politicians choose that but it's typical imperialist trick to buy local leaders and pretend it's all their choosing and you falll for that.
