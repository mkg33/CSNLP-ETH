Great.
More “vote for me not because I have a plan but because the other guy sucks”.
And we wonder why nothing happens in Congress, because our politicians have no plans except crapping on the other side.

It’s complicated.
Missouri is a majority red state by count of the counties.
But a vast majority of the population of Missouri lives in 3 cities along the major highway I-70: St Louis, Kansas City (next biggest after Louey) and Columbia (home of Mizzou), and springfield(okay place to live).
Of course these urban areas with their larger populations would be a threat to republicans, so they do everything they can get away with to suppress votes in and around these cities.
A BIG chunk of Missouri is democratic leaning, but because of the fact that they live in close proximity to eachother makes it easy for republicans to make sure their votes don’t matter.
