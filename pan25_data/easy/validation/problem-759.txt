It had nothing to do with the Democrat party seeking to maintain their political power (which was based on slavery), and that had the Democrat party been willing to loose political power over time, (due to slavery not being expanded, and only maintained where it currently existed), with the result being that the Democrat politicians wouldnâ€™t have formed the Confederacy and instigatedthe Civil War.
This belief, and the pushback of new states and territories against the institution of slavery, led the Democrats to instigate the Civil War, seeking to form their own country and maintaining positions of power, versus loosing political power over time by remaining in the union.
The true cause of the civil war, was a grasping for political power by the Democrat party, and slavery, or more rightly, the belief that there must be an expansion of slavery, was the excuse used, under the guise of states rights, to seek to maintain their political power.
Meanwhile, the Democrats, whom the spoils of slavery had enriched, and which enrichment was subsequently used to grasp political power, sought to expand slavery into new states and territories, thereby extending their power and influence over a growing nation.
Both Republicans and Democrats believed that if slavery were not allowed to expand into the new states and territories, over time, the Democrats would experience a loss in political power.
Only when it became apparent that slavery would not be allowed to expand, and there would be an attendent loss of political power and influence by the southern states at the national level, did the southern Democrat politicians proceed with secession.
The Democrat politicians believed that forming the Confederate States of America would allow them to maintain political power, and continue with the cotton plantation based economy.

He's changing the voting rules to make sure only Republicans win.
