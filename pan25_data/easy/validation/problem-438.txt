So taking a stand against the new axis of evil where Iran, Israels mortal enemy, is a central actor is not a reason to aid Ukraine?
Because Ukraine hurt their feelings?
The Jews in Europe and the Arab world were mostly restricted from what you'd consider a "respectable commoner job" before the industrial era- you could not farm, mine or anything of that kind, and thus you were restricted to things like banking (Christians couldn't lend to other Christians with interest, but the Jews are not Christians), crafts jobs (which are not EXACTLY what you'd consider "productive" back then and were really up to the king) and things the community needed (therefore making connections with your "local neighbors" quite hard but what can you do).
The Average Jew was more likely to be literate than the average Christian or Muslim, but the language they were literate in would not always be the local language but rather the local language of the community or of Biblical Hebrew.
Therefore, when banking was considered increasingly important the connections of the Jewish communities (which were surprisingly strong) and the focus on "non-productive jobs" and education has led the Jewish communtiy to be one of lawyers, doctors and bankers a lot of times.
The wealth has led others to hate the Jews and created the idea the Jews "control the world" because when so many Jews are taking great jobs when they can don't think about their skills- just think about how they just stole your high earning jobs They are now actors, artists, surgeons, politicians and who's to say they didn't become de-facto kings yet (Hint: to know the answer to that, consider if you have you seen two Jews agree on anything?).
Sure, Zionism and Israel are not exactly helping people's image, but there's a rich context.
