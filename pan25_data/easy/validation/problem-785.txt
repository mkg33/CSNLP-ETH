There’s a difference between the principle of free speech and the first amendment.
The latter is for what you described, but the former is the broader belief that we should have a society that fosters free and open discussion of ideas.
Most of the values we hold today started out as unpopular minority opinions, and I think we lose something as a society if we move in the direction of those opinions being suppressed.
I say this with absolute certainty that nothing MTG has to say will contribute to society in any way whatsoever.
I just think it’s important to remember that freedom of speech as an ideal is broader than the first amendment.

It's incredible how little the party of fiscal responsibility understands actual fiscal responsibility.
Dumping millions into sham hearings just to rile up their base and cover up the fact that they have no policy only wastes money and time.
