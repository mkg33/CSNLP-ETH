I still have friends back there.
One couple I know are raising a child with adhd and autism, like my oldest.
It's my understanding that students don't have the same level of protection as what is covered by the ADA.
They may have had additional protection with the EU, but that is gone now.
Their son has been expelled for next to nothing from two schools.
He was just disruptive.
One parent had to give up their nursing career to homeschool him.
There was nowhere else to go.
By undermining faith in public education with strawman arguments and moot points (see: CRT in elementary schools), they are making ignorance the preferred alternative to intellectualism.
Yep.
And rags like the Wall Street Journal are bashing the fuck out of public education and would happily have let DeVos finish the job she started.
Like maybe public schools would perform better if they were actually funded and staffed adequately?
But no, they cut off funding and then point and shout “See we told you it doesn’t work!”.
