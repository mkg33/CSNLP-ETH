Except it’s not that clear at all.
Our foreign policy of violently eliminating anyone who thinks differently about how their own government should be run is inherently fascist.
I’m pro-democracy, which means I’m anti-forcing other countries to embrace our ideals with bombs.
Supporting our imperialist nation building efforts is a very right-wing notion to me.
I’m not pro-Putin, but I am very against our involvement in the region going back almost a century that has directly resulted in this conflict.
We made this happen, and now are turning around doing shocked pikachu face that It did.
So I find myself in the anti-fascism stance of being anti-support for Ukraine and pro-us minding our own fucking business and not playing world dictator for once.
Very strange to me how many people supposedly on the left still wholeheartedly support our disgusting foreign policy of brutal suppression of opposing thought and economic pillaging.
Thank you!
I don't normally make post like this but that's exactly what it is.
Stupid people keep yelling like we're letting Zelensky back up a convoy of Mac trucks to the federal reserve when we're actually doing the most American thing we ever do and feeding the MIC.
Also, there will be brutal repayment.
Past that, this entire war is one huge commercial for American arms that are severely superior to our eastern European competition.
This is economically a win win scenario.
