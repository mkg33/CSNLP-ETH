The more high profile the person, the more evidence you'd need to prevent from being found out.
The consequences of getting found out would be extreme, too.
Classified information about planes isn't always the technology.
Although many older airframes can be packed full of cutting edge technology (B-52 has a modern sensor suite, and the B-2 is still the most advanced bomber flying, even after 26 years), that's a story for another comment.
What is just as important as the cutting edge technology is the knowledge of a plane's capabilities.
Being able to know precisely how the plane opperates, knowing the true capabilities, can turn an imposing peice of hardware into a predictable statistic that can be outmaneuvered.
Knowledge of its strenhs and weaknesses is sometimes the most secret aspect, all of which you can now exploit.

Apparently Ukraine inherited a lot of them when the USSR dissolved then sold most back to Russia and scrapped the remainder.
