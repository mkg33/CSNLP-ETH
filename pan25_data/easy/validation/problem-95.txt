Russia was Venezuela's previous major ally, and was a source of both financial and military aid to them ever since things went south between them and the US.
Now that Russia has become unplugged from both the world economy and military exporting, this leaves Caracas trying to find a new partner.
Since the US is unwilling to let China become that partner, and thereby make inroads into the Americas, the US itself is going to prop them up.
Definitely.

You know shit, Chavez expropriated over 90% of industry, only a couple business survived, then after they completely destroyed those business the how we call it Bolivarian Oligarchy, composed of members of the military and PSUV politicians got their hands on those properties, so no shit is private owned in Venezuela, and I did read Marx, Engels and Lenin fyi.
Chill.
Our oil production has been raising at a nearly steady rate for a decade.
