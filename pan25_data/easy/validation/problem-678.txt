It's bizarre that people think it's controversial.
Courts in Europe interpreted laws.
The king could put his foot down, but the equivalent of that in our system is supposed to be a new law.
If it's a constitutional question, then that new law is a constitutional amendment.
I've yet to read anybody even try to argue that a question of constitutional interpretation doesn't fall under that umbrella.
They just get mad and downvote.
Meanwhile, consider the absurdity of the branch that makes the laws getting to decide whether or not those laws are constitutional.
Why bother trying to limit that particular branch in the document itself in any way other than the checks & balances imposed by the other branches - or branch, really, since the judiciary would be basically worthless?
Whatever law they passed, they'd just add a little footnote: "And of course everyone voting in favor of this legislation believes that it is a legal exercise of an enumerated power that does not infringe upon any reserved right.
