As the primaries continued, various groups tried to negotiate a resolution to the standoff between the DNC and the state parties.
The Clinton campaign advocated first for the results to stand and then for a new round of voting to take place in Michigan and Florida, while the Obama campaign deferred the matter to the DNC, while expressing a wish that the delegations be seated in some form.

Buttigieg, economically speaking is fairly conservative.
He was Obama 2.0 - member of a marginalized demographic, appearance of being left because of membership in that marginalized demo but still economically/fiscally conservative.

GA should probably be on that list too, as it looks like Democrats have been getting better at mobilizing the black vote.
Perhaps long-term, even states like MS and LA can be opened up.
