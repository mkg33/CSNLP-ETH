I am assuming that the Indian Health Services have provided some health care for tribal members at tribal clinics, like in my state.
Medicaid expansion will give natives (who don’t already buy private insurance because of cost) further health care options.
Who this will particularly help are non-natives who cannot afford private insurance and that greatly benefits hospitals and clinics.
Yeah.
It's real funny how states rights in red states means gerrymandered voter suppressed state legislatures who disregard the will of the people.
And by funny I mean sad and disgusting.
Hopefully there is a smooth path to immediate enrollment; you’ll likely recall the unconscionable refusal of Missouri Republicans several years ago to appropriate the necessary funds to cover Medicaid expansion costs after voter approval of Medicaid expansion.
Noem is a climber.
She wants to be president someday.
She would much rather do stuff popular on NewsMax and Breitbart than popular with her own voters.
And she will do whatever she can get away with.
Although Republicans everywhere are comfortable denying health care access to poorer people, they will support the maintenance and expansion of health services, especially in underserved rural areas.
Tying Medicare expansion to improving the access and quality of hospitals and clinics, which are available for all residents, is a winning combination for fighting against efforts to stymie the people’s will.
Health care access isn’t a right or left issue.
It affects everyone in the state Legislators need to be reminded often.
