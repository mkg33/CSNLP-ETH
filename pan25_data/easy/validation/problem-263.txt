Once you have your batch of 20% U235, you can run your centrifuges in parallel and quickly get it up to about 65%-80% or more.
Technically you may be able to create an effective nuclear weapon, but otherwise, you rerun your centrifuges in series again to get it above the 90% threshold for most nuclear weapons.
You cna get it to 99% but a little bit U238 can have its own benefits.
Maybe if the cia was better at using their subterfuge techniques to undermine state sponsored criminal organizations instead of installing easily corruptible puppets all over the world globalization would have been an equalization instead of a degradation into plastic-drowned, overcommercialized, and sadistically gas-addicted hell.
This is not true.
Quality of Russian Air Force has dropped since they are now taking older aircrafts from storage, but the quantity is still there.
In fact, they have already fully replenished their losses and now have pre-war numbers in this regard.
Extract uranium via chemical processes.
At this stage you can chemically reconstitute it and have pure Uranium, but it would be useless for anything else for testing radiation detectors and a door stop.
Spin up the chemically dissolved uranium to high speed in a centrifuge to very slightly pull the slightly heavier U238 to the outside, and u235 to the inside and siphon it out.
Keep repeating.
Enrichment facilities will have a series of centrifuges slowly increasing the enrichment from 0.75% to about 20%.
By treaty and international law, anything under 20% U235 can be used for reactors.
Most fuel providers won't provide higher that 19%, though most civilian reactors don't use more than around 10%.
