Yet for some reason its never a problem when they want to cut taxes or increase military spending.
No, it's only an issue when we want to provide healthcare.
The US can't provide good healthcare because the cost of healthcare is too damn high.
It's not because the government is spending money in the wrong places, it's because it costs $15,000 to treat a broken arm in the US meanwhile it costs less than $1000 in Europe.
That's not "fund mismanagement", that's the government having no control over healthcare prices.
That's actually a lot more comparable to why healthcare sucks in this country than "fund mismanagement".
Someone on minimum wage can't afford to live because the cost of living is too damn high.
Incredibly incorrect.
Fund mismanagement means that the funds are available, but not used correctly.
Going bankrupt could be for mismanaging money, but what about someone on minimum wage?
They can’t afford to live.. they don’t have the funds to mismanage.
Some companies aren’t liquid to provide the funds to mismanage.
Some lack sales.
YOU are trying to correct someone trying to sound smart when he’s right.
