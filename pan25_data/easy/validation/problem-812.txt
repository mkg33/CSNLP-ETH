Who is the grown up here?
If people call what's going on in this country right now a good democracy than something is wrong country is going in the wrong direction I mean seriously when lgbtq and abortion is more important than anything else something is wrong I have nothing against gay people and I have nothing against abortions when the mother's life is at risk or it was right or incest but there's something wrong with those two things right there become the most important thing in the country nobody cares about the Border nobody seems to care about inflation nobody seems to care about the gas prices that's all they care about is gay rights and abortion that's sad.

The word “ye” in the quoted paragraph above was the old English way to say “the”.
As a side note, it was probably never pronounced “ye” it’s just that English used to have a letter for th that looked kind of like a y.
Anyway, people sometimes use old spellings like “ye olde” to jokingly refer to something that is very old.
In this case “ye olde democracy”.
