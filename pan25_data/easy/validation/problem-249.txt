Everyone has a good and a bad side.
It's just with modern conservatives, they show nothing but their bad side.
Also my point was that not all conservatives in the past were bad.
I just used Eisenhower as an example.
I know that subsequent conservative administrations started some horrible policies that really screwed over the country, such as the "War on Drugs" started by Nixon.
Or Bush's "War on Terror" and baseless WMD lies that lead to the invasion of Iraq.
The invasion of Afghanistan was based on the fact that Al-Qaeda was based mainly in the country, which was behind the 9/11 terrorist attack.
So the invasion of Afghanistan wasn't baseless, but it was horribly managed by the W. Bush administration, then later by Obama and Trump administrations.
100%.
Calling out the GOPâ€™s hypocrisy is a dead end with the most diehard supporters.
No matter what Trump, DeSantis, etc.
do it will never ever be as bad as the evil, America-hating, baby-eating, woke, democrats.
