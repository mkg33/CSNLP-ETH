Across the board, we've seen that when these countries develop, when their populations are educated, and when women are given more rights, the birth rates drop to that of developed countries shockingly fast, sometimes within a decade.
Developing countries have higher birthrates because they almost universally have less rights for women, a lack of access to education, and high infant mortality from various factors (lack of clean water/food, lack of access to healthcare, poverty, etc.
), all of which contribute to dramatically higher birthrates.
Capitalism requires exponential growth in everything to be sustainable (economically).
If the population goes flat or negative, stocks go flat or negative.
That's terrifying for the ruling class whos power comes from the stock market.
So, worried about overpopulation?
