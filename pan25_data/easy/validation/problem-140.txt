Eh I don’t know about it this time.
A lot of the money he stole was from rich people and groups.
They’ll want there money back and to see him punished.
He hurt the upper class as well.
The question will be if SBF misrepresented himself to institutional investors while securing capital, if he adhered to accounting standards, if he misused client assets, if he misled people about the nature of FTX product, etc.
Ex.
If you offered me 10,000 Asshole Bucks for $1000, I would refuse your offer on the premise that Asshole Bucks don't hold real value.
But if your sales pitch included " Well if I sell a billion Asshole Bucks, eventually they may(Keyword here) be legitimate, I've already sold 500,000.
I would be sceptical, but still interest in the offer because I'm getting this currency at a discount.
I then gave you $1000 for 10,000 Asshole Bucks, even though I know Asshole Bucks aren't legitimate tender.
You have made $1000 off of me and $50,000 off of the other people you sold 500,000 Asshole Bucks to.
Then later I tell other people with money to buy your Asshole Bucks.
You then Sell 2 Million Asshole Bucks to everyone who believes in the idea that they may one day become legitimate, and of real value.
Later we get angry and demand to exchange all of our Asshole Bucks for USD again.
You then say " Sorry but I spent all of the USD, tell you what, I will give you 1Million Asshole Bucks for $100."
The people are happy because we now have an insane amount of Asshole Bucks for only spending $100.
You get richer.
The legitimacy of crypto is irrelevant.
That’s not what is at question.
The IRS taxes crypto gains.
It’s an asset because people are willing to pay money for it.
FTX was supposed to be a custodian of those assets but didn’t adhere to any reasonable standard.
That is the crux of the situation.
