The founder of the company, Jeremy Tate, said the test is meant to be an alternative to the College Board-administered SAT exam, which he says has become “increasingly ideological” in part because it has “censored the entire Christian-Catholic intellectual tradition” and other “thinkers in the history of Western thought.”.
I'm not sure what your point is.
I have no doubt that it's possible to give a good education in a Christian context.
But I don't think that's what these Florida Republicans are proposing.
And when you see someone pushing one particular while criticizing other ideologies for being "ideological", you know you're dealing with a narrow-minded person.
As Gov.
Ron DeSantis and Florida Republican leaders to the College Board’s AP classes and tests, top state officials have been meeting with the founder of an education testing company supporters say is focused on the “great classical and Christian tradition.”.
As DeSantis’ intensified this week, Tate had several meetings in Tallahassee with Ray Rodrigues, the state university system’s chancellor, and legislators to see if the state can more broadly offer the Classic Learning Test to college-bound Florida high school students.
