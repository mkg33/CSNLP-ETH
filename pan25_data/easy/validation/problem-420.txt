In AR we have a program called work pays.
You can only get on it by recommendation from your case managers for your state benefits.
So for example I was TEA and unemployment in 2017.
Because I followed the requirements and was genuinely looking for a job, they recommended me for work pays.
Work pays gives you money to continue working.
You get bonuses every few months, you get help with transportation costs, they even paid for my car to be fixed when it broke down.
But you have to be working and be recommended so very few people get it, you can't apply for it and very few people know it exists.
I think that's what she means.
This program did help me, I now run a successful company and haven't qualified for state benefits for 2 years.
As far as medicaid, hard to get off of it in this state.
I live in AR and I've been trying to get off Medicaid for the last year and a half.
I got married and no longer qualify based on income, I have health insurance.
I haven't used it in years and I haven't sent them documents in two and I get calls from DHS and I tell them I don't need Medicaid.
And then I get an eligibility letter saying my benefits have been continued.
Lol.
Soo yeah I do think they need to look into it and see after expanding benefits during COVID, who still does qualify.
The work rule was a thing before COVID for those discussing it.
All it means is if you're young and able bodied you have to have some kind of job to qualify for benefits or be actively searching for one... Anyways, I'm not about kicking people off state benefits that need it I think this is a review that is needed in the state.
