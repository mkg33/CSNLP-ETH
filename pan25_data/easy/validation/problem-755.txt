So now I know the answer to the question of what would have happened if the Nazis had succeeded: their ideology would become the ideology of the world, anyone that didn't agree would be put to death, then a few hundred years later they would have written their history to indicate their cause was just, their people heroes, and that their ideology was beautiful and should form the basis for all society.
They'd claim the moral high ground without any hint of irony.
People would proudly proclaim they were Nazis and look with suspicion on anyone who wasn't.
