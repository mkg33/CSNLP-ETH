It’s so ironic them calling Ukrainians Nazis when Zelenskyy is Jewish and they are The ones following the Nazi playbook themselves.
These Russians are evil.
Edit: ðe block was a slip, I was going þrough my notifications getting rid of folks picking fights over my writing style, apologies, to respond to your point ðough, I have yet to encounter a practical gun owner who entertains ðe notion of having to embark against a hostile millitary action, I'd actually be quite surprised if sensible gun owners would consider ðeir personal arms sufficient for such an undertaking.
Most people I've seen who arm ðemselves wið ðe intent of defending against politically motivated attack are þinking less of an actual millitary and more of a millitarized terrorist organisation, and frankly after ðe buffalo shooting I have my doubts about even ðat case since someone actually did try to good guy wið a gun ðe shooter, and failed because he was wearing body armor sufficient to protect against ðe weapon ðe security guard who shot at him had.
Upd: why did you block me, fren, that’s no bueno.
I thought we are having a discussion here.
Anyway.
My point is, it is possible to own a gun and not be an idiot about it.
I understand that this isn’t true for everyone - for those people, indeed, firearm ownership will present more danger.
