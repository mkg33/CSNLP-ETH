No, Israel was invaded in1967 and the aggressor Jordan was pushed back.
Jordan gave up on the West Bank leaving a power vacuum that necessitated the occupation to keep the Palestinian population from continuing the war.
In the Oslo Accords, the Palestinians agreed to terms to seperate the West bank into 3 zones with Zone C being sparcely populated and overseen by Israeli military was intended to be up for negotiations to determine the exact borders.
The Palestinians rejected all peace proposals, did not provide counter-proposals and started the second intifada consisting of suicide bombers and deadly attacks on Israeli civilians.
This forced Israel to build the separation wall which drastically reduced the attacks.
Its now about two decades later and the Palestinians have rejected other peace agreement proposals and are taking the strategy of continuing a decades old war that they lost in 1967 with no end in sight.
Israelis tired of the killings and unwillingness for Palestinians to seek peace have shifted from a moderate government to a more hawkish/right one as a result.
Israel sees no point in waiting for Palestinians to negotiate peace to determine borders from a defensive war they won, so they are expanding their settlements in Area C, the area that they believe is negotiable for them to receive in a peace agreement.
So, I donâ€™t see this as anything close to resembling the Russian invasion of Ukraine since Russia is the aggressor (like Jordan in 1967) and Israel should be allowed to continue participation in the Olympics.
How many are tons?
15%?
5%?
1%?
The whole of 144 million Russia has gathered 200k protesters at the beginning of the war, and protesting in Russia is far less dangerous than let's say Iran.
There are tons of Russians who don't want to die in the war, who don't want prolonged conflict to affect their lives, but would not have minded if Ukraine has simply rolled over at the beginning of the war, because despite living in the 21st century, the 19th century mindset of being superior to those not-really-countries around Russia is well and alive in Russia.
And yes after all the terroristic attacks on Ukrainian power grid, apartment buildings, hospitals, kindergartens, disabled toddlers in their strollers, the title "terrorist state" is well earned.
And yes, the Olympic athletes represent the official Russia with all it's genocidal wars, and not the crowd who is (very very secretly) against the state policies.
