Democrats are gaining with young voters (the future), educated voters (the future) while GOP gains with uneducated, whites who support white supremacy.
Getting younger voters and the increasingly large (38% now) college educated demographic on top of women and minorities gives the Democrats (and science and fact based policies) a better future.
But really?
I think the biggest factor is that college introduces people to other cultures, races, and mindsets.
As Mark Twain said:
Being wealthy is a much more deciding factor of how your life is gonna play out and what policies you're going to tend to support (at least economically, as those are the non-culture war policies that actually matter), because you have a vested interest in keeping taxes low and the market as rigged in the favor of business and land owners as possible.
Not really.
I was speaking in statistics.
Not absolutes.
I can say "a majority of college educated people voted for democrats" and it be a true statement, regardless of individual outliers.
