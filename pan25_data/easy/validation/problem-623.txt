Have we mostly seen improvement?
Sure, but I will repeat myself that that is besides the point.
We have less inequality, not none, and the fact that other societies have more than we do does not excuse us from being criticized for what remains.
You keep saying, "What do you mean, the West isn't better?!"
but that's not what the post you originally replied to or I ever said.
We are simply pointing out that the West started with a level of systemic inequity similar to what we are seeing currently in places like Iran and Afghanistan, and we still need more improvement to be free of it.
Dude.
I'm not starting an argument.
I'm not saying that The West is worse.
Obviously we have the largest and best extension of human rights comparatively.
I'm just acknowledging the fact that having the full extension of human rights is a privileged position to be in, even in the West.
There are still populations of people (in the West) that live without some or all basic rights extended to others.
That is a bottom line fact.
