Before today, the medication was only able to be filled in specific pharmacies.
These pharmacies were not like CVS or whatever- they were alt-pharmacies that had filled out tons of paperwork in order to fill these prescriptions, and they filled all of the United States abortion prescriptions.
Now the FDA has “eased” the regulations so the majority of pharmacies should be able to fill out a bit of paperwork and be able to fill prescriptions for the abortion pills, politics aside.
WRONG!
The pill in question is NOT plan b and does trigger an abortion.
I just just wish they didn’t call it ‘the abortion pill’ bc it’s gonna draw the attention of the anti-choice forced birthers.

Mifepristone IS an abortificant.
It removes the implanted trophoblast that attaches the fetus to the uterus and causes cervical contractions (blocking progesterone which keeps the fetus attached to the uterine wall).
