Trump is an authentic representation of his base, that’s why they love him.
He enjoys fast food, his vocabulary is simple, he has terrible taste in style, he says the things they wish a politician would say.
No one can replicate that because for all of his faults Trump is genuinely Trump.
When he says things he genuinely means it in that moment.
While not actually blue collar, Trump’s whole personality is that of someone who is blue collar “telling it like it is” type of personality.
He has a weird sort of charisma in that way.
It’s partly why the rich reject him, he’s not truly one of them.
That’s also why his base loves him, he’s intended as a big F-You to the rich since the rich do hate him.
The others are too calculated and frankly, too smart to really be embraced by Trump’s base.
Plus DeSantis and Haley have little to no charisma.
Exactly.
She splits the hate he can spew between the two of them so DeSantis comes out not looking as bad to the maga ride-or-die.
She’s such an easy target too.
