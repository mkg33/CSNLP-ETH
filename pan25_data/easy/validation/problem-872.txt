For me the shocker is that even when the head of the SFO very openly admited they have almost no money, there was no outrage and most britons seemed (when I was there, 4 years ago) to think there was no corruption in Britain (oh how easy it is to deceive those who want to be deceived...).
This is how there is oficially no corruption in Britain: the responsability for going after it has been placed in a single entity and then both Tory and Labour politicians cooperated to make it incapable of doing it's work so, lo and behold, there are no corrupt politicians as they're not even investigated much less prosecuted and convicted.
The budget of the Serious Fraud Office - who are tasked with investigating and prosecuting Fraud and Corruption in the UK, has fallen pretty much every single year since Thatcher's time, both under Tory and New Labour governments.
Do you have e a source for this?
The best I can find is list of more recent years on their website and it definitely doesn't just decrease.
In fact, there was a recent heavy bump in budget.
