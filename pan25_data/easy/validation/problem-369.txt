Nah.
Officers were incompentent fucks in positions just because ideological purity and corruption within communist party.
If you were budddy-buddy with correct person you could end with cozy officer life (at least compared to average person) with their own separate city districts, separate shops (thats it, there was shops usually better supplied than "average" but only if you were party member/security apparatus member/ army officer), separate lines for scarce goods such as car ownership while you get free hand at looting state (some high ranking officers de facto used conspricts as free labor if you had party provided summer house quite common were using conspricts for construction jobs or selling fuel and car/truck spare parts to the civillians as side gig, as side note near my town was "secret" sovet army base everyone knew about it because soviet officers from "secret" military base go to local civillians selling fuel).
