it became a real issue; lots of chinese buying houses that are just sitting there empty.
Same goes for condos.
A friend of mine is a realtor and even he stated that things must change because long term itll be catastrophic for some cities.
He actually once sold 12 out of 20 apartments blocks to someone that paid cash (no bank financing).
Those are still empty 2y later.
This means on top of the standard housing issues (albiet our entire country is facing this issue, not just our big cities), our economy is incredibly unproductive because no one invests in the actual economy or productive assets.
Spain already has this.
Part of the issue is that Spain also has other taxes which discourage foreign owners from either spending more time in their Spanish homes, or from renting them out when they're not personally using them.
Part of the problem, which isn't mentioned in the article, is that Spain's wealth tax, which likely applies to many people who own second homes in the Balearics, actually disincentivises the owners making those homes their primary residence, spending most of the year there, reinjecting their earnings in the local economy, and subjecting themselves to Spain's ordinary income taxes.
You get shit for under 600k in Vancouver.
I have friends living there and it was literally impossible to buy a house there.
Both are working with 100k+ salaries.
I was like: "WTF?"
!
It can get worse, nz has mostly tried to stimmy overseas purchases, but we have cultivated a culture of housing being the primary investment vehicle (as it is supremely easy to not pay any capital gains tax, and we donâ€™t have a stamp duty).
