If you're traveling by yourself, for the most part Cruise ships are not meant for you; AFAIK only one cruise line even offers cabins designed for single travelers; most of the other lines will advertise their rates based on a cabin with dual occupancy, and some will charge you more for the same room with one person than you would if you were splitting it with one other person.
