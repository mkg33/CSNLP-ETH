What DeSantis is proposing is literally replacing your local town/county representatives (selectman/commissioners - whatever your state had) with 'his people' who are not elected by local residents for day to day operations.
It's still so weird.
He's still now able to appoint the district board for a private company/district taxpayers?
These special districts exist all over Florida, he isn't appointing boards for all of them.
It's still clearly him singling out Disney to try and get revenge.
Doesn't seem like it should hold up if Disney goes after it.
Their only “policy” is to collectively, unanimously endorse anything one of theirs does and collectively, unanimously condemn anything the opposition does.
Such lockstep pledges (cops have it too with their blue wall of silence) are how minorities are able to consolidate power.
But only evil majorities, because naturally, principled people such as Democrats have nuanced and differing convictions as opposed to choosing from a column, and have the integrity to live by them, and this integrity is the only thing that makes us not Republicans, so if we were to “fight dirty” it would be a far bigger betrayal than not to fight dirty.
Being the good guy is tough.
However, Disney may not chose to challenge DeSantis now (see if he becomes President) since the current press says it has a 2 year implementation plan or maybe the law is worded such that it just acts like any other local gov't - with this 'board' only doing oversight of the comprehensive plan.
Or maybe Disney just waits for it to be law and has someone who lives in the Reedy Creek will sue (not Disney themself) with a really really well paid lawyer .
