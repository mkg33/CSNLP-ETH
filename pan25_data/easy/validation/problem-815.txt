Fundamentalists do, yes.
But the more general American right has slightly vague beliefs about the importance of Israel and simply see the Jewish population as a closer ally and less of a cultural threat than Muslims.
A more simple way of looking at it would be that American conservatives view Israelis as different, but sharing Western values, whereas they view Muslims as both different and rejecting Western values.
Israel is sort of like a psychological/spiritual buffer between the West and the Middle East for a lot of the American right.

Bibi and the Israeli right are much more concerned with Iran and local military threats, and they perceive the American Republican party as hawkish along the same lines, so he will tolerate any antisemitism from the GOP as long as Christian conservatives continue to believe Israel must be protected from Muslims and want to continue pouring in military and economic support.
