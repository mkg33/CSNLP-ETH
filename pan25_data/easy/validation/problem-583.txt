DeSatan graduated from his FL high school in 1997.
There's no way he would've been admitted to Yale before attending law school at Harvard without AP classes and a stellar score on the actual SAT to bolster his application.
But he already got his.
So, why should he care that eliminating AP courses and convincing FL families and students that taking a Christian alternative to the SAT will not adversely impact prospective college students from the state looking to be accepted at competitive top tier universities like Yale and Harvard?
I'm 58.
It's always been like that.
It starts in middle school, where it's cool to be bored but some people never grow out of that mentality.
It's just easier not to care, that and I think fundamentally vast swathes of the population are just selfish really.
They really only care about themselves and their immediate circle.
Bad things happen to other people so why should I care?
(Liberal voters do generally have empathy and want better things for others, but the US is structurally biased against where most liberals end up living, i.e.
urban areas.
