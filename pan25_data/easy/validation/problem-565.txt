Especially when you fail to realise most people that say it are just seeking to be part of the social group rather than trying to pass off some sort of uniquely funny joke.
Itâ€™s an in-joke.
So I go to /r/Ohio, and I see posts from individuals who live within the evacuation zone saying they're back home and nothing's wrong ( although they see lots of authorities testing water in creeks and the like) - but the very next post in the sub is from an absolute nutter talking about how the train crash was caused by Russians attacking starlink and that's why the governor is now pro-Ukraine (and he posts a screenshot from a state resolution a year ago).
The result?
Many of them have still been very openly critical of Russia's failures.
So the carrot didn't really work.
By my definition (as your asking), that's absolutely 'suicide', because it's utterly coercive and threatens consequences to uninvolved family members.
I've found ISW to be decent for a one-stop.
But for some extra detail on specific topics I enjoy Perun (plus, as a follow Aussie, his humor often matches my own).
