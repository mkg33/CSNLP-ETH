Until they have subpar healthcare.
I see it all the time now.
All these boomers had planned to “age at home” and hire nursing agencies rather than go into a nursing home.
Many of these agencies are owned and run by RNs.
All of my clients out in the sticks have 1 agency to pick from if they are lucky and most of the time are understaffed.
Then they get sick from not being taken care of and have no choice but to go into skilled nursing but guess what, they have to move into the city because there are no nurses willing to work/live in their shitty conservative hell scape.
Draining your county of educated resources has its consequences.
I hope so.
But remember, they already made accommodations to Florida by removing some content from the curriculum.
So, the idea that they'll stand up firmly to Florida, while admirable, is not exactly foolproof.
But I hope you're right and my pessimism is misplaced.
Intersectionality?
Wow, that is some big book-learning word.
Which bloated jam sandwich of fascist internet trolls turned that stealthy pip?
