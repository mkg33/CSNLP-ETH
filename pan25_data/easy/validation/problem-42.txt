Given they cannot directly translate money into war material they rely on internal production.
Production can be influenced by converted industry, extra work hours, more efficient methods.
Currently I would imagine there is alot of pressure on people to work those extra hours with out compensation in money.
This will work for a while due to the terror and propaganda control the government has over the population.
Its a open question if this will ever fail though.
Just go look at a Ural vs Brent price differential chart and tell me that oil is fungible in this environment, it's obviously not, years and year of near parity and instantly it drops to -$35, stabilizing at around -$23 - this is because demand for Ural crude within the global oil market has dropped, it will start coming back as new supply chains open up new markets for the Russians.
40% discount???!
are you trying to tell me that Putin is only going to make 1.2 billion this year instead of 2 billion?
How is he going to even buy a loaf of bread on that...Billionaires shouldn't exist.
Billionaire rulers of countries absolutely shouldn't exist.
This is not the case.
The price of Urals crude drops, due to lack of demand and the price of all other sources increases from increased demand.
The price differential will slowly close as global supply chains are reworked.
The idea that the price of Russian oil is dragging down the price of oil in general is false, it's just inefficient supply chains resulting in a price differential - there's a bigger market for non-Russian oil and Russia has troubles reaching friendly markets due to infrastructure issues.
The price differential will slowly close as the world develops new supply chains to more efficiently move O&G between new trading partners.
