I'm glad you got to share your feelings on the topic, but I was obviously making a joke!
Good luck in your struggle.
This is supposed to be an article on the dire economic situation there, not on the apparent debate of whether Iranians are or can be “civilized” or how hot the women are (which is especially gross/trivializing when people, especially women, are being murdered by that government in standing up for their human rights and dignity).
This is hardly a "white guy" only thing lol.
Many POC men fetishize the shit out of white women, and I've seen plenty of black guys on twitter/tumblr fetishizing the crap out of Asian women.
And to be honest, it's not quite only men (though men are the worst with it), I've seen plenty of women fetishizing other skin tones, hair colors and even accents.
So I'm not sure why you're so hung on up on it being a white man issue.
In fact the worst cases I've seen have all been in Asia, where white women have been surrounded at beaches and stared at, it's freaky and you won't see that in Western nations.
