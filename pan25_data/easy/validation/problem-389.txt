Again, what we are talking about is extremely rare anyway.
Id be surprised if there was 1 case on the books in Utah.
when I've worked with adolescents who are feeling they might be transgendered the gradieny process along with many assessment instruments for this sort of thing.
I followed was: psychoeducation on gender>imagining yourself as your internal gender (and exploring related jdeation)>using congruent pronouns>using a gendered name> (if they aren't already) aesthetic transitioning like make-up, gendered clothes, hair cut etc.> maybe (safe) chest binding/tucking > Then finally, we may start psychoeducation and recommend to the family discussions with a multi-disciplinary team trained in transgender health care about further options that involve a bigger team like vocal training, hormone therapy, sexual reassignment surgery, etc.
Still does not answer my question.
I am not asking about over the counter.
And I do t know if you know or not but doctor patient information is private between a doctor and a patient.
The state before could not violate this without a court order.
