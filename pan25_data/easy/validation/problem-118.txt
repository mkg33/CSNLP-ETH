That would be, I feel, a better strategy if they weren't currently engaged in a war that has so far cost them 50-80% of their entire military's functional, tank, apc, ifv, attack helicopter, artillery round, strike fighter plane, transport vehicle, and cruise missile supplies... on top of 60-85k dead (at 400-900/day) 2-3x wounded soldiers, majority of which were their trained troops, and now are trending down in training level, whilst Ukraine continues to grow in strenh and training level...
Correct.
The question is whether the oligarchs will be in a position to cough up that money, as a lot of their wealth was either abroad or in Russian stocks that are nearly worthless.
What they have left, they're probably being very careful with.
The average citizen doesn't have a pot to piss in, I doubt they'll soak up that debt.
It'll be interesting if we ever hear the details.
Integration between western multinational corporations with communist cabals created the oligarchy that Putin wields today.
No.
Russia defaulted.
People don't seem to understand what that means.
That mean much of the western financial companies cannot buy bonds at all based on the ramifications of that.
Add sanctions on that along with illiquid market.
Now other countries like China and India may not have issues with a country in default I don't know.
But 11 months ago Russia was not in default if I recall, now it is and that changes everything vis a vis the western financial markets.
This is the thing that is going to damage ruin their economy for a long time to come is that default.
There is no just "fixing" it and things are back to normal, not how it works.
