They have to change their own government, we can't do it for them, it wouldn't be seen as legit around the world.
Things just have to get bad enough where they rise up and overthrow the government.
It's happened in the past all over the world.
If you might die anyway at their hands, they should all just overrun the government buildings and bases.
Some will die, but what's the alternative?
Dying as a tortured martyr of the state, or as a hero liberating your country from tyrants?
If I were Iranian, I'd want to take my chances on becoming a hero and maybe go out that way rather than cowering in a back room somewhere.
Auxiliary forces=foriegn intervention.
A prince seizing control of a territory is not identical with a revolution, but is absolutely analogical.
Both concern the establishment of a new political order.
And Machiavelli's real point is that without cultivating internal support, i.e.
among the people to be ruled, a political order cannot be independently stable.
That is as much the case with a revolution as a despotical seizure of power.
