I’m not saying I’m right and I do understand that at best it’s a “good on paper but…” situation but I guess what I’m saying is that more and more often lately the right looks like a drunk guy with a machete and the left looks like Little Finger from GoT - in the near term I’d much prefer the one that likely won’t gore me but my gut tells me that I’m playing into somebody else’s game (though I suppose that’s politics in a nutshell).
I want Jeffries.
He can give the GOP all the commitee shit their sad decaying hearts desire, but not ethics, intelligence, or rules.
They can have the rest and write as much batshit crazy stuff they want, we just wont vote unless its made less crazy.
Those three are the ones that keep us from dealing with bullshit hunter biden probes, a government shut down, and from being in actual mortal danger from foreign threats or domestic terrorists.
Just win over 6 GOP weirdos who want specific things for their swing districts.
Agree not to bring up some issue they're hung up on.
Make the deal.
