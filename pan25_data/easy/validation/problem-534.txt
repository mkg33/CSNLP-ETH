However, there are other goals for the justice system.
Ultimately, society's best interest is to keep the criminal from repeating their crimes in the future.
Hopefully, they can return to society and even contribute in new and positive ways.
Most people nod when you say this in person.
But in my experience, the average person simply wants criminals punished, to feel bad about what they did, to regret and maybe even suffer.
Exactly.
Disenfranchising prisoners incentivizes those in power to find reasons to jail their political enemies.
The right wingâ€™s political enemies are people of color.
The result is predictable.
Now, rehabilitating criminals is controversial.
Paying for therapy and classes for them costs money.
This method IS NOT SATISFYING.
Someone breaks the law and they're "rewarded" with continuing education, therapy, nice accommodations....things you and I have to PAY FOR?
Where's the justice?
Or at least, what many believe to be "justice."
Someone breaks the law and should be punished for it.
Right?
