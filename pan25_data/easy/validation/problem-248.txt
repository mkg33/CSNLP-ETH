Greenland was warmer when he settled there.
The Vikings were able to farm crops that simply cannot be grown there anymore like wheat.
Completely agree.
I'm not even 30 so can't compare that timeline, but when I was a kid January was cold.
I exclusively remember the rarity of my parents laying out in the yard sun tanning one January and it made the news of how rare it was to have 75Â°.
It lasted a day or two.
That's partially disproved by modern archaeology.
The vikings hunted and ate seal from the get-go.
Livestock was certainly a priority, but was a matter of food security and prestige.
Bone analysis now show that the vikings started out with some marine diet and increased it further as time went along - from 30-40% to 80%.
The archaeological evidence shows how they organized hunts of harp seal by boat and then sold/distributed the meat to all settlements, including those inland.
They also hunted walrus.
It's not believed that walrus ivory could be what drove people to settle on Greenland.
Walrus had previously been hunted to extinction on Iceland.
Walrus ivory can be found in almost every viking settlement in Greenland.
