Thx for the history lesson 👍 i didn't know Morocco was an early ally of ours.
I don't think I remember anything about Morocco aside from its location lol.
History was the only subject I was never very good at in school.
Couldn't seem to keep the places, names and dates all organized in my head, especially when it came time for a test, even though I usually found the subject matter fascinating.
Geography, fine Math, science, music and spelling/grammar came easily too 🤷‍♀️ (Oddly enough I just realized I have the same issue with movies and actors.
I might enjoy a movie while I'm watching it, but dont ask me later on what the name was or who was in it!)
🤔🙃.
America’s first diplomatic post overseas was in Tangier.
Today the former embassy is a museum in the old medina of the city.
It’s the only place on the US National Register of Historic Places overseas.
I’ve been to it and it was super neat.
Definitely gave me a deeper appreciation of Morocco and I’m rooting for them in the World Cup.
Nooooot technically.
LOL just to nitpick but you could consider the Dutch to be americas oldest ally as they supported us independence before the French.
