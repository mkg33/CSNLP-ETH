Yes.
But let’s get credit to a president who respects and empowers women by example - we can see how he treats his own wife.
Biden is an ally and deserves some praise as he hardly gets any.

No lower Medicare eligibility age.
No public option.
Nothing.
But Medicare did get more profitable for "direct contractors" to administer.
So actually more incentive to weaken the little public insurance we still have left.
And Afghanistan withdrawal….
You know, the massive problem created by Republicans publicly surrendering to the Taliban.
Thank you for this.
We are also talking about a man that has never tried to take center stage of anything.
He has been criticized by both sides.
He deserves this call out and it’s pretty clear neither Biden nor his supports are anything like Trump.
The men is an empath and deserves some credit occasionally.
And he hasn't campaigned seriously for lowering Medicare eligibility age either.
So no increase in public insurance under Biden and now a Republican house for likely a generation.
It's a real "victory".
At least to for-profit insurance companies.
That's not public insurance.
That's subsidies to for-profit insurance companies right?
Plans that often have unaffordable deductibles.
Who is actually getting public insurance who wouldn't have under Biden?
We know millions are losing their public insurance for "direct contractors" through Medicare under Biden though.
