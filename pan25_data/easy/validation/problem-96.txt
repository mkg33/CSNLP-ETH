bullshit.
Texas, Ohio, Florida, Tennessee, and Wisconsin are absurdly gerrymandered in favor of Republicans adding 10 to 15 seats.
Dems gerrymandered Illinois, Nevada, and New Mexico.
Dems left New York and California as fair maps because the courts and/or state constitution stopped them from gerrymandering.
Republicans left North Carolina as a fair map due to a Dem Supreme Court (which just got flipped to R).
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.
If you want to help make this community a better place, consider !
Political pundits, and newspaper analysts are all absolutely fucking clueless.
None of them know anything more than we do.
The only difference is they get paid to be stupid.
People voted against the republican party because of their fascist policies.
The predicted red wave never materialized.
It is normal for Congress to flip to the party opposite that of the president during the midterms, but the Republicans did worse this time than any election in multiple decades.
Ignore these morons in the media.
