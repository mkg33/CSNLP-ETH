The "dilemma" he's referring to is the notion that Democrats might be better off not running a candidate and supporting "Independent" Sinema as the best chance of holding onto the seat.
My point/belief is that Sinema cannot win reelection whether she runs as a Democrat, Independent or second-coming of Jesus...
So, the Democrats should make their decisions from that mindset, rather than one in which Sinema is very popular and Dems would be better off not running a candidate and having her return as an independent.
The only real question is whether Sinema will run as an independent and spoil the election for the Dems.
I may be wrong, but I'm staking my political fortune on the reality that Sinema cannot win any version of this election.
People who believe she has a chance to win and the Democrats have a dilemma here are delusional... Or Republicans rooting for drama.
