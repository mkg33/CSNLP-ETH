And Labour under Starmer has taken up (in effect) a pro-Brexit position- along with such a lukewarm lack of opposition to the Johnson/post-Johnson Tories' English nationalism that they're all but going along with it.
And the fact that Starmer's Tory-Lite, Brexiteer-pandering watered-down "Labour" is the "good" outcome- or rather the best we can expect- is the most damning thing of all about UK politics.
Regardless of how one juggles the statistics, the fact remains that Starmer's "Make Brexit Work" et al is blatantly pandering to Leave voters and English nationalists.
Labour lost enough of their (already-on-life-support) voter base to the pro-Brexit Tories that they clearly decided this was the strategy they should follow.
In Scotland, where we voted Remain by a large margin, Labour is now being dismissed by many as a pro-Brexit party- because they are, regardless of whether they're simply doing it to win votes.
(Even the pro-unionist writer of acknowledges that Starmer has alienated many potential voters here with his Tory-esque rhetoric.
).
Despite their attempts to re-write history a bit, Scotland's support for remaining was 62% which is actually lower than the Labour party's support for remaining, though functionally you'd say that support for remain is similar on all three crosstabs given that the partisan support has to be the subject of polling rather than a result, and therefore subject to a margin of error.
62% Scotland, 63% Labour, 64% SNP.
Similarly, we also voted against another contributory factor- i.e.
Brexit- by a 24% margin, but were dragged out of the EU regardless due to the vote elsewhere.
