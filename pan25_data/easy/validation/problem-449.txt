"This was presumably done by the use of false pretences or concealment of the truth, thus inducing the other committee members to act in a manner that caused DFB a financial loss.
".
This is such a patently absurd argument to justify the fact that one of the most corrupt organizations in the world, FIFA, awarded the World Cup to Qatar back in 2010 because the vote was completely rigged as a result of bribery.
That's pretty obvious at this point.
Now other World Cup votes have probably had some measure of shenanigans as well.
But what made that vote particularly egregious was the whole weather situation when the World Cup is traditionally held.
And then the organizing committee tried to convince us all the stadiums would have this space-age air conditioning technology.
How did that promise work out?
In the end, you can't hide behind so-and-so country's history to give Qatar a pass over the fact that thousands of workers died constructing these stadiums.
Anybody with half a brain and a full conscience can see right through you.
And it's actually kind of funny that a country swimming in Monopoly money via the oil and gas industry is trying to play the colonialism victim card to deflect criticism of the atrocities that took place on their watch.
Gimme a break, man.
