In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

It is absolutely unacceptable to be acting like Biden's attorneys finding about ten classified documents and immediately notifying the archives is comparable to Trump taking over one hundred classified documents and lying about it to the archives.

I had a similar comment about CNNs article.
It’s a nonstory in any other universe.
CNN wants engagement and they don’t care if it’s in support of fascists defending their leader.
Despicable.
It’s not a comparable situation.
