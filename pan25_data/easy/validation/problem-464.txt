It absolutely would.
There's a lot of misinformation out there about title 42.
It only applies to illegal border crossers that can be returned to Mexico.
The vast majority of asylum seekers cannot be returned to Mexico, thus title 42 does not apply to them.
Being able to return many to Mexico without paperwork, it doesn't count as a deportation, is really saving the asylum seekers.
Imagine a border patrol station apprehends 150 border crossers a day, and 100 of those can be returned to Mexico immediately, that leaves only those other 50 that needs paperwork.
Even at that ratio, border patrol is overwhelmed that those 50 might be at the border patrol station for a week before the backlog catches up to them.
Now imagine title 42 goes away, imagine what the backlog looks like with those extra 100 cases of paperwork per day.
Militarism, or glorifying military service and integrating military values into society as a method of normalizing a robust, persistent military presence, is a core component of fascism.
