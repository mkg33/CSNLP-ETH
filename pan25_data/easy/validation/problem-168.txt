It's just orbital mechanics, with a little bit of extra stuff going on in the case of approaching the event horizon of a blakc hole.
An object falling into a gravity well will most likely get thrown out, collision is unlikely without additional forces acting on it because the speed and vector required for that to happen is a narrow band.
You know what I love?
Seeing an article headline inferring an image of a star being eaten by a black hole, but instead getting images of movie black holes.
I didn't come to read!
Interestingly it's also insanely difficult for things to actually cross the event horizon.
As an object gets closer to the black hole it's angular momentum causes it to speed up until eventually it gets close to the speed of light and is usually converted into x-rays or gamma rays and gets spewed out by the by the black holes magnetic field, turning into a jet of material at the poles.
Actively feeding black holes only consume a very small amount of the material falling into them as a result.
