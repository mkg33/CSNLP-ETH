Sanchez revealed that the arrival of Leopard tanks in Ukraine would correspond with the return of trained soldiers.
"We are aiming to synchronize the delivery of the Leopards with the finalization of the training of Ukrainian soldiers," Sanchez said, adding that Spain could send more Leopard tanks later if needed.
According to Ukrinform, Spain is training troops to use Leopard 2 A4 tanks while it readies six tanks to Ukraine by late March or early April, according to Defense Minister Margarita Robles, as reported by Reuters.
"As Ukraine's forces prepare for major deliveries of armored combat vehicles, troops are training on Leopard tanks in Spain.
Ukraine has long sought Leopard tanks, among other powerful Western made assets.
As Insider previously reported, the Leopard 2 is a fast German-made battle tank originally designed in the 1970s that is has been upgraded over the years and can be found in the arsenals of nearly 20 different countries.
