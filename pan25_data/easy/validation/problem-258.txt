In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Exactly.
The law should be objective, not subjective.
It should be applied strictly, not liberally.
You can't have everyone viewed equally under the law when the law is flexible.
Yes, the law is inflexible.
That's the idea.
It's objective.
An action has to fit the crime.
The crime doesn't get molded to fit an action.
That is how we ensure everyone is equal under the law.
If you can't prove that an action fits the law without making the law "flexible", then you specifically make that action illegal too.
