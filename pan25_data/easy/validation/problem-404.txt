It's nice to see what pollsters are saying and what their data gathering and aggregation analysis is suggesting, but fundamentally for voters (as individuals), disregard all of that, do one's due diligence in reading up on what's on the ballot, and then making an informed decision, and then making their vote.
Idk something is emerging here.
This mid term saw the second highest youth vote in mid term history.
The first?
2018.
Regardless of if those polls made any difference in turnout, they left the impression that Republicans were going to make major gains, retaking both chambers of Congress, humiliating Biden and the Democrats, and putting them on a better strategic track for the 2024 Presidential election.
One thought I keep coming back to is how, in the weeks leading up to Election Day we were seeing so many polls favoring the Republicans winning, which was clearly part of their strategy.
I wonder if that perhaps ended up backfiring on them.
