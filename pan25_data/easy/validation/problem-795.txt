Once again reinforcing the fact that religious fundamentalists are inherently authoritarian.
It's why every theocracy is a terrible oppressive dictatorship.
I guess my aunt is an Orthodox Jew.
But she does have shabbat dinner (cause she took me once with Hassidic ones in PA).
She fucking loves Trump.
But it ain't cause she's Jewish.
Correlational and standard regression analysis confirmed that for this sample scores on authoritarianism and religious fundamentalism were positively correlated, with scores on authoritarianism significantly related to those on ethnic and racial prejudice, and punitiveness.
Thanks for the reply.
I'm not really familiar with the various sects of Judaism and which ones are more or less conservative.
I only know that there are progressive secular Jews, many of whom I consider cultural and political heroes, and religious Jews, which I assume to be right wing, mostly due to the highly successful propaganda efforts of groups like AIPAC and the hasbara that jumps into any online discussion of Israel/Palestine/Zionism.
Even J-Street, who seem to be basically pretty decent folks, call themselves "pro Israel" and call for a "de-militarized state of Palestine", which seems kind of patronizing towards the Palestinians.
A true, independent state must be able to 100% fully exist just like any other state, with, among other things, a navy, airforce and army, and the legal right to defend themselves from Israeli agression.
