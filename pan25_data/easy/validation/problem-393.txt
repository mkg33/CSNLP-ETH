Warheads dropped on Japan were pathetic compared to the ones developed later.
But "Russia prepares low to average destructiveness Nuclear Warheads" doesn't work as clickbait.
Arguable.
But I think China actually is.
They're more insidious and infiltrate economies at all levels.
Party members infiltrate governments, educational institutions and corporations at all levels.
Not.... really.
While they did construct the Tsar Bomba etc for their actual Russian warheads they have traditionally lagged considerably behind the US in terms of individual warhead yield/weight and in total payload capacity.
âˆ† that one.
It's said that it could have been even more explosive but the military had to dail it back because the bomber that dropped it would have been engulfed in the blast and would have killed the pilots deploying the nuke.
Incorrect.
The size of our warheads has shrunk because we adapted a different strategy for use.
Namely MIRVs and calculated overlap to enhance certain effects involving overpressure.
