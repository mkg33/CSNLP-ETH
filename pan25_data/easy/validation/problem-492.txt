I always agreed with this.. legitimize the current drug dealers but I’m not so sure anymore.
If weed is any indication of how “legalization” would work it may help a little but the government will overtax it, keeping the demand for black market around and still larger than the legit markets.
Legal manufacturing and sales will have to compete with cartels paying no fiscal tax, offering a cheaper price.
The government would have to lay low for a decade or so on taxation and charging millions to get a license.
big pharma is already selling several meth equivalents like Adderall(amphetamine sulfate), and Vyvanse(lisdexamfetamine), also heroin equivalents, opiates like hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, fentanyl patches, etc.
But how do you decide who receives it?
Do you charge them?
How much does each user get?
(Giving them less than they want will just have them buying more on the street.
).
They could just fund it entirely, like they do social programs, meanwhile attempt to get people independent from the drugs, destroy demand eventually if possible.
There is a way to do this, I don't think it's wanted though.
I believe the system is just how they like it.
