Equally, platform users who curate that content (such as users who upvote or downvote posts, or moderators who remove spam) are also shielded from the liability that falls upon editors at publishing houses.
In effect, he might say that "biased moderation" creates a new context for posted content, one which distorts the public understanding or meaning of that content to a sufficient extent, that it ceases to be third-party content, with the platform becoming a kind of co-author-by-context.
Justice Clarence Thomas, in particular, has made public statements that have caused many people (myself included) to become apprehensive that he may take the position that if social media platforms moderate content in ways that he would describe as "biased", then they are operating beyond the bounds of Section 230, and should therefore lose its protections.
A very big question.
However since the Supreme Court has lost legitimacy in the eyes of most people, it will come down to what the right wing donors want.
