Regarding your second point, that statement has little evidence to back it.
The EU supports projects all over Europe, including infrastructure, science and so on.
Those "shady" bureaucrats you were criticizing in your first paragraph work hard to allocate funds efficiently.

Now, it can be a valid point that a government too detached from local issues may be unable to identify them correctly, but thatÂ´s why it coexists with local governments.
More importantly, the point can be made that an excess of local power fosters corruption, since those local politicians are much more susceptible to bribing and threats by local elites.

Exactly.
Because Germany is a federal republic it is able to have some sovereignty.
The same applied to the EU, would it ever opt for more federalization.
