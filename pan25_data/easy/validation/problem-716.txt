Well it's blatantly insulting to everyone's intelligence.
I think most Republican leadership like McConnell and them knew this very well.
He warned the party about it and showed his concerns while Rick Scott who is head of the Republicans campaigning was cocky and thought he knew better.
Even if it were secretly true there was no discernable proof and even Republicans know that Trump was acting like a child not because he was wronged but because he didn't get his way.
It was pretty obvious that most of the election deniers were absolutely radical and spineless nut jobs who wanted to get support from the now not so popular ex President.
I think we all on some level understood that Trump was a rich kid who has spent his whole life "winning" and had never been told "no" by anyone let alone most of the country.
Mike Pence knew this all too.
We gave Pence a lot of crap as VP but he was absolutely a great VP when it counted and that was on Jan 6 of 2021.
