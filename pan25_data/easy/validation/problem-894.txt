While we had a con artist of president denying Ukraine military aid as well as blackmailing, impeached twice, caught multiple times lying and saying batshit crazy nonsense, talking to putin on a special cellphone no one else had access to, mishandled the covid crisis and then shat on Dr. Fauci, deriving billions of PPE loans to his family business and friends businesses, stealimg goverment documents, lying about having government documents, Incites a insurrection an has his rally break into congress to shit all over the place cause he didn't want to give up seat to Joe biden....
Clearly a gamer.
