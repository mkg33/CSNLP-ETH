Iran has had the capability to build a bomb for at least 20 years.
If they were trying to build one, they'd already have an arsenal full of them.
Is that how international law, international relations, or how a civilized society handles anything?
No.
Are women in the US being killed for not covering their heads?
No, you have pride parades, gay nightclubs, largely uncensored internet porn available for free and practically everywhere, ability to burn bibles and insult religious figures and no one cares (unless it's muhammed).
These are just examples, if I'd make an exhaustive list I'd be here all night.
Hahahha.
Iran wouldnâ€™t be the first religious state, the first terrorist state, or the first religious-terrorist state, to develop and maintain nuclear weapons.
So now Iran has 2 options: acquire nuclear weapons to deter foreign invasion & war, or attempt to acquire nuclear weapons for that act to cause a foreign invasion.
Iran is sure to be invaded by a foreign state should they not acquire nuclear weapons.
North Korea and Ukraine are the best precedents.
