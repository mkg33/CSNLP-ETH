It is indeed grotesque and depressing to see rural (& senior) Americans being fed a steady diet of lies & misrepresentation.
They are suppressed and they don’t even know it.
A result of the GOP and its partnership with Foxnews, evangelism & NRA, keeping a strangle hold & control over the microscopic lives of rural Americans.
Red state governors are a disgrace to American advancement.
They deny their folks access to critical scientific education to keep ‘em under dark, preventing their advancement, stunting growth in their intellect and outlook.
They are not about building a well informed critical thinking populace for advancement of America, but about breeding “yes” people or a legion of minions to command them to their points of views.
It’s hard to fathom how does one even fight this deep rooted blight and bring light to these people.
Only some kind of a (quiet) revolution to their awareness & perception can bring about a change for the better.
Difference in population density?
The Constitution is about people?
Your woke liberal college education won't work here!
