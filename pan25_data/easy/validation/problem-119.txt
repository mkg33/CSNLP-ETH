Not just screwing people for tickets, live nation also owns a large percentage of venues too, so musicians are essentially shut out of the whole live music industry if they don’t want to do business with live nation.
I’ve read about bands trying to book shows at venues and then live nation basically buys the venue out from under them.
Horrible.
A total monopoly.
I had the pleasure of taking my little sister to see her.
I wish she preform more songs from her early albums but she’s fun to see live even if you don’t know her music all to well.
