Let's play the pretend game, because this does not have a chance in hell of happening, but let's pretend...
If Russia allocates 5 million men for Ukraine, NATO will just put bigger and more lethal weaponry to help Ukraine deal with those maggots more effectively in larger amounts.
That's all.
If Russia thinks they can fight with both of their arms now, NATO will most assuredly match their resolve.
It's not going to be smooth sailing for either side, but Russia won't be any closer to achieving their objectives than they are today.
Their leadership is insane, but then again if it was sane they wouldn't have invaded Ukraine or _at least_ would try to pull out as soon as it was clear they're about to witness a giant clusterfuck of an operation.
A bunch of backwards thinking clowns completely cut off from reality.
Figures though, since none of them speak any English to read a Western newspaper with, and have been cooking in their own sweet and sour sauce at home, for decades.
There's old man club and there's _Russian_ old men club, and that's what you get when the old men club basically has entire nation for vassals but its brain is rotten from doing absolutely nothing useful for far too long.
Definitely.
If Ukraine was left to fend for themselves like Crimea, things would have likely wrapped up in a month.
But too many people had/have invested interest in Ukraine to just let it go.
