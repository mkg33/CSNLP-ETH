Don't get me wrong, I don't want to let Trump off the hook, but it's absolutely a bigger problem.
I recall all the way back when Bill Clinton was President and I was first becoming aware of politics, he got hammered for "waffling," which was to say, speaking conditionally.
The thing is while he absolutely could be a slippery shyster when he wanted to be, the fact remained that nuance is important.
The world isn't black and white, issues are complex, and effectively addressing these things means that your policy has a lot of "ifs" and "buts."
But some people can't handle that.
They mistake nuance and precision for being "wishy-washy.
".
It still amazes me that after a doctor gave him a dementia test while he was president, in which he had to identify that a drawing of an animal with a hump was a camel and that a drawing of an animal with a long neck was a giraffe, trump subsequently went on TV to brag about how he had been able to correctly name the animals.
Cut through the noise.
Trumpism is too encompassing a word.
Ask your family this weekend if they really think homophobia is the next winning strategy.
Push back.
