Suppose the mortality rate of COVID-19 is 1%.
In other words, 1 out of every 100 people who catch COVID-19 dies.
This seems like pretty decent odds.
But China has 1.4 billion people.
If everybody catches the disease, 1.4 billion divided by 100 is 14 million people dead from COVID.
This would be a catastrophic death toll, about the lower end of estimates of how many people died in WW1 (16 million to 40 million).
If I was running a country, I would want to find a way to protect my population from COVID that doesn't result in millions of people dying.
By the way, COVID appears to have a mortality rate of 3-4%.
China isn't unvaccinated.
China has a serious problem with the elderly population being under-vaccinated which is the most at-risk group, and their vaccines are less effective, but the vast majority of the entire population will have a vaccine and two boosters minimum.
This is just smart.
They infected the world once, and it ruined hundreds of thousands of lives.
Now theyâ€™re trying to do it again, even worse.
