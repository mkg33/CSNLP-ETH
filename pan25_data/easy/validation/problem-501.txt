Similar situation here in Canada re: zero incentives.
All compounded by a very large country, most of it in subzero temperatures for months at a time.
Not exactly ideal driving conditions for an EV.
And yet despite all that, our government has set unworkable timelines for banning ICE cars, has no plans for EV infrastructure / grid / charging networks, and “incentives” that are laughable.
All while slapping carbon taxes on gasoline like kids playing Uno.
I’m all for EV adoption but this is NOT the way to go about it.
Petrol stations are, understandably, everywhere.
You're rarely stuck for finding somewhere to refill the car.
Absolutely.
And we’re moving there.
But it’s not quick and each country has different challenges.
In all of my comments, I’ve only brought that point up.
Also the battery issue (which is important), but simply saying this, people have assumed I’m against the change.
So much for discussion.
Fossile fuel car requires specially designated and constructed depots for refueling.
I believe that says quite a lot about how much worse fossile fuel is compared to rechargable batteries.
