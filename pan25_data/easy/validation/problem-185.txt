Interesting, there is a movement in Iran to accept responsibility and change their course.
The Imans have begun calling for the government to review the laws people are protesting.
They realize the same emotions that brought them into power can leave them in the dust of history if they don't change.
Whether or not they succeed is for the Iranian people to decide, but they understand they are responsible for their past.
As they should.
You are correct that intellectually inadequate people that can‚Äôt create authoritative arguments lean on others, but everyone (except extreme egotistical people) does.
Also, leaning on authority isn‚Äôt unique to religion: ‚Äúother‚Äù can be religion, a political leader, a parent, a book, a historical figure.
Thank you for that.
Apologies for the generalizations.
These were little pieces of what I have learnt about the area.
I didn't know that about Iraq, I'll have to have a read about it.
Enjoy your weekend üëç.
It‚Äôs astonishing how oppressive regimes can justify increasingly inhumane treatment of people.
Humans apparently have no inherent switch telling us when our behavior has crossed into complete immorality.
