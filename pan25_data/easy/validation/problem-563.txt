That is not the tone of the show at all; the police are depicted as likeable and decent but he's the uber genius one-upping them all.
Protags often rely on the cops including the cop-father who trained our 'psychic' detective.
The show isn't setting out to suggest that psychics are better than cops, but that's the setup of the joke.
Which is now deader than a spellingg bee spellmaster.
Seriously.
There's no proper way to call 911, especially if reporting on a traumatic scene.
Some people might be borderline hysterical and unable to put together coherent sentences, never mind accurately describe the scene in front of them.
Some people might go into shock and sound abnormally calm or detached.
You would also need to know an individuals regular speech patterns, education, cultural background, and tons of other information if you were to even begin to judge whether or not they sound "normal" on a 911 call.
But this guy literally claims that anyone who says "please," "hi," or "huh?"
at any time is showing indicators of guilt.
