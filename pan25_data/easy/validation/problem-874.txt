Not really anymore.
He knows people in west see through his bs, they’ve accepted the fact that it’s time for him to go, even Germany, which he always considered to have a potential of being russias main ally in Europe, and splitting the spheres of influence with them when US is “gone”, is one step away from kicking his laying body.
He only needs to keep his image going amongst the domestic audience, and the domestic audience won’t get news of Zelensky calling putin out.
Putin wants the narrative of UA being “sub-humans” and “not real country” going, and their opinions or wishes are not worthy of reactions.
He’s like a con artist, but on a bigger scale - involving war and hundreds of thousands people dying.
Average.
And i thought this is even lower.
Still, it includes all the alcoholics and other victims of Russian society.
That average tells us something about the general population, but nothing about individuals, particularly individuals of the so called "elite".
It's a catch-22 though.
If Putin does nothing he looks weak by not retaliating.
If he does respond he looks weak because it looks like Zelenskyy got under his skin.
Interesting...
I wonder if he was subject to a directed radioactivity attack, as the Russians have been notorious for using as an assassination tool before?
