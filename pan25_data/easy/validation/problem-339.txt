We were still printing money.
The one that always sticks out with me was when I was in a meeting with our lead procurement guy.
He was able to get containers(shipping) of medically “certified” USB cables.
They cost us $0.50 and billed $30.
The gouging is where the contractors/vendors/consultants/agencies/lawyers/compliance all make their money.
That 'slack' is where the system is gettin' their beak wet.
In America, all those companies who are taking their slice in those moments of bureaucractic bullshit is the cost we pay because we have a culture which has foolishly affixed it's unending avarice to a economic system which demands we liquidate all to satisfy it.
So in pursuit of it, we have this - all these fuckin' hands, 'gouging' as you wrote, to get paid because where else are they going to capture margins?
They can't out right steal it because that's just piracy and theft, but fuck they get as close as possible as you have witnessed in your work.
