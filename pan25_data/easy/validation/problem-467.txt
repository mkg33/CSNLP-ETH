No idea why you come off so aggressively when I think we could agree on many things.
But you do understand that "stocks" and "assets which can be sold" only have value if someone is willing to buy them.
When you say "take the wealth from the rich" there's a huge spectrum there between full nationalisation and various inventive tax brackets that can be implemented.
I don't know on which part of the spectrum you are because you didn't elaborate.
I was just pointing out that measures that wipe out the "rich" as an economically caste, means you also wipe out the value of stocks and assets because there's nobody to buy them.
The things don't have much intrinsic value, just what "investors" are willing to pay for them.
Depending on the economic system you advocate for wiping out the hyper rich and the stock market and banking system might be a good thing.
Again, you didn't elaborate.
Absolutely.
The trouble is, most people in richer countries know they'll be gone before the shit truly hits the fan, so their attention is easily diverted against poor immigrants--that is, poor immigrants from countries falling apart due to global heating.
It's perverse.
