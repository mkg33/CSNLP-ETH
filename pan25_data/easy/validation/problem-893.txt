Yeah and at the same point Covid is never going away.
You want permanent Corona restrictions?
Move the China.
Otherwise feel free to get vaccinated, wear a mask for the rest of your life and leave society alone so we can move on from the pandemic.
Medicine and science can still continue to develop better vaccines, drugs or treatments, even when the rest of humanity lives their lives.
The middle ground is vaccines, wearing a mask if you want to and have science continue to improve vaccines and medicine against Covid.
What else is there to discuss?
Note that they deliberately exclude online businesses like amazon, but allow local bookstores (There are legal requirements that all bookstores online or brick and mortar have to sell books at the same price, so amazon isn't really cheaper than any local bookstore anyway.
).
Or the increasing amounts of social distances between the classes, shitty overpriced public transport, political parties like CDU stopping progress, refusual of the employers to increase salaries, two class health system, overpriced rents and a couple of other things.
Eh.
The bureaucracy is tiresome and the country is very anti digitalization.
Thank God for covid, it pushed businesses to accept card payments.
