Cap THC to 30% flower, 60% concentrates (anecdotally I've never purchased a concentrate that had a label lower than this and I treat a lifelong seizure disorder under the medical program - most are at least 68%-80% and cancer patients buying RSO have higher concentrations).

Can you simply imagine what happens to the five state area if rec becomes legal, with the collaboration of Oklahoma weed oasis.
MY GAWD.

the Devil's Lettuce and before ya know it you'll be having a 'Netflix and...' night with him!
It's a downward spiral I tell you...
TLDR -- the question just opens up the program to adults over 21 and set up for shops to sell to any adults over 21 (even the expungement process = still have to go before OK's Pardon and Parole Board), the OK Legislature is looking to do a LOT should that happen though, and even if the question doesn't pass, these bills are still filed, they could still restrict the medical program further due to who and how these have been lobbied (without going into who and how that's happening) :/.
Hmmm.
Oppose upcoming vote or oppose passage of the upcoming State Question?
Usually the latter.
The former would imply that even voting on it is a bad thing.
