Because McCarthy had 2 entire months to count votes, compromise his power to ensure the Speakership, and to know the results of the vote before even going in and he probably hasn't done shit.
This reminds me of the 10+ years that Republicans had to come up with their own health care plan to put in place after they tried like 20X to take away Obamacare, and they said they did, but they were actually only interested in taking away Obamacare.
All this isn't to say that their isn't nefarious Republican shit going on here where those members said they would vote for McCarthy before voting for Jordan or someone else.
Also doesn't answer the mystery of why they would continue to hold 3 additional ballots without actually taking the time to secure those votes, other than this party obviously not understanding the popular definition of insanity.
Heâ€™s not gonna make it.
I see no way that these 20 people change their mind.
McCarthy will reluctantly bow out, and some other placeholder will come in that the Freedom Caucus can you pretend to accept.

Kevin McCarthy is an extreme right wing, election denying, pro-awfulness, anti-decency, anti-democracy candidate.
However, he isn't conservative enough for at least 20 Republicans.
