All the rumbling of the deal seems to be giving into the no Kevin group's demands.
How is that a deal?
Also, what happened to all the "moderate" republicans that are against those provisions?
Is Kevin just expecting them to cave?
Is there a deal where the moderate republicans are going to say no?
(for example when he gives the MAGA ones all the committee jobs and do away with seniority?
).
If Republicans get tired of this charade and want to work with Democrats, they'd demand a compromise candidate, most likely a current or former "moderate" Republican member (meaning to the left of Mccarthy but right of Jeffries) such as one of the impeachment voters (Valadao, Newhouse), Fred Upton, or Liz Cheney.
I don’t believe them.
Sounds like a ploy to get some of the dems to not show up.
I may be wrong but I am not going to trust the GOP again after the “too close to the election to appoint a Supreme Court justice” debacle.
