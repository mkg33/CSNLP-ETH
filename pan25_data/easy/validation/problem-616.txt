I know it's intentional.
I really don't understand what you are saying.
I said r/justiceserved banned me for posting on a different subreddit (r/conservative) which I find off-putting and stifles conversation.
I cannot fathom what I could have said in r/conservative to get banned in a completely different subreddit.
I'm banned for posting on r/conservative.
I had no idea subs would do that, as it seems highly subjective and makes broad assumptions about why a person would post on any particular forum.
Incredibly stupid and off-putting for a sub to ban in this manner.
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.
If you want to help make this community a better place, consider !
That's intentional.
They have a rule that says they can ban you if they decide you aren't a conservative.
Basically they use this rule to ban anyone who says something they don't like.
Conservatives opposed abolition, women's suffrage, desegregation, civil rights, gay marriage, unions, higher education, abortion rights, etc.
Every conservative cause has always been 100% garbage.
