There are plenty of highly unpopular dictators who don't lose their life though.
For example Lukashenko in Belarus has been leader for 20+ years and everyone in Belarus hates his guts.
Chinese belligerence is predictable.
They said they wanted peace, they want nothing of the sort.
They are pernicious liars and bullies who seek to legitimize their stupidity on the global stage.
China can go fuck it’s self.
Warren Buffett very recently bought into TSMC (Taiwan) but then divested from that equity stake almost immediately thereafter (by value investor standards).
Wait.
China’s position is that the world shouldn’t support invaded countries?
Foreshadowing Taiwan and leaving me giggling about their support of North Korea and the Viet Cong.
Ahhh the shifting winds of….
Diplomacy.
Tunnels.
This is my crazy idea of how they might attack Taiwan is to build one or two huge tunnels to Taiwan.
It's within the Chinese technological grasp to do this and would eliminate the need for troop transports.
Probably wouldn't work but something to think about... Maybe?
