To no one's surprise it has been an entire day and still not even an attempt to prove Obama innocence.
A wise move that is reflective of the fact that any attempt at defending Obama's role in this controversy would be better served as a plea to your legislator.
Obama will continue to meddle and fluff his massive ego in the spotlight until the GOP is finally able to get it's crowning achievement, the "Obama Erasure Act", passed in both chambers.
As long as children are taught that Obama is a human being as opposed to the reptilian he clearly became upon his election to the Senate, as long as that happens I can not consider this a free country.
Yes, that does bring the Supreme Court's jurisdiction into question, something can only be settled by the arrest of Sotomayor and accomplice Kentaji Jackson.
As a public trial would destroy the court's morale, which would mean fewer enjoyable days at work for the great men and women that happen to be both be members of the Supreme Court as well as the Federalist Society.
Associates without Federalist Society memberships are by law, commuting treason by creating these questions about the morale of the court and not resigning immediately.
Well duh!
It's not gay, reading drag queens, sexy lady candy, unisex potato figurines, gas ranges, or, weapons for toddlers.
If its not performative outrage, it's not in their wheelhouse.
