They started this nonsense with lies, plowed ahead with no strategy, and are pwning themselves with stupid costly mistakes all over the place.
The USSR was formidable.
Then the kleptocracy set in and everyone has been trying to steal as much as possible ever since.
Most didn't think they'd ever need it.
They felt the reputation of Russia was enough.
I seriously doubt their nuks even work, they're massively expensive (lots to steal there) and if they really needed them, it would already be the end of the world anyway.
Now, all the good stuff is gone and they have an army with nothing but leftover crap, if there's anything left at all.
All that self enriching has put Russia into a dire position that could likely bring the end.
There's a lot of sharks just waiting.
Nation-building in Germany post WW2 created one of the most pacifistic, anti-fascist, anti-communist countries on the planet right next to modern Japan, which was similarly denazified.
And...?
Them simply existing as a hostile invading force on foreign soil continues the invasion.
Them simply taking up space is a hostile act.
Unless their first actions after getting off the train are to actively seek to surrender enmass, then they deserve what they get.
