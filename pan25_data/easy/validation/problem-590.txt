US Military base won't help Saudi Arabia in anything a direct war between Saudi and Iran is very unlikely because both sides have no interest in direct war.
In the other hand Saudi Arabia hopes that rapprochement with China will reduce China's support for Iran and, more importantly making Iran less aggressive towards Saudi Arabia.
Most people in reddit doesn't understand that Saudi Arabia doesn't really need US protection as you think, Saudi main concern is a cold war with Iran and it seem that US intervention in the Middle East the last few decades just let to more influence for Iran in countries like Iraq, Syria, etc.
Do you think any country especially Europe he look at the middle east as the best option to avoid dependence on Russian energy that's besides Saudi Arabia have the holiest city for Muslims attacking Saudi Arabia is the best way to maximise terrorism In the world as possible.
Why are people so stupid?
Saudi Arabia gives big welcomes to people they want to influence.
Biden represents USA, no courting, SA all ready has influence here.
They courted Trump, he only represented himself.
Now court Xi to better influence China.
