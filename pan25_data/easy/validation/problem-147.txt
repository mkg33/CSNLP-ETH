Iran’s war plans against the US aren’t to face the US head on, fighter to fighter, tank to tank.
They’ve trained their military to be professional insurgents.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps for example are known for setting up insurgencies across the Middle East.
They want to leverage their massive 85 million strong population, massive territory and mountainous terrain to drag the US army into a second Afghanistan, another quagmire for which the American regime will be bled dry of political will to continue fighting.
Moreover, there is also the possibility that if US warships enter the Persian Gulf, suicide boats will be employed to sink them for little cost which is as a strategy employed and validated in the Millennium Challenge 2002 war game.
Oh.
Thank you for the jets.
What do you mean they have no engines?
Where are the parts you promised?
Why do all of the boxes say "Made in China" on them?
Seriously?
all the training pilots were killed in Ukraine?
Its cheaper for Iran to acquire for obvious reasons, they probably couldn’t get F-22s or F-35s if they wanted to, judging by American performance in Afghanistan and Vietnam, overwhelming air superiority doesn’t seem like it can decisively crush insurgencies anyway, and you stated that your judgement of Iran’s acquisition of the SU-35 was because they may face NATO fighters in the future.
