The US also waited a long time to get involved with Libya.
In fact, the US was dragged kicking and screaming by France and the UK because we really did not want to get involved.
As an American, I am ultra proud of our military.
With that said ...
I always and fully supported Afghanistan.
The one that I never fully got behind was Iraq.
Of course I was in middle school when this all started lol.
So I guess the question is, do you try to stay independent and wait for conflict to break out so that you can be subjugated by the necessities of a hot war, or do you pick a side and get all the benefits of the association in peacetime and all the protection that will be provided against some other aggressive government trying to take you over?
But that’s not true!
The governments of those countries have no control over what their military personnel do on their paid leave.
And Ukrainians have the right to go on holiday, and even do a little Christmas shopping.
Conventional forces, very likely.
A guy who is loose a couple screws, suffering an embarrassing beat down and possibly weeks from his deathbed and a finger on a nuclear arsenal—scares me a lot.
