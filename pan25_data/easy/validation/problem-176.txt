Blake Masters was never, ever going to beat Mark Kelly.
This race was establishing him for 2024 against Sinema, a race she has been positioning herself to win handily against any MAGA candidate.
All she has done, besides being a reprehensible piece of shit, is make herself more attractive for the McCain/Bowers/Flake/Kyl wing of the Maricopa GOP.
I fear primarying her with a progressive would cause whomever she runs against to win.
Sucks.
She sucks.
Meanwhile, Blake Masters goes on TV and quietly licks his lips while shooting a silenced pistol while repeatedly emphasizing its German origin with a clear and uncomfortable fawning intonation.
I think he could.
I think that he can't get the Maricopa GOP votes she can.
I've been here most of my adult life and this state has changed in such a dramatic way, since even before SB1070.
Got ourselves a blueish purple state on the higher level.
Problem is the homestedding militia types in the big, empty places.
