Going on a mini-tangent from the “straight wars” joke; It’s actually very interesting being an LGBT+ person, we have our own sub-culture and interests, but still participate in the “general culture”, but I know from experience if something political specifically helps/benefits us, or a piece of media markets to us (but that’s less important in zeroing in on the political consequences), that the majority of allies completely disengage.
Saw it happen with my dad once.
They went on vacation in Las Vegas, and one of the things that surprised him the most was how the black people were out there.
In his words - they weren't being in gangs or screaming "yeeah boyee" in your face or being all trashy with gold chains, they weren't break dancing, weren't pointing guns around, they weren't rioting or anything.
None of the stuff he'd expect a normal interaction with a black person to be.

Republicans hate everyone.
Even republicans voters hate most republicans voters.
They’ve just been fooled into thinking THEY are part of the hierarchy - not THEM.
