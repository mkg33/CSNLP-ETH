Back in January when everyone was saying this wasn't going to go hot, I moved two thirds of my meager savings into Lockheed and Raytheon.
Nothing absurd in terms of gains, but it's been very healthy.
32 Broken arrows and 6 permanently lost, all accounted for but the breakdown of the Russian federation would be a disaster, the entire region would be destabilized and a power vacuum formed, more chances of nukes getting lost in the chaos and more chances of some random nuke in the mountains going post critical and exploding or some madman pulls the trigger, there is too much risk.
Lol.
I looked up the casualties of the gulf War, the war in Afghanistan, the Iraq War and the us involvement in Somalia, Libya and Pakistan.
The civillian casualties of the Era when the us was involved was a small part of the civillian casualties that were from the other sides in those wars.
The Ukrainian civillians who died In Russian hands is potentially in the 100,000 or more.
The civillians who doed from us hands in the middle east is far smaller.
