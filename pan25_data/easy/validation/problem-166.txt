Simple.
Blacks were born into chattel slavery in the US.
All of their cultures, diety worship, heritage, and lineage were erased for hundreds of years.
They were enslaved, beaten, murdered, and considered less less than human.
They were forced to practice a white man's religion and worship a white God.
Even after abolition they were discriminated against and murdered by whites for decades.
Laws were constructed through Posse Comitatus to specifically oppress them.
They had to fight to exist, to vote, to own land.
Their leaders were assassinated during the civil rights era just trying to be equal on paper.
They have had to fight the " white" throne every single year of every day they have lived in this country and still do.
So ya.
I think they might have earned the right before Mexicans, Italians, and Chinese in the United States.
Concentrate forces geographically.
Itâ€™s better to hold all of the power in half the country than it is to hold no power across the nation.
Concentration of forces itself is a force multiplier.
In the case of the GQP, it also results in more groupthink because the differing views were running out of town.
