Maybe we just have different trains of thought but I’m not too keen on making minimal payments over a long period of time.
At that pace it’s no wonder people never get out of debt with the way interest works being regulated by congress.
I can at least say I have more money put away than what I owe in loan debt after working in the field for the past year.
Right now I’m just waiting to see how this court decision plays out.
If they forgive then I think I’d qualify for the $20k forgiven in which case I would be comfortable enough to pay off all the remaining debt at once.
If not, my net will still be positive rather than in debt.
Again I’m just trying to get rid of my debt as fast as possible.
I’m not in this for the long haul.
No denying an educated populace is very important.
There needs to be a big discussion on funding for higher education, and education as a whole.
As it stands, I’d argue that college is a luxury (and not that it should be).
Depending on degree, school etc it can be very beneficial, but you can survive with out it, and in some situations, be very successful with out it.
