Especially if it comes to military/defense, architecture, urbanism, infrastructure and economy, which is all very good and well-organized in Finland.
There's a lot of Soviet thinking and way of doing things in Estonia, none which exists in Finland and which people want to desperately get rid of.
It's super visible in urbanism, for example, where authorities still think that "more/wider roads = less traffic" and so forth.
Or the serious and forward-looking way Finland manages its defense forces, that'd be quite difficult to sell to an Estonian voter (well, perhaps not in 2023, but still).
Exactly.
That is the documentary.
I have seen it.
Of course one factor in that thing is, that Finland is culturally close enough for Estonians, that they can identify themselves with Finnish things.
Finnish culture sucked Estonians to its whirlwinds.
It might be, that Finns arrived from Estonia to Finland.
Estonia was the bigger and wealthier neighbour for centuries, Tallinn was a hanseatic city (a Central European trading union).
But when the climate in Finland started to get warmer in the 1500's, Finland started to grow bigger and stronger.
Nowadays Finnish GDP is about 10 times bigger than the Estonian one.
