Even with the START Treaty requiring very regular shared reviews of nuclear arsenals, with how absolute shit the Russian military machine has proven to be?
It feels unlikely that Russia has anywhere near 6000 functional nuclear weapons.
Yes, it would be terrifying for the globe to become erupted in thermonuclear warfare, but it seems quite unlikely to happen.
I mean, people have been saying for some time that if India and Pakistan just nuked themselves and the launches/detonations were kept purely in that region, it would "destroy the world", it may cause some problems, but we have MUCH more to fear of the super volcano erupting under Yellowstone National Park, as that would be a TRUE global catastrophe, vs. India and Pakistan glassing themselves.
Needs to be more careful?
Lmao, how about people stop victim-blaming and instead give Ukraine more modern AD systems, so that this won't happen again.
Genuine question.
What good reason would be there for Zelensky to deny UN's claims?
The narrative was along the line of "eventhough the missile was from Ukraine they were just defending themselves and Russia is to blame.
This incident shows that Ukraine needs more support".
