I don't follow Brazil closely, but this seems like encouraging news.
Brazil has the resources to be a major economic power but it always seems to go haywife.
Magnificently corrupt?
That implies he's heads and tails far more corrupt than other politicians in Brazil.
I'd like to know where you get this impression.
Think about the scandals around the FAA, the FCC giving money to prop up a monopoly instead of getting Americans internet, the person in charge of running the USPS actively sabotaging it to prop up the stock he has in its competitors, people in congress doing legal insider trading, Congress letting companies do mergers that would have been illegal according to the antitrust laws in exchange for donations, electricity companies dumping millions of tons of radioactive coal ash into rivers and having the taxpayers pay for the cleanup while never facing justice...
Thanks.
It's Sunday so I'll put aside some time today to read up more on Brazil.
I just have a very top level knowledge, but always found the place fascinating.
