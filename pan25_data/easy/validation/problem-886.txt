Exactly, also the part where the mother is interviewed and she knows the trauma involved with any of her choices.
To wait and give birth to a still born is extremely traumatic for any woman.
If a Neuro surgeon was involved it is the assumption the baby after birth would have very little chance at life even after intervention.
This is a medical termination, not that of a healthy baby because she so chooses.
This is not letting this life be in pain or suffer, and to be clear the only thing the court said was that it was the motherâ€™s choice.
Weather she wants to give birth to a still born, wait weeks until the baby suffers and dies, or have mercy and terminate an unviable pregnancy.
Worry about an unviable pregnancy now, forget if the woman dies or could never carry another child.
What if the woman already has a family.
Better the unvible fetus and leave her children orphan?
Disgusting.
The ultimate betrayal.
A child being nurtured by a woman's body until two and a half weeks from the point it would be born....and she has it scraped out because she finds out it will be completely healthy but will have learning disabilities.
And tons of Americans will laude this as a wonderful thing.
Absolutely sick and depraved.
The say being against this is medieval and brutal, is say the opposite is the case, surely.
