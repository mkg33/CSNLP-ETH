The geography overwhelmingly favors Ukraine on most of the Bakhmut front, and it does so in a manner that makes it worse and more exposed for the attacker the deeper they get, which is why you hear of "imminent envelopment" over and over yet the Russians keep shattering and getting rolled back.
These guys fell in a trap.
There is a giant salt mine in this town and it is still under the control of Ukraine.
Thing is, there are secret tunnels which lead behind the Russian front that the russians dont know about.
Ukraine retreated in the last few days and the russians started to push.
Now Ukraine stopped them at their defense line in the town and has started to use those tunnels to also attack them from behind.
Genocide fanboy?
Soledar is about to fall I don’t understand people like you, you people can’t just ignore anything negative about the war in Ukraine, Ukraine is completely reliant on NATO for weapons and supplies, which they aren’t gonna supply Ukraine with forever.
I’ll be back to this thread when Soledar and Bakhmut fall waiting to see what goons like you have to say.
