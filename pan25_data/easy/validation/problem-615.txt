There was a derailment in 2014 and there was enormous pressure to do something, so much so that the Obama administration put out an open call to the public asking for suggestions on regulations.
One of the organizations that responded was the governmental agency that investigated that derailment/spill, and it explicitly recommended that the regulation should be very broad, so as to cover not just liquid natural gas, but all sorts of other toxic chemicals.
The chemical industry lobby lobbied the Obama administration not to have a broad rule, and he capitulated to them.
Responsibility lies with him.
