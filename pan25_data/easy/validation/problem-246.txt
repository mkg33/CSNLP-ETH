That will be many months from now, they need to bring the crews to train them, tank crews, maintenance crews, etc, then they need to get everything there, tanks, parts, ammo, support trucks, etc...
It's goos they will get them, but it won't be before the summer.
Exactly.
Things are not as they appear.
I wish I was not shocked at how this war has been covered.
As someone who studies history, I find a lot of major media coverage on the Ukrainian War has parallels to how war time journalism operated during World War II.
Yes and no.
Its no coincidence that Ukraine made this decision on the heels of NATO countries supplying modern tanks and supporting infrastructure.
As was correctly amended by another poster onto a comment of mine below, a significant strategic weakpoint of the Russian invasion is their lack of options regarding supply and resupply, meaning they have to rely on trucks to get anything at all to their massive new draft of soldiers.
Ukraine did an amazing job of striking their truck infrastructure at the beginning, leaving Russia with little choice but to hodgepodge commercial vehicles together and commit their armour to guarding supply lines.
With superior tanks in Ukraine, this places their supply lines at significant risk again and having hundreds of thousands of soldiers in an advanced area is a strategic nightmare if they are cut off from supply/resupply.
Yes.
They are still vastly outnumbered, and though the quality of Ukrainian fighters, their equipment and tactics are far superior to what the average russian soldier has to work with, quantity has a quality all its own that is very difficult to overcome.
16 weeks is 4 months,.
January is over, they will be "trained" by the end of May if the training starts next week, summer starts on June 21st... sooooo I wasn't wrong saying that is not before the summer, even experienced people will have to learn new things, yeah, no need to teach them what a wrench is, bu the engine of an Abrams is not the same as the T72 or whatever they're used to.
