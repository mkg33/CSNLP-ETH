Same with the UK when we recently were part of the UEFA Euros Pan-European hosting.
You can’t buy beer in British stadiums (because of our history) but we had to change that rule when we hosted matches during that tournament.
Yeah seriously.
How often did ppl even THINK about Qatar before the World Cup.
Now it's just that "super conservative Muslim country with no beer and lots of slavery".
But it's ridiculously expensive.
Several times the cost in any reasonable country.
You sober up as soon as you see the bill.
You'd think a country trying to make itself lol like a beautiful hub for culture would you know, tolerate other cultures, the world cup is like a month straight up day drinking in most countries, I was actively studying in Paris in 2014 and every cafe was full of people drinking from sun up to well into the night, I saw people stumbling down the street wheeping after losses, drinking is the main alarm for a lot of football fans it feels.
EDIT: alrite guys stop messaging me.
As you can see a lot of other people have clarified what I meant about buying alcohol in UK football stadiums.
You don’t need to add the same comment to the pile.
