Are there classes on Asian American, Mexican American, or \[insert race here\] American studies?
If so, any one of those sounds racist.
We’re all Americans and our society (in general) has been trying to reduce/eliminate segregation for MANY decades.
Having any class highlighting a particular race as a whole would be a significant step backward.
I’m curious as to how you come to the conclusion that I am one of “them” based on my position that it is racist to teach a course based on race.
I’m not sure how else a class such as \[insert race here\] American studies could be considered as anything other than racism.
I do not deny that there are many alt-right people that are very racist, however, I do not consider myself near that spectrum.
In fact, I have many close relatives and family members from several races.
We are a melting pot of many Americans and I hope we would teach all Americans inclusive history of all the races we share our community with.
