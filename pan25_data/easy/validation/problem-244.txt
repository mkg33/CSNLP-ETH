Deinonychus has feather quill knobs and hollow bones.
With this and other evidence Ostrom moved raptors into the category of feathered dinosaurs without the fossilized remains of feathers.
Their feet were made for running.
They had cartilaginous rods the lenh of their tails to stiffen them as rudders.
They likely used wing-assisted running and it is speculated they jumped on prey, held on with wing claws and feet and began biting their prey with their 72 serrated teeth.
They caused their prey's death through massive blood lose and organ damage.
All that from skeletons and devoted research.
I bet these raptors have evidence of the same.
“Jan 16 (Reuters) - Scientists in Chile's Patagonia region are unearthing the southernmost dinosaur fossils recorded outside Antarctica, including remains of megaraptors that would have dominated the area's food chain before their mass extinction.
Fossils of megaraptors, a carnivorous dinosaur that inhabited parts of South America during the Cretaceous period some 70 million years ago, were found in sizes up to 10 meters long, according to the Journal of South American Earth Sciences.”.
I won and I WIN.
Twenty-nine years later it must feel shameful for you to read this (not that you are or anything).
