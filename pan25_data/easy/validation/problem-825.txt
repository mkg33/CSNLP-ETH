Not sure where fear mongering cones into play here this us just how evolution works.
What were talking about us genetic drift.
We are a species that uses tons of energy to procreate and to rear the young but if we have less success due to some outside factor which we can't cobtrol then what happens to our gene pool?
It's not like a person who's genes coded for creating a human who takes too many risks ended up not passing on genes as a result of their risk taking ways, this is affecting random people (actually seemingly all males) and will have an effect on the individual.
Ultimately you want to pass genes down and if you can't your fitness decreases which will be cause for those genes fluttering out and ceasing to be part of the gene pool.
Again I said before we don't know how this will affect us yet but I think my prediction of "this will impact our gene pool" is extremely accurate.
To deny this is to be willingly ignorant.
Alarmist?
Worldwide, fertility rates have dropped about 1% a year since 1960.
Miscarriage rates are going up about 1%/year.
The sperm count decline began, probably before 1930s as they've been tracking it since 1932 and it's been declining since then to the tune of about 1%/year.
And we don't know what the underlying cause or causes are and thus we can't do anything to fix it.
