On the other hand my Tesla Model 3 is the best car I’ve owned.
The build quality has dramatically improved over the years and mine was flawless.
Also, when I rotated the tires myself and inspected the suspension components, I was impressed by the solid castings.
Everything was beautifully constructed compared to the cheap stamped steel on my former Mazda and even better than anything I’ve seen on my many Hondas.
Not saying Tesla is perfect, but the critical parts are extremely well designed and built plus the drivetrain components are the best in the industry.
Not to mention that it’s fun to drive and costs 2.5 cents per mile to operate.
What’s not to love?
It wasn't all that long ago that ICE vehicles required so much ongoing maintenance that there were several nationwide chains devoted to just providing tuneups and carburetor overhauls, as well as all the other minor and constant repairs needed to keep ICE cars working.
If your car lasted 100K miles it's only because you dumped thousands and thousands of dollars into it over those ten years just to keep it running.
