I mean NORADs whole purpose is to detect and eliminate intercontinental ballistic missiles, which can launch in mascow and land in the U.S. within like 18 minutes or something so I'm a bit suspicious they didn't detect a slow moving balloon.
Coincidence?
Who knows?
The threat of a large EMP generating device or multiple devices could effectively decapitate the US nuclear missile launch capabilities if countermeasures are not in place, effective or even exist.

It was low enough to be seen with naked eye/cell phones.
Meaning what ever it was trying to view, they could not view from space.
Propaganda.
We have been drilled to view most actions of whatever current enemy nation states to be inherently nefarious, while ours are justified evils or just misunderstood.

Why they flying a weather balloon that low?
I’m no weather guy but being in the south Tornado, hurricane, storms,etc….
All form way the fuck higher in the sky than the balloon was.
So I can probably bet you 100$ that it was not a weather balloon.
I might have had weather equipment on it, but it was not a weather balloon.
A few things to note.
