In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Fair!
I doubt it would go far though.
The view of life is so damn warped.
Likely someone on the right will claim doctors are going to come after "your parents and grandparents" and murder them... some stupid shit like that without giving any context or of the mind to keep a person alive despite being in terrible condition because it makes the caretaker feel some sort of way.

If you think allowing a terminally ill or completely broken person to painlessly end their own life willingly and knowingly is "morally wrong", you also probably think abortion is for murderers, getting a vasectomy takes away your manhood, or something similarly ridiculous.
I guess I'd consider myself a fan.
I'm mildly involved in MAID (Medical Assistance In Dying) I volunteer as one of two witnesses necessary to sign off on the patients' paperwork before the next step; filling the prescription for end-of-life meds to be prescribed within 10 days.
