You'd be surprised at how fast choking a country's economy can neutralize them.
When your country is small and very controversial just like Afghanistan having a super power neighbor like China upset at you because you refused a deal or looked them the wrong way will more than likely bring great instability to your country, more than what war could do.
Economics are scary.
They didn't defeat the US.
Public will ended.
I guarantee you if the US wanted to use every tool to conquer that nation it would.
But, the US had a puppet government set up.
The puppet fell apart.
It's the Afghan people that failed.
They didnt want that government.
But, now the Taliban have to play politics with the big boys.
They have to be legitimate.
Before they were united behind their anti west.
But, now the various groups and tribes are no longer unified by a common enemy.
Economics is now the game.
And the Taliban have shit for economics.
They need money to ensure they keep the groups loyal.
China knows this and will get a far better deal.
Afghanistan is now worse off than it was before.
Money will get funneled to the top.
20 years wasnt destabilizing because Afghanistan isn't a nation.
It's a country with various ethnic groups in it.
They were used to living in the mountains.
They were mostly rural population.
They hardly noticed a change from soviets to US and Afghanistan.
