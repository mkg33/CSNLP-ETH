The comment reflects a simmering divide within the antiabortion movement, which has long sought to treat women seeking abortions as “victims” and not as targets for punishment.
In the wake of the June Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, movement leaders promised that women had nothing to fear — even as Republican leaders in more than a dozen states in the South and Midwest moved aggressively to enact strict abortion bans, though almost always targeting providers rather than patients.
Alabama’s near-total ban, which took effect soon after the Supreme Court ruling, exempts abortion seekers from prosecution, including penalties only for those who help people obtain abortions.
In his statement, Attorney General Steve Marshall’s office suggests that pregnant women could still be prosecuted under a separate 2006 state law that has been used to punish women for drug consumption during pregnancy.
Alabama’s attorney general became the most prominent Republican official yet to suggest that pregnant women could be prosecuted for taking abortion pills, saying in recent days that a state ban targeting those who facilitate abortions does not preclude the state from seeking to penalize women under other existing laws.
The alternate reality these folks live in is wild.
I mean, this women is at least saying she doesn't agree with Marshall, but it's just because the words he is using is bad PR.
And this equating medical procedures to some holy war against a made-up cartel of pill peddlers is absurd.
Check out this dingbats CV; she worked for Bush-Cheney campaign, then the RNC, a year at Health and Human Services, and now almost two decades running this stupid non-profit... no medical background, no real public policy credentials, yet WaPo thinks she deserves a soundbite.
We gotta stop amplifying the voices of these fucking zealots.
