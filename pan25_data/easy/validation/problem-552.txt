The entire island was ruled by the French by the time Haiti became a country, Santo Domingo was technically under Napoleon’s control at the time since France captured Spain.
A lot of people miss that the cracks in their system were staring to show even then.
The “founder” of Haiti, Jean Dessalines, was assassinated by one of his rivals, that started a feud between Dessalines top commanders, one called Petion, and the other Henry Christophe, who declared himself emperor.
Some of these commanders gained their experience in the American Revolutionary War, when they were deployed by France, many of them were already soldiers in Africa before they were captured by rival armies and sold as slaves.
Christophe ruled his side of Haiti as a Napoleonic dictator.
Both Christophe and Petion captured the rest of the island, and in the tradition of his ancestors, slaved the captured soldiers.
Haiti was united once Christophe committed suicide, when walls were closing on him due to his unpopular empire, Petion was rumoredly assassinated after appointing general Boyer as his successor.
It was Boyer’s brutal dictatorship that tested the resolve of the former Spanish subjects of the island to found the Dominican Republic and divide the island for good.
Haiti went through their endless periods of chaos, while the Dominican Republic, after a chaotic start, found some stability thanks to the dictatorship of generalissimo Ulisses Heureaux (of Haitian descent) and his predecessor Arturo de Merino, who became Archbishop of Santo Domingo after yielding the presidency to Heureaux.
The Catholic Church has been a historical check on dictatorship powers in Latin America.
Haiti never had that check.
Absolutely.
A country would have to go in and wipe out the gangs, maintain law enforcement responsibility for decades to keep new ones from forming, pump a ton of money into the country to rebuild infrastructure, promote a stable system of government, improved education, work to root out corruption and the whole time the people that benefitted financially from the old system would be screaming bloody murder while eventually much of the domestic population would tire of your presence.
