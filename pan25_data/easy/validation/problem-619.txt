Nope, not really.
Not with way D.C. works and how it works and how everybody classifies EVERYTHING.
Because it's the only way to talk to each other.
Fixing the problem is a much bigger question, assuming "the problem" we're talking about is that some classified docs are poorly tracked (the archives didn't know any of Biden's docs were missing), and that this happens so frequently that as long as the person follows procedures for reporting and returning the docs they generally won't lose their security clearance.
So what then?

People start treating classified information lightly, because it's how people talk in the government and shit happens.
