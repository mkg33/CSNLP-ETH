Probably they liked the sense of "community" and "standing up" to the government.
They dont need a real reason to do that.
WHEREAS the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom:
What you call a toy.
I use to hunt ducks, and occasionally target shoot.
If I'm expected to be trusted to act on the behalf of Canada with firearms.
If I am expected to behave safely when foreign policy is on the line.
Then why am I not trusted in Canada, with much less dangerous firearms.
Firearms which already have significant legislation around them?
Oh great.
A bunch of assholes with too much time and money creating a bunch of noise for the poor locals so they can't get to work or get enough sleep.
Fucking pull the fingers out of your asses.
And whereas on the Establishment of the Union by Authority of Parliament it is expedient, not only that the Constitution of the Legislative Authority in the Dominion be provided for, but also that the Nature of the Executive Government therein be declared:
No.
I don't believe the cons will do a good job, but I'm not given any other ability to do anything about this.
