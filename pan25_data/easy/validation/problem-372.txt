Putin isn't just some corrupt politician, Russia has done something pretty special in human history.
They've industrialized corruption.
What Ford did in American to manufacturing, Putin and his cronies have done to corruption in Russia.
They're a brand new form of economic system, not capitalism, not socialism, not communism, but a kleptocracy.
Huge cuts of money made in businesses and natural resources go directly into a small number of pockets, none more than Putin himself.
The problem is what happens when foxes guard the henhouse, you can only skim that big for so long until you seriously impact the number of hens.
Having taken so much for so long and a year's long reduction in oil prices pushed the kleptocracy to the brink.
American history teacher here!
To be fair history is alot to cover.
And most high school history classes want you to cover things like "all of American history" or "1000-2000 years of world history" in just a single school year (with classes of twenty to thirty 14-17 year olds).
