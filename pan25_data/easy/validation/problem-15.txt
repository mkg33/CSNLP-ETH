Exact India doesn’t really care.
You can offer to give India the F-35 and they’ll take it and still support Russia.
Their relationships with Russia data back to the Soviet Union.
If India chose to be a friend of a literally regime of communist oppression, then I highly doubt they will break from Russia now.
History matters.
The history of what Europeans did to India, it still matters to India, and it influences how India behaves and reacts to Europeans today.
oh yeah for sure.
i actually am starting to think that all of these patterns of hypocrisy is God showing us how fucking dumb we are and it's ok to be both socially supportive of everyone without being a commie, and that competition inspires our greatness as one world nation.
the lines are bullshit and we draw them for ourselves.
India has had close and strong diplomatic, economic, military and political ties with Russia (and its predecessor the Soviet Union) for EIGHTY YEARS.
They are like old buddies.
most Americans see the caste system as discrimination/classism (because it is) so it seems like indians who have fled their third world homeland to the US now want to employ the same hate tactics that has turned india into what it is (or has kept it as it is for as long as it has been that way).
No there isn't.
A sovereign nation can decide to enter any military alliance it wants.
Especially if it feels threatened by its neighbour.
That is no justification for an invasion.
Stop that propaganda.
