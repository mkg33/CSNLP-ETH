The story is that he's "soft on crime" and "just letting criminals walk" when the actual truth is that he's "softer" on misdemeanors because California voters voted to change the laws around misdemeanors AND, further, that "soft on crime" DA is prosecuting felonies at the same rate as his predecessor.
AND, further, his office prosecutes misdemeanors in unincorporated L.A. County and cities without their own court systems, but the complaints are about the city, and it's the City Attorney's Office who handles most of the misdemeanors in the city limits, not the County DA.
No.
Laws against real crimes (things like murder, theft, etc) are just and should obviously exist.
Laws that criminalize activities with no inherent victim (like Marijuana possession, having a pistol grip on a rifle, etc) are unjust and repugnant in what is supposed to be a "free country".
Do you not see the difference..?
But we’ve gone so incredibly far beyond that till houses need yards of certain acreage, height limits, minimum square footage and maximum housing units per acre that we’ve worked awfully hard to make sure housing can only become much more expensive, and all this exists on almost every development even without an HOA.
These land covenants are also essentially set in stone till the end of time.
