He was less re-elected so much as conservative/centrist democratics in Maryland freaked out when the Democratic Party nominee was an actual progressive.
Look at him.
Calling a Trump a Trump.
Hello??
Who are these people commenting on trumps abuses like they are new or unique?
Small edit.
Ahhhhhh.
Trump insulted his family.
That makes it DIFFERENT.
When he was merely insulting the great THEM, there was no problem.
I see.
Hogan is positioning himself as the moderate Republican candidate for President.
He's hoping that his victories in a deeply blue state will allow him to be the vanguard for a changed Republican Party.
He's hoping that Trump and DeSantis' internecine fight will give him an opportunity to obtain the nomination by courting the suburban voters that the right is hemorrhaging and by making Republicans believe he's electable in the eyes of independents and the recently departed never-Trumpers.
“Outstanding” is a stretch.
Even by GOP standards.
He just looks a little better because he was kept firmly in check by a very liberal state legislature.
He still took every fiscal opportunity he could to fuck over women and black people.
