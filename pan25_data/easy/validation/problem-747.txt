It's all just hollow gestures and publicity stunts at this point.
The time to protest would have been when Qatar was awarded the World Cup.
However that doesn't mean that most people in said countries approve of that: even in so-called Democracies most of the actual power to change things that common people have in anything but very large numbers (and being very angry) is basically zero (power really is with money first, second, third and so on) and only when shit trully hits the fan do people eventually organise enough for change things and even then a lot of resources are spent by those with most of the money to manipulate people against some scapegoat or other (or even each other) and not impact their money extracting activities.
I'm so done with this.
I was never a football fan to begin with, but holy hell.
Anyone backing any of these spineless teams or FIFA or watching the games or supporting Qatar in anyway?
A bad person.
You just can't keep rolling over to evil like this and not be at least somewhat complicit.
