In this particular case the selling of tobacco is still legal to anyone born after 2009.
So as long as that's a significant demographic (a few decades yet) this doesn't empower gangs.
At most it empowers illegal resellers who buy cigarettes legally and then sell them on to people born after 2009.
This requires no complicated smuggling or otherwise high risk crime that makes organizing it and fighting over turf and products a valuable money making scheme.
For a long long time it will just be people asking their older friends to buy them some cigarettes.
Exactly.
People on this thread seem to have a very narrow and exceptionally naive view of addiction and make the mistake of equating the power of the experience to the addictiveness of a substance.
Which is not the case when it comes to nicotine.
There are people even claiming that illegal cigarettes won't be smuggled into NZ because it's an island nation and they are getting dozens of upvotes.
It's actually mad how foolish people are to how the world actually works.
