PETA is like the NRA: They wholly exist to manufacture outage and raise money off of it.
Any causes they claim to support are a distant second at best.
In March 2013, Charity Navigator issued a Donor Advisory advising that "the majority of the Center for Consumer Freedom's program expenses are being directed to its CEO Richard Berman's for-profit management company, Berman and Company".
The Chicago Tribune depicted CCF as an organization that "employs razor-sharp wit and unconventional tactics."
Berman and Company does not publicly name its clients; 60 Minutes obtained a list of companies that funded the Center for Consumer Freedom in 2002.
Among the parties named were The Coca-Cola Company, Tyson Foods, Outback Steakhouse, Wendy's International, Inc., Brinker International (parent company of Chili's and Macaroni Grill), Arby's, Hooters, and Red Lobster.
Zero environmental impact?
No.
Can the it be less than the environmental impact creating and throwing pleather has?
Possibly.
Just because something has an environmental impact doesn't mean its the worst option.
