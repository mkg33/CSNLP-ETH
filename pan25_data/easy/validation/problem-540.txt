To answer the question... No.
Because nobody gives a shit if they are chinese or not, the point is the high levels of infection.
We'd close the borders to canadians, and new zealanders if they were reporting similar numbers.
And we frikin love those people.
Because the Chinese population has much lower vaccination rates (in combination with a less effective vaccine) so concerns about a new/unknown (for now) variant are much higher, and the spread in China has been so quick that we could be seeing a spread of covid similar to the beginning of the pandemic when lockdowns were implemented.
E.g.
Ruby Princess but planes.
In a low vaccination population there is less selection pressure for a vaccine-evading variant, plus a negative test two days before isn’t enough to actually keep it out, and there are negligible control measures in the general population so if a variant does have a significant growth advantage it doesn’t really matter whether a little gets in or a lot gets in, it’ll blow up sooner or later anyway.
So the benefit of this policy is a lot less clear.
And if you’re drawing comparison to the start of the pandemic, remember how well individual country travel bans worked…?
