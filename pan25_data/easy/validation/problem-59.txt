Because she's a US POW essentially?
She's being held and Russia won't negotiate an exchange?
Because I care far more about some random US WNBA player than some fucking corrupt foreign legion full of actual shit people and she's on there for a fucking weed vape.
Why would you want her to fight?
Y'all are a bunch of fucking idiots.
That's my point you fuckwit.
Why would someone joke about Russia forcing US prisoners that were unjustly acquitted to fight against Ukraine and you people are making a joke of it.
How does that not make sense?
It was HER that the previous commenter brought up, and I stated that it's not cool to joke about forcing US citizens in Russian prison to fight against Ukraine?
How the fuck are you both so dense to not understand what I meant?
I swear everyone reddit is brain dead.
Russia has a unique prison and criminal culture due to the gulags in the Soviet days in many gulags gangs of prisoners were pay to help quell the growing rebellion’s from the other prisoners after the Soviet got rid of most of their gulags many of theses gangs stayed together making a business smuggling in western products to The ussr.
After the fall of the ussr these now criminal empires gained vastly more power and now have large sway over the Russian government.
I not so sure how much criminal’s dislike the current Russian government seeing how corrupt it is though it probably depends on the person.
