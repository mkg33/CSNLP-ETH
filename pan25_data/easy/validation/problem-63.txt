and I have people coming up all the time, Big Strong Men, Beautiful Suburban Women, I love Suburban Women, and they all love Trump, I'm up to probably 100% in the Suburbs, and they love their Washing Machines, their Amazing Machines, and they're totally happy with their Fridges, they have no problem, "they work great, Sir," of course they do, of course they do, but now Sleepy Joe wants to take them away, just like Obama took away your Lightbulbs and your Toilets, your Water is now Sky High because of the Radical Left, and Sleepy Joe has been letting it happen, just like he's letting Iran and China take over.
we had a Perfect Record, remember that, your Favorite President, and we're talking about me ok, not Obama, not Sleepy Joe, and I shouldn't even mention Crooked Hillary Clinton who has hurt us a lot.
and I've done more than even the late great Honest Abe Lincoln, very Presidential with the hat, not as Presidential as me but pretty good.
and we would've never had Space Force without Trump, they'll be talking about it millions and billions of years from now, "President Trump is the Greatest President That's Ever Lived," even the Fake News is writing it down.
you're welcome.
