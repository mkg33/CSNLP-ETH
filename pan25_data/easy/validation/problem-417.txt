If it’s something that can be proven and sees the light of day, it’ll lead to congressional investigation (which currently would only be able to be done by the senate judicial committee because the house will do Jack or shit).
And since there will not be any support for impeachment, the best bet would be to smear the justice in the press and the court of public opinion until either a) they resign (won’t happen) or b) there becomes more senators who would want to shut the conversation off and side for impeaching and removing the justice (also won’t happen while a democrat is in the White House).
Kav is also a pawn.
He’s a sociopath and a hack.
He’s easy to manipulate because he really just wants bribes, women to sleep with, young women to control, and the ability to inflict punishment on people he doesn’t like.
He’s really shitty, but not in a way that is particularly unique in DC GOP circles.
He is an especially odious example of his type of person, but easily 1/3 of GOP members of Congress are about the same.
