I don’t qualify for ACA because my job offers health plans.
At least that’s my understanding of it.
Problem is those plans are really expensive and practically useless.
One person would need to pay $400-500/month which is ACA unsubsidized level, a “family” of two need to pay $1600/month.
It goes without saying that these are plans with $9500 deductibles which would have me going broke anyways before insurance covers anything significant and $1600 is way more than I take home every couple weeks.
Hard to justify spending more than half your pay on health insurance when you have many other more pressing expenses like housing, bills and food.
No free time to go see doctors.
I haven’t had health insurance since 2018.
I haven’t seen a doctor/hospital since around 2015.
I had insurance as a child, used health insurance once for shingles.
As an adult, I had emergency surgery for appendicitis which put me $50k under because fu if you are 21 years old and one month and full time student, your parents expensive insurance decided not to cover students past age 21 and you can’t apply for medicaid to your name until you are 22 (at the time).
I guess people age 21-22 with no income do not need medical coverage, I fell through a crack... Had QoL surgery a couple years later because the union insurance decided change rules and cover me until age 26.
By then I was paying for my own health insurance anyways from my 24 hour a week job so I was double insured for a few years in case they randomly changed their mind again.
That put me under about $4k.
$12k of my after tax income goes to student loans so I actually make over $15k less than I actually do, yet that doesn’t allow me to qualify for subsidies people making $15k less than me do.
I think you Americans call this “being house poor.” I guess education poor would be more appropriate.
Anyways, I don’t complain, it is what it is.
At least I’m relatively young, relatively healthy and out of organs that burst.
