Put another way, Capitalism as proposed by/according to Adam Smith looks nothing like the sort of Laissez-Faire Capitalism of the late 19th/early 20th century, and it's the latter that Republicans espouse today, but when someone like Biden (or Elizabeth Warren, or others) refer to it they're usually talking more about the former.
And that version thereof talks very strongly about the need for government intervention and regulation in order to ensure competition, rather than monopolistic control and rent-seeking behavior.
How does that exploit you?
Otherwise, you would be the one withholding the means of production from workers who could utilize it unless they submit to your authority and give you the products of their labor.
You would be the one buying others labor power and only paying a portion of it back in wages.
The most you risk is not making it as a business owner and going back to being a worker.
That is exploitation, not workers having equal ownership of the things they need to work.
