Then some other team is told to make 'A housing unit that can house something you dob't need to know what, [precise dimensions told to above team] and is fully waterproof and weighs no more thab 3 kg and supplies 5 volts to a mystery thing using this adapter and can work in a vacuum'.
Of course China wants chips.
Russia wants chips.
Everyone does.
No one goes it alone, right now.
No one can today.
The US is bringing more chip fab back home, but those projects are a decade out, and all it's going to do is make us more internationally shock resistant, not independent.
If China and Russia want to do it alone...
They just... can't...
Both countries demographics are inverted pyramids - they have more older people than younger people.
Russia has a population of 143 million, but only 8.4 million between 20-40, and Putin has pledged to send up to 2 million of those to die in a war.
There isn't going to be a Russia in 10 years.
China isn't faring much better, by 2050 their population is going to reduce by HALF.
There isn't going to a China anymore.
They don't have enough people left, neither of them, to innovate, because they don't have enough people left to hold their own shit together in the first place.
