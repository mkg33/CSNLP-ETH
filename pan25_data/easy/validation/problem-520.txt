Additional note for a bigger picture.
The Peruvian constitution of 93 does allow for the dissolve of the Congress.
HOWEVER the president must send a request to 2 cabinets, whose members were selected by congress, if Congress were to ignore or silence/censure the cabinets decision then and only then does the sitting president have power to close congress.
Upon the closure of Congress per the Constitution there would be another congressional election held at a maximum of 4 months since the closure.
What Castillo did is illegal per the constitution of Peru.
So yes he is no longer the president of Peru.
Another problem that many people have seen with the Peruvian Constitution of 93 is that it gives too much power to Congress.
Protest has erupted on both political sides, both political sides also want to close the Congress and have elections held for a new Congress.
Both political sides are fed up with Congress and their corruption and while some agree that Castillo did illegal Acts others disagree however both sides still want Congress to shut down and a new Congress to take over.
