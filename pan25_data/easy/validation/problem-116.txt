Cheers to you and your circle.
I work in an industry that's very global and have a lot of Russian friends and colleagues - I find them to be entirely against the war and opposed to Putin, as well.
But the ones who live and work inside of Russia have slowly stopped talking about it.
I'm assuming with people getting snatched off the streets and sent to the front there has been a chilling effect?
If you lived in that space all your life and didn't have any exposure to the outside world, I can imagine it would be easier to fall into the z favoritism.
Economically, yes.
Belarus and Russia have somewhat consistently relied on each other both politically and economically.
Belarus’ wealth comes largely from refining oil and sending it into the EU.
Sanctions bit and now both countries see an opportunity to merge economies, supposedly whilst holding onto Belarusian sovereignty.
The future will tell, but it’s likely that most big businesses in Belarus will be ‘absorbed’ rather than a loss of territory or movement into the Russian Federation.
A single currency might even begin, which would be wildly unpopular as most Belarusians save in dollars and consider the ruble on either side as unstable.
