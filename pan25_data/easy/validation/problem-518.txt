God finally people with brains.
SCOTUS is beyond repair and has been tampered with to ensure corporate profits/benefits no matter what.
People need to realize that this whole crisis in America is class warfare, the ruling class has hijacked the government and especially the courts to do their bidding.
There’s a reason they absolutely needed trump to win 2016, they knew that they could reshape the court for literal DECADES to come.
And before somebody says “what if the next Republican president goes against scotus” as if they wouldn’t already?
As if trump isn’t the prime example of a president doing everything in their power to break the law and not be fucking accountable.
He’s been impeached TWICE.
He STOLE CLASSIFIED documents and took them to his fortress where god knows who could access them for whatever nefarious purposes.
Let Biden go around the courts.
Who in the actual fuck is going to stop the head of the department of education (or whoever) ?
They didn’t stop Betsy Devos from being as corrupt as they come.
Let the courts enforce their ruling.
I’d love to see them fucking try.
