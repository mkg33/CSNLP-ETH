Democrats do need to be careful though not to overplay their hand in Arizona.
Everyone wants a progressive Democrat for this seat.
And the Democrats have done reasonably well in Arizona lately.
However, Arizona is NOT a far left state.
Kari Lake was only 17,000 votes short in the governor race.
If Sinema does run as an independent, I don't think anyone knows for sure how that's going to change the electorate.
Analysts seem to be all over the map.
Some say it will make little difference.
Others say it will be a mess.
And some say it will hand the seat the GOP.
No one knows.
If they nominate another crazy MAGAnut or Democrats boost the Republican MAGAnut then some Republicans would surely go for Independent Sinema.
Yep.
This entire stunt strikes me as Sinema trying to set it up so that she can run as an Independent, expecting to peel off even just a few points from Democrats and hand the election to republicans.
Really awful thing to do.
