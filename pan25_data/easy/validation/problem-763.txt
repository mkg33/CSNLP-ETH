What I want to emphasize is that every single person including myself I’ve talked to or opinions I’ve read online know the basics about the war and sympathize with the citizens of Yemen and criticize the US and foreign support of Saudi Arabia for their roll in the humanitarian crisis.
Oh no.
Not this shit again.
The Saudis are doing the exact same thing in Yemen that the Russians are doing in Ukraine.
In fact, the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen have been called a war crime by the UN and the US and allies who want the world to support Ukraine because of "morals" are also supplying weapons to the Saudis and buying oil from them.
1.
People do care about Yemen, just not either side who do the fighting.
They care about the civilians displaced and who have lost their lives.
The current situation is itself a product of American imperialism.
The CIA organized a coup to overthrow the popular government in Iran and, predictably, it fell to reactionary elements.
Should the US not have done that, and did not support the Saudis as they did, this war might not even have happened.
The US is simply incompetent at playing the game.
