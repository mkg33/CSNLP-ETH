If it ends up replacing local currency for most transactions (which if successful it probably will given the historical instability of much of South America) that will mean that the central banks of the participating countries will lose valuable tools to help manage their economy.
If one country enters a recession while the rest of the participating countries are still in their boom phase, the central bank(s) of the new currency will want to be increasing interest rates and slowing down how much currency is minted to reduce economic growth to prevent inflation from getting too high, which is the opposite of what you want to do during a recession and thus will make the recession of the one country much worse while the central bank(s) tries to bring the boom-bust cycle of the other countries in line with the currently busting country.
It means that lonerm, the participating countries will need to tie their economies together well, and as the Europe has demonstrated, it is difficult to keep economies connected if politics diverge and thus it will almost certainly necessitate a combined political system, i.e.
a Union state, which brings about its own host of problems.
Deflation, though, disincentivizes spending money.
If I know that my money will be worth more in the future than it is now, I have a strong incentive to put off purchasing or investing in whatever I can because I can get it relatively “cheaper” in the future.
