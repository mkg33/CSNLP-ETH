Not a coral reef for sure but the advantages of reefs include providing shelter for fish etc.
As "lifeless" as you suggest, there are fish in the Black Sea.
There's a commercial industry (although too aggressive, they have to shift to conservation it looks like).
Then why is there a commercial industry?
Turkey catches hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fish alone a year for instance.
Or what about the tens of thousands of dolphins (sadly being killed by Russia).
Your point I guess is they only catch below a certain depth?
Anybody organizing any serious discontent is immediately arrested.
Putin is a KGB man, so Putin knows how to keep the KGB working competently.
Hard to revolt without any organization.
Usually, on average?
Probably.
That said the Russian army doesn't pay that much attention to the retrieval of the wounded as was shown already in this conflict.
Also the Russian Army is in the process of literally falling apart.
There is barely anobody left with half a clue about combat.
At this stage the Ukrainians are often fighting clueless conscripts, who are abandoned by the commanding officers.
One accurate artillery barrage plus no faintest clue how to behave in such a situation can easily translate to a wholesale slaughter.
