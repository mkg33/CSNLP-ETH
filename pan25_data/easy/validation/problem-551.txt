Also, if you don’t think people using their toes to press buttons isn’t gross then let me walk on the handles of your fork and spoon with my sweaty feet that had been standing for hours in tsa and check in.
It’s the same method it transfer.
man i know (most of) y’all in the comments probably aren’t directing your ‘all of these people with their BS “emotional support” dogs suck’ comments at me, a person with an emotional support Cat that i do still have to pay pet fees for to travel on a plane with, but man i get so anxious about bringing my cat with me when i fly even though part of the reason i have him is because of how stressed out i get on planes—kinda defeats the purpose a little to have him as my ESA and then not get the emotional support from him when i need it lmao.
he cries a little for the first 15-20 minutes but then he’s calm…does it really bother people that much?
or is it just the fact that people who don’t NEED to travel with their pets are abusing the system that bothers you?
bc i already feel so bad about having my cat with me lmao.
