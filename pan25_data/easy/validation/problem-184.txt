About the only mitigating development relating to Moore vs Harper is the MI legislature flipped and the PA House flipped, so that's two fewer states (and a lot fewer electoral votes) for the GOP to work with in the short term.
And this was filed mostly to prevent state courts from overturning anything legislatures want to do re: elections and gerrymandering, and there aren't many places left where the state Supreme Court has a different makeup than the legislature.
(Including, sadly, the NC Supreme Court, although by flipping red, it might technically moot the entire reason this lawsuit was filed in the first place, although the SC hearing is set before the ousted Democrat justices leave the NC court.
).
I mean, multiparty systems aren't automatically better.
Most places with those systems end up with one or two dominant parties anyway.
The other parties tend to remain small minorities that influence policy only when they can swing a coalition.
I'm sick of Repubs and Dems too, but more parties isn't a magic wand.
