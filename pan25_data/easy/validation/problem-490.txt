Can we get stupid, unqualified people out of politics?
I know there are haters of the elite, but come on… being intelligent doesn’t mean you are an elite.
I would think most people would rather someone smart and quick witted to be in charge than a dunce.
What is wrong with being smart and educated?
For sure if I am on a ship in the middle of the ocean, going through a storm, I want the best qualified person at the helm.
It’s the sane way.
As voters, we have to temper our expectations and understand that it can't be all or nothing when trying to pass legislation, and the elected officials need to understand that this voting base is touchy, has very high expectations and standards, and needs to see them fighting every day.
Governing is a public service, not a cushy gig to ride out and scoop up books deals later.
It can take decades to win seats and months to lose them.
