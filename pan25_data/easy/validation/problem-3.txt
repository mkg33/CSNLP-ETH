In France it was a different story, a massive number of reactors were built giving an efficiency of production, leading France to have some of the cheapest electricity in the world, and certainly in Europe.
The cost per kWh of electricity in the UK is around $0.41 USD, and in Germany it's $0.53 USD.
Compare this to France which is $0.21 USD - nearly half the cost of UK, and 2.5 times lower than Germany, thanks to Nuclear!
Some "failure".
Goes to show that blindly advocating against nuclear and in favor of renewables is very very stupid especially when nuclear energy can have less environmental impact than renewables.
Europe isn't sunny or windy enough to rely on renewables (with the exception of Spain maybe), meaning they simply have no way of achieving energy security without nuclear.
PERIOD.
The Green Party is so fucking stupid.
They fucking forced Germany to shut off their Nuclear Power Plants and now they switched to old ass Coal Plants.
Yeah, thats fucking great for the Environment.
