Agreed with this.
Especially regarding McConnell.
I would never say he’s the smartest politician, but he is absolutely one of the most cunning, and “best” politicians.
Not best because I agree with his policies, he’s a piece of shit.
However, if he had a heart and compassion and wanted to help America, you’d absolutely love to have him in your corner.
I feel like this is where the split is going to come from.
The educated politicians who have the capability to see past their next move, will split from the idiots like boebert (if she even has a job) mtg etc.
Possibly.
It’ll depend on which wins out: his ego and resistance to looking weak by bending the knee to whoever does better than him, or his desire not to go to prison.
If he feels confident in his ability to delay consequences (which he probably feels very confident in because it’s worked for him for literal decades), then he might not endorse for a pardon.
I could see self-preservation winning out if he’s in dire straits legally by then.
Regardless of what happens it’s going to be a weird time!
