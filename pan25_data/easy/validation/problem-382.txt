There's very few people in the UK that think this way, they're 100% behind Ukraine.
There's still UKR flags flying, statues of Putin as a penis and everyone I speak to think Ukraine should be getting more, not less.

Government budgets are predetermined.
Even if they don’t give Ukraine anything, you won’t see a single pound going toward your heating from the defence budget.

You dont need milliona of shells to defeat some domestic terrorists, and china probably wont invade europe anytime soon.
Russia is the only enemy here that you realistically need to prepare for.
Now they will be used for the exact thing they were built for, blowing up some russians.
