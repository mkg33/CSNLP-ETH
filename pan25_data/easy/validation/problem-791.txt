There's also the fact that the local areas that host things like the Olympics or the World Cup are typically screwed over while these events are going on and for several years afterwards because they suddenly have massive stadiums and other facilities they may or may not be able to use yet still have to maintain.
Not to mention all the environmental damage that happens as a result of all this.
Exactly!
And gender neutral bathrooms in Sweden are mostly just a practical thing and have nothing to do with trans.
There has been a recent movement for making life easier or trans people which have made gender neutral bathrooms slightly more common (and I am certainly not opposed to that), but in most cases it just as to do with efficient use of space.
God.
I legit can’t believe a seedy goth nightclub is where I first encountered open/mixed bathrooms and it worked perfectly.
Urinals and some stalls on one side, all stalls on another, sinks on both sides, and it was all a big, connected horseshoe shaped room.
I present very femme and I’d walk in through the “men’s” side all the time and no one even batted an eye.
No one cared because we were all just trying to shit and piss.
Why is this such an issue for some people?
I’m all for gender neutral bathrooms and connected bathrooms and whatever else, because the vast majority of people aren’t going into the bathroom for nefarious means and when they’re connected there’s more people to look out for one another.
Plus, connected bathrooms mean everyone has access to fucking diaper changing stations.
