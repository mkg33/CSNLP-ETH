There's a noticeable difference between -30 and -40, both are cold but there's a certain bite at -40.
Used to live in northern Canada where it'd be -40 for about a week a year.
I recall taking the garbage to the curb, one trip from back to front of house and my hands had the burning feeling when warming up.
That never happened at -30 from such a short time outside, not that you'd want to be gloveless long at -30 either.
Same with the original Scandinavians, the Inuit, etc.
I mean WTF were they thinking?
Personally, I abhor the cold.
I spent 3 years living in southern Mexico without AC and that was right up my alley.
Spent a week in Estonia in October and nearly died.
That shit is for the birds.
All state-funded jobs - civil servants, teachers, cops, and back in the Soviet days before privatization even more jobs - have around a 50% base pay raise for wprking in these northern conditions, and that reflects on all local income levels.
It's the entire reason my parents moved here back in the 80's.
