As the article hints at, the IRS does not do a lot of actual auditing.
What it does is computer matching, which automatically generates material for a correspondence audit.
Most correspondence audits occur because som poor working Joe didn't know he/her was supposed to include or exclude something, and the IRS caught it in its matching.
Of course, the problem is that we have a complex code and little help in actually helping people through the various forms, rules, and so on.
But millionaires don't have these issues, so they can escape most of the traps that lead to a correspondence audit.
If a lot of these 87,000 were in taxpayer service (which I expect) it would lead to fewer audits at the low end, more robust audits for large corporations, wealthy individuals, and those who actively use tax avoidance strategies.
But of course that is not the dialogue that gets promoted when the 87,000 agents are discussed.
Exactly.
It's when someone misreports a number from their W2, didn't report 1099s they received, both separated parents claim a tax credit for the same kid, etc.
All stuff that's easily checked by a computer.
The IRS isn't "auditing" random low to middle income people.
That would be a complete waste of their time.
