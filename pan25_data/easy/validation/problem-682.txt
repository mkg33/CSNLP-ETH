We already have multiple defense arrangements with Sweden and Finland.
They have been included in joint military exercises, which means broad sharing and integrating capabilities and strategies.
If Sweden is attacked, the US will absolutely come to her aid.
The only thing that not being in NATO really means is that Sweden cannot invoke Article 5 and receive the "more powerful" pledge to help.
To the extent that would be "more powerful" is probably negligible.
It's just unfathomable that Sweden would be attacked and the EU would sit still.
Especially since the only non-nato state that is able to meaningfully attack Sweden is Finland, and the Finns would clearly have lost their minds and are attempting to be the Army of the Dead from Game of Thrones.
(lol).
Even worse, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - a Republican - is allowing an international fugitive and former dictator, Jair Bolsonaro, to stay indefinitely in Orlando.
The Republican Party in America increasingly supports fascist dictators.
