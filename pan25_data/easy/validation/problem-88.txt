How can someone eat pork or beef specifically to anger someone else?
Is this even possible?
Like, if you do it in front of their embassy, will it count as an offense?
But at a restaurant it would be ok?
I guess I don't get your example.
The irony of India entirely believing they're suddenly a world super power when their contributions to the world include shooting farmers on their own land, uncontrolled gang rapes, shit flowing through the streets, enabling Russians to kill Ukranians just for the ability to manufacture the world's worst rifle.
Despicable.
Not sure.
I have no reference for how their legal system handles such things.
Don't have a copy of what exact "permission" he actually received so can't comment on that.
Exactly.
When someone eats pork, they disrespect muslim religion.
Since they are free to eat pork, why they eat it shouldn't be any of our business.
So, just like muslims are not offended by someone who disrespect their religion by eating pork without asking any more questions, they shouldn't be offended if people break any other of its rules too.
Because in the end of the day, they are just rules of a religion.
