The first 200 or so are direct shipments from korea (initial deliveries have arrived already), and the rest would be license produced in Poland with technology transfer agreements in place.

Poland has been buying south korean K2s which offer some unique capabilities as well as other equipment.
Iraq and poland canâ€™t be compared due to massive differences in terrain, economy, alliances and country characteristics.
There are different strategies where tanks still play a key role esp in counteroffensives and russia still has some economy war demand production capability which would make them dangerous even if their soviet military doctrine is archaic and questionable at best.
So much more can be said on this.
As for the second part, it is not russians that killed nearly 20% of Poles during ww2, razed Warsaw to the ground (while speaking of Warsaw, Wola massacre is also not something that soviets did) or build all those 'fancy' concentration camps to gas people after forcing them into slave labour.
Your idea as to why supposedly it is russians who should pay is asinine to say the least.
