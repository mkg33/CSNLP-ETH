The US is already giving an insane amount of financial and military aid to Ukraine.
This particular defense system purchase is not part of US aid, it's part of Canadian aid.
It just happens to be purchased from the US.
Definitely.
The more NASMS and other systems they have the more area they can cover to protect.
The more coverage, the more they can do like have electricity, water, and heating.
Weapons production would be a good thing to protect as well for a belligerent.
Eventially, this makes Muscovy impotent in their war criminal ways.
I’m Canadian.
Our military is very under funded because we don’t need it, we don’t utilize the military, our military is very small.
And we don’t need it.
I have noticed it on numerous topics, from the London Olympic Committee warning Britons to refer to Americans as "Canadians" to avoid offending Canadians, to reminding Americans that Canada kicked their ass during the War of 1812, to believing that Canada created Thanksgiving (it was originally an English Medieval holiday, and Canada most likely borrowed it from early settlers from the US).
