Dr. Scott Stringfield, medical director of the Choices Medical Clinic located directly south of Trust Women’s Wichita clinic, made the comments at a recent March for Life rally at the state Capitol in Topeka, where abortion opponents celebrated the fall of Roe v. Wade and moved to regain their footing after a failed attempt to remove abortion rights from the Kansas Constitution in August with the Value Them Both amendment.
Stringfield called the 9/11 attack “a heinous act” but told March for Life attendees “you have to look at one thing.
They (the terrorists) were principled.
They were willing to die for what they believed in.”[...]“Some people who think they’re pro life, or consider themselves pro life, find themselves sticking a wet finger in the air to sometimes see which way the wind is going to blow before they make a decision,” Stringfield said.
“That’s called pragmatism.”[...]“I encourage you to always choose principle over pragmatism,” he said.
