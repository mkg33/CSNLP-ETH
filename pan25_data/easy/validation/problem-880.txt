That plot is in specific energy, for which here is no argument about hydrogen being a leader.
Density is a discussion of a variable as a function of volume.
Typically that of mass, thus the common mix up.
Hence why you burn it it all, Much like how modern cars will even store the gasoline that evaporates from the tank in a carbon filter and inject it back into the intake when running so that gasoline fumes don't make it into the atmosphere, and use O2 sensors to make sure the fuel/air mix is ideal, with a catalytic converter (and more O2 sensors after that) to make sure that any hydrocarbons that make it through the engine into the exhaust are fully combusted.
Almost right.
The idea that you can take a couple of hundred tonnes of metal and propel it to 900kmh while it holds itself up in the sky with airfoils and somehow expect there to be some magic future tech that will make it efficient and environmentally friendly is just wishful thinking.
Maybe one day when we invent some magical gravity manipulation device but not today or tomorrow.
