Exactly... Not even sugar, high fructose corn syrup which is even cheaper... they cut the sugar out with the new coke/classic coke scam decades ago It is water, artificial flavoring, corn syrup and aluminum.

It’s opportunism.
They see inflation news just like everyone else & get excited at the prospect of raising prices while they tell the public “look, it’s the government Everything’s more expensive, you can’t blame us”.

This is what sports books do in Vegas with betting lines on every game.
Opportunistic greed.
No one will hold them accountable for increasing prices past the rate of inflation, so they see zero downside to doing it, because corporations don't care about long-term goals or profits, they only care about short-term gains, as that's all the investor class truly cares about, and that's their customer base...not those shopping for groceries.

It’s time to break up the big food trust.
When the baby food shortage happened I thought for sure that alarm bells would have been raised.
Instead, the only major trust busing I’ve heard of recently is because some people were salty they couldn’t buy tay-tay tickets to scalp.
You know, don’t worry about those starving babies, the Ticketmaster line is too damn long!
