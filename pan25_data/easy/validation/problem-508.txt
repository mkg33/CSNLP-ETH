White slave owners in the south got rich from slave labor.
Whether that money passed down to any heirs post civil war today idk.
Maybe.
At the same time the South never really recovered economically from the civil war and has high rates of poverty, so maybe the money was lost.
Maybe the wealth gap is more about post 1920s discrimination in funding for schools, job opportunities, segregation, redlining, etc.
But so what?
How is it close to fair to take money from someone who did no wrong and give it to someone who suffered no personal harm.
The person living today has no personal experience of slavery.
By that logic, everyone should get reparations (from whom I canâ€™t imagine) because someone in their genetic past.
