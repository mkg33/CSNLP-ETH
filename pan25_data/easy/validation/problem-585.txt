Conservatives aren’t conservative, they just want their own brand of authoritarianism.
They talk about wanting limited government that stays out of everybody’s business, but they want the government involved in abortions, stopping people at the border, keeping people from receiving benefits, they want the largest military industrial complex on the planet with bases all over the world, they want Christianity in schools and government, they want to stop who can protest and where, the whole thing is just a farce.
Hmm, no.
Falling into that conservative trap of my experience blinds me to others' realities.
If it personally hasn't affected them or doesn't, then they don't care.
