I'm not really concerned about if someone in someone else's relationship has an affair.
It's not my business.
When someone starts campaigning for a powerful political office on the strenh of their Christian righteousness though, the fact that they're an adulterer is suddenly very relevant to my concerns.
I'll be concerned with this ex's hypocrisy when she runs a political campaign on an assumed platform of Christian righteousness.
Please wake me up when that happens.
Sen. Raphael Warnock’s victory in Georgia’s runoff held special significance for one group: women who had romantic relationships with opponent Herschel Walker and came forward with their stories of secret children, abortions, and abusive behavior.
I mean, yeah.
But does anyone else find it odd that we're supposed to be taking political advice from these women who willingly carried on extramarital affairs with the guy?
