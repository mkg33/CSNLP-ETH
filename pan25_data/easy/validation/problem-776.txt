I’ll be honest.
This past year I’ve been borderline depressed over whether or not we were witnessing the United States’ democracy unravel in real time.
While most of these races were/are wayyyy too close, at least I can sleep a little easier knowing that most of the country believes in democracy instead of not.
Man this news feels good!
Fuck every conservative.
John McCain warned them all before his death.
They happily turned on McCain who was probably the last conservative patriot.
