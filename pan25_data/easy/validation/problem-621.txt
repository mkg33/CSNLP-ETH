Article I read today said that there would be a period after being purchased that they would dismantle sensitive communication devices and other hardware.
So it's already being thought of.
After the invasion immediately enforced stronger sanctions across all our allies preventing Russia from importing required goods to build the weapons they needed, imposed export sanctions to prevent them from funding the war, and sent massive humanitarian aid packages.
It's been something of a ramp up, yes, but no circles were spun.
We were already giving them aid before the invasion, and we started giving more immediately after.
2600 Javelin missiles (among a lot of other things) is no joke and were crucial early on.
Very promising.
Poland has 250 Abrams set to be delivered in 2024, they should be a key ally in the training process.
Better than that, it frees up the Leopard 2.
Our Abrams could see action in 6-8 months, but there are a dozen countries that could put 150+ Leopard 2 tanks in theatre by early summer.
Give Ukraine whatever they need!
