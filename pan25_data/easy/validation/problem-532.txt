India and China both are trying not to engage in this war.
Both of these countries are taking benefit from this war.
Actually that is a pretty smart move.
That is incorrect for Germany, to the extent that Germany doesn't even have a constitution but a Grundgesetz (Basic Law), which was drafted by the Parlamentarischer Rat (Parlament Council) in Bonn in 1949, made up of German politicians, which was summoned by the Ministerpräsidenten (Heads of Federal States) after being asked to do so by Allies.
yeah...
I get the feeling that a lot of what happens in East Asia is some kind of reactionary escalation which is somewhat depressing because it doesn't really solve anything except save face for politicians.
I heard somewhere that the Chinese weather balloon thing derailed a visit from Washinon to China which definitely didn't help attempts at reconciliation.
I don't think I'm that well informed on the matter either though.
Absolutely this.
We cancel that much debt and our debt rating instantly goes lower than countries like Pakistan, El Salvador, Argentina, and Ethiopia.
That strategy doesn't seem to work.
Germany highlights much more 'enlightened' concepts such as human dignity, the responsibility that comes from ownership, and focuses more on bureaucratic structures (judges are hired based on their qualifications, civil servants are there for lifetime and unelected), power is much more distributed (every power comes from the Bundestag, the parlament), there is no executive decision making (for example no executive orders) and no president (besides the Grüßaugust that farts around Schloß Bellevue).
Federalism is very strong and with exclusive rights in many areas, and ankered into the 'constitution' for eternity (Ewigkeitsklausel).
The whole government is set up much more to enable slow, collaborative decision making.
