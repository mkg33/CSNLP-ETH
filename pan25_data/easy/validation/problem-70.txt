Medicare is only 80% insurance.
Many people on Medicare still go bankrupt paying for their health care.
Say you fall and have to go to the ER.
That can easily be a $30,000 visit.
If you only have Medicare, that's a $6,000 bill for you.
That's why it's crucial for people on Medicare to pay for private co-insurance to cover that gap.
Even with that, things like ambulances aren't fully covered.
So just the ride to the ER will cost $1,000 out of pocket after whatever coverage you do have has taken care of the rest.
Ambulances are expensive.
Even a short ride can be $6,000.
Idaho isn't trying to move anyone away from National Healthcare - the health insurance corporations are because they're earning trillions annually on this current system: "Health industries' spending on federal lobbying rose 70% from 2000 to 2020, largely driven by drug and device makers and activities surrounding the Affordable Care Act.
The industry as a whole spent $713.6 million lobbying federal policymakers in 2020.

That's a rationalization.
Or more so, an excuse.
Since the amount of student debt the indebted doctors had was much less than what they make in a year.
So that debt should have been paid off in short order.
Then what's the excuse for these debt free doctors to continue to have such extravagant salaries?
