The stories they tell about my however many greats grandfather are almost completely, if not entirely, made up.
Truth is, or at least as close to the truth as I've managed to dig, after the war he said that they could continue to live in on his property and continue on basically business as usual except he paid them a pittance so they were forced to continue working for him or be homeless.
From what I can gather he was an evil man.
The stories I've managed to dig up about him talk more about an abusive husband and father than a benevolent farmer.
My grandmother has let slip that her mother told her it wasn't unusual for him to pull out a whip on his kids so I can't imagine the slaves working the field were treated any better.
I've heard the stories about how he supposedly gave them each a house, a plot of land to farm for themselves, taught them to read, and of course only beat them if they "deserved it for stealing and such" and how "it was a mercy" compared to how some slaves were treated.
He went to war and fought against his cousins to protect that farm and when the slaves were freed he just hired them on and for years after their families and my family were just the best of friends.
