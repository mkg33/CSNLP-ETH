They didn't.
It was filibustered by Republicans because it couldn't pass the 60 vote threshold.
Instead of letting it all die, they passed a modified version with a 24% raise and the ability to take time off for medical appointments without being penalized.
Your argument is the same garbage peddled during the Obamacare debates like Democrats are at fault for Republicans being shitty.
That’s disingenuous.
House Democrats put forth a bill to give them paid sick leave.
Passed it.
Republican senators refused to sign on.
Stop “both side!s” When the majority of demarcates voted for it and republicans killed it.
FFS.
Constructive criticism would be identifying that the bill that did pass had a 24% raise, provides for the ability to take time off for medical appointments without being penalized, and is supported by 8/12 unions representing 48% of rail workers (almost half, but, yes, not the "majority"), and then addressing the issue that maybe it was a strategic mistake to run the bills concurrently while identifying that that strategy runs some super high risks as well.
If they went with an all-or-nothing bill only to start and a huge swath of holiday shopping shipping and supply ground to a halt, what do you think would be on the news 24/7 for this entire month?
