Socio-economic strife.
The controversies you mentioned are just culture war focal points used to vent a general realization that the neo-Liberal freedom and prosperity promised through the policies of the 80s and 90s was a lie.
Obama swept to office promising to change the way the system worked, but instead became a figurehead for the very system that failed so many.
People lost their houses and their livelihoods at the end of the Bush adminsitration and Obama didn't reallllllly do anything to fix the systemic issues that destroyed the housing and job markets.
Flash forward to 2016 and your choice was the status quo (that only let you barely subsist within it) or gamble on Trump and a hope that he'd fuck enough things up that some positive change would have to occur.
The 2020 election a correction to realizing that status quo was slightly better than the chaos Trump brought, but people are still barely surviving out there and something drastic needs to change.
