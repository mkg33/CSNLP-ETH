I'm glad a little bit of the money is going to the CRIT but some of this seems pretty sketchy honestly.
In the bill they're basically just selling their rights to the Arizona cities to bail them out of their water crisis which to me seems like they're just moving numbers around on paper.
if the fundamental problem is we're overdrawing out of Lake Mead and those acre feet don't actually exist I don't see how this helps.
It's also weird they can't send it to the other reservations that seems like a weird structural thing to put in place.
Why can they sell it to Tucson but they can't sell it to Kayenta?
That's seems super fucked up.

Absolutely this.
Arizona has had permanent early voting registration for many years.
You don’t need special qualifications to get it other than to be a legitimate voter.
They send you your ballot along with the state run “clean elections” write up/voter guide where each candidate write about themselves and why you should vote for them.
You can take your time researching.
It’s fantastic.
