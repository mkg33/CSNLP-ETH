I agree in principal, but I don't know how well it would have worked.
As I recall there were talks of invoking the 25th amendment, but they needed enough buy-in, and I think there were questions about if the 25th amendment could legally or reasonably be invoked, and what benefit invoking it would offer.
TLDR: I don't think there is a single chance in hell that invoking the 25th amendment would have worked, and trying to invoke it outside of it's intended purpose could have been potentially problematic as well (sort like John Eastman and co trying to push fake electors, thinking they could manipulate and misinterpret the verbiage in the law to make a legal argument of misusing a law).
