So a non-naturalised Turkish national in Germany would vote for the Turkish presidency (and possibly parliaments if they have expat constituencies) but would vote for a German mayor.
oh what?
Seriously?
THIS is the direction of the topic?
In Thailand Russians fight with Russians about Ukraine topic cause they can't do it within a country.
I already know a story how guy literally got beaten for asking arrogant russians to not contact him as clients.
Just focus on your laws being executed, that will bring more value then banning all people based on their passport, who might be seeking shelter from their "home country".
You misunderstood.
They were talking about people voting in a country they are a citizen of but don't live in for a short time.
“German authorities had been investigating Prokhorova, who reportedly entered the country illegally, for glorifying Russian aggression and harassing Ukrainians.”.
For example if I lived in the US but took part in a 2 year program in Britain, I should still be able to vote in the US since I intend to return.
