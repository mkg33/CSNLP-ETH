Thier silent on one game?
It means shit as far as i can see.
The player are the IRGC'S team, is what people are saying.
That's why everyone is happy and choosing this as a means to come out in the streets even more.
Man, it's chaos here, everyone honking their cars, yelling everywhere, a big sound, almost like an explosion/shots being fired, every now and then.
I'm telling you, not even new year eve celebration has this much noise in here.
Depends, its an instant red if the last defender fouls an attacker as they are going to goal, but reds are also given for fouls that are blatant fouls (where it’s obvious that the defender is aiming to foul rather than go for the ball) it ultimately falls to the refs decision on the later, but most refs would give a red in that position as pulling his shirt was in no way going for the ball while stopping a breakaway.
I’d wager around 6-7/10 refs would show a red there.
Iranian here.
I dont give a shit about football.
But never have i ever been happier about IRGC's team losing.
Literally every one in tehran are out in the streets celebrating now and it's almost 1:30 in the morning!
