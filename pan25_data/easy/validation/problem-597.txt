I still feel like calling someone for an occupation they had 15 years ago to be kinda chilidish.
15 years is a long time, and plenty of people have had life changing career moves within that.
15 years ago I worked as a dishwasher at pizza hut.
No ones ever called me pizza hut dishwasher before.

Why not just criticise what he does in office?
There's plenty that's actually worth criticising.
A job he had 15 years ago?
Who cares.

I'm pretty liberal but trudeau has absolutely destroyed any notion that he is.
With scandals after scandals and nonsense legislation one after another...I wont be voting for liberals again until they find a true sensible identity, not whatever the fuck is going on now.
