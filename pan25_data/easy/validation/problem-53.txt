In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Factually incorrect.
Back in the 1930s, you could mail order machine guns straight to your house for only a couple hundred dollars.

This would disproportionately affect minorities and marginalized communities who need the protection most, and claiming otherwise is dismissing the lingering and very real effects of racist systems persisting in our society.
Sure I'll give it my best shot.
They assumed we'd protect our children using guns.
Unfortunately there's an unconstitutional federal law which prohibits firearms on school grounds for your average peaceable citizen.
We protect our money with guns, we protect politicians with guns, hell even the rich have their own armed security.
Why on earth do we try so hard to ensure the longest response possible?
There is no tradition at the time of ratification of 2A that prohibited arms in schools.
"The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature.
