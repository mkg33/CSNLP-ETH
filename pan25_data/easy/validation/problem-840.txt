also, to point out just another user scenario: I drive.
Got a car 3 years ago for my job (I know; bad timing!).
I use my car a fair amount, but there are lots of times I'd prefer to use public transit but don't because a) I may not have enough money, or b) I may not have the necessary equipment (e.g.
specialized transit cards) and getting it for one short trip would be a hassle.
(not to mention transit systems that require multiple passes for different transit modes and lines.
).
Nope, they hurt consumers massively, raising prices at the end user point, particularly on any food that isnt specifically subsidized, by raising the opportunity cost of growing anything other than corn, wheat, soya, rice, cotton, sugar, or molasses.
Not to mention agricultural tariffs.
If we removed all agricultiral subsidies and tariffs, rhe average comsuler would see their grocery bill drop by about 7%.
Plus, all these welfare sucking incompetant farmers who cant manage to actually competenin the free market would have to get real jons instead of sucking at the taxpayer teat.
