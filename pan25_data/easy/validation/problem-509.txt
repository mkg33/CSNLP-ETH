It’s literally free education and free money paid for by the government.
(They get a living stipend too!)
From that perspective you can see why China is really really serious about the guarantor and commitments.
They did it in the most possibly dictatorial way but It’s a big investment from the Chinese government and they expect the student to return to China to probably boost their healthcare workforce.
No.
The CSC program funds Chinese students to pursue PhD degrees outside China for 3/4 years.
These Chinese students do not have to pay the money back if they work in China for 2 years after graduation.
But Chinese students can also choose to return the funding they have received and pay 30% breach penalty to exempt from returning to China.
In this sense, the CSC program can be seen as a student loan.
Therefore, when someone is applying for a CSC program, they need a relative as a guarantor so that when they decide to not pay for the loan, the government can take tax payer's money back just like a bank taking the collateral back.
