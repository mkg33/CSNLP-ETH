Like, I donâ€™t even get the strategy.
What votes do they gain by going against this so aggressively??

For the next 2 years Democrats should be highlighting the fact that radical rightwing judges have taken over the courts and are making these decisions that rewrite the laws and throw out all legal precedence to hurt Americans and protect the very wealthy.
It's not just about Roe v Wade.
It's about student loan forgiveness, dismantling federal agencies on consumer and environmental protection, special interest money in politics, voting rights, separation of church and state, among many other issues.
Reversing that won't be quick but it requires Democrats maintaining the presidency and Senate.
If Democrats hold the Senate as is looking likely now, they'll be able to confirm more good judges and hopefully one or more Supreme Court justices.
Biden's had a good start on this but there are still so many hacks that make rulings like today's and end up in a 6-3 rightwing activist court.
