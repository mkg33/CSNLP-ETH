Edit: Honestly the real kicker is Belarus.
I really, really want NATO to stage some pretty huge exercises that keep getting extended to parallel Russia's bogus exercises before the war, on Belarus' northern border or something.
Keep Belarus and Russia guessing--if Russia commits their Belarus manpower to an invasion from the north, Russia will have no way to respond to an invasion of Belarus to depose Lukashenko.
And it's a much safer bet that DEFCON won't be raised if NATO only declares war on Belarus.
It would reveal NATO's hand, but then again, the whole point is threatening so that Belarus won't join the war or be a launchpad for another front.
But I've said this years ago many times to many downvotes; I sincerely doubt Russia would use nukes even if it goes to war with NATO, and same for NATO.
The only situation where nukes may actually start dropping is when NATO forces approach Moscow or St. Petersburg, and that's as tactical nukes.
Which yes, means nuking themselves.
A nationalist government could theoretically keep itself isolated and self-sufficient, not bothering anyone outside its self-imposed bubble.
They would be poorer for it and people would suffer, but at least there would be no war.
