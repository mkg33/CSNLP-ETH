I swear it's part of the reason people flinch in the west when they hear the word communism.
It's great that under communism we blame policy failures of autocrats on the ideology.
But under capitalism we blame policy failures of our governments on the politicians.
That way autocratic capitalist states don't harm capitalisms image, and "democratic" states can maintain the illusion of democracy and capitalism not being fundamentally opposed.
