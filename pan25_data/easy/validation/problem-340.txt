I don't mind compulsory military service, in Greece it's also one year.
What I do mind is when you spend 97% of your time doing jack shit and 3% of your time actually training and whatnot.
I'd rather have 4 months of more intense military boot camp than a year of looking at the ceiling and considering moving to the Netherlands.
School-stationed military officer.
Kind of like an extra step above your usual dean in terms of intimidation factor.
Though in actuality the dean was usually the one dragging problem students by the neck into staff offices for disciplinary actions as opposed to the officers.
Guess the uniforms are intimidating enough as a deterrent.
The officers are also responsible for leading courses on military training stuff.
I was in a junior high school that shared a campus with a senior high and occasionally you’d see senior high students training with formation, how to hold or aim a dummy rifle and stuff.
Iirc it’s mandatory military training once a week for senior high students.
