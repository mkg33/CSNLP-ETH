As a sober alcoholic, I will say that attempting to stop a few times never killed me (obviously) but I would not want to be in public during withdrawals.
The shakes, the insane anxiety, the cold sweats...
The anxiety alone will make you look like you've lost your mind.
The drop of a pin could scare the shit out of you.
Feels like "dignity" and "decorum" haven't really done much for the world of politics in any way, shape or form to me, and are mainly just an egregious focus on style over substance, generally weaponized to bring down political opponents (while also simultaneously ignoring the absolutely horrid actions, words, and ideologies that people manage to spread simply because they remain "dignified"), but idk.

I was more appalled by her so called friends who recorded the video, because if you record it, it will leak.
It's how videos and pictures work.
We already knew that these things will get spun in a bad way by tabloids, and so her friends should have known that too, after the previous similar (non-)events.
I don't know how many people really considered that a scandal, but at least some did.
Of the people I've personally spoken to, none did.
