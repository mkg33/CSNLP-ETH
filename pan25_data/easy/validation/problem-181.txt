The funny part is that Volodymyr is just a weirder transliteration, it's still rooted in the exact same name, so really we have two Vlads fighting each other.
One's the idiot and one's the hero.
How do 21 active B-2 and a small fleet of B-21 bombers that won’t be active until 2027 in any way entirely negate an arsenal of thousands of nuclear weapons spread across Russia’s nuclear triad in hundreds of locations including submarines, bombers spread over different airfields thousands of miles apart, mobile launchers spread over a whole continent, etc.?
The whole point of mutually assured destruction (which is in force today just as it has been for over half a century) is that even if Russia’s conventional military strenh is tiny compared to that of NATO, there is no way that Russia could be destroyed or overpowered that would not spell pretty much the immediate end of mankind, that part had not changed, and that is precisely why Putin embarked on this war in the first place - he knows there is no way he could lose completely that would not mean the end of the world, and he is betting on this very fact.
