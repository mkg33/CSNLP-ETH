I don’t have orthostatic hypotension (though people who have OH can absolutely have compensatory tachycardia as it’s a common response to a sudden drop in BP).
My blood pressure actually increases when I stand.
When my brain senses the lack of blood (and if I’m dehydrated and/or otherwise having trouble with hypovolemia), my body tries to compensate by releasing lots of norepinephrine, which is a hyperadrenergic response.
Meh.
I was doing an oil stain and the grain absorbed it inconsistently and became a blotchy mess.
I’ve got it resanded to 220 grit and am going to try two test spots.
One with a tea stain to open the grain and one with wood conditioner.
Hopefully one will take nicely - if not, paint it is!
So Twitter, I don't know what the situation is anymore, but it's looking to be a slow work day for me so I might try and at least delete as many of my reading list and from my account as possible, mostly retweets and such over the last few years, and I'm starting to wonder if I need to make PDFs of every single one fo the 50,000 or so I have found to have.
Like if it's a whole library and only having a U-Haul truck, it feels ink sometimes.
