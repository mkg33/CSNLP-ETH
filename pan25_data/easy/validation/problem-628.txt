There's something needs to happen, we need a member of the press to ask Hershel Walker if he supports Donald Trump running for president before the Georgia Runoff.
The most likely scenario here is that Walker will refuse to answer and that could really harm him with the MAGA crowd.
If he says yes it will fuck him with the Establishment GOP and Centrist crowd.
This could be a good way to sink his chances.
