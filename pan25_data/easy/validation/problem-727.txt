The US is the only player that has little-to-no economic or political relationship with Azerbaijan (compared to the EU and Russia).
They have the power to stop this but this can change depending on the next administration.
The Biden administration (and his State Department) has been the most proactive in recent history regarding this issue.
The US (under Biden) has been willing to call out Azerbaijan for numerous violations and even helped stop the September 2022 Azeri invasion into Armenia proper.
Nancy Pelosi even visited Armenia back in September and met with the PM and other high-ranking officials in the country.
However this can drastically change if a different administration takes over in 2 years; especially a Trump administration, who not only has business ties with both (as exposed in his tax returns) Turkey and Azerbaijan, but also holds an isolationist "America first" policy.
It's not really about skin colour.
Uyghurs are enormously popular as victims and they are non-white Muslims.
Exactly.
This entire issue/war is a direct result of Joseph Stalin.
He's the person solely responsible for placing Nagorno-Karabakh into Soviet Azerbaijan despite the overwhelming majority of it being Armenian (not to mention the historical ties).
They've had on-off conflict for about a century now.
Longest era of peacetime was when they were both in the USSR, weirdly enough.
But at the same time, the USSR drew their borders to cause tensions.
