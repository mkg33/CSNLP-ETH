It's depressingly predictable that you and everyone else on this thread thinks that, because you've been told Iran is enriching uranium and that's scary.
Uranium enrichment is standard in energy production, and Iran is one of the few countries that doesn't do it.
It has a single reactor powering the country, and it's kept in the dark ages because Israel demands total strategic dominance, using a large nuclear arsenal that isn't bound by arms treaties, because it is illegal, and has never officially existed.
Also, Israel recently bombed Iranian aid to Turkey, made air strikes on earthquake-stricken Syria, and stole an ancient artefact from the Turks while there for 'disaster relief'.
If you swallow their narrative, more fool you.
Literally every country aspires to expansionary objectives because it provides for enhanced security.
Because every country wants to rule the world, at some point the US helped undermine Iran’s democracy and install a puppet leader, the Shah, who would sell Iran’s oil and gas assets to Western companies and would stop auditing them.
