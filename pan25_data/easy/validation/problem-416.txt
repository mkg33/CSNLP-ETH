Even if they checked the calendar, it probably would have been checked by a young American, or by some programmer in India, and it's likely neither would have understood what Kristallnacht was and how it's not an event that is typically "celebrated.
".
Unfortunately when renaming traumatic events, there is the good chance you’d lose the historical association and world recognition.
I’m 72 and still remember learning in high school about Kristallnacht, I can’t say that in America we would understand the German language enough to associate the new name.
I think we remember it so vividly because of the irony of the name with the horrific events that occurred that night.
That actually sounds reasonably believable.
More so (at least to me) than the notion that someone sat down, thought this through and decided it was a good idea.
Americans aren’t completely ignorant of history.
The Holocaust is a topic that gets covered.
I expect more Americans know about Kristallnacht than about the Battle of the Bulge.
