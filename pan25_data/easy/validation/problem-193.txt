If you are reading this musk, I challenge you to a fistfight.
I will kick you in the nuts.
Repeatedly.
I don't know anyone who uses Twitter.
I mean, I'm sure I do, but I don't use Twitter and there's nobody that I keep up with that I'd require Twitter to keep up with.
All this stuff is so humorous to me.
I've been watching this in small scale at multiple Universities as presidents who can't take any criticism freak out, try to get rid of departments, try to throw out students for not liking them and posting about them on facebook (seriously), stomp their feet, get rid of cheap but useful programs, all to drag the school so far into the toilet that we'll never get out and it is getting old.
Watching it on large scale with Twitter is in many ways an even bigger wtf.
Employees have tried to stop it where I've worked but to no avail as even a vote of no confidence doesn't get the state to remove these power hungry mini-trump psychofants from destroying the institutions we work for.
Why is this foot stomping tolerated?
