So I pushed hard when I was young to Read lots of books and although I was a solid C-grade student (mostly because I didn't like school).. my curiosity and passion to explore and read books and etc was almost insatiable.
(this was back in the time Parents would get door-to-door salesmen selling Encyclopedia sets.. which we bought.
I would spend hours just laying on the living room floor flipping through the Encyclopedia or Dictionary.
(or old newspapers or old National Geographic, etc).
Right?
And what happened to “parents should have the last word” on what their kids learn which was the reason these kinds of people gave re: the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.
Suddenly parents are teaching the wrong thing if they aren’t teaching their kids to be bigots.
Hateful shitstains, all of them.
