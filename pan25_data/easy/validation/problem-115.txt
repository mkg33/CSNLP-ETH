There is absolutely no evidence of puberty blockers as 'potentially dangerous' for transgender kids, to be clear.
Trans teens on puberty blockers are regularly monitored by doctors, not thrown out into the forest if they start experiencing any side effects - and the side effects can often be relieved by additional treatments, like calcium supplements for bone density concerns.
That wasn't the argument that I was making.
I was very specifically talking about puberty blockers for the purposes of advancing growth of bones.
I have to admit that I was not aware of the calcium supplements for people taking puberty blockers for transition.
Thank you for letting me know that the doctors are taking responsible steps.
Children, women, minorities, LGBTQ+ persons, etc.
are usually the rope in a political tug of war (and that applies to when either side uses them for polling points).
