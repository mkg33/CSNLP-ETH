The more interesting thing is that Twitter appears to be completely on making redundancies.
This will potentially open them up to individual challenges of unfair dismissal which could prove expensive - there has obviously been no consultation process which should begin 30 days before the first redundancy is confirmed.
Lol.
An international company that doesn’t need offices in other companies That’s rich Bet he doesn’t need lawyers in other countries either for his international company either!
Yes.
If you look at their overhead, its atrocious.
I feel for the employees but Twitter was unsustainable if they kept going the way they were.
Twitter should be a cash cow if managed properly.
Exactly.
Why is this hard for people to understand?
Companies lay people off all the time.
They have every right to revoke access to offices and computers.
They just don't have the right to skirt local labor laws about payment and severence, and they almost always follow those laws because violating labor laws is a BFD in most places.
