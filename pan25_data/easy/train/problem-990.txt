There was another article stating that the Kremlin called Ukraine's attack on their airbase a "terrorist attack", which only brings up the question of "if Ukraine defending itself against a hostile country is considered a terrorist action, then what do we categorize the Russian invasion as?"...
smh.
For the third time, a formal declaration of war is irrelevant, as the Genova Convention applies to any international conflict.
1) The Genova Convention is intentionally broad as to when it is to be applied, as such it applies to all international conflicts, a formal declaration of war is not needed.
3) The first Gulf War is hardly the first conflict that started without a formal declaration of war since the Genova Convention was adopted for the most part in 1929.
The Soviet invasion of Finland started without a declaration of war back in 1939.
Or Maybe the Soviet invasion of Poland earlier that year, there was no formal declaration of war for that one either.
Bad analogy.
Israel obviously dominates over the Palestinians under its control and actively steals their land via illegal settlement expansion.
Palestine has no capacity to represent an existential threat to the Jewish Israeli state like Russia poses to Ukraine.
