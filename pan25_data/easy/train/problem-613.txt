Well they did tell a Russian warship to F itself after being bombed with missiles, knowing they only had grenades and rifles..
I did explain you they did tell a Russian warship to F itself after being bombed with missiles, knowing they only had grenades and rifles.. knowing and having been threatened with bombing.
I did, when i told you they did tell a Russian warship to F itself after being bombed with missiles, knowing they only had grenades and rifles.. knowing and having been threatened with bombing.
Or are you willing to emphasise on them surrendering, while leaving out the part where they tell a Russian warship to F itself after being bombed with missiles knowing they only had grenades and rifles, for a different agenda?

Propaganda: information, ideas, opinions, or images, often only giving one part of an argument, that are broadcast, published, or in some other way spread with the intention of influencing people's opinions.
tell me why I'm sus.
please make it make sense for me how you can surrender without a fight.
but still be a hero for not surrendering.
Exactly.
I think the nuance a lot of people can't handle is that the truth isn't always right for every situation.
Sometimes a little lie for the right reasons is a good thing.
