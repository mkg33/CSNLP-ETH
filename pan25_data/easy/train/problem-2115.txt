After the civil war Virginia and many other states banned the public carrying of weapons by civilians.
And a few banned the ownership and possession of pistols and revolvers altogether.
People forget (or never learned) that for 200 years prior to Scalia's upending 2A with Heller and McDonald, states enjoyed wide constitutional authority to enact their own firearm restrictions.
There is a long history of gun ownership, there's also a long history of state-level restrictions on firearms, including bans on certain types of firearms and prohibitions on public carrying of weapons in cities and towns.
It's only within the last 15 years that a corrupt right wing majority decided to reinterpret 2A to confer an individual right to possess firearms for self defense.
Absolute bullshit.
Homicide rates declined globally during that period due to many factors... just because the expiring ban didn't offset those gains proves nothing.
Mass shootings precipitously increased since the ban expired... that says much more.
And what backlash... some gun nuts were upset?
lol I think the backlash you witnessed was mostly in your circles.
