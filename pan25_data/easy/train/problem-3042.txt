I think the "new solutions" for infrastructure attacks is Turkish power power plant ships that will be docked in ports and provide electricity to Ukraine.
Turkey has a bunch of them and has already said they will send one.
Obviously Russia won't attack a NATO ship.

Yes and no.
You can earn a bunch from captured hardware such as potential limitations or vulnerabilities.
But at the end of the day, you still need the ability to create something to exploit those weaknesses.
Completely agree.
Strategic bombing has been widely debated in regard to its efficacy.
The British didn't give up when the Germans were blitzing London.
Neither did the Germans when the Allies firebombed German cities.
Neither did the Polish when the Germans razed their cities to the ground.
The one "exception" in recent times is the Japanese with the atomic bombings, but I don't count that because it was such a shock to not only the citizens of Japan but to the world as a whole that a weapon so destructive could exist - and also because if it was employed again today, there wouldn't be much stuff left to "strategically bomb" since the world would be glassed.
