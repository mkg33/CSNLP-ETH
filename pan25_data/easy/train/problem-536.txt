I cannot wrap my head around why people would go through all the risk and trouble to do shit like this for adversaries of the US.
Money is nice sure, but that seems like way more trouble and effort than it's worth.
Either way, have fun in the brig asshat.
Remember.
When your soldiers are getting slaughtered by tactics straight out of YOUR playbook .
Uncle Sam really didn't give a $/+ before, could've done something.
"The foreign earned income exclusion mitigates double taxation on income from work, but the Internal Revenue Code treats ordinary foreign savings plans held by residents of foreign countries as if they were offshore tax avoidance instruments and requires extensive asset reporting, resulting in significant costs for Americans at all income levels to comply with filing requirements even when they owe no tax".
Yup yup yup.
I personally know a rich white American who fucked off to Asia and renounced his citizenship for this very reason.
His kids, though, still go to college in the US, and his investments and entities in America still benefit from Federal oversight and protection (and are subject to much less in taxes, since our tax code treats so much as pass-thru to personal income).
So he and his family enjoy the benefits of a robust economy and a stable government without having to pay for its protection and maintenance.
I'm sorry.
But this is very very much treachery.
The amount of former commanders.trainers , and veterans that turncoat for money is insane.
And who they are working for is more horrible.
