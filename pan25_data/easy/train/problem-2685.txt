Nearly every press release, news story, etc make the reference.
The presidency is not a committee.

Inappropriate?
That's laughable.
I've found multiple examples of every administration being referred to or speaking as a unified admin(T-P, O-B, B-C).
I think with the current political situation Biden and Harris are in lockstep and present as a unified team.
Cry about it?
