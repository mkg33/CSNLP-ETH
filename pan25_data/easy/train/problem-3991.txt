It is so wild seeing the pro Kate brown pro Ted wheeler defund the police crowd vote to give cops the authority to approve or deny gun rights for every individual.
What could possibly go wrong.
A common theme I hear from Portlanders is that the cops are basically white supremacist slave patrols.
Yeah let‚Äôs let them choose who can and can‚Äôt exercise 2A rights.
Doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
National abortion bans, punishing corporations who disagree with them, anti trans rhetoric using the force of government, anti trade, anti states rights (see California trying to make their own digital privacy laws), kangaroo court forcing my money into religious schools, ISL to remove state judicial oversight, anti second amendment(republicans want stop and frisk back), NSA.. etc.
Oh?
I‚Äôm all for BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ people being armed.
My point is that, if the group notorious for speaking out against any gun reform remains silent, then you can be sure the bigotry is a feature; not a bug ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
