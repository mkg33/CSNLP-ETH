Oh and another good one is when they say "you're more likely to hurt yourself with a gun".
I get it that saying "I'm built different" is snarky, but not being a fucking moron and not being needlessly violent is actually incredibly simple.
Honestly, even though I sleep with a gun by my bedside every night, my firearms are one of the most controllable risk factors in my daily life.
I'm more likely to get killed or mauled in a way so horrible I'd ask for death at work with the heavy equipment strewn about.
I could do everything right at work and still get killed Monday because someone launched a chuck key using a lathe.
suicides?
Why is it your concern if people check out on their own schedule?
Some people have horrific illnesses, etc.
Yup!
Generally not dangerous unless they’re worried about their cubs / just woken up from hibernation.
Polar bears are different beasts, but bear guns tend to have 1 LOUD round and then several shooty rounds.
If you’re going into that 3rd round, you’re likely dinner so ….
