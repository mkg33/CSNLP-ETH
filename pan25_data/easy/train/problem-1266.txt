At the time of the Stan-Israeli war of 48 Palestine didn’t exist, it was a geographic expression rather than an internationally recognized state, sort of like Appalachia in the US.
The offensive against Israel was from the Arab states of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.
The Palestinians were stuck between the clashing armies, not active participants.
Israel did not “leave” Gaza, they dismantled the settlements that were there and that was it, the Palestinians never had control of their own border crossings, or the sue and water space around Gaza, and Israel continued to and still continued to act with impunity there.
Nor was the dismantlement of settlements a gesture toward peace, Ariel Sharon was very open that the reasons for it were self serving-to relocate settlers within Israel proper to shore up the Jewish population and to strenhen the claim to settlements in the West Bank.
Try reading an actual history book.
Seriosuly this isn't a mind blowing geoplitical analysis.
Just don't build a small box over a big problem.
The Palestinian Authority also doesn't want Israel to end the occupation anymore.
Since 2009 polling has showing that the most popular party (by a lot) in the West Bank is also Hamas, so the Palestinian Authority suspended elections.
