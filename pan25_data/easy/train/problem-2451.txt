None of this negates the fact that the United States has become India's most important strategic partner.
The two nations have made enormous progress in recent years.
Since 2018, New Delhi and Washinon have held annual summits and signed numerous groundbreaking security agreements.
Both nations are part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (known as the Quad), along with Australia and Japan.
At the Quad summit in Tokyo last month, Modi met U.S. President Joe Biden in person for the second time, complementing the two nations' ongoing virtual discussions.
New Delhi also joined Washinon's recently unveiled Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, which aims to intensify economic relations in the region short of a formal trade treaty.
Throughout their blossoming partnership, India and the United States, as the world's two largest democracies, have pledged to channel their shared values (and strategic interest in containing China) into upholding the rules-based liberal international order.
idk what to say lol.
If you think replacing Modi with someone else will be more pro west you are so wrong lol.
Literally anyone else will be more anti-west and pro Russia/USSR as the Prime Minister.
