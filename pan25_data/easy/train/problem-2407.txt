It is possible that there are worse bad beers in some parts of the rest of the world but I have not been that much outside Europe.
America also has plenty of good beers, it is just that the swill is worse than any swill i have found in Europe.
As someone who drinks a lot of cheap beer and has traveled a lot all over Europe I would say no European country I have been to has had worse bad beers than the US.
Your bad beers are in a league of their own and the reputation is well deserved.
Even Malta's Cisk is better than the cheap American lagers.
Sadly, yes, and I have no clue why since there are plenty of cheaper and better plain lagers.
But Heineken also has a lot of other beers, some of them actually good.
Heyheyhey.
This week the US Supreme Court clarified that boycott is not an exercise in free speech.
You must incorporate yourself first, before your speech enjoys any protection.
And also, it has to be the right speech.
Only the right speech is the free speech, which is the true speech, which is my speech.
