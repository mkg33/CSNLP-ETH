Funny how the past few days the international headlines were all about vague (and subsequently false) statements from one member of the judiciary in Iran pretending the morality police isn't a branch of the judiciary and using that as a loophole to say the morality police is abolished and headlines ran with that, as if the world somehow didn't understand that the Iranian regime, like many dictatorships, is built on lies and false promises which only lead to eventual even greater oppressions.
Too hard to spend on food or water.
Would you take a US silver dollar for a bottle of water?
Or how about 1 oz of silver?
Now ask if you would take bitcoin.
Iâ€™m.
Personal attacks aren't warranted.
If the vendor doesn't already accept BTC you're fucked.
End of discussion.
Your options are steal or starve.
