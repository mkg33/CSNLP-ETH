The legislature ripped up the Reedy Creek charter unilaterally without a transition plan.
The state is now trying to figure out how to "undo" what they ripped up before the deadline hits in June.
What the state is proposing probably isn't actually legal and they're not betting any of their proposals against real lawyers.
(Yes, the irony of the state not engaging lawyers is not lost).

I’ve had conversations with acquaintances who were astonished when I said I was impressed with Disney making an overtly antifascist show.

My acquaintances said they honestly can’t decide who to cheer for.
It’s wild to me.
