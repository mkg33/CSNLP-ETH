The USA, if it would simply give up attempts at nation building, could EASILY just go the old Roman way and say "create a desert and call it peace."
Those "wars" you quoted, were all won within a few weeks.
It was the attempted nation building that failed.
And whereas in reality, Israel has voted to condemn the russian invasion of Ukraine in the UN every time it has come up for a vote, Israel has given large amounts of humanitarian aid to Ukraine including setting up a field hospital in Ukraine, Israel has taken in a large amount of ukrainian war refugees, and Israel has given Ukraine some military equipment to defend themselves such as helmets and kevlar jackets.
What you gonna do?
Train terrorist groups to harm Israel?
Threaten it with extermination?
What are you going to do what you haven’t done yet?

Incorrect.
Iran would get curb stomped no question and their poorly trained, under-equipped soldiers would get rocked.
