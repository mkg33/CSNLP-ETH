The only concession that the majority of Palestinians are willing to accept is an end to the Jewish state and to push the Jews into the sea.
This is the position of Hamas and a popular position among the people, even in Fatah/PLO controlled areas.
The Palestinians rejected peace during the Camp David accords in the 90's when they were being offered everything except control of Jerusalem.
Now they can't even get that offer back because of 25 years of settlements.
The younger Palestinian generations are being indoctrinated to extreme violence and refusal to even acknowledge Israel as a country.
Your post is clearly misinformed.
If true, actual peace was on the table, I guarantee that the huge majority of Israelis (other than a radical religious minority) will embrace it with both hands, and whoever leader brings it will be a legend forever.
Omg.
Fuck both of these groups of morons.
Been doing this for how long?
Still haven't stopped?
I'm so done.
Let the desert consume both of these miserable peoples.
What dictatorship?
I don't follow.
Also the offers were extremely fair.
The last one Olmert made was so good I doubt they will ever get anything even close to it.
