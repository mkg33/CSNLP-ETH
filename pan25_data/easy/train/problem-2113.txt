So now you decide what my heritage should be based on my political views?
Pitiful.
Turkey is just like any other country, aside from autocratic tendencies, they simply do what is in their best interest, like any other country.
Unlike the relative stable west, Turkey has been plagued with terrorism for decades.
The PKK has even plagued its own peoples for support.
My dad who is Kurdish and a business man in the west, was often visited, harassed and threatened by Kurdish terrorist supportive goons from the mob that demanded money for their terroristic activities in Turkey and Syria.
They even called him a traitor for marrying a Turkish woman, the woman he loves.
Those terrorists are also key drug traffickers, and ironically so, even work together with the Turkish mob, to keep the steady supply of heroin flowing to Europe.
When I was in High School, I was even recruited a multitude of times to join their criminal organisation.
You guys know nothing about our peoples, stop pretending you do.
Not for me, but for yourself.
They still hold significant Ukrainian land areas, they have forcefully migrated Ukrainian people including children into Russia proper.
How do I know?
Turkey has pretty advanced weaponry, namely their drones and military ground vehicles.
As the situation escalates, heavier and heavier weapons would be used.
The outcome would be a complete disaster.
Besides the effigy, Swedish courts prevented the extradition of a Turkish anti-erdogan Journalist (Bulent Kenes) and Scandinavian countries in general have become a go to place for other turks/kurds seeking political asylum.
Turkey is actually just below Russia in based on Journalistic freedom.
