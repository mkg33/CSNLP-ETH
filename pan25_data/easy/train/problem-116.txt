The substance of debates don’t matter too much, but image during them does.
Trump, from an intellectual stand point, crashed and burned during the debates, but republicans didn’t pay attention to the substance, they paid attention to him getting in arguments, “fighting for them”, and that he got to complain about bias when he was shut down for breaking agreed rules.
That all does move the needle, especially during a primary.
If DeSantis is asked a question and he goes deer in the headlights like he did at his last debate it’ll destroy his “tough guy” image for a lot of republicans (especially MAGA republicans) and that’ll harm him.
"lacks compelling alternatives?
What BS whitewashing is this?
They 100% told trump what to say and how to act.
Trump was their best cheerleader.
He took every cue from the GOP party line for the past 40 years.
He is the perfect example of a republican, and because of HIM, they've stepped up their attacks on this country because they now see the time is right and they can get away with it.
There are no alternatives, they all backed and supported and protected him, because he is their best wet dream come true, and almost gave them totalitarian dictatorship over this country.
That's their end goal, and has been for a very long time.
