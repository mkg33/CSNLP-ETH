There's also Republicans like Lindsey Graham who are all for giving Ukraine weapons military aid and weapons.
Hell Lindsey Graham if I remember correctly openly was advocating for Putin to be assassinated on live TV.
There's also conservative podcasters and such, like Ben Shapiro, who are all in favor of supporting Ukraine.
That's such a blanket statement to accuse all Republicans of supporting Russia, it's just totally false.
I have never heard of a Republican actually supporting Russia.
If you have evidence go ahead and link it.
And no not wanting to support Ukraine by sending them weapons and cash isn't supporting or thinking Russia is great or some such nonsense.
There's a group of Republicans that are isolationists and argue we shouldn't provide any country with weapons or cash but that doesn't mean they support Russia or say China or any other country with aggressive intentions in regards to their borders and expansion.
Have you turned on Fox News lately?
Fox is the propaganda wing of the republican party but may as well be Pravda these days.
Ask a republican about Hunter Biden.
After WWII isolationism is not amoral or apolitical.
Russia gives them cash.
Clinton called out Trump for being a Russian stooge in a live debateâ€¦ fox news shredded her (they are also in Russian pockets).
