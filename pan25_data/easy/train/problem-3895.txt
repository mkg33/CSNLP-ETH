Dude I know… this 30% tax is killing the growth of the market here in IL.
Sure, it’s been taxed by 30% since it was decriminalized.
People were so hyped you could finally go buy edibles, waxes, vapes, and choose the strain you want, so people were willing to pay the tax.
It’s not like that now.
We were supposed to have a whole other dispensary built and open one town over and that would have been sweet, the closest one to me is a half hour away.
Not a bad drive but it still would have been great to literally have one right down the road.
But it never got built, they pulled the plug, cuz the closest one had now basically only been doing less than half the business they were.
First few years it was open tons of sales , but the more recent years it dipped.
People rather just grow their own plants or buy it from their usual old school dealer lol.
Definitely!
Unfortunately there’s still no way to reverse symptoms and you can’t really slow progression with anything outside of immunosuppressants BUT we definitely have many more ways to manage it now.
