Promoting conspiracy theories, culture wars, fear mongering, stoking religious and ideological fanaticism, and anti-government rhetoric.
Like labeling antifa as some vast, powerful socialist army when it really was just a bunch of people opposing skinheads and neo nazis.
The original group was just mostly young men who thought the best response to a angry skin head with a bat was to hit him with a bat.
Then other people joined in, because who wouldn't want to counter protest racists and nazis.
Why, the far right, that's who.
So, Tucker Carlson and other right wing mouth pieces (of $h!t) narrated Antifa into some Left wing army that was going to install black communist dictators, turn your children gay and make them ashamed of being white with critical race theory.
Meanwhile, they spread the message the only way to stop mass shooters is to arm everyone else.
After all, if all the God fearing, market worshiping, conservatives aren't carrying assault rifles how will they stop the deep state when the come for our guns, burn the bibles we don't actually read, and try to force us all to become transgendered?
