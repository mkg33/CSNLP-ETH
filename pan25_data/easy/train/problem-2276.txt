Your mistake is thinking that they will operate in good faith; they will not.
They do not care if it's unconstitutional, they will do it anyway just to make a statement and tie it up in courts for years.
They are going to do something blatantly unconstitutional, people are going to scream "You Can't Do That!"
and they're just going to go :trollface:.
If they can get a court to uphold it and then have SCOTUS just not hear it, what then?
In Lovett they almost did not appropriate the funds even after a court ordered it, so even if the court finds it unconstitutional, what are they going to do when there's simply no budget for it?
While all this is being hashed out, the right-wing media's smear campaign will be in overdrive going on about how the House is fighting a corrupt FBI/DoJ who want to persecute Republicans.
They will then just defund part or most of the DoJ using this nonsensical "corrupt persecution" as an excuse.
And all this is assuming Federalist Society member Garland doesn't just drop it because "they can't be political.
".

"Everybody in America is innocent until proven otherwise," Perry told ABC "This Week" anchor George Stephanopoulos.
Why the fuck is this even allowed?
Simply because no oneâ€™s been able to jump through the fucking hoops to legislate something this specific?
Ridiculous.
