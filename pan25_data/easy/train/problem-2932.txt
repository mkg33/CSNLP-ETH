Maybe it’s about power: maybe it’s sadism, knowing they’re causing hurt to people, with politicians like trump, Boebart and especially desantis(whom I find the most insidious,) but at a certain point they need to realize they’ll lose.
A large majority of the people who pay their campaigns, and their voters, are older.
And they’re not getting younger.
Especially the most right leaning ones.
It makes me sick seeing people from one of the most well off generations who fucked the housing market and has tons of money only focusing on themselves.
They can’t even claim the Christian altruistic purpose anymore of “protecting kids” or any bs.
A lot of youth are tired of their shit.
They aren’t giving away their wealth like their Bible claims: Matthew 19:21 “Jesus told him, “If you want to be perfect, go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.
Then come, follow me.” “.

Honestly?
I don’t give a fuck if the whole right goes down in flames.
I want it to, and I don’t care if someone thinks I’m acting extreme or a maniac.
Losing friends to a system rigged against us and rigged to blow if we ever try to fix it is frustrating, especially in a day and age where we have more than ever before, only to be squandered over petty differences.
