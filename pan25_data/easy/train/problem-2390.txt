Interesting how the USSR would align with the west in a full cooperation capacity with the goal of fighting fascism together, yet made the most hands-off deal possible with Germany to buy time when this push for total alliance with the liberals was denied.
Nice read.
But isn't world's preferred curency heavily tied to the stability of that currency, and hence the nation (or alliance in EU's case).
Like currency used to be tied to gold but nowadays lots of countries use USD as the substitute for gold because of its stability (currency and the nation).
When covid and russian war happened lots of currencies, including euro, fell compared to USD, which just shows what currency people believe is the most stable.
It's not related to who won ww2.
Arguably russia won it too but their currency is what is what it is despite having massive oil exports.
I don't think a lot of people believe that China, or especially the current regime, is stable.
Isn't that factor alone enough to destroy Xi's wet dream?
