Well then, I concede on that subject, there are options to move to another EU country and not get extradited for draft dodging.
Still, meeting the requirements is quite hard.
There is no option like "I want to stay where I was born and not be forced to give 1 year of my life to the army".
You have an obligation, but there are ways to legally escape it.
I would still consider that if my country forces me to become a dual citizen or move out for a long time to avoid conscription, some of my rights are taken away.
Honestly... if someone told you that you are allowed to live in your home, but only if you work as a soldier for 1 year or move out of the country, you are in all practical senses being forced out of your home for a period of time against your will.
It's forceful in my eyes, just like paying taxes.
The problem is, when you pay taxes you decide how you make the money and how you spend that time.
When you serve in the army, somebody else is deciding for you how you spend your time.
Do you think that security, stability, liberty and self-determination arent fundamental necessities of modern living?
Do you think money alone is enough to stop a foreign army?
Don't you think that if conscription wasn't useful it wouldn't be implemented in all military organizations since Napoleon?
