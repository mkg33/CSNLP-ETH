I think there are a large number of parties in Ukraine thanks to the runoff in the presidential elections and the party list voting (half of the seats in previous elections all in the next election) instead of the two we have here.
Many new parties form around major politicians.
Before 2014 there were significant number of MPs who were at least somewhat pro Russia but between removing many of the voters who voted most consistently for these politicians and pissing most of the rest of Ukraine off Putin made it impossible for these people to get elected again.
Reminds me of a quote I read.
"Sir, with respect.
I shall fight you til hell freezes over, and then by God, I shall fight you on the ice.
Good day."
Looks like we are past hell freezing over and Ukraine is awaiting Putin's lousy ass on the ice.
I dig it.
I wish someone could describe the actual "best case scenario" Putin had in mind (full of military, governors, world renown, economic, etc) truthfully and accurately.
And then what?
Fuck Putin, but I do not see a good ending.
Russia is so deep into its own Rus nationalism I cannot see how this can end in a good way.
Putin's main critics are basically criticising him for not being even more brutal.
There is no real opposition in Russia.
A lot of people talk Navalny but his coalition is basically only united by "fuck Putin" and completely irrelevant.
