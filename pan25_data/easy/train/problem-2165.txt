In the modern American political landscape, centrists can’t win in the republican primaries because their voters think democrats are evil, hellspawn literally controlled by demons.
They’d sooner destroy their own party than work with the democrats and they just might do that.
After 20 years of Fox News brainwashing, the nut cases run the party now.
The new policy chief for the house is Lauren “had to take the GED 3x” Boebert.
65% of the republican voters don’t even believe Biden won the election legitimately.
And you think for no reason at all, out of the blue, they’re just suddenly going to decide to be centrists because… it benefits the democrats??
I mean fucking wow man.
What kind of weed are you smoking?
I def want some of that shit.
Then you draw another line from there to Ronald Reagan giving a states rights speech at the Neshoba County Fair after being nominated for President in Philadelphia, Mississippi, an otherwise unremarkable town save for the horrific murder of three civil rights workers by the Klan working hand in hand with local police.
