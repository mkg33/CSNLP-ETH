I'm 35, Northern NY resident.
I remember building epic snow forts as a kid that would last weeks.
We didnt even have to pile the snow up to make tunnels, juat dig out the 2+ feet already there on the ground.
We always had a white Christmas and would go sledding at a friend's house just about every weekend.
He had a good steep hill in his yard.
Winters were often brutally cold and seemed to last well into April.
Now we're lucky if the snow lasts a couple weeks at a time, and I can get away with a light jacket for most of November-March.
White Christmases are 50/50 chance, maybe worse.
Actually when I was a kid, Thanksgiving was often snowy.
Immigration.
Many decent people advocate mass immigration.
They insist there are absolutely no negative effects on the environment, wage stagnation or rising housing costs, even though all 3 are obviously affected by fast growing populations.
Ignoring other factors, basic state institutions like schooling and roads must grow just to keep up with a growing population.
It's not cost-free.
