Why can’t we just accept her at face value?
She’s a kid angry that we lived our lives enjoying subsidized energy (in that it did not include the cost of remediating the pollution it generated); we’ve had the actual scientists warning us for decades that we were critically altering the climate and made only token gestures to address it; we (or at least I) will be dead and gone before the worst consequences will be seen; and they will inherit this dumpster fire.
Who cares how well-off her family is?
Who cares what she looks like or anything else about her, other than she’s angry and has every right to be?
Everyone her age ought to be angry with us.
If she did nothing other than help some of her peers recognize that we have generationally screwed them, she at least deserves credit for that.
If not an apology.
Or, you know, actual environmental policy changes.
Good for her.
She's done so much to inspire young people to care about climate change, and at such a young age herself.
She has more than earned her time away from the frontlines to pursue an education, a career, or anything else she's looking for as a 19 year-old.
