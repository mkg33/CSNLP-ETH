Hehe.
I meant post as in C.E.
or A.D. as in after the development of the scientific method.
So, technically speaking it would be "post-development of the scientific method".
.
According to the Godfrey-Gibson report “the level of damage with fractures on all sides and the extreme force of the penetration right through the debris item lead to the conclusion that the end of the flight was in a high-speed dive designed to ensure the aircraft broke up into as many pieces as possible.
The crash of MH370 was anything but a soft landing on the ocean.”.
The debris item had barnacles on it when it was found and in total four items of MH370 debris have been found on the same beach.
The location was predicted by the University of Western Australia (UWA) oceanographic model.
And they shouldn't.
Reality, aka the Truth based on facts and supported by evidence, doesn't give a damn whether we personally prefer simplicity over complexity.
Wow.
Have you ever been on a plane?
Everyone on that plane would have known exactly what was happening, the plane was nosedived into the ocean.
As a passenger I feel like "we're all gonna die" landing at LaGuardia or San Diego.
Inductivism also continues bubbling under.
People think you can predict the future with statistics.
