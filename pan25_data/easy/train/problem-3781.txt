You're right it's not 100% on the producer, but also the governments who don't regulate their emissions.
But the politicians are lobbied (paid) to push the responsibility onto consumers instead of themselves.
And most governments represent a minority of their constituents' interests, and would rather take the corporate money and ease regulations instead of doing anything actually useful.
But sure, the average consumer can totally make significant changes to climate change, they just have to give up everything that makes them happy in this otherwise miserable world, and just walk/bike to work, eat only just enoughto live (being sure to exclude all meat, and definitely no bottled water) go home and stare at a wall in the cold and dark ( or hot and dark depending on location).
Thats definitly an effective way to combat climate change.
Suicide?
Lmao, cause of course now it's my fault if multinational companies pollute the shit outta this world, I'm so sorry for not living like a monkey yet, with no electricity, no technology, no gas and no modern services whatsoever.
Fucking idiots.
