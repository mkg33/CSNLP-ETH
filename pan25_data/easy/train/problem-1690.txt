Propaganda is an extremely effective tool, especially when given a megaphone, and most of the media on the attacking side feels no obligation to be truthful.
The MSM needs to stop "both sides"-ing this shit.
One side is responsible for the dishonest messaging and the violence that is following that messaging.
(Hint: It isn't the Dems.)
This is about a lot more than the need for the Dems to be better story tellers.
The side perpetuating the violence needs to unequivocally denounce that violence, and then it needs to back up those words with better actions.
Until that happens things will only get worse.

The problem isn’t Democrats storytelling ability.
The problem is that Democrats don’t have an entire media ecosystem that unquestionably spreads their stories like Republicans do.
Republicans have Fox News, OAN, Newsmax and an even longer list of conservative radio shows.
Democrats don’t have anywhere near as a robust set of platforms to spread their message, no matter how compelling it may be.
