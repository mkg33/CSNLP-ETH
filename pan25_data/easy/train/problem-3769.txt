Me neither.
I have just had to do exhaustive biblical research for World History courses in college.
If you’re following him you haven’t read it, or can’t read.
Both are highly likely.
A multi-lateral nuclear deal that involved every major country and was specifically designed to allow for the development of nuclear power infrastructure and prevent the development of weapons.
Had that deal simply been passed years ago rather than been cancelled by Trump, Iran would be in a much worse position to try and go rogue now on nuclear weapons.
Just another example of reductive machoistic populists being wrong and fucking everything up by thinking they know better than the scientists and diplomacy experts.
Thanks.
I wasn't aware of the referendum.
It's hard to say how legitimate it was.
Khomeini was a genuinely popular figure in Iran (he had led a popular uprising earlier during the Shah's reign but was exiled after its failure) and was given a hero's welcome when he returned.
Many of the people protesting the Shah were followers of his and specifically protested the regime's oppression of Muslims.
It's very well possible that those who voted were in favor of the Islamic Republic.
