The idea that universities and college "brainwash" young adults into becoming liberal is correlative, not causal.
The interactions with, conversations with, and becoming friends with people from different states or countries opens the average individual's mind and emotions to experiences and ideologies that they may have never had around in the small town that they went to high-school in.
This worldliness lends people to become more liberal, because despite having a completely different upbringing and journey, all those young people at that school ended up there one way or another.
These ideas, to people who are open to them, tend to make people more progressive, rather than regressive as conservatism requires.
\- They are cringe debate-lords that believe their intellectualism has allowed them to "figure out" politics that leads them to a conservative position as it is the party of opposition to progress.
Being the devil's advocate, hoping that someone will acknowledge how smart they are, when in reality it just ends up in the average person thinking they are an annoying smart-ass, so they have to double down and reaffirm their position amongst other equally-ostracized individuals who claim to be conservative.
Most people don't want to associate with young people openly espousing the beliefs of the party that wants our peers, friends, and family that are gay/trans or literally any race other than white to suffer so that Christian conservative white people may prosper through it.
Yep.
You can’t smoke cigs under 21 in most states now, but feel free to smoke ducks for money at 18, as long as you film it.
If conservatism gets voted down democratically, conservatives won’t abandon conservatism, they will abandon democracy.
