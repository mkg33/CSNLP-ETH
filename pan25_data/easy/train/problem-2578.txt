That's supposed to be the idea but when you take a step back and look at the big picture you'll see that we have 1 major political party that has turned into a fascist regime and our wealth distribution at its worst point in our entire history.
If that's not enough, then what is?
It was only the other day when our government's leader were feeding us disinformation in regards to a deadly disease that has now killed over 1M Americans ffs.
What more could it take?
Install campaign Town Halls in every state(where the final candidates will be tested before voters to see the candidates in action to determine the best candidate for the civil servant position) then added to the ballot in rankings "not party" for the voters to choose from.
Where could it have gone?
It's a mystery.
I like how the IRS is instantly up my ass about a miscalculation on my taxes but things like this just can't be solved.
Typical Republican bullshit.
Do something horrible to someone else, and make other people money while doing it.
