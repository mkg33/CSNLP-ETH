Putin ever remind you of that annoying kid who isn’t happy with his piece of chocolate, he must have ALL the chocolate, including everyone else’s.
And if he has to rip out your stomach to get it, it’s OK, it’s for your safety.
4) Economic and military paranoia.
Very few nations have the capacity to sustain large, modern armies far away from their borders.
The US, France, UK, and maybe China or India or Brazil in the near future if they invest heavily.
None of those are going to invade Russia any time soon.
So the military threat to Russia is distant, but over the long term, who knows?
While natural gas fields were found in Ukraine the time and cost to develop them means they won't be a threat to Russian production for a couple of decades, and only a few of them are near enough to existing pipelines to be attached inexpensively.
While a wealthy Ukraine isn't a threat now, it might theoretically be in a couple of decades and given that Ukraine has been growing in strenh and Russia has been weakening early war favors Russia more than later war.
Spot on.
Western “expansionism” is when Eastern European countries democratically elect pro-Western leaders.
Russian expansionism is the rape and murder of tens of thousands of civilians.
Absolutely!
Know how you keep them from ever thinking of doing similar shit in the future?
Destroy their will to fight - wear them down on their front lines, and wear them down internally having to send their sons into a meat grinder for what purpose?
Send a message that we are a unified alliance against tyranny and they won’t be meeting one nation but many behind them.
One fault I have for past administrations, and I’m strongly against rushing into war/conflict, but on the other hand, you can’t give this lunatic and his sycophants so much leeway up front.
