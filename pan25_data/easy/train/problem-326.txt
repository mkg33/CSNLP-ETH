So the party could theoretically use some soft power shit to keep a Dem from running, but then I’d be worried about Republicans backing some nutjob to run unopposed in a Dem primary as a spoiler for the general.
And yes, my entire point was that the party can exert soft power to keep Democrats off the ballot if they wanted but they probably wouldn’t because Republicans would run a ghost candidate Dem as a spoiler.
No candidate who actually wants a political future will file to run against the wishes of the party and the signature requirements to get on the ballot seem kinda low actually but are probably still enough to keep just any swingin dick off the street from running as a Democrat without some kind of funding/organizational support.
Nothing will change.

She pissed off a lot of people.
