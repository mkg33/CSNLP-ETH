Because the Republican party since the 80s (70s?
60s?)
has been selling themselves as the party of common sense and reasonable thought, of men being "real men" (why do you think they photoshopped Trump's head--one of the weakest, thin-skinned, draft-dodging wimps every to be elected--onto the body of Rambo?
), the party of God, Guns, Country, and Family Values.
Republicans are the good ol down home True Blue Americans^TM, and that propaganda has been spewing from Fox "News" and right wing talk radio for decades.
It's ingrained into several generations, that being Republican is tradition, honor, Jesus, American flags and screeching eagles.
At the same time, the propaganda portrays the Democrats as perverts, deviants, nuts, communists, socialists, Nazis, anti-Americans, foreigners, immigrants (the bad kind), Jesus haters, religion haters, and all-around crazies.
Decades of that shit becomes ingrained into their very beings.

American civilians are dumb and intentionally ignorant.
It's all "team" related - 90% of Republicans don't even know why they're republican other than that they're republican, which makes them hate democrats.
They have no grasp on politics or what the politicians are saying - they have no idea what politicians mean when they say "social programs.
