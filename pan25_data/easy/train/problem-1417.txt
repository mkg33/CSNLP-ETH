While I'm highly skeptical of the Chinese government having benign intentions, I'm also strongly in favor of ending the war ASAP on ONE CONDITION That no one asks for stupid shit oike Ukraine giving away parts of the occupied Donbas or returning the 300 billions frozen Russian assets.. these are now Ukrainian assets and should be used to pay for rebuilding Ukraine.
Nice quote.
Too bad there are more examples throughout history that point to the opposite outcome.
There is a massive difference between the two situations.

I think you need to do your own research about this cause a lot has been happening and there are so many details that I don't even know where to start but in a nutshell, China isn't just 3 or 4 years behind, and their domestic Chip industry, with the full weight of the sanctions implemented by the Netherlands (the country that makes the machines that allow companies like TSMC to make microchips),Taiwan, and Japan, means their domestic semiconductor manufacturing can't cover their own needs which is why they haven't and couldn't supply Russia.
