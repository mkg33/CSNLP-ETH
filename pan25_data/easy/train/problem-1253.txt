The fact that he gave an exact number is potentially damning, but his defense will say "Trump thought there were far more than 11,780 fraudulent votes, and asked Georgia to investigate at least enough to demonstrate that fraud tipped the election."
It's a shitty defense but it's Georgia's burden to prove it's false, and it's very hard to prove someone's intentions.

Unfortunately, no.
They have to prove that Trump had criminal intent and knowingly asked Raffensberger to commit a crime.
If Trump genuinely believed what he said--that there were fraudulent votes, and that he was asking to Raffensberger find enough of the fraudulent votes to prove he won--then he was not guilty of Georgia's "solicitation to commit election fraud" crime.
Unfortunately in the case of Georgia's "solicitation to commit election fraud" law, this is a defense.
The prosecution must prove that Trump's intention was to have Raffensberger commit a crime.
If Trump's defense can persuade that Trump believed what he said --that he was asking Raffensberger to investigate and find fraudulent votes he genuinely believed existed--then Trump was not soliciting a crime and therefore was not guilty (of that particular crime: we all know the fucker is guilty of a lot of other shit).
