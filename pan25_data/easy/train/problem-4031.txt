You're arguing "they still have this other tax, so it doesn't matter that they scam their way around paying their fair share.
".
But intentionally losing money (which is what I assumed you meant by "loophole," but in re-reading your comment, I notice you only use incompetentance as your example, so I may have been mistaken) and as a tax avoidance strategy is not a sound idea, and anyone trying it isn't going to have an easy time getting those loans you claim you can live off.

The President cannot.
Congress also cannot just do this as a normal law.
The only eligibility requires to run for US president is you are 35 years old and a natural born US citizen.
States have rules to add a candidate to the state ballot, which varies by state (usually filing fee and a petition).
To change eligibility to run for president requires a constitutional amendment.

I’m on a grad student stipend, make 35k/yr.
I struggle to afford groceries, my car is never full of gas.
Yearly taxes are the same as Trump’s though, apparently.
