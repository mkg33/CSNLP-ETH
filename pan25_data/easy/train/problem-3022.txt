But the real big deal is the negotiation and implementation of the infrastructure law with a big shift to active transportation, public transit and trains in addition to repairing bridges and modernizing ports and airports.
Add to that new rules for customer protection for airline passengers including a bill of rights for passengers with disabilities, a road safety strategy, the reconnecting communities program, climate resilience programs, a nationa EV charger network, new rights and more autonomy for tribes and working with HUD on public transit centered urban development.
This is lame and low.
My comment stands by itself, and has nothing to do with someone's sexuality -- using that as a bludgeon to try to chill conversation is a really gross tactic DeathByTacos.
Nobody cares about his sexuality in this context except you, and I can't help but think you're using this tactic to avoid my point about how some jobs can't have you disappearing for months.
e.g., the President.
The VP.
Secretary of Defense.
Secretary of Transportation, etc.
