If you have a problem with this, then blame Russia.
They're the ringleaders in this escalation circus, aren't they?
The reason Russia is even doing this is because they know they can get away with a lot with nukes.
You'd show them they're right to think so, and you'd give them exactly what they want.
not literally, but Chechnya has a reputation for excessively violent conflict resolution methods, within Russia itself.
Ugh.
Yeah.
I bet that's exactly what's going on.
Based on the even more wacked out aggression of his speeches lately he's probably upped his dose, isn't working out and/or is overeating because of stress about being overthrown if Putin is ousted, and is very angry about what's probably a lot of shrinkage downstairs.
I 100% agree with this.
I don't mean it should only be a threat, but I also don't mean to say Poland should just fully invade.
Treat it like a negative peace.
Act as if Russia might invade at any point, so you station troops at the border, you attack trade ships, you quadruple support for Ukraine.
