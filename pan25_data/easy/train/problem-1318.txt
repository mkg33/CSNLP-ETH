Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Eat Germany - all of them suppressed the opposition in brutal ways.
All of them were run by leftists.
"State capitalism" or no, that doesn't matter.
It is just how the disease progresses.
You genuinely believe someone spouting bullshit conspiracies about an elementary school shooting, causing his followers to harass the families of the victims and being fined for being a jackass is equal to someone being jailed for 8 years for pretty much wanting a militarist dictator regime out of his country?
Yashin is a very very brave man.
And an honest, sincere and intelligent one.
I hope these 8.5 years will turn out to be not more than a year or two.
But this hope is bleak.
Another Redditor commented Navalny may be trying to earn "street cred" with the prison gangs as well as the general public (as a Nelson Mandela-esque political prisoner) which will position him well should Putin be forced to step down (either voluntarily or coup or death) and leadership of Russia becomes up for grabs.
Both exterminated opposition.
Both destroyed freedoms, like freedom of speech.
Both enjoyed violence against dissidents.
See China, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, hell, any and all of them.
