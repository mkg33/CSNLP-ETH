tl:dr --- The US is noticing that some countries are beginning to falter in support for the Ukrainian war, with the majority of the rhetoric behind this decline being that Ukraine is not trying to do peace talks.
Good.
Neither is Ukraine.
It's all PR.
FTA: "The move is not intended to push Ukraine to the bargaining table, but instead to ease international fears...".
Absolutely insane.
Can they not imagine what it'd feel like for them if their people were being killed, raped, and tortured?
How difficult it would be to try and find peace with someone who is the cause for having tens of thousands of people die for nothing?
Absolutely fair.
I'm Canadian, so maybe it's partially an outsiders perspective on this topic, but on my end the same is definitely true for my people - very gullible (I'm sometimes guilty of this too.
).
Every population everywhere is the gullible sort unfortunately.
It is difficult to teach critical thinking to everyone, and usually bad for people in power to have a bunch of people willing to try to be critical of news, even from their own "side".
