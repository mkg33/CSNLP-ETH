They'd undoubtedly support these things if their candidates did well, they're not coming around, they're just looking to pass blame for a little consolation, they don't really find these things unappealing, they're just upset that enough voters did.
So a lot of conservatives are turning on these candidates, on Trump, on election denying, on Christian nationalism, extreme, anachronistic policies, but they voted for these candidates, for these ideas, they're only lashing out because they lost.
Oh, no.
They are about to rip each other apart.
First the MAGA wing lost control of the Federal government so badly that it led to Georgia electing a Black Baptist preacher and a progressive Jewish man from Atlanta as their US senators and nearly brought down the US government in a vain attempt to restore their cult leader to power.
Then, instead of withering away into the margins as happens traditionally with fail movements like this, they spent 2 whole years whining about how they were treated and there would be retribution in the midterms as the MAGA wave carried them to winning both houses of Congress…only to have it blow up so badly in their face they cling only to fleeting hope of a slim margin the House and potentially not having at it all.
Then the business Republicans (who never bought into MAGA any more than needed to get Donald Trump to sign a bill) totally miscalculated and tacitly ok’d Donald Trump to flood to field with his handpicked candidates in competitive districts and it almost completely failed up and down the ballot.
Now with no ability to override Bidens veto or stop the agenda of Senate Democrats, they won’t be able to come up with a cohesive strategy.
Debatable.
The GOP primary is shaping up to be a total shit show.
Democrats could nominate the blandest inoffensive candidate and sail through to victory while Republicans tear themselves apart.
