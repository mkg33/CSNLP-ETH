Yes this is for Erdogan's upcoming election to portray himself as a defender of Islam.
The election is scheduled for June but Erdogan has suggested moving it to May 14th.
I'm sure he will do whichever will benefit him the most.
Either way it's not so long that Finland and Sweden can't wait and with Greece in line for getting F-35s Turkey not even getting F-16s is a pretty heavy challenge for his strong effective leader propaganda.
A good bipartisan move by the US Congress.
Interesting.
I thought any country within the UK could negotiate internationally on its own behalf, but that only the UK could negotiate on behalf of the entire UK.
Kind of like how France could negotiate with a foreign nation, but it can't speak for the whole EU.
Is that not correct?
The reality is that Erdogan may actually lose in the next elections, and the coalition parties have promised to revert the concentration of power measures enacted by Erdogan, reducing the role of the president and returning the power to the parliament.
