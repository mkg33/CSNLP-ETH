This is such a critical point for people to realize.
Even if no new legislation gets passed in the next two years, just giving the legislation they already passed those years to take hold and bear fruit is going to be huge for the Dems in 2024.
Fortunately I think the Dems did a great job of safeguarding against that because they already accomplished a ton of stuff in the two years they had both chambers of Congress.
I feel like in particular the IRA, infrastructure bill, and chips manufacturing will all be paying tangible benefits for millions of Americans over the next two years, in addition to protecting same sex marriage, strenhening NATO, and hopefully student loan forgiveness.
The Dems already have a lot they can point to for 2024, especially if inflation is no longer a concern by then.
Exactly.
They barely win as it is and the first thing they do is go after Biden in an impeachment?
I’d think even the anti-Trump impeachment would think “we can handle more important stuff right now”.
