There was already a new service to move registrations and make them more declarative and volunteer instead of current paperwork, but it was done somewhere at the start of the invasion, and after that nobody really cared about people movement because it's impossible to track with all the internal refugees.
Ugh.
I volunteered months ago but wasn’t needed.
Going to throw this out here just in case.
If there’s anyone reading this that wants to try come to Canada (or knows of someone else)- I have space in my house.
Not much money but safe space and food/transportation/whatever else.
I can speak crappy Ukrainian, writing not so much.
(дитяча розмова, так!
).
Until recently, changing registration was one of the hardest buerocratic hells in Ukrainian buerocracy.
They are.
There is a LOT of air defence set up, but there is only so much you can do when Russia sends over a hundred cruise missiles and drones at once in one huge swarm to saturate those AA systems.
They may get 85% of them but that remaining 15% will still wreak havoc.
