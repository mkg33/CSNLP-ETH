That may give your enemy a way to extrapolate the position you are in strenh wise.
They could determine that a big push is needed because they dont have the numbers to defend a certain area, or change tactics based on that information, or lose the morale of the troops or citizens, along with a whole bunch of other things i'd never think of.
There are valid reasons to keep those numbers secret, in my opinion, especially when you are the underdog.
Right now the world thinks they are winning, so do the ukrainian public, but if they said we've had 300k killed and 3x that wounded, the public may start to think it isn't worth it to keep going, if at the end there wont be any Ukrainian men left.
Supplies and manufacturing capacity matter.
In a protracted war, the country thatâ€™s most capable of mass producing (or acquiring) bullets, shells, missiles, vehicles, clothes, food, etc.
- and most importantly, getting them to the front lines - is ultimately more likely to prevail, even if their opponents have a technological advantage.
