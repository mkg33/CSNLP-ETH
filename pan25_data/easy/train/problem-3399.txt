It’s also a waste of resources to mass 200k on the border for training, yet they’ve done it multiple times.
Is it really that unthinkable that they ship blood and medical supplies there for a bluff?
The west changed a lot after 2014: some countries like Sweden re-introduced mandatory military service, the average people in the EU went from seeing Russia as a trade partner to a threat, all countries but Germany and Austria started to oppose NS2, Russian economy got hit by sanctions, the EU started funding the building of LNG terminals (yes, that work started many years ago but was sped up when Russia invaded) and talk about the 2% goal of NATO started for real (previously it was just empty words).
I don’t know.
The opinion towards Russia had changed after 2014.
The Russians just refused to see it and accept it.
They should’ve known that Ukraine would not roll over.
Seriously.
The Tory party is so full of Russian money that we don't even know the full extent.
We do know they willing took millions of pounds and when they were caught they pretended it didn't happen.
