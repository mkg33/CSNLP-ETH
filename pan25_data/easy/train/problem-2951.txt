Reminds me of the time the circus came to my town back in 1960.
I was just kid and this was totally new to me and exciting.
They circled the wagons and set up their own little community.
The whole circle was wrapped in tarps so we couldn't see anything.
There were elephants and horses and camels and lions in there.
They went about their business taking care of the animals and all.
Us kids stood around outside in amazement.
Then a pile of elephant dung came flying over a wagon.
And then more.
We were intrigued...no challenged.
Being the small farm town kids we were, dung was no problem.
We started flinging elephant dung back over the wagons as fast as we could.
Inside they were shoveling it back at us.
It was a total shitfest.
Then some circus roady ran out with a bucket of water and soaked a friend of mine.
I can just see Trump and DeSantas on each side of a circus wagon throwing elephant dung at each other.
