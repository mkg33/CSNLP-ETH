Yes we are heading towards a time where planet earth won't be livable for a good part of humanity.
A lot of people will die.
But who knows what this will be good for?
Even without polution we went to times like these.
The black plague, wars, specially the world wars, natural disasters.
Genghis khan killed so many people that the world actually got colder and there was less co2 in the air because less humans were around.
In the end humanity will survive and will come out of this stronger and wiser than ever, just like we did before.
So from another perspective this self destructive behaviour is just natural.
Animals don't control their population, nature controls it.
By access to food, enemies, competetive "tribes" and diseases.
We have overcome all these boundaries and we will overcome this one too.
It will cost us a lot and maybe i'm one of the people that will die because if it.
That's life.
Vita est morte est vita.
All in all this fits to previous propaganda by Mediacoorps covering sauces and soups thrown at famous art pieces (they were all covered with a sheet of glas an therefore took no damage, which is stated in very few articles reporting these incidents therefore projecting a very very bad light on the protestors).
