He is trying to rehabilitate his image recently though i cant imagine anyone is believing that shit.
We are talking about someone who has sold millions of antisemitic books with titles like "Jews, the whole truth"(written by a literal selfproclaimed nazi) and recently apologised to the jewish community and said that he cried when he visited Auschwitz.
I think this is just posturing.
Greece and Turkey are NATO allies, and Turkey was asked to help Greece with their anti-drone system, Minotaur.
Erdogan is probably posturing that even if Greece can defend against Turkish drones, Turkey can still bombard Greece with missiles/rockets.
The posturing was overplayed by Erdogan with Turkey being a NATO ally and a historically neutral country, but we are heading into a less globalized world, so the Sultan may be actively looking at ways to consolidate/expand power.
Also Turkish nationalism was founded on the precipice of Anti-Greek sentiment, Turkification, and Anti-Eastern Orthodox sentiment; those attributes are still contained within Turkey, and we are coming up to the 100th anniversary of the Greek genocide, and on top of that both countries have major elections next year.
no?
Im saying that putler started an unjustified, brutal war against a sovereign nation claiming that the people "need" him and they will greet russian troops with open arms.
