Honestly.
I still don’t understand what’s affecting these prices.
I understand that gas prices are mostly controlled by the OPEC mafia.
What about food prices and all other prices?
They are still 50 to 100% up.
Is it just corporate greed causing this inflation?
Why I l aren’t the prices trending down with all the fed rate hikes?
Absolutely.
They don’t expect this to pass.
But they also know that the dems are assured a loss in 2024 if inflation doesn’t tamp down.
Anything they can do to spur that, they will, even if it’s just based on people acting out of the fear of the potential.
Exactly.
Also the same with the old "flat tax" that rich conservatives trot out once in a while.
"Hey, taxes are complex, why not make them easier?
Everyone pays the same rate!
