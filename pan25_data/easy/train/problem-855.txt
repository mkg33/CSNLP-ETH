When I was SaR (Pacific Northwest, mountainous, near the ocean) we hauled out more dead mushroom pickers than hunters or hikers or any other category.
Their mindset was they were going for a little walk on a nice day to pick some mushrooms so they weren't prepared... often wearing a t-shirt and sneakers.
Then they would set off with a bucket in hand and just start walking.
They walk over a ridge or two, always with their head down looking for mushrooms, and pretty soon they don't know where they are.
Then the weather turns, it gets foggy and/or starts raining, and they are totally lost.
Lost people tend to go downhill, which often leads them into deep gullies and canyons and steeper, rougher terrain that they can't get back out of.
They expend a lot of energy.
It gets dark, it gets cold, they get hypothermia, they die.
People are always surprised when they learn that there are so many deaths from lost mushroom hunters.
Obviously offensive supplies.
I know that this subject will lead to absolutely nothing, at least at this point.
And it will be criticised in the face of “fear of escalation”.
