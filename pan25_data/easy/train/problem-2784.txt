RIM is connected to Atomwaffen that has been trained in the Russian camps, so US has fifth column prepared to do the same.
They have already killed like 8 people.
Russia: invades Crimea, international hacker haven, fuck around in Syria, interfere in elections, invades Ukraine, cut off Europes energy in winter, terror in Africa, promises preemptive nuclear attacks.
Nope.
There is no chance of him pushing that button.

It's fascinating.
I worked in academia for a while, and in my particular field China and Russia were top countries sending postdoc to my institute for additional training and collaboration.

The Russians integrated pretty immediately and as far as I know they're all still here 15 years later.
