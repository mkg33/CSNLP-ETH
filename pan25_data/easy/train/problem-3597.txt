I say this a lot, but sometimes people around me find it difficult to visualise without the breakdown of an actual immigrant's living costs in the UK.
It is stratospherically expensive to maintain residence in the UK as an immigrant.
Before your yearly pay, £1,300 to £2,000+ will already be going to visa application, misc visa charges and the NHS surcharge - and this is all paid in advance as a lump sum.
To put that in perspective, you pay your monthly tax contributions to the NHS as a normal UK citizen would, but you also pay a yearly £624 surcharge to lessen the chance your own medical treatment would touch public funds.
Added to that, you work for the NHS, so you contribute your time and labour under a pay scheme universally accepted to be lower than it should.
Overworked.
People try to help as many as possible, the sytem reward this by ensures there is NOT bonus.
If you worked over 40 hoirs or weekemd, payment is still the same.
And because everyone trys to save everyone, there is no issues, so any request to hire more people is denied.
