Ever heard of the time the Wagner Group tried attack a US outpost in Syria?
If not, I’ll give you the short version.
Wagner gathered a force of 500 guys, T-72 tanks, and armored personnel carriers to attack a small US outpost with a smattering of men.
When the US guys started to suspect they were about to be attacked, they called for reinforcements from the 30 members of the Army Rangers and Delta Force who were at a nearby outpost.
At about 10:30 that night, Wagner attacked them.
They retreated to a defensive position, the US commander called the Secretary of Defense to find out why Russia was attacking us, Russia denied it was them, and then the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered that the force be “annihilated.”.
And why is that you ask?
Because after a remarkably short war, we, NATO and the US would be RESPONSIBLE for maintaining the Russian infrastructure and decommissioning the Russian Nuclear arsenal, which probably hasn't seen a single ruble of expenditure since the 70's.
