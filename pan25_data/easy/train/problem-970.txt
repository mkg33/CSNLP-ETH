Russian nuclear arsenal had no impact on Ukrainian NATO membership applications.
It does probably have implications for what the individiual countries are doing (i.e.
US/UK/EU not sending troops) but that is not a NATO jurisdiction since they are a defensive alliance.
That is up to the individual countries.
Haha exactly.
They are helping them in a big big way.
Nobody in the world can match USA technology, that's why/how this whole thing is happening the way it is.
Obviously..
If Russia didn't have nukes, western countries would have interfered directly in the war.
There would be no Russian soldier left in Ukraine by now.
Nothing new historically happening here.
A supposed military strongman dictator propped up by smoke and mirrors instead of actual military power is nothing unusual in the modern era.
Perfect examples are the Mexican dictatorship of DÃ­az, the Saddam dictatorship of Iraq, or Gaddafi in Libya.
Easy as a dictator to make your military look mighty and scary until the acid test of actual combat hits and you actually need them to be competent and deliver results.
