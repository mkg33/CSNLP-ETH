I honestly respect those that are holding onto the conservative Republican Party.
Problem is, they don’t separate themselves from the weirdo MAGA Republicans that label them as Rhinos.
If they want to remain a party, they are going to have to call these nut jobs what they are.
Terrorizing, racist, radical, seditious, asshole dirtbags.
They are not conservative.
They want to demolish a democracy.
They have ZERO policy platform.
They stand for nothing, but anything that prohibits specific populations that make them uncomfortable from living freely.
They are completely psychotic and have perverted their Christian God’s teachings and use it to veil their horrendous character.
They are no different than ISIS other than the prophet they profess to follow.
Anyone who follows this faction is pathetically confused and gullible.
MAGA is terrorism.
They are truly the most violent, least intelligent, most dangerous of our population since Charles Coughlin and his dumb asshole Nazi movement.
I have no respect for them.
Exactly.
It's honestly disappointing to see everyone continually get caught up in the schadenfreude, "leopards are eating their faces, ha-ha!"
narrative as though they're not simply manufacturing rage bait for their base like always.
It's not even complicated, literally just obstruct whatever process is in motion and paint the other side as trying to rush it or exclude you and your "concerns" so they can "steal" a win.
Works for legislation, investigations, elections, etc.
