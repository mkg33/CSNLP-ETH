This is probably the only accurate take I ever see on Reddit and so infrequently.
The reality that you don’t see too often on the internet is that Ukraine is losing a lot of men as well.
There are fronts like Bakhmut where there is an intense stalemate in fighting with a shit ton of losses on both sides.
The difference is that Russia has more men it can throw at these meat grinder battle grounds than Ukraine can.
Sure Ukraine is getting loads and loads of NATO toys but Russia has more men, and that’s why Putin will not budge.
This war unfortunately will go on for a long time and probably will not end this year.
Ukraine is still getting aid to fight in the war and Russia still has the manpower to continue, and no NATO superpowers seem to be interested in facilitating peace talks even if Russian leadership seems dismissive.
What?
No they won't.
Russia has absolutely wrecked its military and will have very serious difficulties recruiting and training new people.
Ukraine will not have that problem.
Well, kiiiiinda.
Isolate and contain, and then figure if they're worth anything.
Otherwise they're just pieces of shit who went along with this whole thing from the start, and bailed once it went sideways.
Fuck the whole lot of em.
