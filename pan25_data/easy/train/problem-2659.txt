Yeah.
The West has been responsible for countless crimes against humanity.
But, are we supposed to turn a blind eye to the crimes of the Arabian Peninsula that are ongoing by their wealthy and powerful elite who try to play the Muslim card as cover for enslaving and killing migrant labor NOW in this day because of the past?
Fuck that.
Two wrongs donâ€™t.
Theocratic Arab nations are brutal.
Scum governments and wealthy elite supported by the West.
The Arabian Peninsular nations have their own brutal history of colonizing others, too.
Hypocrites.
Leave the left out of this.
Infantino and FIFA are corrupt.
How quickly we forget the FIFA scandals just a couple of years ago and FIFA said they would clean house.
Well it's more like cleaning free House in Qatar for Infantino.
It had the nerve to lecture us about history.
3,000 years ago is not 2022 where woman can't leave their house in Qatar without an male spy.
But these same theocracy Qatar leaders have no problem with meeting up with their male or female lover or escort paying them $100,000 and meeting them in Europe on the luxury yacht.
HYPOCRITE!
