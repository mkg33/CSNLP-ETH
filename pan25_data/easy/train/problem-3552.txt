Imagine that Hitler's own personal secretary, , was never charged with a single crime, despite everyone knowing she was Hitler's personal secretary...
Exactly.
I’m Jewish and I would probably have believed it all if I wasn’t Jewish and was a German at the time.
There was no internet, and nazis gave out radios and used propaganda on Germans for 20 years.
If that was my only source of news I probably would’ve believed it until evidence showed otherwise.
It’s important to know how this happened.
Maybe stop thinking of economics as "capitalism" or "socialism" and look at the legal structures that society passively agrees with and look how those structures contribute to the growth of wealth inequality where many people are enriching the few instead of themselves.
That inequality stems from information inequality and weak negotiation positions.
I did.
I completely fell for the propaganda as a kid and blindly joined the military.
And again when I went to basic.
It wasn't until I actually went overseas and realized nothing I saw or was trained to believe was really true.
The most effective propaganda is the stuff you don't even know you've been tricked by.
