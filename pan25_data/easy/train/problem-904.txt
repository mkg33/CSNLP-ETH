It's not camouflage or misinformation - pretending to be a civilian plane is perfidy.
It tricks the enemy into affording your combatants the protection that is afforded to noncombatants only under the law of armed conflict.
There is absolutely no world in which "it is questionable" whether it applies to planes or not.
Why would it be questionable?
The definition is right there.
Civilian planes are afforded protections that combatant planes are not, not just under the law of armed conflict, also various open skies and civil aviation related treaties.
Combat aircraft are not afforded the same protection.
Bingo, the definition of perfidy has been met.
What diplomacy?
The U.S. took part in a coup of Irans government, manufacturers reasons for sanctions in the 90s which every sanction since then is now built off of.
Iran is a signatory of the NPT and has a right to develop nuclear technology.
The U.S. is also a signatory of the NPT and is bound by it to share nuclear technology with Iran.
The only rational logical step, is for Iran to develop nuclear weapons, to get the U.S. to leave it alone.
But to suggest that Diplomacy was attempted is laughable.
Obamas 'nuclear deal' was not Diplomacy it was coercion.
