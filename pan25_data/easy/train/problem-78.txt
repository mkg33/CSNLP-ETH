Agree, although I'm not sure globalisation is here to stay.
Especially if the fertiliser production in Russia collapses.
Food could become scarce globally, and very few countries are genuinely self sufficient in fertilisers + land for agriculture.
Some countries (especially America) could quickly get into a position of getting to choose who dies and who lives.
China is exceptionally vulnerable.
Look, with that I agree.
I'm a young person, trying to progress in my professional career, save some money, buy a nice house with a garden, start a family, all the usual.
It would be fucking unfair if Russia invaded my country, killed my countrymen, destroyed our society and economy and forced me to flee as a refugee or fight as a soldier.
And it would be equally unfair if my country surrendered and we had to adopt a slew of bullshit political measures to make sure that corrupt Russian oligarchs can continue exploiting my country, our citizens (including me) remain poor, my political opinions are outlawed and my right to choose my country's leader revoked, and isolated from the European Union and the Western World, which is free and democratic.
He should have asked the Marines.
They would have told him at the start.
If you ever find yourself in a fair fight, you fucked up.
On the wrong end of an unfair fight?
You really fucked up!
Iâ€™d suggest another correction: NATO capabilities arent being used against Russia.
Theyre being used against Russian forces in a special military operation.
Simply cease the operation and your troops wont be in harms way.
