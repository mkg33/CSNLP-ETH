I mean I didn’t think that Trump would ever win the Presidential election but the third time was the charm for him.
Let’s not assume this can’t happen.
There are many of ex-Trump supporters who didn’t like all the chaos that cam with him.
For those people DeSantis is the perfect amount of bigotry with added bonus of competency when it comes to impacting actual policy.
He is so much more dangerous and a lot can happen in the next two years.
I hope everyone is talking to their friends, neighbors, and young people about how important it is to vote!
We still have a much larger portion of the population that doesn’t vote at all.
Those are the people we need to activate.
Fortunately?
Are you on the pipe??
These people are pure evil.
Effective?
AT what, exactly?
45 never did a blessed thing to improve the lives of any, but he certainly made life difficult for thousands.
He's just a little Hitler.
He should end up the same way, with the trophy wife right along side.
They disgust me, the entire 45-crime family.
