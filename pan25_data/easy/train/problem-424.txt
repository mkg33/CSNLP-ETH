Trump takes advantage of cost segregation studies and 1031 exchanges.
What is a cost seg?
When you buy or build a building, you are not just building a building.
You are putting appliances, land improvements and other things in.
If an asset qualifies for special depreciation, you can bonus it out and expense the asset the year it's in service.
Cost seg studies identify this sort of property.
You would typically recapture this and pay tax when the building is sold; but if you use 1031 exchanges you don't incur a recapturable event.
Trump's losses are disconnected from his wealth.
Cost seg, cash out refi, buy a building, cost seg... leads to tax losses as long as we have 100% bonus depreciation even though he is building wealth.
