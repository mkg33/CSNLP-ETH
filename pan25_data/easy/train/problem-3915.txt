My American friend in Australia received the voting documents and instructions on line.
She printed the documents to fill out but didn’t print an envelope - because that’s silly, she just used a real envelope place.
No where in the voting instructions did it say to date or sign the envelope.
It was only the online envelope that had section and the instructions to do that.
By the sounds of it her vote won’t be counted.
Isn’t that the consequence of the lack of information with the instructions?
Isn’t that the fault of the electoral system?
