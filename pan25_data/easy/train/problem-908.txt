While Im sure Poland will not hold Ukraine as willfull murderers, It is war and bad shit happens.
If only one missile is fired without concern for tragectory count it lucky.
I disagree that an attacked nation can bare no responsibility for its actions.
The idea that if you are attacked you no longer have any resposibility to your actions, because only the attacker can hold any form of responsibility would suggest that whenever anyone is under threat there is no amount of "collateral damage" that should be avoided.
If you shoot POWs, not your fault, If you bomb civilians, they did it.
If you light children on fire, you didnt-they did.
While im sure many people on this thread would masturbate to an image of a burned russian baby, I disagree that we should strive to be no better that what we fight against.
You are responsible for what you do, there is no exception to that truth.
But Russia would agree with you, they also belive that everyone else is responsible for what they do.
Absolutely.
The difference here is that Ukraine would have fired those missiles to intercept Russian rockets in an act of self-defence.
Russia would have fired those missiles with the intent to kill innocent civilians.
