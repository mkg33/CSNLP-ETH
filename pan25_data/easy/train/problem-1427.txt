Marriage as an institution was founded upon the principle of generational wealth preservation / transfer.
It was, above all, a contract that guaranteed a child would receive the resources of both their parents.
Without it, historically men would be able to impregnate women at will and then refuse to take responsibility, leading to high rates of birth related mortality, since pregnant women are extremely vulnerable and so are their children.
Not to mention historically, intensive agriculture was a man's job and so only men had the resources.
Disgusting.
Just more pissy lowlifes that need to keep more than half the country back to have a shot at success.
Their inferior asses cant compete.
Lazy fucks would rather oppress billions than improve their skills or themselves.
Losers.
It's still the best 'base' environment to raise a child is still between parents that are committed to each other that children can reliably imprint on, notwithstanding the benefits of living in extended family situations where both parents are still present, with the inclusion of other close-knit 'family' (not necessarily blood-related) members.
