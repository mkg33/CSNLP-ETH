Yeah this a key point, and it makes it quite difficult for LGBTQ African Americans as they try to gain acceptance.
Also many older black folks, while historically voting Democratic, are also still quite socially conservative and religious, so it stands to reason that GOP fear mongering might peel away a few of them, though let’s be honest, it’s still not that many.
As someone else mentioned in this thread, there’s unfortunately still a lot of anti-LGBTQ sentiments in the black community, especially among black men, so the GOP making these issues front and center unfortunately will probably peel away some black voters who still hold these views.
Yes.
Black people and Hispanics tend to be incredibly conservative in their views of LGBT, and Republicans definitely have been successful with their messaging that “the left” is trying to groom their children with sexually explicit and pro-LGBT propaganda.
Black and Hispanic voters are also more likely to face substantial difficulties due to inflation wiping out their already low-on-average buying power while the Democrats keep telling everyone that things are going swell/okay (the economy is doing fine, for those of us who are upper middle class or higher).
