Yep.
Tier 3 at my state job and it’s dramatically lower retirement than tier 1 or tier 2.
Now many governments are making employees mandatorily contribute to their pensions which makes it even worse.
I’ve seen some states as high as a 10% mandatory contribution that comes off your gross check.
Ours is 6.5%.
They “compensated” everyone by raising their pay that much, but then we have to pay taxes on that higher pay.
The net effect is less money (worse case) or equal to before (best case, in low paying jobs).
Definitely.
We are working on processing these datasets into more usable forms and writing documentation for people who want to use it.
We have a growing network of partners as well: the data backing this was localized for many Axios newsletters.
Exactly.
They promised no effective change but then clawed that EPSA amount back not long after (I forget the salary threshold, but it’s pretty low…I wanna say like $3k month?
).
