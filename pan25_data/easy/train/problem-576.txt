...where large companies gradually take over governments with their own police force, army, legislative institution, lobby or rather direct influence that effectively controls politicians, and so on.
You're not wrong.
But as a practical matter Russia is already set up this way (Putin "owns" Gazprom and simply allows it's CEO to act like a minister in his government or a trusted subordinate).
You'd never want the official head of a country to also be the official head of a company because running a country takes a huge amount of work and you ultimately will need to delegate every kind of sub-division to someone else.
Minister of Education, CEO of State oil company, Minister of Defence, etc.
etc.
etc.
etc.
According to gazprom had a net income of 2.5 bn in 2020.
It's a lot but a modern army also cost a lot of money.
If we check we can have an idea of how much it cost yearly.
The netherland (who is a small western country, with a small army of 41k active personnel, and yes that's personnel not soldier) spend yearly five time more than what gazprom can afford.
