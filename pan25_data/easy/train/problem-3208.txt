Hi UK Expat living in America here ready to expand on that.
If you lived in the UK for more than 6mo during the outbreak you are barred from donating blood in the US.
I was born there during the outbreak, so I qualify for this restriction.
The reason for it is BSE is a prion disease.
Prions are weird, terrifying little buggers which are misfolded proteins and when they come in contact with other proteins like them, the other proteins go "Oh shit I'm doing it wrong?
It's supposed to be like that?
Aight" and misfold as well.
You can have them for decades without even being aware a ticking timebomb is quietly floating around in your system until it finds a buddy, fucks up its buddy, and then all the buddy's buddies start a cascade failure that leads to death within a year.
There is no test, no treatment, no cure.
The way the outbreak initially spread was due to cow byproducts being fed to the cows as part of their feed, so the cows were eating the infected nervous tissue of their brethren, and if a human ate contaminated meat, they could also end up taking in these prions.
They can be transmissible via blood, leading to a barring of the potentially infected donating, lest their secret ticking time bomb that no one knows about accidentally kills some poor fucker who needed a blood transfusion.
Dude.
Did you even read the paper/website?
Both of those sources are discussing evidence of fecal transmission in Chronic Wasting Disease.
NOT mad cow!
