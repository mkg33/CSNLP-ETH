Of course it is still possible to hide a dual citizenship in Japan if you are careful, but they take it very seriously if they find out.
And they will actively check up on foreigners who seek Japanese citizenship.
It's a bit easier for native Japanese to get by with a dual citizenship if they keep a low profile, because obviously the government doesn't have the resources, or the motive, to investigate every citizen's citizenship status, and it's very unlikely that the average Japanese citizen would be motivated or capable of securing a secondary citizenship.

They have adopted the same strategies of brazen lies.
Remember how Trump told blatant lies on a daily basis, while he held a 90% approval rating amongst Republicans.
His defenders claimed that he didn't lie at all, that the lies didn't matter, that everyone else was just as bad, that the lies were actually a justifiable and smart strategy, that it was just sarcasm etc... that's how it's been in Russia for centuries.
Lying as a strategy of confusing the public dialogue and to test loyalty.
Those who stand up for truth will get singled out and crushed.
Unsurprising.
The real purpose of this "church" is to promote Kremlin propaganda and recruit spies.
It is an organ of the state and it's so called priests are nothing more than agents of the Kremlin.
