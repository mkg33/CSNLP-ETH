Putting an explosive charge on a robot and blowing up the barricaded Dallas subject was the only way to kill him without putting additional police in extreme danger, given the unique and exigent circumstances of that particular case.
The precedent for a robot to to deliver deadly force was created in 2016 with the Dallas shooter, who had killed 5 cops, and barricaded himself in a parking garage where he could not be safely approached by police or reached with an armored vehicle.
He was on the phone with negotiators saying "come and get me, so I can kill more of you".
