At least the West stopped appeasing despots when Poland happened.
Took Georgia, Crimea, and a full invasion of Ukraine for the West to finally intervene.
Ukraine has been like Afghanistan for Russia as it has been for Pakistan and India.
Just a bufferzone from Nato like Afghanistan is for Pakistan funding terroist orgs to destabilize the country.
Validate?
Did you not read that Moscow is destroying power plants in hopes of millions of civilian casualties?
Russia isn't going to stop killing if the west decides to buy its propaganda.
It doesn't need to rely on brainwashing the west when it's own people live in a shitty modern day 1984.
It will continue to kill, rape, and torture Ukrainians until either there is a full on collapse of their government like the USSR(which is extremely unlikely considering the iron grip putin has in the terrorist state) , or things are going to get so dire that other nations will end in joining the fight anyways leading to the terrifying "escalation " Putin already says has happened once a damn week.
