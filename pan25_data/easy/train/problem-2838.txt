Arizona has started realizing how much the GOP has screwed them.
Unlike Texas, the state has started getting wise and sadly when John McCain died and Trump and company turned on his family and their narrative since he by one vote kept them from repelling the Affordable Health Care Act.
When they didn't have a DAMN THING to replace it.
Arizona didn't like that and while so many held on with the "Big Lie".
Now with Lake and company losing so much and all the former GOP government pretty much trying to scorch Earth as they leave.
I can see major change for the state.
I know my family down there is very happy.
This is anecdotal so don't take it as anything more than that, but one of the reasons slightly more progressive legislation seems to have been passing is (some) of the unaffiliated voters noticed for example when weed was legalized (first medically) that it wasn't harming people, that it was helping their older friends going through cancer or other struggles, and they learned about it more in the process of deciding whether or not to vote against it and realized it wasn't this scary monster it had been painted as.
