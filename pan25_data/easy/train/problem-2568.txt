I don't think it's that obvious.
AIS is a requirement for vessels over 300 grt for international voyages and vessels over 500 grt for regional.
Two of the 25 vessels they noted without AIS and in the region were from 95-130 m long, which could be any number of local trading vessels.
Plus, there's no need to turn off AIS, it can be spoofed as stated in the article, or Russia could have used submarines out of Kaliningrad where their Baltic fleet is based.
Blowing up their own pipeline is illogical as well; sure, it is (and I emphasise that it is!)
reasonable to point the finger at Russia, but not necessarily logical.
Since no info has been released, I can kind of believe that it was industrial sabotage; the big winners are the oil companies and traders.
Because Germany doesn't have any significant natural resources.
Germany has to import them from somewhere and other countries were either unwilling to sell Germany gas for a competitive price (US, Canada) or were unwilling to increase their supply to Germany (Norway, Netherlands).
It is always funny when people from countries with huge oil or gas deposits ask themselves why Germany didn't just do the same thing.
