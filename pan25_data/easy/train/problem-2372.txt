Edit: To answer comments yes all these countries are Muslim majority.
And as an American who is an immigrant from a Muslim majority country yes the religion is generally antagonistic to gays and non believers.
Although most other religions (including Judaism and Christianity) aren't very gay friendly either.
True.
But from all the countries in the region, Qatar has made incredible progress with many things in a short amount of time.
I think at this point there's more women in university than men for example.
So I have hope.
Yemen, Iran, Brunei, Mauritania, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan, United Arab Emirates, Pakistan.
It's not quite the same.
Russia actually did a pretty brilliant job on the PR front for both the world cup and the Winter Olympics.
Most of the press and coverage was positive for the country and most of the visitors reported having a really good time.
The police backed off, the locals were friendly, it went exactly as an authoritarian state looking to sport wash would want.
After that though.....
Afghanistan, Iran, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Libya, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen.
This is a great comment actually.
I've never really understood the sportwashing, but this makes a lot of sense.
It's not, look West we are just as good as you, it's look Arabia, we are also up to your standards.
