This is why honestly I do not foresee the political divide being fixed anytime soon.
Yes there will always be differences but when you have corrupt, genuinely evil, and blatantly extremist running the show on the right, things will go wrong.
Just look at what is happening in Florida, this is what republicans want.
Removing books, removing education, and simple indoctrination.
I saw it in full.
Jordan outright lied or misrepresented every "fact" that came out of his mouth.
Literally everything he said was varying degrees of a lie.
Everything.
It should be noted that they didn’t raid Pence’s house either.
Apparently they asked all former presidents/VPs to check their documents and turn over any classified material they had.
Pence did that, turned it over, and surprise surprise, the FBI didn’t have to raid his house.
The goalpost moving from the GOP to protect Donald fucking Trump still astonishes me, even though it shouldn’t at this point.
