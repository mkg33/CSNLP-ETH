She is worth over $10 million somehow.
I think that is built on an entire system of oppression and racism in her part of the country though.
I wonder just how much of that money came from programs aimed at improving Georgia's infrastructure, seeing as though her father owns a "construction(?)"

ANY and EVERY person knowing this, while not demanding her resignation has lost ALL credibility both patriotically and politically.
Texas would likely go out on their own.
They don't like welfare programs and social safety nets.
I can't imagine that they would increase their support to poorer states like Mississippi or Alabama.
Florida would probably do the same.
Most of Florida will be under water soon anyway.
Georgia might stay in the US along with Arizona and possibly North Carolina.
The rich red states wouldn't want to burden themselves with whatever is left.
They will build a wall to keep it Mississippians.
