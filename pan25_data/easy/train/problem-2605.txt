I have to wonder how many people across the country are living like this, defrauding and lying, but the rest of polite society lets it go.
Like, he held a fundraiser with the fake charity to benefit a real charity, but apparently kept all the money.
The real charity clearly got screwed over, but either didn't pursue it or got stonewalled.
I assume charities are perfect victims because charities are loathe to complain or file lawsuits, since they can't afford negative press.
Trump was known to abuse that.
False equivalency.
AOC has a mythology surrounding her of being Alexandra-from-the-Bronx when she spent most of her childhood growing up in cushy Westchester County to the north.
But some disingenuous image PR pales in comparison to outright fraud on just about anything and everything Santos has done, from lying about where he worked and went to school to grifting money meant for charity and running a Ponzi scheme.
This guy is a hardcore criminal, where AOC is more of an on-brand millennial using a filter.
