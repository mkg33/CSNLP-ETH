I am inclined to believe what the Baltic states say, as they have the most “skin in the game”, and they say they have and are having significant problems with the attitudes of Russians who recently moved there, saying that they will be next to be conquered and that they “deserve it” for being “traitors”… :/.
One friend of mine.
29yrs.
In may 2022 i told him to move here, because I had the feeling Putlers going to start sending people to their deaths, I really did!
This guy was living in St. Petersburg.
He told me "nah man, they ain't gonna do that, they send guys from Siberia and small places".
But, then, later the news broke, that they gonna "draft" (force) 300k more men to Ukraine.
I messaged my friend "get out, now, bfore they close the border".
It was evening, he messaged me back "yes, i'm packing stuff now".
He drove thru the night to the border and was able to get to this side because we had gotten him the required paperwork already in bfore may.
Joseph McCarthy?

Tankie is a term almost unanimously used by leftists/anarchists.
