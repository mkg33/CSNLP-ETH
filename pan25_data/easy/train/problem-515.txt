The IJN's two I-400 class aircraft-carrying subs (a third had been converted into a tanker) were originally going to attack the Panama Canal in an attempt to prevent the US Navy from bringing the Atlantic Fleet to the Pacific Theater, or to aleast slow it down, but the subs were then ordered to attack Ulithi Atoll after reconnaissance showed that fifteen USN carriers were at anchor in the atoll's lagoon, in advance of attacks on the Japanese main islands.
They did paint their planes to resemble American planes, which didn't sit well with the pilots, but the war ended before they reached Ulithi, and they were ordered to destroy their weapons (including launching the planes into the sea without unfolding their wings and stabilizers) before surrendering.
There's no mention of chemical weapons being in the plans for the Ulithi Atoll attack.
Edit-leaving it...sigh.
I don't know how that even happened.
I don't think I have ever in my life written the word seminary.
Cemetery, on the other hand... sadly too many times.
Given that a) the only time the corruption would ever be discovered in practice is a literal apocalypse scenario, and b) the secrecy involved out of necessity means audits and other less physical means of identifying the corruption would be far less likely to succeed, and c) the US has almost certainly been putting massive intelligence efforts into promoting and accelerating this particular corruption...
