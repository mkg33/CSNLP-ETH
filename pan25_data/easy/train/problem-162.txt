Obviously xenophobia is a major force for horrific evil in the world - and I will always voice my opposition to it.
I'm not scared of or opposed to something "other" because it's "other".
If you treat others with respect and don't force your beliefs on them (that includes family), we can be friends and allies.
I couldn't care less about your skin-color, country-of-origin, cultural idiosyncrasies or professed religion.
In fact, when we share this common understanding - I celebrate diversity, because it's beautiful, it makes people less parochial and can give rise to fresh ideas.
But still - many ideologies are extremely illiberal and inegalitarian - so they oppose that foundation that has to be common for pluralism to work.
did u see the amount of money they spent?
Literally 10 times or something like that than the last world cup.

There is a clear reason.
I'm opposed to any illiberal, inegalitarian, inhumane ideology - political or religious.
The more fervent or thorough they are in their illiberality and inegalitarian nature - the more opposed I am.
