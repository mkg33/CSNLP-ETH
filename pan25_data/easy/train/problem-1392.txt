Second, they are twisting what Trump tweeted.
Notice the news doesn't show the actual tweet just telling you what to believe was said?
What Trump said was voter fraud allows for the termination of rules, regulations, and articles including ones in the constitution.
That is a far cry from claiming Trump tweeted the constitution should be terminated, and he never said "return to power".
Republican moderate!?
Anyone who will not disown a candidate over a literal constitutional threat is not a fucking moderate.
Jesus fucking christ.
The few actual moderates (who dare to be openly critical of their party) get labelled RINOs, Secret Democrats, and Deep State Operatives and are ceremoniously excommunicated.
No need to debate.
I make no claims that he is right.
If Trump is so wrong, why need to lie about what he said?
If you fell for this lie, what other lies do you accept as fact?
