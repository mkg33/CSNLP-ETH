Neanderthals and modern humans are considered separate species by most scientists because of their physical differences (skull, body shape, all of which has distinct ranges for each species) as well as their differences in behaviour.
Though there was some contact between modern humans and Neanderthals (as evident by the inbreeding) for the most part, both populations lived very separate lives, both with very different manners in which they lived (in terms of group size, dietary preferences, artifacts produced etc).
Hey!
I work at a State museum (not in New York though), and I can confirm that literally every museum has there own mess of stuff that needs to be catalogued.
They did a count at my work, and said if they stopped taking in new artifacts and new pieces and worked on digitizing everything they currently had, it'd take about 30 years to get through it all.
That enormous amount coupled with underfunding and multiply that by at least the other 49 state museums (but I'm willing to bet the other thousands of museums each have their own) and you can really start to see the big picture.
