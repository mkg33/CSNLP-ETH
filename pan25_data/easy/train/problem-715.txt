I think you fell into the "fake news" problem.
Originally a lot of outlets reported that people had spotted T-62s.
But what they actually saw were T-62M and T-62MV.
We know that that's what they are.... because Ukraine ended up capturing all of those tanks.
They were the most advanced tanks in Ukraine's inventory along with the T-90A, T-90M, and T-90S that were also captured.
Russia has almost 4x as many tanks sitting in storage as it has deployed... and almost 10x as many armored vehicles.
Russia has a little under 40,000 infantry fighting vehicles sitting in storage.
If we're calling tanks and IFVs the same thing, that would put Russia at 50,000 "tanks" to America's 14,000.
50,000 sounds like way more than 14,000 to me.
Sure, but I wouldn't doubt for a second that sales are down and marketability is significantly impacted after countries get into the nitty gritty details of these platforms' performance against similar generation or modern NATO equipment.
I did!
Russia has been trying really hard to make their hardware marketable.
They wish they raked in what nato countries did.
Russia has a hard time finding friends to sell to.
