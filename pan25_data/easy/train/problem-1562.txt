You misunderstand, I am not saying Russia deserves its seat, to be honest none of them do, but Russia certainly deserves it even less, but its not a matter of deserving is a matter of practicality.
Stripping Russia of its seat sets the precedent that permanent seats can be stripped.
If the argument is of economic might then the UK and France aren't going to be liking it one bit, if the argument is off starting wars and committing war crimes then neither China nor the US are going to be liking that one bit.
If the argument is about being a sponsor of terrorism and terrorism tactics then I have sad news to give you because the one of the biggest sponsors of "freedom fighters" isn't going to like that argument a whole lot.
Exactly.
I am in no way saying that those wars are/were good.
I argued and protested against them as vehemently as I could, and am happy that they have largely ended (even if I think the withdrawals were mismanaged).
They were my number one issue for two election cycles.
