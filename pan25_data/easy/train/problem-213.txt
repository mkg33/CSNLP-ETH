>Zelenskyj: You can't stop him, because Putin is a dragon that has to eat.
To satisfy his appetite you give him one land after another, or at least pieces of them.
And their people shout: "Forward Stuff him some more Go!‚Äù But in today's world, neither borders nor oceans will stop the Russians.
I am absolutely sure of that.
I told a head of state who felt offended by me - and I have to say it wasn't Olaf - that delivering ten tanks made no sense.
What I meant: It's not about the number of tanks and there's no point in haggling over it.
Rather, this is a political decision, just like the sanctions.
Tank deliveries only mean that we are all united against Russian aggression.
And tomorrow it won't be tanks, it will be planes or something else.
Once the Russians get to your border, you will have to sacrifice your people's lives.
That is why what Ukraine is doing today is more favorable for your country.
While that would of course be good for Ukraine, isn't it a bit risky?
The Russians would certainly send several rockets towards it.
Ignore clickbait and sensationalist headlines.
The enemy offensive began days ago, it's not a blitzkrieg and may very well fail, setting up Ukraine for the counter-attack ISW.
