When everything came out about Trump, I could see how some of those documents the Archive wanted could be mistaken for personal paraphernalia.
The letter from NK's leader, signatures, gifts from dignitaries.
But when you go out of your way to hide classified documents amongst the junk, and then lie 3x times that you don't have it, that crosses a line.
I could see a Biden staffer accidentally slipping the wrong folder of papers into a cabinet and forgetting about it, the same way I can see a Trump staffer grabbing those gifts and letters - but no staffer has their hands on nuclear secrets, full stop.
Exactly.
Bidens team could have said nothing about this and no one would have ever noticed anything was gone like they didn’t for 6 years, and they still let it be known and gave them back.
There’s absolutely no real equivalency here.
It’s not even remotely close to the same situation to expect there to be a raid.
Yet the right will pretend to the end of time it’s the same thing, and the media will fall for it.
