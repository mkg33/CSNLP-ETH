The problem is the GOP will demand parity on the charges and consequences.
Even though the difference is literally an accidental oversight of a few documents vs willful and intentional theft of literally hundreds of documents followed by refusal to return said documents and continued refusal to disclose said documents.
Also in the case of Biden we're talking some documents not properly returned from the office where they were kept, with Trump we're talking serious state secrets kept at a resort that Trump marketed as a way for foreign powers to have access to the PoTUS.
Seriously this cannot be overstated, we do not know who all got to look at the documents Trump took, it could have been anyone, for all we know Trump may have actually made business deals with state secrets.
The absolute inability to tell how much Trump jeopardized is one of the scariest things about what he did.
