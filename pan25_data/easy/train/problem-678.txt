Yeah, and if Russias standards of maintenence are anything to go off, I wonder just how many Belarusian BMPs are operational considering their shoe-string budget.
I mean I don't think so, Belarus's army has all the problems Russia does except its a lot smaller, it has a shoe-string budget, and the people are under no illusions as to all of the above.
Edit: I see a lot of people speculating on this so I figure ill make it clear: Belarus's military has every single problem the Russian army except worse, and then add onto that they don't have inexhaustible manpower reserves.
They have a shoestring military budget as well as a population that isn't brainwashed like the Russians are; Minsk might very well see a civilian uprising if they entered the war, if they aren't forced to back out immediately from catastrophic casualties suffered in the initial attack across the border first.
Jackson is plenty fun!
4th of July and new years you get to play gunshot or firework.
Drive bys, crackheads, roaming packs of wild dogs, water doesn't work half the time, trash may get picked up once a week if they feel like it, dodging potholes.
It is cheap though.
