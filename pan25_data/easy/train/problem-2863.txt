Wrong, we want as many fellow Americans to be armed as possible.
As a pro 2A supporter I’m happy about getting as many guns out into law abiding Americans hands as possible.
It’s great that we are shattering gun sales records and minorities have been helping us achieve that.
Typically republicans don’t see things based on race and sexual preference like the left does, the left would argue that armed minorities are harder to oppress while the right would just be like an armed population is harder to oppress, we are all fellow Americans here, on the same side.
Sure.
you can call the cops.
They'll take 15 minutes to get there to save you but you save yourself in seconds.
And at the end of the day, they too will use a gun in these situations whether you like it or not .
Absolutely agree.
Gun bans are empty calories.
Democrats need to be addressing root causes.
We need to be doing the heavy lifting we were supposed to have been doing for the last 50 years.
End the drug war, reform this horrifying prison system, free health care for all including mental health and meds, deal with the fact that there is a permanent underclass who won't live by society's rules because those rules are designed to make them fail.
