China threatens soverign nations,while also persecuting its muslim population not to mention they already killed many of tibetians,it has shown that it does'nt miss a chance to assert its dominance by brutual force or otherwise,don't know if americans notice it often,but overwhelming majority of people will happily accept USA as global hegemon when compared to China simply because of behaviour of two states.
So that's all your passwords, you know, if you use a password app.
Which means billions of people's passwords.
Me personally?
I don't have access to anything that could endanger national security, but I do have access to things critical to my personal security... and China can't do shit with it.
The US government, who has the capability and possibly more care to prosecute me, I kinda want to keep them away from that info.
In any way that it would practically effect most Americans, their personal info is in better hands overseas than with the people who have direct control over their actual lives.
