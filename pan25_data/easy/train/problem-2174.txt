How?
With Ukraine controlling the land access to Crimea at that point, and the bridge gone, Russians in Crimea will have no way out other than via sea, and you can bet Russia won't be providing escape ships; in that scenario, Putin wants as many Russian citizens as possible to be stuck in Crimea so that when Ukraine takes it, Ukraine has to be the bad guy and deport hundreds of thousands of Russian citizens (who, having gone onto Ukrainian soil without a valid passport, were illegally present and thus subject to deportation; they're colonizers, not a legitimate pre-existing population).
Half cranks don't count.
I heard it spun once in the 90's and that cracked the iron Bloc.
But then the new owner attempted the rebuild himself, and he fucked it right up.
He's a shitty neighbour who doesn't care about anyone except himself, let alone his car.
Hopefully it goes to a good home, and gets the attention it deserves, so it can turn over, start running on all cylinders, and eventually join the neighbourhood show and shine.
...it's gonna take a lot of fucking work though.
