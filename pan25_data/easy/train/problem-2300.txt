That’s not true though.
IMO you’re looking at it from a western perspective.
Most cultures have lived in pretty good harmony with their environments creating the biodiversity over thousands of years that the west has been destroying over hundreds.
How true.
While the heavy impacts of logging and river industry hurts forested areas no doubt, can’t say that an increase in forested land tourism is without risk as well in a different level, to branch into that topic… As a wise and seasoned camper and traveler myself, I always worry about designated or dispersed camping and potential wildfire risks, which could wipe out a huge swath of land on its own.
Human caused fires (NON prescribed controlled burns) are so awful.
Happened right outside the Seattle metro last September, for one, with the Blot creek fire that choked out the region with bad smoke for nearly 2months.
Major fire determined human caused near campgrounds.
CO has seen its own terrible fires, including near gun ranges.
They’re not just caused by an open flame.
