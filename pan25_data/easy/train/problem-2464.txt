All sorts of things end up on bills that come from different budgets.
I guess it's possible that both items are coming from a discretionary fund, but that's unlikely considering the aid for Ukraine involves military equipment that's already been purchased and itemized in the defense budget.
People are dying en masse.
I can barely afford to survive in the US, but I'm also acutely aware that if the money isn't being spent protecting democracy and a democratic countries soverignity, it isn't getting spent on anything else that will help us either, as any budgets that involve something that can be construed as "hand outs" are shot down.
Likely not.
That's not how bills work.
Everything ok one bill doesn't all come from the same budget.
They stack items on bills as a manipulation tactic in order to guarantee something passes.
If they want to ban alcohol, they know that a bill banning alcohol would never pass.
But if they added something onto the bill like banning the dumping of radioactive waste in elementary school playgrounds, they're hedging their bets.
They're thinking that nobody is going to vote to allow radioactive waste disposal in elementary school playgrounds, so they'll have to vote yes, which also includes the alcohol ban.
