No, me and several others will not leave one of the most effective forms of communication in the world.
We are still fighting an information war and a lot of these suspensions are from the far right mass reporting left wing accounts and getting them suspended automatically.
They have been reinstated.
We are also using these tactics against the far right.
We should not cede extremely powerful tools of spreading propaganda in an information war.
We need to fight back by exposing our audiences to facts.
Those companies do not want to be associated with Twitter for brand safety.
Worst comes to worst we can create campaigns to boycott companies that advertise on Twitter.
If you are fighting this information war it is extremely important to try to use your discretion to figure out if people you are arguing with are arguing in good faith.
Engage with people who you know are real people, look at their accounts and see if it looks like a normal persons account.
Try to spread true information as much as possible so people who arent on reddit and arent deleting their Twitter arent swayed by the far right.
We dont know how much money Musk would put into this to keep it running as long as possible.
If we leave now we could be shooting ourselves in the foot and giving them complete control of information on an extremely powerful tool.
