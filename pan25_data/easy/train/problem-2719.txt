If someone had told me I would ever be on the same side as W and Cheney on anything, I’d have said they were crazy.
I also remember thinking that after W at least it couldn’t get any worse.

You truly are miracle workers.
I feel like we have allowed these nefarious actors to meddle in our elections, hijack our company systems, steel our technology wage misinformation warfare and cyber warfare on us and we should be extremely overt that it isn’t acceptable and a possible consequence for you is a physical response should we catch you doing it.
This Russian fuck who said they’re meddling right now in our election, should be hunted down.
It must be considered unthinkable to conspire against America in any way because the consequences are too big.
