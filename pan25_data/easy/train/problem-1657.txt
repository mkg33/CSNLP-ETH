Man do you want Trump in 24?
This is how you get Trump in 24.
Call a spade a spade; the optics on this are awful.
A huge catastrophe; POTUS goes take pics overseas and pothole Pete doesn't even talk about it, then Trump shows up with water and food.
And then to make the optics even worse, Pete comes the next day, following Trump around.
Only after they run a piece about how saving the environment means showering for 2 minutes every other day and riding a llama to work, followed by a "feel good" story about a grandmother of 8 who walks to works as a greeter at 3 different Wal-Marts so she can afford her heart medication being gifted a 1992 Hyundai Elantra by her equally struggling co-workers, followed by a report on all time record corporate profits, followed by an announcement that the DOJ has decided not to pursue animal cruelty charges against a congressman caught on tape fisting an endangered snow leopard because the next elections are 3 years away and they don't want to appear biased.
Optics dude.
It doesn't matter how you spin it.
Optics are not good for the Biden administration in this one.
