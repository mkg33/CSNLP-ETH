In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

There is only one police report on file ever for the abuse from 1990, and when law enforcement and state involvement ended within a week of that, the abuse got ratcheted up in retaliation so I wouldn't tell my teachers again.

That means there was never anything on record.
My father would attack me, and then my mother would sit there tending me while saying the whole time that I shouldn't have provoked him.
Like, htf does a 7yo provoke a fully grown adult to violence?
