The Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched a criminal investigation that is the largest in history, covering hundreds of prosecutions.
This investigation is focused on Donald Trump, and there is evidence that he is being criminally investigated based on the actions of grand juries and the execution of search warrants for individuals connected to Trump, such as Peter Navarro, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark, Rudy Giuliani, and Mike Lindell.
In addition, subpoenas have been issued to Trump associates and advisers, including Roger Stone and Sidney Powell, and members of Trump's administration, including Vice President Mike Pence's Chief of Staff and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, have testified before grand juries.
State officials in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and New Mexico have also been subpoenaed as part of the investigation.
All of this is related to the events of January 6th, and there have been 40 subpoenas issued to people in Trump's orbit in connection with that day.
