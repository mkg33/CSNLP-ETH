I wish I could be in the UK honestly there's too much wrong in this country.
Someone said it well "Majority rule doesn't work in a mental institution" So I highly doubt the ANC will be out of power anytime soon plus corruption is basically advertised everywhere you go, Its too deep in the roots so cutting a few branches won't help anything.
The people are easily manipulative especially the youth (my youth) as long as they get free money and beer than they will basically do anything.
I get it every country has its problems but these are worse cause there was and is so much potential in this country but people only care about themselves not about the future of themselves or our country as a whole.
And don't get me started on the crime rate and safety.
That's a mischaracterisation of our democratic issue.
It's such a common narrative that "poor black people are kept ignorant so that they will vote ANC out of loyalty" that we don't note that this exact same issue occurs in literally every democracy that has a first past the post voting system - America being the prime example.
