The current state of affairs from the DSA working within the Democratic Party is an alliance of convenience against the GOP.
The end result at this point is that contradictions like this happen, and if the GOP were to fall from political relevancy, it would not be completely surprising to see the progressives, social democrats, and democratic socialists break off.
Furthermore, and this is just from what I've observed as a member of the Seattle DSA, it reignited debate over whether the DSA should continue to operate within the Democratic Party or break away entirely.
Really?
Seems more like "I'll claim I'm your friend but stab you in the back the minute you actually risk impacting anything other than yourselves; I support unions so long as they don't hold any bargaining power beyond self-immolation; also even a tiny expenditure of political capital is too much to ask.
".
There’s a gigantic spectrum of regular progressive-to-liberal policies under social democracy that exist between “socialist” and “neoliberal” which accounts for the vast majority of democratic politician’s stances.
People on the left seem to love to forget they exist.
