But the company has struggled financially this year as it tries to move into a new business — the immersive world of the so-called metaverse — while also grappling with a global economic slowdown and a decline in digital advertising, which is the main source of its revenue.
Last month, Meta posted a 50 percent slide in quarterly profits and its second straight sales decline.
Its stock has dropped more than 72 percent this year.
Right before Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah & Kwanza.
Where is the outrage???
Twitter too!
How cold and cruel.
Oh yeah, anything to create a recession after fake inflation, huh?
Only slightly less horrible than denying a pandemic and its prevention and treatment and thus killing millions of people and jobs and a worldwide economic crash as a sacrifice for their economy.

An expanding universe.
The metaverse appears to have gained momentum during the online-everything shift of the pandemic.
The term today refers to a variety of experiences, environments and assets that exist in the virtual space.
