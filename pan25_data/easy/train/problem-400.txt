A church that’s acted as a 1 advocate for the spread of HIV in Africa by convincing its people that using condoms will send them to hell makes this request.
It’s insane.
Education & Harm Reduction > Abstinence & Punishment, for EVERYTHING.
Sex, alcohol & drugs, prostitution, etc.
You can’t stop people from doing these things.
So give them the info and resources to be as safe as possible.
So the organization could become destabilized, inhibiting their ability to kill Africans with anti-condom propaganda, and inhibiting their ability to transfer pedophiles around the world in order to help them escape consequences?
Yeah my dude.
A lot of these newspapers and agencies can't afford or won't send their own people for big international stories.
So agencies like these sell theirs to them.
Or however it works exactly.
I was raised catholic and it was browbeaten into me by church leadership as senior as an archbishop that using contraceptives of any kind of is one of the most grave sins one can make against god, it is wasting the gift of sexuality for reproduction, it is wasting the body given by god on base pleasures, etc.
