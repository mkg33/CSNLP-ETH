Multi-member districts.
Countries that have younger legislatures tend to have districts where you elect more than one rep for a district at a time, so that younger, less-experienced members of a party can more easily ride the coattails of more well-known candidates.
And states can do this under their own election laws, if they decide to.
We just set up our system before multi-member districts were really in use.
Itâ€™s time to fix that.
It's from looking at actual left-leaning countries who don't consider things like free health-care and post-secondary education as "extreme left-wing concepts" and see them as beneficial investments in future generations...
Agreed.
But it is also proven that the older you get, the more set you are in your ways.
Someone age 60 has the same interests as someone 80, retirement and healthcare.
They also are far less aware of the needs of the working population which is in their 40s and people that are raising kids.
That younger population is more in touch with the current societal needs than the older generation.
The operating age of the government should be similar to society and the workforce, not close to retirement age.
50s average is better.
Mid 40s average would be ideal.
