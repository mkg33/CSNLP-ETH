Missouri was solid blue when I moved here in the late 90’s.
It’s gotten more red over time as the Dems have abandoned the white working class in favor of more progressive and coastal focused causes.
Missourians are pretty practical people and not very ideological.
As you say, they elect republicans but will support more liberal common sense issues.
They want leaders that will help them.
They don’t care much for abstract social justice issues or the modern climate change movement.
They see themselves as real conservationists who actually go outside to camp, fish and hunt and support the management and preservation of the lands to do these things.
Nothing about the modern Democratic screams we care about white middle America and as such they have lost their appeal.
It’s similar to a lot of states in the Midwest and Appalachia that were solid blue until recently.
They don’t really have anyone advocating for them but at least the republicans aren’t actively disparaging them and basically blaming them for all the countries problems.
So it actually is pretty logical.
