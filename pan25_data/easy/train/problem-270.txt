Do republicans realize how unpopular election denialism is?
I am not even that big of fan of democrats, but I will vote for them aggressively when republicans behave like this.

They don't care about laws, or even the Constitution, despite what they'd have you believe.
Sure, they'll use them, when it's to their advantage, but as soon as it becomes inconvenient, they'll dispense with any pretext of caring.

It's practically doublespeak.
