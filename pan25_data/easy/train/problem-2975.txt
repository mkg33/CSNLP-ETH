I would have loved to have had any understanding of the long-lasting implications of taking on the student debt I took on when I went to College, when I didn't even care about going to College, I was just a kid who had been told his entire life he had to go to College, and College prep and applications was just a thing I was marched through by literally every adult in my life.

Republicans are objectively worse for reducing wealth inequality and they embrace that with the excuse that heightened wealth inequality is a byproduct of a healthy, capitalist system.
This is an ideologically inconsistent stance, especially since this forgiveness goes towards middle-class Americans who, otherwise, wouldn't be able to overcome this debt for most of their adult lives (along with being unable financially to buy a home, get married, have children, etc.)
because college has gotten drastically more expensive over time.
