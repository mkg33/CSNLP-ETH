So instead of focusing on teacher pay letâ€™s weaken public education further by shoving school choice and vouchers down our throats What could go wrong?

Texas has a little known provision in taxing law that keeps the sale pricing of real estate private if the transactional participants do choose.
Couple that with strict property laws that forbid an assessing agent from trespassing without invitation and you get something akin the Londonâ€™s Iceberg Houses.
Follow the sale of properties in say Highland Park or The Woodlands on a realtors site and then look up the assessed value later.
Guarantee itâ€™s assessed for a small fraction of the actual sale price.
The rich threaten taxing authorities with a courtroom battle if thereâ€™s any attempt to raise the assessed value and the taxing authorities are so under resourced in this realm that they canâ€™t fight back.
The Dalllas Observer found it interesting a few years ago that mark Cubans well publicized $7MM home sale was only valued on the tax rolls as around $750k.
This under assessment for wealthy properties is soooo common in Texas.

And indoctrinating far right, christian nationalist beliefs and ideologies.
Programing kids at a young age.
Those schools will stop teaching history.
Stop teaching foreign language.
Start teaching hatred and beliefs that otherness is dangerous.
Instilling fear.
Finally- a society of clueless people who wonâ€™t know how to function in the real world with decency and equality.
Ultimately it will lead to more and more people by age 18, willing to fight for their leader Abbott-take arms-war etc.
