The Nazis liked to claim they had superior technology, weapons and tactics, while the Soviets only won because they were more of them, in a way they were implying they should have won, but it was an "unfair" game from the start.
I know a few.
I've never heard a Russian claim the rest of the world should be grateful to him, while being born decades after the end of WW2.
Americans on the other hand... You'll hurt a few egos if you claim other countries had a significant impact.
On Reddit, every time the Soviet effort is mentioned, Americans come with their "muh lend-lease".
Some people just can't share the glory.
In reality, the Nazis had beyond shitty tactics and had insufficient high tech weaponry, relying mostly on horses and walking for transport of the majority of troops, and designing hard to repair, overcomplicated machinery whilst taking most people out of factories to fight because they were stupid enough to think they only needed 3 months to win, and thus didn't need supplies or logistics.
