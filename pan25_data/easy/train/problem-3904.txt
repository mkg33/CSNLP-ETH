Pandemics are becoming a more frequent threat as humans encroach on natural areas, wildlife migrate and mingle more in new areas with new species and close to humans, and domestic factory farming fails to address its sanitation and over medication issues.
This is bullshit.
We should have been at doomsday already.
10 seconds with ukraine war?
Weak Covid pandemic should have brought us to 20 seconds to doomsday.
Bullshit.
There was also a new study article published about elephant extinction - decrease of 60% in some over the last 10 years, around 450,000 left in the world, 40k in Congo, which could reduce rainforest carbon capacity by 6-9% (which would be accumulative on top of deforestation).
Theres other things to consider as well.
A community in Arizona just had their water shut off.
Yes, I know, its Arizona, but the migrations are beginning in more places than sub saharan Africa now.
War and conflict always begin over resources, especially food and water.
ridiculous.
2020 was closer to midnight than the cuban missile crisis despite the fact there was no covid at that time.
putting it even closer because of the ukraine war is stupid.
