Give Gerry Willis's biography of John Wayne: John Wayne's America a read.
In it, Willis outlines Wayne's history of opportunism and cowardly behavior.
Wayne made every excuse in the book to keep from having to go fight in WW2 and spent the entirety of the 60's making 'patriot' movies and aligned himself with the far right.
A common theme in Wayne's movies is a need to break the law in order to uphold the common good.
Wayne's fans adored this brand of fascism as it justifies their backwards idea that violence in the name of preserving their vision of the republic supersedes the law and even the constitution.
That's not to say Wayne invented this idea, but rather he is symptomatic of a sense of so called 'riotous lawlessness' that has plagued America for a very long time.
Exactly.
Like...states literally don't have rights under the constitution.
People have rights; states have powers.
"State powers" just isn't as sexy as "state rights".
