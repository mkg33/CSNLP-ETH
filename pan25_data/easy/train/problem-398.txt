The teacher doesn't need to use pronouns almost at all while teaching (yes, I know "you" is a pronoun).
Names and "you" (singular and plural) are sufficient for addressing someone, which is done in the second person, and teachers can easily use substitute names for pronouns when referring to someone in the third person singular, or "they" for third person plural (possibly also third person singular.
Not how it works.
The title, by law, passes to the Secretary of State (who is also a Democrat).
There is no way for Lake to become governor since she has NEVER been elected to any office in Arizona.
She is delusional.
Republicans are the ones that have openly and deliberately passed laws fully aware they are unconstitutional when they do so with intent of trying to get reviewed in a favorable Supreme Court, and will even hire outside attorneys to litigate it when the attorney general says they're not defending a law that's clearly contrary to supreme court precedent.
I know.
I was trying to explain to someone who read your comment and didn’t understand how succession of the governor title goes.
I was trying to show that no matter what Kari does she won’t become governor because she has never been elected to any public office.
So many people are clueless how the political system actually works.
I know someone who thought Kari would become governor if Hobbs was actually impeached and had to explain how she is not in the line to succeed anyone as governor.
