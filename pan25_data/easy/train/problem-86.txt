Twitter can’t really go bankrupt any more.
They can cost him money to remain in operation but until he has no money it is impossible.
He can file for bankruptcy to protect himself from the stupid debt he took to buy it.
But ultimately he could just as easily pay off the debt.
Places almost nobody actually uses.
What the far right actually want is to try to force everyones to listen to/read what the bullshit spout.
Precisely.
Twitter isn’t going anywhere.
He isn’t going to break it up and he isn’t going to be able to walk away from his debt.
It’s not like he’ll get better terms immediately after buying the company.
It’s just non-sense at the moment.
Banks require collateral.
Usually hard assets like property or capital investments (large equipment).
Twitter is mostly intangible IP.
The bank can’t really sell the idea or algorithms of Twitter for much in a secondary market (remember Trump basically copied and pasted Twitter for Truth Social.
But to put it succinctly, he can't loose more than the total value of his stake in the now non-public Twitter corporation unless he decides to pump more money.
But what is Twitter but a bunch of assets and (you guessed it) liabilities... Those debts don't fall directly to the owners because of the corporate veil.
However, debts that are owed by a corporation can also be required to be personally guaranteed by officers of the company as part of the terms of the loan.
