Definitely, but this one is huge and has totally no purpose other than to prolong putin's reign which he abruptly shortened after starting it and is happening in 21st century in the middle of Europe where people have low tolerance to violence and thought to have learned their lessons from world wars.
Absolutely awful.
This is the Russian greatness that Putin is offering and showing to the world.
We need to continue to support Ukraine in every way possible.
Send weapons, ammo, supplies, financial aid.
Anything to help these people with their fight against this terroristic regime.
Every.
Fucking.
Russian.
Who does nothing to actually stop the war, overthrow totalitarian government, fight even for THEIR OWN COUNTRY'S FUTURE.
Absolutely despicable.
The Russian's have sunk to a new low, just when you thought they had plumbed the depths of evil.
The West needs to do more for Ukraine.
That's different people you're taking about, the ones who helpless are usually oppose the current government for years or decades but it's the reality that there's not much they can do against the current militarized totalitarian regime which has set up in Russia, look at 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, 2020 Belarusian protests, recent Iranian protests and many other similar cases including Nazi Germany, when the government has the military and police power you're in a bad position when you're minority and majority has been brainwashed for 20+ years - if you exclude soviet times, these people aren't crazy fascists as some may paint them but they prefer to look away and walk the line, pretending to be on the good side.
But that's not for us to worry about.
Our work is simple, see russian occupant - shoot this fuck on sight.
Rince and repeat, until the last one of these raping, looting, torturing sons of bitches are removes from our land.
