The GOP tolerates antivaxxers because they fall under their base.
But they don’t want to do anything that would actually hurt Pfizer’s bottom line too badly, because a profitable Pfizer can give them more bribes campaign contributions.
Eeeeehhhh?
?,,, any press is good press!
Maybe they’ll bring some uppers to stay awake during the meeting, and some flow max to keep the old farts pissing regular, and some benzos to keep everybody, calm, and a little pseudo ephedrine to keep the sinuses dry, and everybody just alert enough to not have to blow their nose,… And may be a little Xanax for the agitated ones.
I strongly agree with those moves.
The note you made about barring them from any industry they had purview over is for an even longer period than I've ever heard but I like it.
I'd honestly just like to see them barred from the private sector in any capacity for an extended period of at least 7 years.
Give them good pay and a good pension after at least 2 terms so they have no reason to go off doing things they shouldn't.
