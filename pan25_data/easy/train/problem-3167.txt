Italian.

DeSantis is devoid of ideology.
He just does whatever he thinks the base wants.
He has no actual beliefs or values, which is pretty similar to Trump.
But it also means that any fascist beliefs he seems to exhibit are pretty much a byproduct of representing the Republican base, which yearns for a strong authoritarian daddy, not something DeSantis is genuinely trying to push.
I think the danger with DeSantis is that he actually listens to his "handlers" in a way Trump never did.
But he's really just a standard Republican shill, he just happened to embrace Trump's strategy of never giving a fuck.
