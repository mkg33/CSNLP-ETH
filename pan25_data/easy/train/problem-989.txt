Passes away from some health issue?
I have it on good authority that his health is astonishingly excellent and that he was the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.
I doubt that?
That's not something they can base a decision on, because they have no idea when he'll die.
It's more likely about getting their ducks in a row and making sure they build a solid case against him.
Securing a conviction against someone rich, famous, an ex-president, and has sizeable public support is difficult.
The case will be in court for ages because of his ability to throw an army of lawyers at it which will keep the case tied up in legal loopholes for months if not years.
Then there's the issue with the court of public opinion.
His followers will be crying election fraud, witch hunt, and every other talking point they've been taught to parrot.
Prosecuting someone like that requires a lot of leg work before the indictment even goes out.
They need to make sure the case is solid and has no cracks to be exploited.
