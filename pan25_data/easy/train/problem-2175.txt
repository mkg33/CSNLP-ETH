It's the entire country.
My wife was a public school elementary teacher for about a decade after college.
She taught in the Chicago public school system for about a decade.
When we moved to another big city, she did the same thing for another two years, but that was it.
She couldn't take it anymore and was being broken by it.
She would literally come home in tears everyday.
Her administration was a fucking joke, the pay was absolutely depressing, and she had anywhere from 32-45 kids (1st, 2nd, and 5th grade depending on the year) in her classroom.
It was an impossible and thankless task.
2) I cannot condone any organization that operates the way the Republican party accuses Antifa of operating.
The fake antifa of Republican fearmongering is a group of politically motivated domestic terrorists.
Fortunately antifa in the real world is nothing like the antifa of Republican mythos.
1) Antifa is a real and gets things done.
But they arent anything like Republicans describe them.
Mostly they go to rallies and harrass neonazis and other openly White Supremecist events.
