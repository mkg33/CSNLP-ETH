Just like old WWII artillery, Im thinking a newer nuke designed not to go off like that would be..... mostly safe.
Then again, we have to trust Russia on that.
The fission reaction of the plutonium-239 triggers a secondary fusion reaction which usually contains hydrogen-3 (tritium).
The fusion reaction itself doesn't release much energy itself, but it does release a ton of energetic neutrons which blast their way through the compressed fissile material and set off more chain reactions.
Tritium has a half-life of just over 12 years, so the tritium in a thermonuclear weapon has to be replaced periodically or the efficiency of the weapon will drop.
It will still work, just not as well.
There's a completely different alternative explanation.
They may have used the nuclear capable platform to test the ability of delivering an actual nuclear warhead to Ukraine.
Overwhelming the missile defense and sneaking a tactical Nuclear rocket through successfully is definitely an option that they may be testing.
