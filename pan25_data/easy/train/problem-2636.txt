Left needs to mobilize because trump is back on top on the conservative subreddits, whereas before he announced officially they had turned on him.
Donors don’t vote more than anyone else in the primaries, if trump wins, and he will, he’ll bully everyone out of the way and desantis said he wouldn’t run against trump.
Trump is not going away and shame on the media acting like it’s 2015 all over again and that Trump isn’t a threat.
When he is the nominee republicans will fall in line.
The alternative they are told, is Biden destroying America.
Better a pedophile than a democrat.
Doesn’t anyone remember that motto of theirs?

The US has unregulated capitalism deeply embedded in the democratic processes.
I'm not sure if this is considered a feature or a bug though.
Maybe Americans believe that capitalism should have strong influence so the super rich can have more power?
