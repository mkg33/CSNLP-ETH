Nailed it man.
I grew up in a small town in Arkansas.
I was racist.
I was raised that way.
I was taught to fear two specific colors of people.
There was maybe one black person in our community.
I imagine it was a rough life.
Then Katrina hit.
Tons of new people of color were being bussed in.
It was so bad at the other school in town that they ended up sending them all to ours.
Which came with its own difficulties for them.
But it opened my eyes so so much.
I am still really ashamed of some of my prior beliefs and things that I had said.
But I also am proud that I will shit on my family anytime I'm back home.
Because it's almost inevitable it's going to come up.
I grew up and they stayed.
I think hate will die out a lot more in the next 50 years.
Prejudice may take a bit longer, but I think starting with millennials, we are on a better path.
I will be brutally honest and say I'm a bit uncomfortable if I'm in a large group as the only white person.
But I have to imagine what it must be like on the other foot.
I suffer it to grow, but also it feels like a bit of homage.
