The idea that it's Satan is extra-Biblical, originating with things like the Book of Job.
Point is, Satan (as we know him today) is a concept that the authors of the Old Testament did not possess.
The Satan of the New Testament is still not fully formed to how we know him today.
Most of that came from Patristics, Dante's Inferno, and Paradise Lost.
For instance, in the New Testament, Hell not specified as being hot, that was decided by allegorical interpretation of when in Revelation John talks about a pit and a lake of fire.
There was a pit outside of Jerusalem, a valley, where trash was thrown and constantly burned.
John was likely just talking about being thrown in the trash heap, not into some mythical place deep within the earth.
Hell was actually cold, with early ideas of the Fallen Angel being imprisoned in ice.
Another.
Numbers 5:11 the trial of bitter waters.
Basically, if a husband thinks his wife has cheated, he can ask the priest to force her to drink bitter water for an abortion.
