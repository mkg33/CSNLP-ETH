This is going to be a rough two years... the debt ceiling fight alone...
I'm not a religious man, but I'm definitely praying and hoping for the best, because Speaker McCarthy power has been whittled down and he will have no choice but to acquiesce to the demands of the far right for fear of being vacated from the chair by any one person.
He already promised to hold the debt ceiling hostage for spending cuts, as well as a willingness to use government shutdowns for negotiating purposes.
We saw this under the last far right-run House under Boehner.
This should not be a surprise for anyone watching.
