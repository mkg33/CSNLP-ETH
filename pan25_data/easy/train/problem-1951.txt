The only reasoning for voting for Trump as a leftist is the belief that it would be tempered by a Democratic Congress and after 4 more years of Trump, more progressives would win elections and the corporate stooges like Manchin and Sinema wouldn't be able to block progress until Republicans inevitably take back over.
No one said they did.
Democrats made Sinema leave the party though in general.
She was Censured by the Arizona state party, all indications were she would face opposition in a Primary, and she likely has a better chance at being re-elected as an independent anyway given that the majority voting block in AZ is Republicans followed by Independents, and only then Democrats.

That's debatable.
Did the country move to the left after Bush's second term?
By all measures yes.
