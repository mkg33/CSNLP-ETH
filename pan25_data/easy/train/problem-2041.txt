That is true... After the earlier immigrants "made it", they tended to discriminate against the later-arriving immigrants.
What's noteworthy in the US's treatment of Chinese immigrants and laborers is the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act and Geary Act, which is something that did not happen to other groups.
Asians from other countries were targeted as well by other restrictive immigration laws.
The US did finally condemn the historical mishap of excluding Chinese immigrants in 2010s though.
Hopefully, the US remains welcoming to immigrants who seek a better life here.
Not necessarily.
Other one-party states (specifically: those that do not have primarily resource-extraction-based economies) have been able to transition to democracy.
Consider Taiwan and Japan.
Consider India, even.
Wait, WHAT?
I’ve listened to like every Metallica album (including the one we don’t speak of) although mostly the first 4 and a bit of DM/hardwired and kinda ignore everything in between that’s just hard rock.
Black I’ll give some love sometimes.
