I disagree, the longer term outcomes is that their base isn't large enough for them to win elections, they need independents.
Pardoning Trump will not prevent him from continuing to be a thorn in the GOP's side.
If he's in jail and no longer able to have access to his "base", he can't send them emails, he can't stir them up and they will move on past him to someone else.
If he's still a thorn in their side, he will continue to back candidates that are unelectable in general elections.
He will continue to cause problems to the GOP itself.
They will pretend to help him but Kemp can claim that he can't pardon Trump without looking partisan.
If Trump no longer has access to his megaphone he can't pressure anyone and the party can move on past him.
As to New York, it's his organization and his money that is in trouble there.
He has not been "trapped" as of yet but it remains to be seen if they will find further evidence of his involvement.
It's possible he can be brought up on charges but it's also possible they will not be able to go directly after him.
They might only be able to hit the organization.
I'm not certain if he's running an LLC or something else and that distinction could prevent them from directly coming after him.
