The idea that this will drive off moderates and independents is ridiculous.
Moderates and Independents who are attracted to DeSantis's brand of right-wing populism most likely already are skeptical of the coronavirus vaccines.
The bungling of the public messaging and bi-partisan dissatisfaction with the degree of some of the mandates, especially the effects on POC and people who are poor (who were more disproportionately negatively affected or have a historical background of distrust with vaccines) when it comes to moderates and independents, means a lot of people who aren't full-blown "anti-vaxers" have been skeptical or disapproval of the COVID vaccine.
A lot of people also saw the COVID vaccine as sort of like the flu shot, and didn't approve of being what they felt was coerced into getting a vaccine they felt was non-essential, these pseudo-Libertarian independents and moderates are the ones who DeSantis are gonna attract the most, so he's actually playing into his base.

Those without underlying health conditions may be able to return to work more quickly.
