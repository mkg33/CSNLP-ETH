His opponents say that, certainly, but things are a little bit more complicated.
When you have very high tax rates, you can actually free up more money and even higher government revenue by lowering rates.
The "sweet spot" for that is somewhere close to a combined 70% range, which is well above what's seen in the US today.
It only has benefits when reducing down to that level and reducing tax rates substantially lower doesn't really do much unless you're doing it into the teeth of a big financial crisis or recession when it can offset some of the losses from that and the damage to the public purse can be handled by tax increases when there's more to tax again.
