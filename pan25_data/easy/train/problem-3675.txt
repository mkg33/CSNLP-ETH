Smaller European countries switching over to EVs will do nothing but provide good feelings if larger countries that are much more reliant on vehicle transportation have large swaths of their population still priced out from EVs a decade from now.
Nope.
But 5 years from now when the grid hits capacity the EU will have to either approve major nuclear projects by 2030 or accept more Russian gas.
There really is no alternative, and the only thing holding it back are German taxpayers and French steelworkers.
Both should be able to find agreement.
Elsewhere in Europe, Ukraine has already started the process to replace it's Soviet reactors with American Gen 3 designs.
Poland too.
This is likely to happen since Ukraine benefits massively from using safer forms of nuclear energy, and Europe will lose if they can't articulate a similar works program within Europe's core itself.
Same with me.
I'm on board, but not until it's at least comparable in convenience.
Ill even pay a little more to help the environment, but I'm not sacrificing everything.
Unfortunately, consumers ignorantly assume every electric on the market is equally economical.
It's why marketing continues using the misleading metric MPGe instead of the more precise kWh/100 miles.
