>Employees in sectors including transport, education and energy across France will take part in Thursday's strike, with major protest marches expected in Paris and other cities.
I don't think you get it man.
They'll just get five.
Or ten.
They do not give a fuck.
All that matters is they have power and they have the means to secure it, strike or not, if they so desire.
Edit: disregard!
NPR has wildly mislead me.
But, happy that at least this has been corrected by real Frenchman.
If they weren't to extend the retirement age, an elderly person will find themselves in one of two scenarios imo : 1) SS payments are too small to live off of, so the person rejoins the rat race at 77 2) the SS payment run out at a certain age like say 85 and then you're fucked becuase you're too old to get back in the workplace and now you're just a burden on your younger family members.
you're expected to increase time spent in the rat race in this case because people are living longer and thus are getting payouts for longer than before, so in order to fund the SS programs for those people, and yourself when you reach retirement age and live 20+ years after that, they are trying to extend the retirement age.
But a lot more peaceful than the first one.
That I always found interesting.
They kept having the revolutions but they got, as far as stuff like that goes, relatively more peaceful.
I'd have expected the opposite.
