I don't blame you.
It's more surprising seeing teachers STAY at this point.
How this country treats its teachers is shameful and disgusting.
I hope you find or have found fulfilling employment that compensates you adequately, if not much better.

As far as the general schtick of all criticism of school curriculums is ridiculous I think basically the notion that educators could dictate what values where emphasized to their kids in the primary belief forming institution in America without a high degree of community engagement and discussion is both absurd and deeply undemocratic and not all reducible to strawmen like the truth about slavery and evolution which are not really where the controversy lies at this point.
They of course created a backlash that is altogether ridiculous in the demands now being sought but this is largely because the NEA and school boards sowed the wind by rejecting more moderate demands and rejecting engagement and are now reaping the whirlwind in the form of united front between reasonably concerned parents and lunatics.
