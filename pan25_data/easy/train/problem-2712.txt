Oh good, I didn't realize he was in Supermax.
I was going to say "Nope, into the hole with you," but I guess he's already there.
Itâ€™s genuinely near impossible.
You would have to have the highest level of corruption to pull it off.
Like the Warren and guards would essentially have to hold doors open for him.
Definitely.
That said, having a guy who who spent a big part of his life ordering the killing of children to send a message or hanging the mutilated bodies of his rivals off of bridges, or whatever else he did, having to spend the rest of his life there doesn't cause me to lose sleep at night.
Interesting.
I once talked to a guard from Florence, Colorado.
She didn't work at Supermax but a lower security prison there.
She said that every escapee always runs toward the mountains where they are ill equipped to survive.
If an escapee hid in the city they might be able to blend in and laylow but in the mountains thay suffer from exposure and are found in bad shape and are rescued and reimprisioned almost glad to for the "three hots and a cot".
