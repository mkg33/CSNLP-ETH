"You know all those things we did up until this point?
That's nothing by comparison to what we're going to do next It'll make what we did before look like we were caring maternal mothers by comparison You'll look back to all those things we did up until now and say, 'How sweet they were back then, a kindness even' Ohhhh you wait and see You'll SEE all the consequences you'll get Consequences GALORE You'll think you're at a Costco, but with only CONSEQUENCES inside!

The U.K. isn’t giving Ukraine any fighter jets, we don’t have any front line jets that would be suitable, eurofighter & F-35 are too complex for an airforce like ukraines not to mention the operational costs of these platforms and the US wouldn’t want their F-35s falling into the hands of the Chinese or Russians.

She had "Christmas" tattooed on one thigh and "New Years" tattooed on the other thigh.
She would ask her gentlemen friends if they would like to drop by between the holidays.
