I was writing an op-ed for the onion along the lines of "The Onion sues real life for content infringement" but I ran out of steam about 3 paragraphs in.
It's really more of a headline than an actual article.
Christian Nationalists support GOP candidates.
They have a large voting block.
They supported Trump first term.
He was instrumental with Mitch McConnell getting three judges added to SCOTUS.
They got Roe decision on abortion saying it belongs to the states.
This wasn’t a legal decision it’s a religious decision.
Republican governors wasted little time banning abortion in some states other gave after so many weeks no abortion.
Now they have Desantis and Niki Haley whose religious tweets are designed to gather Christian Nationalists support.
Trump was their candidate they ignored his faults to get a foothold in SCOTUS.
They have the House of Representatives they already want a federal ban on abortion.
They want same sex marriage overturned.
Christian Nationalists want to blur the line between church and state.
They’re close to their agenda.
