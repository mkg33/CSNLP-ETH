For those cheering on the failure, from the article: "Many large tobacco companies, including British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International and Philip Morris, have their international headquarters in Switzerland.

The thing about Austria is tabaco and nicotin products can only be sold by tabaco speciality stores (they also sell newspapers lottery tickets and kids magazines) thing of a liqueur store in the US but for tabaco products and somehow we still have the highest rate of u deranged smoking we recently even increased the age for smoking from 16 to 18 and nothing changed (16 year Olds where grandfathered in BTW).
We also have those horrific pictures on the cigaret packs with missing toes and cancer and shit like that but nothing we do helps at all.
