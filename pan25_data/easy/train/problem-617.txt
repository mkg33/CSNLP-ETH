You can’t spell CONServative w/o the Cons and trump is the biggest of them all.
He will 100% be the 2024 republican candidate and unfortunately it’ll be a close race.
Most of his base is poor, ignorant, and racist.
But they are many.
Most live in poverty stricken areas with ever shrinking economies and feel like they’ve got there back against the wall.
Trump has given them someone to blame (Mexicans, African Americans, “libs” etc..) so no one is looking at the 1% with all the money.

Trump,unfortunately, is not going anywhere.
