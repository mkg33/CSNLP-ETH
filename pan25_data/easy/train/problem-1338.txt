From that point of view, the battle and the staggering losses were a sad complete and utter waste of life.
There was objectively zero tactical value to Stalingrad.
Hitler detoured from the original plan on a whim because of the name of the place, and Stalin defended it because of the name of the place (anybody who points out that the Russians wanted to defend all places because they were being invaded overlooks the fact that no other defence was given as many resources as Stalingrad was).
A real pointless devastating human tragedy.
No?
Why would I ask that?
Which outcome depends on what they want?
If they want to agitate Russia, then that's their decision, but they'll have to live with the consequences as well.
Sucks to have Russia as a neighbour, but if you want to be an asshole, don't expect Russia to turn the other cheeck, why would they, lol.
Who gives a shit about whether or not they are part of Russian territory?!?
Russia, rightfully, feels threatened so they will react accordingly, to whats in their best interest.
If that means invading every country before it joins NATO then that's what they'll do.
How is that so difficult to grasp?
