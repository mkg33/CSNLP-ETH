>But some people are disenrolled even though they remain eligible for Medicaid because they either don’t receive their renewal notice, can’t provide documentation required by the state, or they don’t submit the documents by the deadline, among other reasons.
HHS has estimated that 6.8 million people will lose Medicaid coverage even though they remain eligible for the program.
The article I linked states that approximately 6 million people that qualify for Medicaid are going to lose their coverage over this, and you're telling me it's not necessary.

We need to expand health coverage, not cut it.
Pandemic or no pandemic.
