For 34 years of my life, I have seen this happening every time with Israeli politics.
"Bibi is this, Bibi is that.
He will lose the election bla bla".
But one mention of Hamas and Iran, his party or extreme right-wing ideology, wins the election.
For Israel, a sense of security is more important than progress, and they always are swayed by some sick and twisted tactics of the right-wing using Hamas and Iran to win elections.
You say that, but once they start talking about slaughtering Palestinians and how much Hamas and Iran threaten them, they will win the next election.
Like always.
You do realise the majority of Israel are secular - I agree with you completely re religious but jobs of any religion but this conversation is about Israel as a whole not the religious but jobs that unfortunately happen to be in power currently due to a flawed politics system (similar to the us) - as a side note the majority of Jews around the world are secular and left leaning (Jewish people as a% are far more supportive of lgbt rights and other social issues - in the USA they vote 70%+ democratic - i assume the other 30% are where the religious but jobs reside).
