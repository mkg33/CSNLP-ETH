Yeah I spent all night looking at outstanding counties back in 2020 and came to the conclusion that Biden won the morning after the election.
It was incredibly narrow and it was based on county by county analysis and I’m not a professional when it comes to elections.
Biden won both overwhelmingly, FYI.
I mean, he won Mesa by +32 points, except north of university in one precinct Trump won +11 but all 8 other precincts Biden crushed.
Won Gilbert +5.2.
Interestingly, 102K people didn't vote for governor (and 90K skipped the Senate race), and I would assume those are mostly some mix of the Lake-averse independents and McCain-type Republicans who couldn't get behind Hobbs or couldn't bring themselves to vote for a Democrat and instead just showed up to vote for their reps in congress or the legislature (lots of people like this out there—see the "none of these candidates" voters in Nevada, for example).
But no one lives there.
You can look at the and zoom in to Maricopa county.
I mean, an area 5 times bigger then Phoenix in eastern Maricopa had eight votes cast in 2020.
