Like the new green import tax passed by the EU wich build on carbon taxes.
Since companies try to avoid taxes like it is the plague a carbon tax should reduce a companies carbon emission.
Sadly a lot of companies will avoid this tax by just moving to a country without that tax but with the new import tax wich lvls a special tax against companies based in countries with a lower carbon tax.
So now the companies have 3 option lower your carbon so you pay less pass on the cost to the consumer and get out competed by companies who reduced carbon and also get out competed by companies who do not pass on or do not pass on and out compete companies who pass it on and get yourself out competed by companies who reduce carbon.
Not necesearaly if there are alternatives not affected by the changes will mean that those companies can either not pass the cost on to the consumer or if they do get out competed by the componies that are not affected or by the companies that do not pass it on.
Yes.
Quite simply, there is absolutely nothing that will cause the Republican base to hold their elected officials accountable for their political stances on any remotely meaningful policy that isn't related to, or motivated by, wokeness or the perceived culture war.
Their core constituency will not even be made aware that this bill exists, let alone how their senators and representatives vote on it.
For all intents and purposes, it will be as if the bill never existed.
