McConnell is one of the old guard of Republicans who play the long game which has pushed the country right and distorted the electoral system so Republicans can still vie for power without being representative.
The Trumps, Boeberts and MTGs are a distraction, who can only exist due to the decades of work by the McConnells.
whatever.
Even if Clarence Thomas was ejected from SCOTUS today, McConnel would refuse to allow his party to vote on a replacement.
He'd find some reason to legitimize his refusal to participate in the process.
Exactly.
Those judges are like tectonic pressure, quietly pushing the culture of the country right.
People who say that Trump-appointed judges aren't helping him get away with crimes are missing the point, Trump was never interested in the judiciary and they weren't appointed to cover his back, they were McConnell's project.
Absolutely.
The right wing has an entire industry devoted to cranking out right wing judges in the heritage foundation.
Judges are extremely powerful people.
