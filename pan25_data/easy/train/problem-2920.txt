It's a common problem across world politics from what I'm seeing.
It seems that people have accepted FUD and character attacks as being acceptable politics now and one party had embraced that.
It's easy to look like a better option when you don't actually come up with solutions and instead just bash the other side.
But they aren't actually making anything better because they aren't actually creating any solutions to the problems.
Wow.
Here in the US the hot mics tend to pick up crazy shit.
In NZ “arrogant prick” makes the news.
In the US we have racism and misogyny and death threats on the hot mic and they get elected.
I wish our politicians called each other arrogant pricks.
Would be so much more civil then.
Rather than death threats and calls for violence.
The right bloc, made up of the centre-right National party, increased its lead by 1% to 38%, while the Libertarian Act party, jumped 2% to 11%, putting the two parties in a comfortable position to form a government without needing additional coalition partners.
