One of the reasons it's such a popular crop here in CO is that it grows well in a wide range of soils, especially the difficult clays where I am.
Many farmers here don't have much water in storage (reservoirs) and are limited to irrigating during spring and early summer snowmelt.
So they irrigate when their ditch is in priority, grow as much as they can, and then by late summer they're out of water but the alfalfa survives and even thrives in the summer heat.
It's far less fertilizer-intensive than most crops; as a legume, it actually fixes nitrogen from the air.
It's a high-protein forage for animals.
It has a pretty purple flower and the pollinators go absolutely nuts for it.
When grown in a field with grass hay, a 25% mix of alfalfa can actually increase productivity of the field by 300%.
This is not only because it fixes nitrogen that the grass needs, but because alfalfa grows back so quickly after cutting that it shades the soil, resulting in less evaporation from the top couple inches of soil, allowing more available moisture for the grass.
You are now subscribed to alfalfa facts.
Edit: or as sarcosmonaut brilliantly coined them, "alfalfacts" lol.
Arizona?
The America-first, fuck Arabs, republican state?
Theyâ€™re the ones effectively stealing resources from their people to placate a foreign interest?
Color me shocked.
