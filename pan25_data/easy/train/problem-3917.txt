Redlining?
Jim Crow?
Prosecutors consistently offering much more lenient deals and sentences to white defendants?
Black soldiers being denied GI Bill benefits?
Black farmers being denied USDA loans that white farmers got?
Punishment for possession of crack being harsher than the punishment for the same weight of powder cocaine?
Some of those practices no longer happen (but were not remedied), while others still happen.
It might also be worth talking about the codified discrimination against American Indians, especially on reservations.
I can’t watch him.
I watched Bill O’Reilly sometimes, and Hannity—to know what the enemy was doing.
But honestly, Fucker Tarlson is beyond my capacity to endure cringe.
Can’t do it.
He’s smarmy on roids ….
Over-representation of black/Indigenous/people-of-color in statistical analysis of prison systems, poverty rates, the juvenile justice system, suicide rates, lack of home ownership and accumulated wealth….
The damned irritating thing about Fucker is that he’s not even sincere.
I don’t believe he’s serious.
I don’t believe he believes his own “schtick”.
He believes in “da moh-nay”.
He believes in accreting his own financial wealth.
I really don’t think anything else matters; he just knows his audience, he knows his eyeballs—the ones tuning in by the astounding millions every night.
