I assume you're referring to Mueller's obstruction of justice instances.
I would have liked to see those prosecuted too, but Garland inherited the aftermath of January 6 and it's clear that his DOJ has been occupied with all levels of that -- from identifying and prosecuting about a thousand participants from photo evidence, to deep investigations into militant extremist groups and laying the groundwork for several seditious Conspiracy convictions, to impaneling grand juries to probe Trump allies who planned and financed the Stop the Steal rally, to investigating thousands upon thousands of pages of communications among Trump lawyers and advisors involved in planning the fake elector scheme, to searching Trump allies' homes and siezing phones and electronic devices, to compelling Pence aids to testify before a grand jury, to obtaining Meadows' phone and communicationa records, to impaneling a grand jury to probe Trump's PAC and members of his 2020 campaign, etc... (That's a hell of a lot for someone who's "not doing anything," isn't it?
).
DOJ refuses to do their job though, because it would mean going against their authoritarian leaders, and the DOJ is after all law enforcement, it's a staff of authority worshipping wankers as evidenced by the persistent refusal to go after the right wing criminals.
