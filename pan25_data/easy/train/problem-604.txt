The event would be canceled but it would still be a loss all around.
The teams would all individually have to honor their contracts and pay the damages.
Advertising clients would be furious and demand their money back (probably also have clauses in their contracts if they are savvy).
The web of economic entanglement is large at such a large event.
I can't even grasp the scope of all the companies which would go under due to this.
Nobody would remember boycotts.
More people remember Jesse Owens going to Nazi Germany and destroying the "ubermensch" in front of Hitler than those who would've boycotted.
Qatar is gonna get violated by Ecuador tonight.
Get the popcorn ready folks.
You'd probably see a different type of corruption as the top clubs creamed off the deals for themselves, and ultimately football being what it is, this would work its way down into players wages, but even this tawdry scenario would be better than the FIFA executive Committee coining it for themselves.
This.
Little protests are all fine and we'll, but no one cares.
You want FIFA to care?
Keep your team at home.
Make it clear why your team refuses to play.
Get other teams to do the same.
Ruin their fucking event by hitting them in the only place that matters, their pocket book.
