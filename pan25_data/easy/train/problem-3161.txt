It is not.
The amount of complete victim mentality coming from Serbia and the Serbs since the Kosovo conflict is sickening.
They've made a whole industry out of history denial, completely refused to acknowledge and deal with the genocide they perpetrated, and generally blamed everyone else than themselves for why NATO had to step in and bomb them.until they stopped filling gorges with massacred civilians.
If its one country thats taken an exact playbook out of Post ww1 Germany, its Serbia.
Amazing.
Everything you just said was wrong.
I do remember Yugoslavia.
I also have a degree in International relations with an expertise in the Yugoslavia conflict.
I also have a post doctoral degree in International law and worked with a lawyer on The Hague tribunal.
Serbia started that conflict and perpetrated the vast majority of the war crimes and atrocities in that war against Croat and Bosnian civilians.

We have always been on the right side of history while being sole freedom fighters in the balkans and biggest group that are forced to live in others countries with fake borders.
Straight up lies again, like every single word is a lie.
