My best friend from high school is literally going through this exactly.
22 years married.
They married when he was 19 and she was 16.
He is currently busting windows out his house and all his old trucks that everybody down there somehow accumulates that litters their back yard.
She is having an affair with a guy slightly bigger than him which is hilariously par for the course.
It’s like the generic boiler plate script for everyone down there.
It’s insanely depressing and dark and mind numbing.
He is also behind the curve for Qanon.
He just recently told me about a documentary that tells the horrifying tales of Hollywood sacrificing virgins, drinking their blood, crop circles, and how democrats, Catholics and Jews are reptile people.
Now I think that the insurrectionists are their form of hipsters.
I very much regret answering the phone.
Foundation.
There are like seven of them.
Also for shorts two of my faves are The Last Answer, and The Last Question.Here is a link to The Last Question I hope it works...If this is against rules mods please let me know.
