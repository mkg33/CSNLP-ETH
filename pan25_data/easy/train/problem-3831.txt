Russia goes through brief periods of reform and progress followed by regression towards authoritarianism and amplification of that authoritarian power until finally it breaks under internal systematic failures and the process can begin again.
The ultimate microcosm for this is Romanov rule collapsing because if a country is poorly run, and one guy is in charge of everything, then obviously its that guy's fault, followed by a brief attempt at democracy, followed by a dictator hitting everyone with sticks until they were communist, followed by a genocidal maniac hitting everyone with sticks to prevent anyone with sticks from hitting back.
And a lot of this happens because Russians have never been free.
