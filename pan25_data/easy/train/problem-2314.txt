Ironically, this applies to the overwhelming majority of the people who adhere to far-right ideologies and spew the associated disgusting rhetoric.
A lot of them are legitimately unintelligent and all of them lack self-awareness entirely.
They get used as pawns and are discarded when no longer useful; history has proven this to hold true time after time after time.

The state of societal discourse at this point in history is disgusting and tragic.
I hate it.
