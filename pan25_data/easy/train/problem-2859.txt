Sad?
Not really.
If it's not verifiable AND it's automated, it creates the opportunity for actual large scale fraud which could be extremely hard to discover.
Right now, the systems used make it next to impossible to engage in large scale fraud without it being easily discovered.
Interesting.

Hey, I have a random, serious question for you.
I remember in the 90's there was a song on the radio ("alternative rock" radio station) that was a kind of pop-punk song with the refrain, "Fucked it, fucked it, fucked it uh-uh-uh-up, / Fucked it, fucked it, fucked it uh-uh-uh-up."
I can't remember any other words.
Does that ring a bell?
I've tried web searches but all I find are the dozens of other songs which have the F-word in them ...
Thanks for any insight.
