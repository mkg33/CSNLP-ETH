The problem isn't as simple to fix as that.
You'd need to find the entrances via ground reconnaissance (these bunkers are best at camouflage from aerial and satellite survivance) and then coordinate large amounts of precision munitions onto that target and then hope they didn't have more than one exit, hence the investment in subterranean warfighting capabilities.
I wouldn't be so sure.
With modern advances in concrete technology bunker busters are again having trouble punching through to properly designed bunkers, and Iran is on top of implementing this technology.
It's basically the one technological field where Iran is actually on the cutting edge (at least according to publicly available information).
So like... why?
I mean genuinely this one baffles me.
Alright let's say that shit goes down and there is a war.
Pretty much guaranteed US and its allies knows of most if not all locations of underground bases.
And let's use the one in the video as an example.
So now they are protected from being bombed... wouldn't they just have to wreck the entrance and the jets would be utterly useless and unable to even leave?
