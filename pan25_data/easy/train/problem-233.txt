“Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists".
Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S.
It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics".

/r/SandersForPresident was pretty wild.
There would be people talking about how they were definitely voting for Trump since Hillary stole the nomination from Bernie.
That was a huge red flag.
Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because "Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics".
Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.
