In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Interesting.
That would correlate with the rapid decline in the quality in conservative political rhetoric we’ve seen in the last thirty years or so.
Its seemed to get worse every day, to the point where the politicians aren’t even trying anymore, and the pundits’ arguments, such as they are, are just laughable to the liberally educated.
And anti-abortion.
There was a recent article stating that almost 50% of young women are taking anti-abortion agendas in states when they are making higher ed and employment decisions.
Moreover.
Colleges can't easily cut expenditures because those often directly risk losing prospective students.
If part of the appeal of the college is premised on it being selective, and you admit more students you lose that rating.
College administrative staff usually have "sacred cows" as well, but even if you cut the administrative blood that conservatives like to point out usually end up with 1- 2% of budget cuts.
