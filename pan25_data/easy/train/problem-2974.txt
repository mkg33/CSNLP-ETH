If you briefed me on everything we'd be looking at regarding him as a candidate in 2015, I would have laughed and said no but man with Trump being an actual President in this country -- something we'll have live with for the rest of time -- I have no faith there are standards we expect our leaders to meet before electing them.
That's what kills me.
Trump looks like a Saint compared to DeSantis.
Trump is just an offensive loudmouth.
DeSantis is a man of action and his actions are very selfish.
He gets offended by disney he abuses his power to retaliate.
He gets offended by schools he uses his power retaliates.
He trafficked human beings for a political statement.. ðŸ™„ The guy is not a public servant.
He's straight up power hungry.
Honestly!
Props to the people.
Also my above comment was simply stating their education is still calculated to be considered strong.
It was not a defense of Desantis and his policy.
Truly my real hope is that one day African American+ (and ancestral lines of our citizens) will be proportionally taught is regular good ol history class.
Long ways from thatâ€¦.
