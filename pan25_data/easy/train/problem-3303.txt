The problem is that Canada isnâ€™t independent from the British crown, itâ€™s only independent from the UK parliament and prime minister.
Itâ€™s still part of the Commonwealth and Charles is nominally the head of the government with the Canadian prime minister and members of parliament answering to him.
So not swearing an oath of allegiance to Charles III is like refusing to take the constitutional oath of office in the US.
You generally donâ€™t get to take your seat in congress if you refuse that oath.
Canadians!
Dump British imperialism in the dustbin of history.
Also leave the commonwealth.
We here in Ireland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª are doing just fine without the crown .
Seriously.
Let's enforce rules to make sure our democratically elected legislature can't function at full capacity when members won't swear allegiance to a figurehead monarch of another country.
The title is wrong.
They are not "banning" anyone.
They want to make sure that people who come here either speak French totally, partly or intend on doing so in a short future.
Actually yes.
Not trying to disrupt anyone's fairy tale fantasies but Charles and the monarchy are actually 100% British and he's just a figurehead there.
