yeah, way too many leftists of his generation can't shake their cold war binary thinking.
The USA is bad, thus the west is bad, thus anyone opposed to the west is actually good.
They'll rightfully oppose western war crimes with passion, but the moment a non-western aligned state is doing the crimes, even genocide, it's suddenly rambling whataboutism or outright denial.
Absolutely.
I'm just saying that you can't single out corbyn as being bad on brexit when the current leader is doing the same thing.
Honestly you’re conflating “capitalist playground” with “deregulated playground”.
The two things are not the same or mutually exclusive.
It’s perfectly possible to be a playground of capitalism and have consumer regulations.
It’s called responsible capitalism… which isn’t as immediately as profitable as straightforward capitalism, but is far more sustainable long-term.
Yeah I used to be a big fan of him.
Seemed like a true committed leftist and a big train nerd just like me.
But recent years showed me he has those chomsky brainworms that makes him support and defend the worst genocidal dictators so long as they aren't "western", plus on a deeper dive a lot of his domestic politics blow too.
He was fine with brexit because the EU is an evil neoliberal org or whatever.
I mean true, but brexit is much worse.
