My dad was still in school as the revolution was happening.
He grew up and lived most of his life in Shiraz.
When he had the chance to move to the US, he took it.
The stuff that had happened during the revolution deeply saddened him for many years.
If there is another revolution, hopefully recovering Iran to back how it was in shahâ€™s time, itâ€™ll give him the closure heâ€™s been needing for years now.
He says heâ€™ll take me when it returns back to normal, so hopefully that will be fun.

Not only does the government have the political willpower and capital to violently crack down, there is little historical evidence that, unless the secular military forces start to mass mutiny to support the protestors, that the protesting demographic that has a big chunk from the more comfortable part of the socio-economic ladder will fold.
That's how it's almost always worked.
People living in any semblance of comfort are not likely to meet violence with violence unless they are shown that considerable military force will defect to them or that the government is heavily split and unwilling ot match it's rhetoric.
