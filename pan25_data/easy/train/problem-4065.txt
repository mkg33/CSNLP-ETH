Right?
Why are we pretending like anyone is doing anything TO Russia?
Everything that has transpired and will transpire in the future, Russia did to itself.
There've been nonheriditary monarchies historically.
When the king dies, the bigwigs in the tribe elect a new king to lead them.
Prominent examples include many of the migration-era Germanic tribes, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
Ah, no?
Russia chose to invade.
They are committing war crimes.
Theyâ€™ve taken kids as hostages.
They torture captives.
They target civilians on purpose.
Crush them straight to hell and make sure they can never do this again.
Guess which penalization actually succeeded in ending German militarism?
It wasn't the paltry treaty of Versailles that left Germany perfectly capable of ignoring the terms, re-arming, and proceeding to try to conquer Europe again.
It was the second one, the penalization of WWII where the Allies didn't fuck around, marched all the way in, and actually enforced some very serious, permanent consequences.
