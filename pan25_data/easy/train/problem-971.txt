As for donors, I think that's a terrible standard.
I'm sure she had some sincere donors who liked her and what she was pushing, but I'm also certain there were other donors who were supporting her because they wanted to hurt Democrats in any of various ways, from just making the primaries look like a clown show by there being too many candidates, to supporting candidates whose ideas they know are bad, to wanting to split the (primary) vote to try to influence who ends up being the ultimate nominee.
Just like there can be spoiler candidates in general elections, there can also be spoiler candidates in primaries as well.
Not necessarily.
Just having a candidate raise the issues has some value, doubly so if they get on a debate stage together.
I'm not saying her running is going to lead to some dramatic change or lead us to a utopia, but her running has some positive value.
Disagree.
Her good policy positions are generic ones many Democrats hold, and the ones that are uniquely hers aren't good.
