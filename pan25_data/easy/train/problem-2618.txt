> A much quicker and easier way to stand out is to be the most outspoken, controversial and arguably craziest candidate — and almost all the intersecting media environments of the mainstream media, conservative media and social media gravitate to stories with the theme of, “You won’t believe what this GOP candidate is saying or doing!”.
Right.
The GOP FBI director covered up Hunter’s laptop in collusion with Trump’s AG.
Totally logical.
If Hunter did something stupid (I’m sure he has) then he should be investigated and prosecuted.
After that, they can move on to the billions Ivanka and Jared got in office and Don’s tax evasion, obstruction and espionage.
Sound fair?
Colorado’s Republicans tend to be Regan neo-cons, fiscally conservative but socially liberal.
Strong military, low taxes.
Most I know are pretty easy-going on social issues like abortion and gay marriage, (CO is a leader in the country of reproductive science for the last 30 years.)
Most Republicans, especially older ones in CO are more afraid of “socialism” (thank you Rush Limbaugh and Fox News) and higher taxes than anything else.
It’s why the Tabor Amendment to the state constitution exists, which was approved by voters in 1992, limits the amount of revenue the State of Colorado can retain and spend.
Specifically, TABOR allows the state to retain and spend an amount based on the prior fiscal year's actual revenue or limit, whichever was lower, grown by Colorado inflation and population growth and adjusted for any "voter-approved revenue changes."
As in, the Governor can’t just change tax laws without voter approval.
