Yeah there was literally no oversight because the republicans refused to pass it if there was oversight—- if you made the biggest profit ever during Covid you could still manipulate it and get huge loans which would only have to pay back if you used less than 30% for payroll or operating expenses- so they took the money- and then justified it by saying welfare recipients cheat the system all the time… facepalm- we should have handled that differently- it caused a spike in buying by people who didn’t need the money and they still laid off masses and since Covid large companies have had record profits… this economy is a mess.

When Etran was bogging down we shifted to teams working at night just to make up volume.
Especially true in round one when it was a literal free for all.
