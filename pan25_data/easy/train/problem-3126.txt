You should read "De Principatibus" by Italian 1500s writer Niccol√≤ Machiavelli.
It details how a state ruled by one person alone is not automatically bad, as long as the regnant has a certain set of virtues, and also talks about much more revolving the argument.
Perhaps it can skew your perception on the matter.
Of course if you haven't read it yet.
Of course, re-introducing monarchy is not a realistic solution to the demagoguery problem.
Switching to to improve the electoral incentives that politicians face, so there's no incentive to polarize the electorate anymore, would be a much better cure for demagogues.
(Approval voting = vote for as many candidates as you want.
).
Everything is done with the idea to preserve the state for as long as possible, through the support of the nobles, the common people, other states, and the Church (which was still important in the 1400s-1500s), because the regent emerged as a man amidst the chaos of anarchy or civil wars; he's a man that guides the state towards a better state (sorry for the wordplay) and transitions to the republic, kinda like Publicola in the Roman Kingdom.
