Those are reportedly from the mostly prisoners who were promised freedom if they survived a little “dust-up”; from those captured the prisoners weren’t hardly trained and then forced into human wave attacks, reminiscent of WW1’s earlier days, against machine guns and artillery upon pain of being shot by their own as “cowards”.
I agree with this.
When one country give zero fucks about their losses and said country will continue to throw bodies at it, no matter what weapons Ukraine has i fear they will keep coming and eventually no matter how long or how many losses they face they will gain enough ground to force some kind of submittal... 150k in a year... over 3 years that is 350k enough for russians to say stop?
I doubt it.
Enough for Ukraine to say stop.
Yeah as they care about life.
This is going to get far worse i fear..
Russia is choosing to destroy Ukrainian Infrastructure.
Russia is choosing to send human waves into the meat grinder.
Why is the obligation on Ukraine to surrender but not on Russia to stop their invasion?
