“WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A New Zealand court temporarily took away medical custody of a baby from his parents on Wednesday after they refused blood transfusions for him unless the blood came from donors who were unvaccinated against COVID-19.
Not correct.
Academic papers show that the spike protein can stay in your body for at least 60 days, which is how long the study went for.
Long story short, there are a few vectors but the main one is a little understood mechanism in which cells communicate with each other via exosomes which ate tiny lipids cells excrete.
Spike proteins have been found in them.
My understanding is that because there is no detectable difference in the blood of a vaccinated vs unvaccinated person they don't collect that info from donors, and because the parents couldn't be guaranteed any blood donations wouldn't be "tainted" by the covid vaccine they refused to go forward with a life saving heart operation.
Just did a quick Google search.
In New Zealand jt is a regulated profession and requires a bachelors degree in midwifery.
I think the issue is that midwives do attend university and get this degree and need a license to practice but it may attract people who think that home births are the best way and that modern medicine is a sham.
I have no issues with midwives (or potentially going to a birth Center to deliver a baby), but modern medicine has saved countless lives and the people making up the medical system have years and years of training under their belt.
Also, these parents are scared blood “may” kill their child.
You know what wil 1000 percent kill your child?
Not having heart surgery.
