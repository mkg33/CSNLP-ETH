i don't have the immediate article at hand (tried to find it 2min without success) but essentially they moved toward replanting/fixing the desert and land reclaimation.
With a mechanical effort backing it.

ugh corporatists more seriously, Alibaba (which is behind online supermarket aliexpress trading with occidentals; Alibaba online trading with businesses -B2B-; and a large computer science sector in their internal market; possibly other things i lost track of but it's a megacorp) is also allowed in kinda necessary/useful economically for both at that point if only because there need to be a (large) concurrent to Amazon they can't easily buy out, mop out or something so they don't suddenly triple prices with their monopoly in crazy greedflation (during a depression :/).
So it helps keep prices grounded in some reality.
