I mean if a country is unable to pay their debt they have to declare bankruptcy, will be unable to secure any loans for government projects, people would not buy bonds, foreign investment plummets, govt assets get sold to pay off debts, rising taxes to increase govt revenue, increase inflation from printing money, rising costs due to no more govt subsidies - basically the whole economy gets fucked.
Simply saying “I’m not paying you” doesn’t work in the real world lmao.
It’s a lot easier to give the land than declare sovereign bankruptcy.
>Economists and behavioral scientists use a related term, sunk-cost fallacy, to describe the justification of increased investment of money or effort in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment ("sunk cost") despite new evidence suggesting that the future cost of continuing the behavior outweighs the expected benefit.
Yeah, sure.
Because the US has made all the Middle East and Latin America a better place to live, right?
Iron-clad contracts.
Pakistan is a nuclear power and can technically say I’m not paying you, but then no one would ever do business with them again because “they don’t honor their business deals”.
Further, China is a major exporter and would say I’m not exporting anything to you ever again, good luck, which is also a catastrophe given how much China provides to the world.
