Primaries are not about the general election.
It’s about electorate composition.
What’s more representative of the party.
Not 90% white Iowa or New Hampshire.
South Carolina is a smaller state and it is diverse.
The party is a multi-racial coalition so it makes sense to have SC first.
If you start with a large state, that will just guarantee only wealthy candidates can start and stay on top because larger states have expensive media markets.
You could argue Nevada first but that’d be ignoring the base of the party which is black voters.
But Nevada should be one of the first few.
The DNC isn't doing this for minority representation.
That's just the stated reason.
They did this to front end a right leaning state at the beginning of the primary schedule to control the narrative against left leaning candidates.
There is 0% chance South Carolina votes blue in the general, but 100% chance their democratic primary goes towards the most center right candidate.
