It's not really theft when the money is used to fix something you damaged.
If I burn your house down, then I should be responsible to rebuild it.
If I'm not willing to voluntarily pay then I should be forced to pay what I can.
I wouldn't call that theft.
The best solution IMHO for the people is to move them to somewhere with existing infrastructure ASAP, not scream through the newspapers how Russia needs to be disowned and devise weird schemes that of course will apply to that but not to any other war in the past or future and will likely worsen the situation socially and politically.
Both.
Its both.
We help Ukraine with money we steal from Russia by funding our own economies to assist in there rebuild while simultaneously full on capsizing the russian market.
Meanwhile there is an even deeper foothold in the Ukranian market do to an influx of western brands from construction materials to cocacola.
Soon enough the populous is as enfatuated with overprocessed-designed-for-the-dump-garbage as any stadard American is and full populist assimialation will be complete!
