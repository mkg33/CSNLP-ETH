Iran still wasn't going to get the bomb after 10 years like the other redditor said.
Yes, some of the restrictions had time limits, but not the most important restrictions that would actually allow Iran to build a bomb.
It was a negotiation and both sides had to make concessions, but Iran wasn't going to be allowed to biuld a bomb under the agreement in any future year.
If Trump didn't leave the agreement then Iran wouldn't be biulding a bomb right now, and they wouldn't have a bomb in 2025.
Back to religious fascism and radicalization.
What fascism and what radicalism do you accuse us of when the incoming israeli police and public security minister is non other than racist genocidal ben gvir.
Ben gvir who had pictures of Goldstein hanged around his house like he was some glorified saint.
Goldstein the terrorist that massacred 29 unarmed and innocent praying muslims in the ibrahimi mosque.
This guy who glorifies religious terrorism is the one who will be in control of israeli police.
Please talk more about religious fascism.
