This is part of the report they publish every few years.
They outline hostile or possibly hostile nuclear rivals' capabilities and explicitly state that US policy is to deter anyone from thinking a nuclear attack would help them achieve their goals.
The report even explicitly states that the US will not rule out a first strike if they feel it is necessary (apparently Biden wanted to change this but it didn't make it into the new report).
It is a very dry yet terrifying publicly available document.
You underestimate Korean/American counter-battery radar.
The North Koreans would get one good volley off and then a combination of CB artillery fire and airstrikes would reduce their offensive capabilities to roughly zero.
Of course!
But I'm quite optimistic about our chances, I'd be less optimistic with Russia/China/India/Pakistan.
Since there aren't that many SM-3's compared to how many Ballistic Missiles there are.
Exactly.
North Korea is extremely important to China.
China would almost certainly retaliate with their military and itâ€™d just be a giant clusterfuck.
