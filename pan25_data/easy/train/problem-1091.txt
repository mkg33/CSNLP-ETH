Firstly lets be clear about what the H1B system provides for America.
For the sake of keeping this brief, I'm just going to call them all as engineers even though the H1B system covers more than just engineers.
But in short, engineers take a lot of money and investment to train even in America.
You're basically taking the top 20 percent of a population, you're sinking in millions of dollars into developing them over time (whether by government or by family).
And then you have someone who is basically hyper productive.
The H1B system is basically a way to take this talent from other countries without having to sink that money into it.
At the end of the day, taking talent from other countries should be a national security priority.
The way I put it, I'd rather have a Russian Jet Engineer working at Ford than at Sukhoi.
Respectfully disagree.
I've had my Buick Hubris since 1987 and it still runs smooth as she ever did.
The secret is mixing a little a that movie theatre popcorn oil butter in ever time you gas her up.
