>what Hicks said about Trump is likely to be damning, and potentially devastating to him, both in the court of public opinion and a court of law should he ever be prosecuted, according to former prosecutors and legal experts.
For sure.
On the side of justice should’ve been read with finger quotes.
I hope the DOJ is smart enough to see what I see and tread lightly lest she cause a mistrial or otherwise fuck this case up.
She talks like she’s trying to remember and hesitantly filling in details she can’t remember.
Pausing to reassure herself throughout.
And then when they follow-up by paraphrasing what she just told them and asking if that is her testimony, she takes a few moments like a contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire considering if she should lock in a final answer.
Maybe I’m reading too much into it.
It was certainly interesting to see how people act under oath through the hearings - some bumbling and painful to watch.
Some pretty cool and collected.
This one just strikes me as unreliable.
