This is the chief thing I’ve never understood about Walmart constantly depressing the wages of their workers.
If they paid more then they’d just make more sales.
Virtually nobody who works for Walmart is doing so well that they’d start investing in stocks, and they’re not going to shop anywhere else because they get that employee discount.

A corporation the size of Walmart certainly has the metrics so close at hand that they could easily adjust the exact percentages on employee discount by category to account for elasticity by leaning into economies of scale advantages while indemnifying themselves from any diseconomies of scale.
Idk.
When I was young I was always told/thought everyone wanted to move to the US.
But when I lived in Cambodia in 2012 nobody wanted to move to America, they all wanted to move to Singapore.
I suspect it might have always been a bit of American exceptionalism in America to think that, at least since the 2000s and the Bush Era.
But who knows, I could be wrong.
