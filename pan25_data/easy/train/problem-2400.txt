International sanctions/shunnings only work if the target country is sanctioned/shunned.
So Russians get caught doping, their athletes are still allowed to compete in a celebration of sports and international unity.
So Russians invade another country.
Their athletes are still allowed to compete in a celebration of sports and international unity.
A few on the IOC are getting some nice bonus checks.
The absolute minimum would be for each Russian athlete to have to overtly condemn Putin, condemn the entire Russian Armed Forces for being guilty of genocide, affirm the all of the land Russia has tried to conquer, including Crimea, is rightfully Ukrainian, and call on Russian citizens to help Ukraine defeat Russia.
Well.
As we know, all sports championships were invented as a "civilized" alternative for nation states to compete and gain honorary accolades instead of traditional bloody way of solving controversial geopolitic aspects, as you name it.
Yes, I know that.
And of course what Russians athletes are going through isn't remotely similar to what Ukrainians are suffering because of this war, but they too are victims of the actions of the lunatic in power in Russia.
Whole lives of dedication to a sport thrown away because Putin is a murderous asshole.
