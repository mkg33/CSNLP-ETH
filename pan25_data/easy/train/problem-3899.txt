Wars of attrition are not faught for territory, that can easily be regained, as we've seen.
They are faught to slowly dismantle the opposition, which is exactly what's happening to the Ukrainian, the country is in the brink of collapse, their military is over stretched as it is, now they have to leave troops and weapons in the city to defend instead of fighting on other battle fronts.
The EU countries that blindly jumped onboard with the suicidal sanctions are also financially on the brink, and the only people that suffer are the citizens...the elite are just fine.
Incorrect.
They left due to a deteriorating supply situation that would have made surviving the winter impossible.
If you've been following the conflict at all you'd know that Ukrainian gains in Kherson region have been incremental and capturing Kherson city was nowhere near imminent.
Kherson would have fallen but it would have been very bloody and drawn out.
Instead the Russians are trying to consolidate their holdings in Crimea and Donbas.
