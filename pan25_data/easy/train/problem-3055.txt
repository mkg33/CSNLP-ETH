Context: in Canada, government student loans are comprised of provincial and federal portions.
When COVID hit, the federal government suspended student loan interest on the federal portion of the student loan.
Now, a bill is before the house that, if passed, will eliminate the interest charged, for good.
Finally.
Maybe it's just me, but the idea of the country charging interest on the betterment of its people seems morally perverted and deeply impractical.
It helped no one that it was supposed to serve.
Finally, good riddance!
Most Canadian universities are primarily publicly funded.
Provincial governments exercise a large degree of control over their governance and are able to directly influence their tuition schedules.
Idk.
I did it.
How much do airplane mechanics make?
X to 3x hmm.
How much does it cost to get training to get my requirements met, tools, orals and practicals.
Y ok, can I get a job making X and still pay my loan on Y and also pay for housing and food???
Yes, so I did it.
For public universities and colleges, whether institutions are allowed to raise tuition and by how much depends on the provincial legislature.
So, it is not necessarily the case that institutions would get to raise tuition willy-nilly.
Also, if you choose to attend a private school or out-of-province school, it is possible that you get a lot less funding, this is true in Ontario.
