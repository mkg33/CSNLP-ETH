In a way, the absolutely terrible way Lula is behaving is good for the people.
This means he will be impeached in record time.
But don't worry, he will be impeached in record time.
He's so stupid he's thrashing the market.
He's so stupid he appointed his VP to coordinate the transition.
Alckmin is in Brasilia telling everyone behind the scenes "this is bad, but don't worry, it's only temporary.
When I take over the president's office things will be different.
".
Brazilians only voted for Bolsonaro in the first place for the same reasons the US voted for Trump, a certain portion of your population are easily manipulated fascist sympathizers.
The Venn diagram of people who yearn for a return of the military dictatorship and Balsonaro supporters is a circle.
The markets and people like you despise Lula because he cares about the environment, indigenous people and poor people.
The markets loved Bolsonaro because he was happy to let the highest bidder rape your country of its natural resources.
It's weird that the Brazilians i know who support Lula are intelligent, educated professionals and you Bolsonaro supporters merely regurgitate whichever semi intelligible talking points you're getting from individuals and organizations who don't have the best interests of Brazilians at heart.
Congrats on supporting a President/set of policies whose long term implications would leave Brazil with 0 resources and all the capital from exploring those resources in foreign hands.
