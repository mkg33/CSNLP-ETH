My local pool had a "No street clothing" rule.
meaning t-shirts and cutoff jeans, regular shorts etc, weren't allowed in the pool.
This rule would at least address one issue.
Personally?
I don't care.
Honestly a full coverage swim suit (which is basically what a burkini is with an added flowy swim cap, if you ignore the emotional aspects of it) is not at all offensive, and it saddens me (as an atheist white woman who doesn't swim because I feel uncomfortable in public in swimwear) that women are denied it because asshats who hate women (and let's be honest the right hates women) want to pretend that it is oppressive, while they oppress women in countless other ways.
The Iraq war killed over a million civilians.
You know, when the United States did exactly what Russia is doing now.
Deliberately falsely claiming weapons of mass destruction were being developed when they never were.
same general concept Russia is applying now in Ukraine.
Not mention the continued ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.
