Given the atrocious strategy and execution Russia has used, I am not supporting them.
I am not intentionally being a contrarian.
However, I don’t think the rest of the world is doing the right thing by intervening.
Ukraine does not have any binding military alliances (if they did, those countries would have officially joined in against Russia) and these other countries are violating neutrality.
Oh I know.
But from Russia’s standpoint, those areas are now Russia.
I’m just highlighting the fact that it’s not as simple as “pushing the Russians back to their borders” and not triggering a nuclear war.
The war is escalating and the West is contributing to that.
Right or wrong, justified or not, sending missiles and planes to Ukraine increases the likelihood of nuclear conflict.
It’s a game of chicken that both sides are playing.
"violating neutrality"?
what neutrality?
no one has an obligation to Russia to remain neutral.
there is no violation.
Exactly.
It sounds like he's taking some of his philosophy teachings too stringent, and disregarding other philosophical teachings that do not say "bad and good are entirely subjective", but rather more nuanced.
Which boarders?
The Donbas and Crimea are now part of Russia.
Taking those back is technically invading Russia and could potentially start a nuclear war.
