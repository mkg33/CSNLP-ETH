This was 2021, not last year.
Primary was right at the height of one of those cycles when people think crime is skyrocketing, so a cop candidate made people feel safe.
Another problem is that this was the first ranked choice NYC mayoral campaign.
On the first ballot, Eric Adams was first with about 30% of the vote.
The next five candidates--totaling a little over 60% of the vote between them--were all various flavors of progressive (counting Andy Yang as a progressive for this race).
I think candidates felt comfortable not dropping out because, hey, no such thing as a spoiler in ranked choice, right?
But in practice a lot of voters don't fill out the total ballot or they went unpredictably in their rank.
Garcia (who barely lost) and Yang (fourth place) made an effort at the very end to work together and cross-endorse each other, but it was too little too late.
