That monarchy was replaced by two of the most prolific mass murderers in human history so it's not hard to pick sides there.
Also, of course this is speculation.
We're talking about the potential results of the US joining a war more than 100 years ago.
I feel that a Germany that maintained it's monarchy wouldn't have had Hitler rise up since Hitler was partially driven by his hatred of the Hohenzollerns.
If the Kaiser hadn't been ousted and Germany's economy not been ruined by a devastating war and staggering sanctions the people would have been less radicalized.
A massive part of Hitler's rise was the people's hatred of the Versailles treaty.
Those reparations are the primary reason the Weimar government collapsed in real life.
Read up on Germany from 1918 to 1925.
It was brutal.
When you add into this the pattern of behavior both domestically (within Russia - rampant corruption, violence, and rules-for-thee-not-for-me and far too high a likelihood of death by defenestration even for those among the elite) and what has been coming to light even outside of the ongoing attacks on Ukraine (election meddling internationally, plans leaking to take over neighboring countries OTHER than Ukraine, and on and on and on) - it is only sane to take a look at what's going on in Ukraine and go 'this is the tip of the iceberg as to what's coming if we let him have his way'.
