By some metrics 75% of russians "support the war" but only 25% want continuation of the war and 55% want peace talks right now.
Not "Ukranian capitulation", "peace talks."
If they support the war why they want to end it right now?
People want to be left alone and they will tell and do anything to be left alone.
Mobilization directly affected people.
You can check russian propaganda about it.
"it's only 1%" with comparison to a bag of gummy bears.
"Don't worry, it doesn't affect you.
".
Absolutely Hit Russian infrastructure.
Power plants, hit the bridge again after they repair it.)
Hit oil depots , airport runways where there are military bases.
Then the Russian people will go after Putin.
Absolutely.
Why the f am I still reading news in this sub about what a failed idiot thinks about the war?
What I really want comment is "who the f cares what he thinks?
".
People are multi-faceted.
It is odd to me that in modern times this is not an accepted truth.
I notice this particularly when looking at historical figures, there's no longer room for complexity.
