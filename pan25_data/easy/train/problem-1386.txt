> The study of false polarization is rooted in social and political psychology research that compared actual partisan beliefs and attitudes with people's assumptions about those beliefs [28, 29, 30].
These studies found that, while actual partisan gaps existed, participants dramatically overestimated their magnitude and also overestimated people's ideological consistency.
For instance, in one study, pro-life and pro-choice participants were asked to evaluate various abortion scenarios, some sympathetic and some unsympathetic, and were also asked to guess how those on the other side would evaluate the scenarios.
Participants substantially overestimated the extremity of the other side's views.
They also exaggerated ideological consistency.
For instance, pro-choice participants expected pro-life participants to treat both sympathetic and unsympathetic scenarios as very similar, but that was not at all the case.
These phenomena have come to be known as ‘false polarization’, a somewhat misleading term, because actual polarization does exist.
The point is that the people's beliefs about polarization are substantially more extreme than the actual partisan gap.
Basically everyone internationally likes Lula.
He's stable and diplomatic, or at least was in his last terms.
Brazil sat at the big boy table at the time in part because of respect he gathered/worked towards getting.
Then it all went to shit, but I’d wager the US is pretty happy with this outcome.
