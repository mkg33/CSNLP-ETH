It feels like the far right is expecting every citizen to be a “god fearing” “good Christian”, that we are moving backwards so quickly towards the third Reich where we have to become “true believers” in their bullshit rhetoric.
I am a freethinking, great human being, who truly believes “to each their own”.
It’s not my business to worry about who marries the person they love, or that I gave the right to control how a person dies or doesn’t want to reproduce, or how they choose to modify their body to become their genuine self, or what kind of book to read, our to pray or not pray, and whether or not two loving and supportive individuals can adopt and unwanted child and shower that child with true love!
Yah.
A buddy has a sister with a gay best friend.
A few times they dragged us to a gay club.
I'm a very go with the flow people watching person, so figured the first time it'd at least be interesting.
It was indeed.
He was into some dude there so I being a few drinks in told that guy to talk to him.
Won his respect and everytime I bumped into him after he'd go out of his way to try to find someone to introduce me to.
One I actually really talked to and dated for a while.
Good times.
