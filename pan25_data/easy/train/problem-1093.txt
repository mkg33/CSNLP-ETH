I also think people underestimate how much gun violence(even removing suicide from the equation) is done with legal firearms - we do have a real problem with massive amounts of untraceable/illegal firearms on the street, and yes we have a massive mental health crisis - none of that negates that there is empiric evidence that making guns a liiiittle harder to get can significantly reduce gun violence(even when it's states that have guns trafficked to them from neighboring states with lax laws).
Nor is it in any way a violation of the second amendment.
just like prohibiting felons and medical card holders from ccws(kinda silly but that's the whole criminalization of weed in general lol) and guns respectively is not an infringement on the second amendment.
