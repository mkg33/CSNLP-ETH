Yes and no.
I think if we see a scenario like we did with the Speaker vote, where 6-20 Republicans are holding up their own party it would behoove Democrats to play some hardball with Kevin and threaten to side with the loud minority in calling for his removal unless he gives the Democrats some of what they want.
Basically, what I'm saying is that Democrats can gain a lot by playing these two factions off of each other and using their own sizeable population in the House as leverage every time the Republicans get stupid enough to force this issue.
Is there any doubt?
Whether it’s successful or not, the one member threshold - if he keeps that promise - makes motions to vacate inevitable.
The only question is how many mooches until the first one.
I’ve already got a head of lettuce sitting in my fridge to see which lasts longer.
Go Republicans!
Fuckin hell they are bad.
No plan other than to look into H. Biden?
Wtf is that about?
(Rhetorical) For fuck sake make a move the helps Americans or get the fuck out of the way.
