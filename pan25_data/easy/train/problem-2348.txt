Please if you have any questions or concerns.
But I think the worst part and this isn't exclusive to the documents issue is the fact that those on the right believe they are getting the correct information and all of it despite that very much not being true and thus their view of just about any topic politicially is heavily warped but they don't realize this and thus they're inclined to reject reality as a smear campaign because their sources didn't talk about it and when you inherently believe that your side isn't biased or partisan but the other side is, it even further entrenches your views.
I can tell you.
It's because of the sheer volume of documents.
They don't have a good system in place to keep track of them all.
It needs to be improved badly.
On the flipside though non-MAGA people (I can't say Biden people because quite frankly there aren't Biden people, there are just non-MAGA people) they see Trump evidence long predating his Presidency that Trump is exactly the kind of corrupt person (And this has been extensively verified through the court system) for whom taking and holding classified documents would likely be for corrupt purpose such as selling to the highest bidder.
It was a decade ago.
Does the man not touch his garage for ten years?
Lol.
Just go “oh man… this one’s a throwback!” And it’s a box of classified docs.
