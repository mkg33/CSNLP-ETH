Whether he's deluding himself, coping or just trying to keep this facade of victimhood to his population, he's a shit human being.
He knows that he's a piece of shit, but he doesn't care, and has no guilt whatsoever for what he did.
He is using the Soviet playbook of gaslighting, misdirection, brutality and wanton destruction, and he doesn't have any moral compass.
Only his survival, glory and legacy matter to him.
His brain has been scrambled by the eductation and traumas of his past; no empathy remains in him; just endless cruelty and cynicism.
History will remember him as a despicable barbarian that ran his country into the ground, while lashing out violently at their democratic neighbor which only wanted to make its own decisions on how to rule itself, and who to engage with in peace.
I hope they have enough.
There was a video earlier today that showed what were apparently proximity fuse / air burst artillery shells being used against invaders in trenches.
Seemed to have good results for Ukraine.

The Biden administration has previously equipped Ukraine with other advanced weaponry, including air-launched high-speed, antiradiation missiles, or HARMs, to enhance Ukraineâ€™s ability to carry out airstrikes.
But those weapons function differently than the GPS-guided JDAM, instead hunting radiation emitted by Russian units and headquarters.
