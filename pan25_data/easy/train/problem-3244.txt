The installation costs of wind/solar have plummetted in the past 8 years or so, and aren't even showing signs of slowing down the rate of cost decreases.
The only reason utilities haven't already installed more solar/wind power plants is because they're just waiting for future cost decreases.
They don't wanna buy something right before an even more efficient, cheaper and more reliable model comes out.
Solar and wind are improving in cost and efficacy so rapidly that energy utilities are acting like computer buyers in the late 1990s and early 2000s, hesitating to drop capital into something that will reliably be cheaper in the future.
Why put your current money into a solar farm now, when a few years from now that same money would produce far better ROI?
Natural gas isn't unfeasible.
I'm not saying this as an anti-renewables person.
The simple problem renewables hasn't addressed is how you deal with cloudy days, night time, and non windy days.
You can preach about all the pros of renewables, I don't deny them.
I spent $50k to put solar on my roof, but hour.
