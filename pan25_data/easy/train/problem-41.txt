We had an army guy in my training class (joint forces tech school) who was from some Balkan country and would never say more than a few words so we all just assumed he couldn't speak English very well.
We were about a week from graduation and had to present our final project and this fucker gets up there and gives an eloquent as fuck 10 minute presentation where he's perfectly enunciating shit I can't even spell.
Found out later from his roommate that dude basically aced his ECL, was there to give his family a better life, and just thought we were all stupid spoiled kids he didn't really WANT to talk to.
And he was probably spot on about that.
edit: as other users have pointed out, serfdom was not reinstated per say, but core aspects of it were kept in place (Alexander II's successor canceled plans for giving the peasants elected representation in government, their education/enpowerment was not supported or encouraged, and most significantly, in 1893 they were legally tied back to their communes and could not leave without permission).
