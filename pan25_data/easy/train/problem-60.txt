Palestinians weren't a monolith before Israel gained statehood.
I think that is part of the misunderstanding.
You're denying that Judaism has existed for more than 3500 years in Israel-Palestine?
That's like saying that no Muslims existed in Palestine either.
Jewish people don't identify themselves as Jewish solely based on religious identity, either.
Many identify themselves as Jewish ethnically but don't practice Judaism.
Not to mention that the powers that be in Israel have denied a lot of Jews citizenship based on discrimination between denominations and country of origin.
It's extremely complicated.
Hence why many Jews do not support the current Israeli government.
Incorrect.
The reason the mission was carried out in the first place is because the subset of Judaism practiced by the Ethiopian Jewish community was determined to indeed be Judaism.
The current Aliyah minister in Israel (responsible for encouraging Jews to immigrate to Israel) is literally an Ethiopian Jew.
Hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of Ethiopian Jews make Aliyah each year.
