Interesting story.
So Dolly mentioned in an interview in the early ‘80s that she’d like to open a theme park in her hometown.
There was already a small attraction there called silver dollar city that was another location of a Branson based themed park.
The owners realised that if Dolly built a park it’d kill there’s, but if Dolly bought in, they’d all make a killing.
They called her up, entered into a partnership, expanded, and rebranded.
Within the next year after the rebranding ticket sales doubled.
I’m a woman & every time I hear that music blasting from some kids car it’s lyrics about selling drugs, killing women, forcing women into prostitution; beating women up who won’t give him her money - how come a drag Queen performing ‘Gloria’ is offensive but this music talking about killing some 18 yr old girl forced into prostitution isn’t?
