This is on biden and the PEB.
They decided that Union workers could be better compensated for not having off days by having a 24% raise.

Strike and everyone hates you.
Don't Strike and your union was just shown to be toothless by congress and you've lost all leverage.
What stops the companies from doing this the next time?
A strike is coming because it's the only option they have left.
