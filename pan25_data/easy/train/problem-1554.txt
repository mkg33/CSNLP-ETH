In the UK there hasn't been anything much to feel good about for ages.
The mood of the country is just pessimistic right now.
Has been for awhile.
Solal panels on every roof, manufactured in the UK creating many good jobs and then a battery for at minimum 3 days power storage in every home to boost the new battery manufacturing possibilities in the UK.
I do agree though.
Green energy policy needs to be more ambitious and driven.
Every rooftop capable of supporting solar panels (which may exclude listed buildings though) should have them installed, whether private or council ran.
Especially on new builds.
Done effectively (alongside on site batteries) will be affordable considering the cost of nuclear power stations and HS2.
Summer it should store overnight or feed into the grid.
Then just have those mini Rolls Royce reactors and offshore wind farms around to cover baseline generation.
The only thing that needs to be sussed out then would be production scaling.
It is possible though.
Dismal returns, you do realise that right now putting a few panels on a roof will generate enough electricity for a house in the uk, with a decent sized battery that improves multiple times over and solar panels can generate electricity in cloudy conditions , rather well compared to what they could do only 20 years ago.
But that view would be too short.
The Russians could only abuse what was already there.
And the English had a weird relationship towards the EU, pretty much since they joined, so for 40 years.
Russia nudged them towards leaving definitely, but the heavy lifting was done by the English themselves imo.
