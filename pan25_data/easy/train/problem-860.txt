In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

The churches that teach against it also teach that these suburbanite Christians will be cursed by god of they don't stop the "gay, baby-killing agenda".
They think they'll get hit by lightning, or be cursed with boils like Job, or fall victim to Egyptian style plagues, or worst of all BECOME POOR like those brown neighbors they hate, if they aren't taking away your rights.
