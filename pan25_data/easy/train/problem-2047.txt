How would you describe it otherwise?
Asking as someone who has almost no knowledge on the subject (other than comparing it to what has been happening, for example, in Poland, where the government was basically trying to take over the judicial branch in order to exert control over multinational companies and investment).
Direct check?
What direct check?
There is no check by the people beyond causing economic damage.
You are talking about a scenario where the legislative goes rogue.
It's all over if the legislative goes rogue.
They can institute state propaganda, outlaw criticism using loaded language to excuse the censorship, and you'll end up with a situation no different from any other "democracy.
".
But the media likes to pump out garbage to make it as if most people in Israel are against this and that this is hurting democracy - while completely ignoring how the Supreme court times and times again used it's powers for its own agendas, rather than for the citizens (like what the ones who against this, are claiming - that they are hurting the supreme court's ability to help the citizen - but it never truly cared, only about people with their agendas and political side).
Let me give you an example.
Say that the Knesset passes a law saying that parties can only run for elections if they publicly affirm in writing that they will recommend the outgoing PM as the President's first choice to form the new government.
Parties which refuse cannot run or, if they renege after the elections, have their votes invalidated.
