I grew up with a conservative family.
I loved science from a young age and started attending private Christian schools in 4th grade.
I was the type of kid that got near 100% in my early math/science classes.
In 7th grade my science class was basically directly taught that climate change (global warming then) isn’t real.
They then asked us to go to one side of the room or the other depending on if we still believed in climate change.
I was the only kid in my class that still believed in climate change because I knew almost all scientists out there agreed on it and thought my teacher was wrong.
Around that time I started noticing how hateful my Dad’s rhetoric about immigration and homelessness was becoming.
I graduated high school in 2016 and during that election I really started diving into GOP vs. Democrat policies.
All the data based evidence I could find was telling me that nearly every conservative grievance was completely overblown and that Democratic policies were historically proven and/or empathetically driven.
I couldn’t bear the cognitive dissonance of all the Christians around me being so hateful towards illegal immigrants, the LGBTQIA+ community, homeless/poor individuals, and certain minority groups.
Now I’m the ugly duckling of the family and while I know my parents love me it has absolutely made me more miserable and damaged relationships with them and other family/friends.
Moral conservatism = WtF?
It's none of your business what Mark/Mary believes, how they dress, who they hang out with, what they read, who they marry, etc.
When Mark/Mary start taking away your constitutional rights, you lemme know.
Til then, mind your business and balance the budget.
