We have too many shootings but inflating the numbers with all these small events and acting like every one is one of the major ones is purposefully disingenuous and only going to push people against gun control.
School hours is relevant because a lot of them are random skirmishes in school parking lots when there’s no one else is there, that’s no where near on the same playing field as something like uvalde, and we know that’s the type of shooting people think of when they hear “school shooting”.
What people think of as “mass shootings” and what these statistics are mostly made up of should definitely not be discussed in the same context or presented in the same manner.
Anecdotal.
It makes sense, though -- Cartels wouldn't want Uncle Sam sniffing around their business any more than he already is, since that would be bad for business.
It's much easier for them to operate if the US Gov't gaze isn't afixed upon them for weapons smuggling on top of all the other bad stuff they're involved in.
