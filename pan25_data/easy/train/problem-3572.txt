The USPS Board of Governors functions almost more like the Supreme Court with term limits insofar as the President makes appointments to fill vacancies as they come up and theres a high bar to remove one of them.
The Board hasn't had a quorum since 2014 due to the GOP Senate majority refusing to approve any of Obama's nominees, so there were a lot of vacancies for Trump to fill.
He appointed a total of 7 members to the Board out of the 9 positions that are presidentially appointed.
Since then, Biden has replaced 5 of them, but the Postmaster General and the Deputy Postmaster General both get a vote and they're both Republicans, so the vote count currently stands at 5-6 in favor of ousting DeJoy.
Not true.
The cost to add chargers to our stations is massive.
And our electric bills are going to be insane.
I work at the P.O., and weâ€™re already been told that our station is ineligible for EVs since there is not place the chargers can be installed within code.
It lowers our credibility.
Just like what the Golden Turd did with the Iran nuclear contract making our word non-trustworthy.
And that contract was certainly not shit.
