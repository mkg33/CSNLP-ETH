Boehner had a much, much larger majority than what the projected Republican majority will be.
There are moderate Republicans, even if the mainline party is entrenched, and everyone in the House is up for re-election in 2 years.
Regardless, whoever the Republicans (or Democrats) would elect as Speaker of the House is going to have to contend with the need to reach across the aisle for votes or placate the extreme fringes of their party.
If the Lord of Hamberders continues to drive a wedge between the Republican base, things could get difficult for a Republican majority leader.
What optimism.
I'm literally pointing out how we are probably about to get fucked yet again.
Further continuing on with my take that three Supreme Court Judges were already showing signs of being favorable with Brett playing at being ambiguous as an obvious 4th.
Supreme Court initial response definitely seems like 3 are already on board and Brett will join in no doubt as the fourth.
Its not looking good tbh.
This was literally a large part of GOP wanting to pack the Supreme Court with federalist to begin with.
