I sip fluids through it and then rinse/brush it.
There’s nothing to be stuck in there or to be dirty in any way.

After four or more uses, reusable plastic bags are superior to all types of disposable bags — paper, polyethylene, and compostable plastic, across all significant environmental indicators.

I work in the bio-plastic industry.
Exactly.
Just think about all the work it takes to plant and grow a thing, harvest, pack, ship, and deliver.

Many break down in regular industrial compost facilities.
But there’s so many issues.
They are hard to sort at recycling facilities because they look like plastic, there’s different types that need different processes to break down.
They need to be harmonized to be effective and right now it’s all over the place.
bio plastics work really well in some circumstances like agricultural film.
But for consumer products, they could work with a little bit of streamlining.
