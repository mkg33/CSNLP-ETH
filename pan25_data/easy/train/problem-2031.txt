It's kinda crazy, this is just my anecdotal experience and obviously not trying to make any overarching claims about sickness trends, but I've noticed it seems like a lot of people are getting sick from various stuff now at a higher rate than pre-Covid.
Even during the start of Covid and lock downs, seems like covid was about the only thing going around - probably due to said lock downs, masks, social distancing, etc, making transmission of other things less likely.
But over the last few months it seems like a lot of people I know have been coming down with various illnesses at a greater frequency than before Covid.
I'm probably just noticing it more now, but I'd actually be interested in seeing if there's any kind of data on such things and whether I'm noticing an actual trend or just more aware of when people come down with something.
Nope.
Unfortunately.
Up until recently it was one of those places that had the same people working there together for 40 or 50 years who all had a really good relationship with each other.
Also until recently it was a French owned company.
So most of the policies were made by corporate and were more worker conscious.
But they just sold to an American investment firm.
So we'll see how that goes.
