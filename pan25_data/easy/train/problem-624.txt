Well the are technically getting American Tanks, the Ukrainians will be driving them.
They figured it was the best way to deliver the American Ammo we are sending them.
ðŸ¤£.
The problem is that Russia has suffered under a authoritarian, kleptocratic, racist, militaristic and imperialistic regime for 100 years, add the trauma of ww2.
Nah.
Letâ€™s keep that word for better occasions.
There are different levels of evil.
Not to say that Russia has no characteristics of it whatsoever.
But it ainâ€™t remotely similar to Nazi Germany.
It is nothing fanatical.
More indifference melted together with some motherland blabla.
It shares some totalitarian features.
And it wages wars for conquest.
The Nazis however had some ridiculously evil side hobbies beyond war.
Never forget about that.
Otherwise we could argue that the USA was as evil as the Nazis because natives.
I mean it is very evil.
But at another level.
Not lower or higher perse.
Just a different kind.
Hence words matter.
Soviet Union places quite firmly on the evil side, with all those invasions, genocides, pogroms, exploitation of minorities, lack of human rights, etc.
Grow a pair dude.
Rape even occurs outside of wars.
Bad sure.
Like comparable to smoothly and efficiently killing 6 million Jews?
Nope.
Simple as that.
So why do I want to spell this out?
Would be easy no?
Showing that I care too by comparing them with Nazis.
Because it matters man.
It really does.
Otherwise we can also talk about how we treat animals.
Not all evil is the same.
Did you ever follow what happened in Congo?
Why we want this comparison so bad in this case?
Why can we not simply see what it is?
It is nothing like Nazi Germany.
It is older stuff.
Empire building.
Power.
