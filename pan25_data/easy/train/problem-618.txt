A big issue with China is that they project a shit ton of soft power that isn’t big news.
In Canada they have taken over natural resource companies, valuable land, and there is a high Chinese population here which allows them to easily justify or hide these secret police outposts and other shit.
Not blaming the immigrant population btw, they aren’t responsible.
But China will be well positioned if they choose to stir shit up.
edit: FYI on the below.
lexlibertas will go on to refuse to acknowledge that China's threat to attack Taiwan and break off diplomatic ties (such as the UN) is a major reason Taiwan hasn't declared itself officially as an independent country and that the US and others haven't acknowledged Taiwan as an independent country.
He then claims that the reason the US doesn't acknowledge Taiwan as independence is because California might declare indepdence which is a total joke.
That is not why US hasn't acknowledged Taiwan and it's proven by Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.
Just the mere exercise of some independence by having a top US official visit Taiwan was enough for China to surround Taiwan with it's navy and fire missiles over or near Taiwan.
Imagine what China would do if the US actually recognized Taiwan if China would do all that just for member of congress visiting Taiwan.
