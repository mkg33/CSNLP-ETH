Mueller's rebuttal should have been big news, and I certainly heard it and felt that way at the time, but for most people it was completely drowned out, spoken out of existence.
The bleating masses screaming 'no collusion' and covering their ears were never going to be swayed, but if Mueller had stood and truly defended and explained his findings, rather than nodding along and citing his report, maybe it wouldn't be so common today for non-maga people to believe he exonerated Trump.
His exchange with Schiff in that hearing was as close as he got to telling the people the truth about Trump.
In a just world, that would have been enough, but this is not a just world.
That hearing was enough to make them terrified of Adam Schiff, and rightly so, but their propaganda machine made quick work of him.
All things considered, it may have been an impossible task, but what Mueller did was not enough to protect us from Trump, and I fear January 6th isn't as bad as that's going to turn out.
