We (or at least I, as part of the public) thought this was going to be a decade in which we could capitalize on an expanded peace dividend now that the War on Terror was effectively over, in which case I think Bernie would have been an excellent president for domestic reform to improve quality of life.
Thanks guys.
Sorry, new to Reddit and was unaware of the saved post feature.
Thanks for all the help.
I work long hours doing construction and I try to stay up to date with what's going on in the world.
