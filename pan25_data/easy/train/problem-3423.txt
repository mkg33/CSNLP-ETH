your not thinking big enough, firstly, if kadyrov wants to take out prigozhin or lukashenko, he doesn't need that nuke to necessarily be a projectile.
a truck might just do the trick.
The thing is I am sure Putin has already decided on his successor and is keeping him well hidden until the day he dies , donâ€™t forget Putin literally waited years to begin his invasion making sure every piece was in its place and that Russia had enough gold and money to survive the war sanctions , they are still going strong after an entire fucking year , I have seen videos of common Russian people and nothing has changed except for some brands leaving and being replaced by home based brands there .
Putin is the emperor of Russia and if anyone disobeys him even oligarchs they die , 13 of them have died this year becuz Putin suspected them of disloyalty so his system is quite robust and efficient .
Meh.
The ability to use them as projectile weapons is likely centralized.
Same reason Ukraine gave up theirs after the USSR fell.
Couldn't use em alone.
Couldn't maintain em alone.
The nuclear material though....eesh.
