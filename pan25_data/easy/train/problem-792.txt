Had the kids cough meds just a few days ago with Indian manufacturers using anti freeze to safe a penny or so per dose.
Those pennies add up but so do the dead kids.
In this specific case, the onus of enforcement was on FDA in US as the company in question only had an export license and did not produce in the Indian market, leading to it not being checked by Indian authorities (medical ones especially).
Nothing needs to change.
Medicines to be used in India are tested by Indian drugs controller.
Medicines to be used in USA have to be tested by their respective bodies and same goes for Germany.
Either you start making your own medicines or you improve your regulations.
And similarly US needs to better enforce it's drug controls.
Do remember that when Pfizer was told to validate their vaccine before usage in India, they pulled out.
As much as I want export controls in India to be improved, the US and any other country for that matter has to put in quality checks to ensure that they are not importing garbage especially when it comes to medicines and other important goods.
I don't understand this.
If you want to be a complete piece of human garbage and water down medicine...
