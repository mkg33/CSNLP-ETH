Please explain how that is at all parallel to Russia today with Ukraine.
Set aside whether you like it or not.
Explain how retaking territory that was taken via a genocidal and illegal war against Israel makes Israel like Russia.
Israel building houses in territory taken from Israel in 1948 by a genocidal invasion, or evicting a handful of Palestinians (the area is 60% of the West Bank and 5% of the Palestinian population; it’s mostly empty and stories of evictions are wildly exaggerated) is completely different from Russia invading Ukraine.
Will you able to work still even tho your home is gone?
What about the kids?
Wife?
It’s raining tonight, I guess we have to go to the refugee camp.
Israel is violently annexing their neighbour over nonsensical "historical claims."
What, do you think Crimea is Russian?
3) It’s interesting that not demolishing it illegally is rewarding criminality.
You support that for the tens of thousands of illegally built Palestinian homes too?
Or only when Jews are involved?
"Palestinian Islamic scholar Issam Amira said in a sermon at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem that any form of Arab nationalism, including Palestinian nationalism, is a “colonial heretical innovation,” calling all Arab states are “null and void.”.
And no.
Those houses are not illegal under Israeli law.
That’s just the stuff people say when they try to take snippets of history out of context or when they falsely equate something that happens a very small amount of times (like people building without housing permits or on disputed land, which both Palestinians and Israelis do) with the far more common legally built homes.
Same as how they pretend the settlements are all built on land Palestinians were evicted from, even though almost all of them are built on land that’s been empty and was owned by the Ottoman state, then the British, then Israel, and has been state-owned land for hundreds of years.
