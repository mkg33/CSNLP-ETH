Second, I'm sorry but I cannot make heads or tails of what you're saying otherwise.
You mention something about a deal, but a deal for what?
I made no mention of some deal, unless you're referring to the oil transportation fees over old soviet pipelines to which Id say their "making good" was the nord stream because it bypassed those fees.
As far as control over European energy, remember their whole plan was to take Ukraine in a matter of days, likely under the assumption all of Europe wouldn't have waned itself off their oil had they done so.
Now, aside from saving face in an effort to not look weak, the only reason to keep going is for that strategic advantage of closing the eaforementiom European plain.
They could still export the oil to China but an independent Ukraine isn't going to be able to deliver their oil to China anyway so it poses no threat to them.
Unprecedented?
Yeah that whole cold war, cuban missile crisis, and training kids to cover their heads with books when russian nukes fell was just totally normal.
Fuck this loser and his alarmist rhetoric.
Theres a real simple way to ease tensions, fuckwit.
