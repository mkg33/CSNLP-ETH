It'd be like driving around slowly with the windows down in the only working car in the zombie apocalypse.
Its going to be coveted.
Now, if we get a breakthrough and someone invents "small" fusion, somehow generating electricity directly from some simple device, no huge control infrastructure, no tokamak or lasers, no steam plant and spinning generator, etc, that would be a different story.

I wouldn't worry about tritium.
There literally hundreds of millions of weapon sight, compasses, watches, fire exit signs, industrial equipment dials and even key chains that contain tritium out there.
There is more than enough hydrogen around.
Everywhere.
