And I get that to some people this is a touchy subject because we all collectively pretend that historic figures were shining examples in every aspect of life, and everyone is so butthurt and eager to scuff at each other every chance we get that every example is immediately labeled as a strawman and people get more hung up on the example than the point someone tries to make, but safe to say Navalny wouldn't be the first iconic figure with a questionable background doing important things while also having awful views.
Post-truth accountability is a first world privilege that really shouldn't be applied until a certain quality of life is achieved in my opinion.
Also, regarding elections.
There were.
In 92 and 96.
And I can even believe the 2000 one.
A hungry scared Russia elected whom Betrzovsky’s channel 1 was telling them would save it.
He DEFINITELY miscalculated in Ukraine.
But will he admit it & back down?
Or will he double down until this whole thing plays out - whether with this back & forth or with Putin getting assassinated & a new Russian leader takes over who TOTALLY pulls back out of Ukraine, saying “that was ALL Putin” - and they’re back on the world stage with a microphone again??
Remains to be seen, but yes, he is a terrible coward.
