We agree on the nuclear secrets part, thereâ€™s no actual evidence nuclear secrets were involved as far as we know.
I love that you picked that source, Iâ€™m very familiar with it and use it for teaching.
I want you to re-read it, but this time pay particular attention to what the article says the President needs to do, and notice that when talking about the President there are very little to no requirements necessary and it even says the Presidents authority to declassify at will has never been challenged in court, notice that the author after research agreed a President can declassify at will with no set proceduresâ€¦â€¦.then continue reading down to where you get the impression that the President must follow certain procedures but notice the subject has clearly changed, the author is no longer talking about procedures a president must follow, the author is now describing what authorities must follow, and officials must follow.
The author clearly used the term President when describing that a presidents ability to declassify without set protocol has never been challenged in court, and that the restrictions that do need to be followed are others who work for the President, Authorities and officials.
This article confuses a lot of people because the author changes subjects relatively seamlessly and most still think they are talking about a procedure a President must follow even though earlier in the article itâ€™s clear a President does not have a policy they must followâ€¦.after re-reading it and looking for the change in the subject if you still need help picking them out I can copy and paste the differences for you.
No?
You don't want an AG who is a lying piece of shit whose sole motivation for government is to hasten the Rapture, as if he's getting anywhere near St. Peter anyway?
