He was trying to rewrite the constitution to cement his own power and the power of his party.
By all accounts, Peru has a pretty good constitution so there wasn't really any good reason to rewrite it while there are so many more pressing issues in the country.
I can't say if the corruption accusations against Castillo and his family were true, it seems too hard to say for sure from a distance.
It's important to note that he was the 5th president in 7 years and had an approval rating in October of 20%.
Hi army chief resigned saying that Castillo was try to force him to appoint political loyalists to key posts.
He ran through 6 interior ministers.
People around him kept getting swept up in petty corruption scandals including an aide that stashed $20K from unknown sources in a presidential palace bathroom.
The investigations were politically motivated, but for reasons.
He appointed several people to his cabinet who were at the time of appointment being investigated for crimes ranging from domestic violence to murder.
Democracy isn't easy.
It's a fight to keep it every damn single day.
You don't defend it by becoming a dictator.
