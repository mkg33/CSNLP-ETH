Not much need for discipline.
They are meet for the grinder.
Nothing more.
If they refuse to advance they are shot.
If they move forward they will be shot or blown up.
Russia is a brutal country.
Always has been.
It might not also be a bad deal from the inmate's perspective: your options are to either stay and die in a Russian penal colony, or get a fighting chance with the option of just fleeing or being taken prisoner by Ukrainian army if the opportunity rises.
They're being used to form zombie waves.
There was a recent report of a Ukraine squad being surrounded by all recruits.
The Ukraine soldiers described them as unflinching to direct bullet hits/pain & mindlessly ever-moving forward.
It was wave after wave, until the Ukraine soldiers nearly ran out of ammo.
Then the Wagner leader just called off the attack & retreated.
Because that attack was a test of the drugs used on Wagner recruits & a determination of how many waves it takes to run ammo out.
fucking savages.
donno what's worse right now ISIS or Wagner...i guess still the first because of the religion crap.
but both are terrible.
