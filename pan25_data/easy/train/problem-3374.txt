In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.

Every time I have gotten in an argument over licensing the person I was arguing with eventually admits they want the licensing because it allows the government to discourage gun ownership in general than it being any attempt to directly address any specific gun crime issue.

There is literally no option being offered from the zealot side other than “nothing changes unless it makes it easier or cheaper for me to have a gun.”.
