I hate to say it, but this is probably the only time in my life that my goals actually coincide with that of the military industrial complex.
Just have different reasons.
I want Ukraine to win over Russia's Imperialism (fascism).
I am on Ukraine's side because I think they are doing the right thing.
The complex, well, I imagine they are motivated by huge sums of money.

Right now Ukraine is devastating Russia's military capability.
Despite the small amount of funding they are getting for weapons (let's be honest, its a drop in the pond for US military budget), the return the US is getting on this investment is incalculable.
It will no longer take a staggering amount of money to protect US interests abroad from Russia now.
Not only that, but with NATO getting new members, the US military/industrial complex stands to save even more money (because of the new members commitment).
