I would support affordable test for safety.
Opioids outside of a hospital setting is almost a guaranteed tragedy.
Legal amphetamines are nothing compared to pipes or even worse injections of meth.
I really don’t hear a lot about people destroying their lives over with prescription amphetamines.
I see it with Vicodins, with Xanax, hell even Valiums.
I’d imagine that decriminalization is a significant step towards reducing arrests and administrative costs.
Then once it’s decriminalized wouldn’t the next logical step be to make it safe for the people who do use it?
IIRC during prohibition, there were attempts to deter alcohol consumption by deliberately poisoning it with methanol, and that didn’t accomplish any reduction in alcohol consumption as far as I’m aware, it simply blinded and killed people.
Similarly, keeping the drugs dangerous wouldn’t accomplish anything towards reducing usage, would it?

It’s not free and therefore cost prohibitive, which will cause much of the community in need to not use those services.
