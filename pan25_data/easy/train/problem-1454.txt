I don't think there's anything random there.
Russia is fucked for resources and has absolute power, they go "send rations for our troops or we just take over the factory".
Seems pretty straight forward to me.
That’s how important logistics are to a military, if you take the top 4 countries in Europe without including the UK and combine their naval auxiliary fleets which gives them the ability to wage a war that isn’t on your doorstep, you’d still field less tonnage of vessels than the UK, yet you think France with a smaller auxiliary of the UK which itself is a fraction of what the UK had during the Falklands could exceed that?
Delusional.
This also may make war end sooner.
Consider the following scenario - someone high in the command chain wants to off Putin.
In one case western powers will say "sure, if you do it we can put some holes in our sanctions" that is then used to convince other politicians and oligarchs that it's worth giving a try.
Compared to "your country is done for, screw you" which makes Russia's current path the ONLY path.
