You don't need a source from last week to prove a point.

Not commentary.
Not just using their office as a soapbox to say stupid shit like AOC did like yesterday, but actual legislation threatening to close libraries unless certain books are removed, as has been done in Texas and Florida?
Or releasing legal guidance which says any parent helping facilitate their own child's gender transition can be investigated and charged with child endangerment, as has been done (yet again) by actual fascists with an 'R' by their names in Florida and Texas?
