At the risk of sounding like I'm wearing a tinfoil hat, I can easily imagine this kind of institution ultimately being used to police progressive and left wing activists organizing around climate change or police brutality, while continuing to turn a blind eye to the increasingly violent far right.
Absolute slap in the face.
It will have no real impact on anything and only potentially addresses one specific way of subverting democracy.
But they have their soundbyte, job done.
Multiple studies (including a recent one from ) have consistently found that American law enforcement agencies and departments have connections to the far-right.
The very people who organized and executed the Jan. 6th riot.
These studies go back .
This won't change anything, because the police were actively helping insurrectionists into the building, taking down barriers and opening doors - at least until some of them started assaulting officers and killed one of them once they were inside.
I came here to say this.
If they make a new law enforcement agency, who is vetting the people being hired into it?
Or are they just moving in LEO's from other agencies?
If all you do is move, or hire in more far-right lunatics, they'll just step aside and let insurrectionists in the capitol just like most of the capitol police did last time.
