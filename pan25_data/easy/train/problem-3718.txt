Oh how convenient, let’s ignore all the other mass shootings because he used the example of a kid getting a gun and shooting up a school.
What about an 18 year old kid getting a cache of weapons and shooting up a gay club?
Or any number of other examples.
America has a sick and broken psyche when it comes to guns and violence.
I have no idea how to solve it, but dismissing it isn’t helping.

Seriously 13?
Just 13?
What deluded metric are you using to define a mass shooting?
A quick google will tell you a mass shooting is defined when 3-4+ people are shot and killed in the same incident excluding the perpetrator/s.
So when you use the widely excepted definition there has been way more than 13 in just this year, if you include shot and not killed that number goes up again.
So go lie somewhere else please.
Your apologist propaganda for the gun lobby is not helping anyone:
