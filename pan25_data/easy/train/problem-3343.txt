Why is everyone just accepting that voting for any of this is still acceptable?
We absolutely need to hold any of them with political power and anyone committing violence accountable but we also need to bring back the concept of shame.
Politicians and terrorists have paths for this where they [theoretically] can be dealt with.
For the average voter tho theres societal pressure.
They need to face social consequences for their actions/beliefs/support.
Authorities can deal with the other problematic factions but social mores are supposed to influence the areas that can’t be legislated but are still dependent on having a functional society.
We need to stop engaging with them, trying to save them, ignoring these sides of them so theres something to lose by engaging in any of this.
They can still be trash on their own time but they need to be pushed back into at least taking their shit out of our government because they’re embarrassed enough to keep it to their fcking selves so they can’t hurt anyone.
