Been to Louisiana many times.
Aside from parts of New Orleans and maybe Baton Rouge, it’s a lovely state with tons of recreational, cultural and culinary opportunities.
As someone from the outside looking in, I would not consider it a “shithole” state.
Does it have problems?
Yes.
Does every state in the union have problems?
Yes.
Having a poor law on the books does not make an entire state a shithole.
I personally think large swaths of California, and New York, not even to mention New Jersey are pretty shitty, but they all have their upsides too.
Maybe you would be taken more seriously if you didn’t make overly broad, demonstrably inaccurate comments about people and places based on your personal political beliefs.
How about this...
Instead of turning to hate and short-sighted ideas like "they deserve it," we think about ways to better represent surpressed communities and better educate everyone.
Me too man.
I got an IUD 4 months before the ban but I had an emergency plan + finances in case I ever had a positive pregnancy test, because there'd be a 50% chance of ectopic.
And it's not safe to have an ectopic pregnancy in a state with a full ban.
I would suffer for sure, and possibly die.
