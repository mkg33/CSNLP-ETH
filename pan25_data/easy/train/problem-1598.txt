Yeah we're patting ourselves on the back but it took a year just to agree to finally send some modern-ish tanks, and only single digits made it into the country.
Still no ATACMS, the offered MiGs are somewhere in limbo for a year too, and Biden just rejected F-16s.
The American people, Congress, the Pentagon, CIA, etc.
still overwhelming despise Russia and would see support continue.
E: obviously this is operating on publicly available information.
Maybe CIA knows Putin will shit himself to death within the year, or that the russian army only has a months of reserves left, etc.
In which case it might not be necessary.
But nothing from what we can see indicates that.
All speculation.
I do like how they share intelligence as a means to build support domestically and internationally for ukraine .so far seems to be working fairly well.
Unfortunately he's probably right.
Russian military is shit, but in the words of Joseph Stalin, "quantity has a quality all on its own."
It may just be propaganda, but Putin has allegedly gotten more popular with his people in the last year, and this has certainly let gonn consolidate his power base.
