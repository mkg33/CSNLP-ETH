Dems are between a rock and a hard place.
We can only barely win the presidency because of the electoral college, even if we win the population vote by as much as 10 million votes.
And because of Republicans having more low population states than Democrats, we can't get anything passed because of Republican obstruction via the filibuster, and yet we can't get rid of the filibuster because of Manchin, yet we can't get rid of Manchin because he'd almost certainly be replaced by a Republican given the makeup of W. Virginia which would cost Dems a slim senate majority.
And then we have gerrymandering screwing things up in the house.
So Republicans can get presidents elected who most voters voted against, and control the senate which represents a minority of the population, and use this power to ram through right wing judges who are unpopular with the majority of the country to further entrench minoritarian rule by refusing to rule against gerrymandering.
It's literally tyranny of the minority.
How?
You have a fascist or an old man.
Pick the old man.
That’s it.
That’s the choices.
There’s no problem, that’s literally it!
Unless you mean the primary in which case yeah don’t vote for the old man.
But in the general?
Why would you vote a fascist over an old man.
