Most of the wealthy pay extreme small amounts in taxes and hide income in unrealized gain.
They play games to make their "incone" seem tiny such as taking out very low rate loans to cover day to day expenses to operate "at a loss".
They'll trickle those unrealized gains into "income" as little as possible until they find a loophole or they are put into a spot where they are forced to sell like Musk.
Anyone that thinks billionaires pay their fair share have had the wool pulled over their eyes.

I think for the price I’m paying for my apartment it feels like section eight with how much the landlord is making/not doing any renovations.
Yeah, I’m saying a landlord must be capped for what they can charge for monthly rent.
A certain percentage of someone’s monthly gross salary.
I don’t care if it’s a 60 year old retiree or Blackrock.
