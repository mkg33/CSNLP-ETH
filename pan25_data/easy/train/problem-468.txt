How do you know what effects Trump's rhetoric and bad ideas have and will have on the public?
And do you somehow think he doesn't still have influence on Republican policies and the actions of sitting Republican politicians?
On top of that, can you see 10 or 20 years in the future (if we're lucky), when the action of NOT going after him for crimes may result in the US slipping even further into outright authoritarianism because others feel like they can further push the envelope after he got away free?
It's not ridiculous at all.
A union looks out for the interests of the workers, which - for example - means creating safe working conditions rather than ensuring dangerous working conditions in order to avoid nearly all accountability and separating tasks into different areas of expertise rather than overloading a huge range of tasks onto a small group of people (with virtually no training requirements) so that they have wide-ranging powers in service of duties they cannot possibly fulfill.
