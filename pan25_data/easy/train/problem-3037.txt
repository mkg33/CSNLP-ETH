The Trump campaign had heard of the laptop during the summer, when a man from Delaware reached out to say that it had been abandoned at his repair shop.
The first known public mention of it came on September 25th, from a guest on the YouTube channel of Wang Dinggang, one of Guo’s collaborators.
The guest claimed that explicit material on the laptop was “recorded by the C.C.P.” and had “arrived mysteriously in America” to provide the Party with leverage over Joe Biden as he ran for President.

Apparently, Miles can.”.
