America is bankrolling the deaths of Ukrainians and Russians not for some moral good, but in the service of geopolitical goals.
What we should be doing, and indeed should've done the moment hostilities broke out, is using our position as the world superpower to force Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table immediately without any preconditions from either party.
Leftist trash eh?
Well by golly, I guess if supporting a country whose land was illegally annexed and later illegally invaded then I guess I’m leftist trash.
What’s your excuse for being a conservative sack of shit?
No, Russia's invasion is complete unacceptable and absolutely indefensible.
I'm not absolving them of anything.
But, in case you didn't notice, America is not the country being invaded or the victim.
And regardless, Ukrainian sovereignty is not worth one single life lost and neither would America's sovereignty be if we were attacked, and nor would any other state's sovereignty be morally worth even one lost life in any other war, real or theorized.
