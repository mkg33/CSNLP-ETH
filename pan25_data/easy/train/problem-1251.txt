I did a very simple exercise.
After one witness testimony, I read the coverage in anti-Bibi media, the coverage in pro-Bibi media and then took the actual protocols of the testimony and read them start to finish.
There was only minor difference between the pro-Bibi media coverage and reality, while there was 180 degree difference between anti-Bibi media coverage and reality.
To put it simply, anti-Bibi media ignored cross interrogation, that actually nullified everything that the witness claimed in her initial testimony.
Yup.
Because this ultra far right govt will fuck shit up now.
Two state solution discussion is dead and things will be bad for next few years, esp for Palestinians.
Western Imperialism good point.
Although that dislocation process has continued for decades with geopolitical backing and direct funding from United States tax dollars.
How it's going?
Let's put it this way: in the last 6 months media that opposes Netanyahu avoids reporting on it, while the media that supports Netanyahu reports constantly.
I don't think there is a need to spell out why...
