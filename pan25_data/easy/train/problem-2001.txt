I think it's past the point where compensation seems like a good solution.
I just wish the Japanese government would admit what they did to Korea was atrocious and accurately teach to their students that what Japan did in WW2 was horrible.
Like actually go into detail about the numerous warcrimes Imperial Japan committed in WW2 similiar to what Germany does today instead of glossing over it or omitting those events completely from history textbooks.
What irks me so much about Japanese racism against Koreans is that the historical relationship is extremely one sided in terms of who violated who.
I can immediately think of comparisons of Korea and Japan's historical relationship to the likes of Ireland-Britain, Poland-Germany, Armenia-Turkey, and Ukraine-Russia.
No.
You're still not understanding.
I'm not likening your comment to antisemitism in terms of racism.
I'm likening it to ridiculous things like belief in the Illuminati and anti-Semitism.
You don't have to take it so personally or be so offended by everything.
You're still ignoring everything else I wrote.
