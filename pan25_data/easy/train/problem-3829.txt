The defence review is currently being redrafted in the wake of the Ukraine invasion but I think it would be extremely foolish to pull back from “East of Suez” once again and have all that effort be for nothing.
Either way, post-Brexit, there is a strong impetus to forge stronger alliances with nations in the region.
This has come in the form of Japanese and Australian Free Trade Agreements, AUKUS and the Tempest project but also the UK’s application to join the CPTPP Pacific trading bloc.
Interesting times ahead for sure.
The UK was one of just a few European nations to actually actively train Ukrainian soldiers after the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, no other major European nation provided training, this was provided right up until the 2022 invasion where it was then scaled up further and moved to the United Kingdom, it also was one of the first countries to deploy massive amounts of defensive weaponry to Ukraine, choosing to do so before the war began so Ukraine could train and then forward deploy it.
No problem.
I believe it is meant to play into the 2021 British Integrated Defence Review’s plan for an “Indo-Pacific tilt” due to the region’s growing importance to the world both geopolitically and economically.
No, no.
Japan brings the Gundams, Britain brings the warships.
And yes, the mobile suits do tend to get the limelight, but don't underestimate Gundam series capital ships.
