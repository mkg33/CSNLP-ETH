I even met a Belarusian guy who was hiding out there, he was nice.
He also directed me to a nice Thai-Aussie hippie dude who sold me weed.
Anyway....
So the war starts.
The mobilisation starts and guess where max is?
Kazakhstan!
He fled the mobilisation hahahaha.
It seems his patriotic pride only went so far.
Exactly.
I had a friend sign a petition at the start of the war and within 24 hours she had gotten a call from her work and her boss was terrified for her asking her what she signed because someone was asking her questions and that they would have to talk about it with the police.
I went last year and I loved it.
The Russians there aren't rude or anything, they're just there doing their thing.
Never had a negative encounter.
Unfortunately, propaganda works the most effectively against the poor and uneducated.
See recent documentaries on families from regions - they all blame Ukrainians for the deaths of their children, not Putin.
Even before February, during elections, these minority regions overwhelmingly supported Putin and his regime with protests being mostly limited to metropolis areas.
Always want to send him a message and bring it up....
But then i would have fucking fled mobilisation and i hope hes ok. Might be an asshole but no one deserves that shit.
