The maori we're enthusiastic traders of these cultural items for western guns and other merchandise.
To claim these items were looted is total bullshit.
You appear to be libertarian (my apologies if I am mistaken about this), and if understand libertarian frameworks where governments ought to have as small a role as possible, one of the very few absolutely crucial roles the government still retains is adjudicating the breaches of contracts that are freely agreed between parties, as appears to be the case here.
Gifted to someone in 1886.
Personally, I think it's almost impossible to argue that since the items have fallen out of possession of a family, a 137 year old verbal agreement should be upheld.
I think legally that'd be the case too.
Try also to keep in mind that practices around the connection to buried objects / cemeteries in Polynesian cultures are so strong and so well known that the first European to land in New Zealand (Captain Cook) was killed in Hawaii in 1779 after an escalating situation that initiated when he ordered his crew to steal wood surrounding the indigenous cemetary where cheiftains were buried (Morai).
