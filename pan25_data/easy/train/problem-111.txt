Ehhh maybe once but not now.
At least in a practical sense they don't really do shit other than take credit for things other groups do and suck members dues into their personal accounts.
Most pro gun people have turned on the NRA for basically just being grossly corrupt sellouts.
Exactly.
I just don’t understand - if you don’t want to deal with someone who is knocking at your door, then just don’t answer the door.
They’ll go away and you won’t have to talk to them.
Donations =/= results.
Court battles are where the real action happens and the real work gets done as far as advancing or protecting gun rights and striking down gun control laws and the group doing that is almost always GOA or FPC or some other group that is not the NRA.
Maybe the NRA rides their coattails on an individual case but the NRA of even the early 2000's isn't the NRA of today.
Emotional reaction evolved long before rational deduction.
It's why chimps fling poo when their agitated, not come up with rational solutions to what's agitating them.
