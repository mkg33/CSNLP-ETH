In 2020, I took my mail ballot to the county elections building in downtown Pittsburgh on election day.
They had a few parking spots in front of the building just for drop-offs.
Of course I also had my own car to drive down there and the time to do it.
And naturally in this environment of decay, the party is descending into an entity that is openly considering abandoning Constitutional norms.
Dumbshits, who did that?
Republicans used to be all about accommodating voters with early voting and mail in ballots, that was their domain.
Then this aggrieved paranoiac came along and started shitting all over anything that he thought would be detrimental to his odds on the margins, including mail in ballots, and the whole party just ingratiated themselves and went along with his lies to the point of limiting voting methods and banning early votes from tabulation in battleground states until after polls closed.
Completely self inflicted idiocy.
They need a reset.
They need to start sanctioning and expelling the window-breakers.
Stop the name-calling.
Restore comity.
Kick out the proud boys and the other militia groups.
Kick out the Q nuts.
FFS.
Several Republicans Senators were asked this week about Trump’s huge losses in this election culminating with Georgia and whether he’s a good leader for their party anymore, and their answers were all some mushmouthed iteration of, “Well, it’s more that we need to stop vilifying early voting…”.
You know what guys?
Maybe a wider window to voting and increasing accessibility means we may get more votes.
Like how if it rains on election day and our voters don't show up.
