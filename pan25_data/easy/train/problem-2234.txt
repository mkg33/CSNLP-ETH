No, it doesn't.
Armed officers aren't trained to shoot an assailant until the assailant is dead, they're trained to shoot until the assailant is no longer a threat.
Armed officers are trained to not let an assailant get within about 25-30 feet of them, because otherwise the assailant can charge the officer, knock them over, take their gun, and kill them.
Safely stopping an attacker in a way that disables them without injuring them is difficult, but shooting an attacker is much easier and safer for the officer.
Meanwhile, armed officers generally don't want to let an assailant get within about 25-30 feet away from the officer.
Within that range, an assailant can charge an officer and reach them before the officer can draw, aim, and fire.
This is a problem because an armed assailant can stab them or an unarmed assailant can knock them over, take their gun, and shoot them.
Either way, your bad guy now has the officer's gun.
