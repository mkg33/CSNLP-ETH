Not necessarily.
Looks like, if you get lucky, there's a slight chance you just become a prisoner of war!
It’s hilariously ironic.
Additional bodies would be exceedingly helpful handling the staggering amount of logistical operations it takes to keep an army functioning.
These jobs would be perfect for volunteer prisoners, who are able to develop real skills while aiding the war.
They could have actual impact there with minimal training while freeing up more experienced and trained troops.
Yes actually.
Keep throwing Russians at Ukraine until they push through, and take land.
They’ll just keep throwing soldiers until the they win or run out of soldiers.
Or until someone makes a leadership change.
The war is far from over, but one main thing of note is that Russia really only managed to survive and push the Nazis back because they were defending and the Nazi supply lines were basically obliterated by weather and shortages, and Russia eventually got tons and tons of superior Western armaments.
If there is a take-away here, its that defensive warfare + Western arms were the crux of the win, both of which are now on the Ukrainian side.
In essence, Russia is the Nazis here.
I know a lot of people are making parallels to Russia's past wars, ie.
like WWII where the mass human zerg rushes coupled with some decent strategy eventually paid off, but I do not think this is a viable strategy in the modern era to gain and hold any real stretch of land.
