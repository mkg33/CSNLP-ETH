It's worth noting that nation building has absolutely worked in the past, much as Reddit would not like to admit it.
If it weren't for the USA delivering a monstrous cultural backslap to Japan at the end of WW2, then immediately going in to say sorry and make up for it, if you track Japan's culture at the time, it is extremely likely they would have ended up like North Korea or China in the modern day.

Well now the Americans are gone.
Let's see how the fare on their own.
