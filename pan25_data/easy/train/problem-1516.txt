I'm curious how these Iranian revolutionaries feel about separatism in Iran.
Examples being Arabs in the southwest, Kurds in the west.
Baluchs in the south east.
Azeris in the northwest.
Petroleum is inelastic and fungible.
For example, lets say your country can't buy petrol products from Iran, this doesn't mean that an intermediary can't buy Iranian oil and satisfy its own demand for oil off the market, thus lowering demand everywhere else since they won't be competing with your set of sellers.
Fungibility, a barrel of petrol is a barrel of petrol everywhere on earth.
These are not phone charges with regional wall sockets.
The situation with Iran and Its ethnic minorities are a bit complicated I mean Kurds and Baluchs are counted as Iranic peoples(Kurds outside of Iran have a very different opinion on this which is respectable I’m speaking on behalf of Iranian Kurds), no government in Iran’s history tried to do ethnic cleansing ,because Iran is made of these ethnicities the thought of an Iran with only Persian people never even occurs in many peoples head , we made our histories with one another,had revolutions together,toppled governments together and fought wars together.
Many of our dynasties in the past were made of Kurdish or Azeri tribes like the Kajars (Azeri)or Safavids(both), Persians didn’t rule over other ethnicities we ruled together.
