Germany's economy was destroyed in the aftermath of WW1 and, when the Nazis took over, they did a lot of stuff to make it look like everything was going great and Germany was on the up and up, but in reality, it was all a sham, most notably the idea that Nazi Germany had an amazingly efficient war machine.
In brief, a lot of what the Nazis did was create ways to get more people to do the same amount of work (i.e layers of bureaucracy, kicking Jewish people/other minorities out of jobs, encouraging women to stay at home, etc) and look pretty in front of the camera while doing it.
