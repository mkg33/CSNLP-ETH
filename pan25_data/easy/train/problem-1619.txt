Desantis just won reelection as governor in Florida last week after failing to address wether he'd serve a full term in a debate.
I don't think people down there that really like him will care too much, but if he registers now, just a week after the election, before even being sworn in for his second term it'll probably look pretty bad to those that are more moderate on the Republican side.
And because he's a smarter Trump, he'll follow the old ways, pretend to be governor for a year, and announce an exploratory committee next year, probably in the summer or something, whenever the campaigns normally start ramping up.
Exactly.
I’ll believe a split and third party tanking the republicans when it happens.
Until then, I’ll assume republicans will fall in line for their fascist when the time comes.
Exactly!
We don’t even know yet if DeSantis will run.
DeSantis might be smart enough to sit it out at least one more presidential election, because he’s probably been warn as well about Trump possibly running as an Independent.
He’s only 44, so he’s got times.
They’ll all fall inline.
