No nuclear power wants to fight the UK because the UK has nukes, no power without nukes has the means or geographical location to threaten even the UK's heavily reduced army.
The only people who support militarizing are people that haven't been paying attention for the last 80 years, Ukraine got invaded because it was asked to give up their nukes, if they had nukes Russia wouldn't have invaded, it's really not that complicated.
The problem arises when Russia go ahead and invade anyway because they think they can take out the nuclear facilities before they're fired, at that point you could end up in a full scale nuclear war on Europe's doorstep, and honestly with how ridiculously Russia have been playing out this conflict, I wouldn't be surprised if they would have been confident in doing such a thing.
Bro what.
You originally said they wasted all their money on the armed forces so went broke and the empire fell.
That's not what the source you posted said at all.
You sound like a Trump voter mate.
Your just making up history as you go.
Madness.
Dunkirk is an apt example of why a big military isn't everything, it didn't matter how but the UK's military was, Belgium didn't want to start to be involved in a war so they didn't let the allies occupy the entrenchment line until Germany had already surrounded the entire force through the ardennes, ultimately if you haven't got the land to actually fight on, then a large ground force is good for nothing but defending ports.
