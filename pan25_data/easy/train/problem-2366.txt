In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Horrible idea.
That just makes ideas meaningless and only candidates with a lot of money favored to win.
It's staggered to have candidates pitch ideas and win smaller States where they can touch every part of the State and scale their campaign and build coalitions.
Having it on the same day just makes it so the campaign with the most money wins every time.
No thanks.
1) South Carolina is a really cheap media market to start with and bucks the trend of starting in states with overwhelmingly white populations, it’s also trending blue in the long run, and even if it’s not super competitive southern black voters are an important constituency in the party, and one that is frequently underrepresented in Congress due to Gerrymandering.
