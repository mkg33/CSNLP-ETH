It turned out that the principal actively tried to keep school district inspectors out of his school (e.g.
to see if 504 plans were being followed) for good reason.
He was sexually harassing multiple teachers and having an affair with at least one of them.

He "mysteriously quit" one day just before the affairs/harassment became public.
Soon afterwards the school district gave us the IEP we had been asking for.
