Dont you just hate it when democracy gets in the way of politics, come to think of it why do so many people get to vote well never get it down to one party one rule if, we keep complicating things by letting every legal citizen(whatever that means) vote plus its not like our votes matter when the dnc and rnc run litterally anything and stack the candidates full of party/corporate loyalists so everytime a bernie comes around they use their power in numbers to sink their chances of ever winning democratically b4 they finish telling us who were allowed to vote for.
8.
Serious ‘chain of custody’ breakdowns.
Invalid residential addresses.
Record numbers of dead people voting.
Ballots in pristine, untouched condition without creases, that is, they had not been mailed in envelopes as required by law.
All of them contained a single vote for Biden, no down ticket voting occurred on the ballet and each ballet was completed with the use of a $10,000+ dye-sublimation printer (the SAME dye-sublimation printer for each ballot) …however and miraculously, these miracle ballets suddenly appear near the end of vote counting, after poll observers were removed, are accepted without question, and no one can verify who processed them.
