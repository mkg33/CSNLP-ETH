It sounds odd but I agree.
We don’t have to be tolerant.
Free speech is our right to disagree, and as individuals to make choices to stop doing business with those we won’t tolerate.
Absolutely!
I used to think that my situation wasn’t important enough or nobody cares about me.
I found out that there are thousands thinking and feeling JUST LIKE ME.
So, if I say something somebody feeling similar will likely read it, and so on and so on .

and we have an army.
Antisemitism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, anti-leftism, etc.

Interesting.
I sorted by controversial and not one downvoted comment.
The ones who promote these lies, and slanderous things are scurrying away like roaches to light right after this happens.
I’m a conservative and constitutionalist.
I am deeply disturbed that what you guys are saying they say is true.
It is true that some of them say some very conceded in their bubble comments that seem dangerously leaning to a theistic way of government similar to middle eastern countries that do not extend any respect or liberty to gays and trans.
Also, I wish people on both sides would not say things out of anger or joking because context and tone is easily missed through written messaging.
It’s just on us to be civil in how we receive and respond but we are free to say what we wish.
Most of the time you can tell when someone is being serious and whether I think they are wrong, factual, uneducated, misinformed, I will still support their right to free speech and an actual Nazi would not.
