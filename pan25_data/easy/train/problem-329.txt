Funny enough they have the same strategic role in the game Terra Invicta, haha.
Small, mostly insignificant nations that are fairly useful / dangerous b/c you (or any other org) could take them over to launch a single strategic nuclear strike.
With a level of plausible deniability, and w/out starting WW3, or any serious escalation / damage between the world's true major powers, which you might actually care about.
Israel or North Korea might get nuked / invaded in response to nuking, say, Texas, but the damage would basically more or less end there.
Job Opening: Senior IT / Infrastructure Administrator wanted.
Must be willing to travel.
High possibility of extremely extended vacations in unusual surroundings, without pay.
Yup.
There's a funny bit of US / Iranian military history there, incl their air force.
We were best buds with the Shah, and Iran basically helped subsidize / pay for the F-14 Tomcat, among other things.
All of that went completely south with the revolution, to say the least.
Saudi Arabia is our Saudi Arabia.
There is no other country with the same purpose of Saudi Arabia.
Maybe Iran for China and Russia.
But tbh we were the ones that created that beast that is Iran.
