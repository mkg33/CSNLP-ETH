Juat boycott.
Let each country recall their national teams.
As in their respective federations are calling the players back home.
What is fifa gonna do?
Ban the european federations?
Also why are the european federations and governments playing by FIFA rules?
They should have no power over these decisions.
FIFA didnt invent football ans FIFA doesnt own football.
I guess if Germany recalls their players alot of teams will follow.
And dont give me the players are waiting x years and the fame and money.
Messii makes more money sleeping than from the world cup.
inertia.
the world cup is so popular it has a stranglehold on fans.
they also have contracts that lock in teams/players etc.
all of those restrictions makes it very hard to move away from fifa.
even though they shouldn't hold all of that power, cause if like 3 or 4 of the big soccer countries move away from fifa it would be fucked.
but everyone has that "you first attitude.
".
"Volkswagen, Adidas, Lufthansa and Commerzbank, the DFBâ€™s other commercial partners, are also under pressure to react.
