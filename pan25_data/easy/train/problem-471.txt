Now the GOP is doing the same thing again, except they're also pushing through spending cuts on welfare programs that are \_really\_ popular, in order to cut down Dem support in 2024 elections.

If congress voted on funding each individual item, they would NEVER have time for any other aspect of governance.
These large budgets are the compromise for having a giant empire that controls a significant chunk of global wealth.

Every story is the same - Republicans are waging war on the United States, it's citizens, the Constitution and democracy itself.

All good people are called to rise up and promote democracy in your house and defend it in your community.
Rise up!
