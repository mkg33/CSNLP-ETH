Well it's not just that he just Spat in a fan and then wanted to build a wall.
The Fan was going crazy at edge of the stage so Waters spat on him in disgust, and then became more disgusted because the Fan liked it and started going crazier.
Fan is short for "Fanatic" after all, and Waters then kinda dissociated and realised these huge stadium concerts (vs the small private venues they used to play at) were basically akin to Nuremberg rallies, that the masses would just blindly cheer everything the people on stage did and follow them, even if the people on stage were just random people I masks (which is what the band would do at wall concerts, send out other people in masks for parts of it).
And so Waters wanted to build a wall and just hide away from all that, and that ultimately led to the Wall as a concept album.
Absolutely.
And even in a literal sense; some would risk actual death rather than experience the ego pain of admitting they don't know or could be wrong, and thus learn and change.
