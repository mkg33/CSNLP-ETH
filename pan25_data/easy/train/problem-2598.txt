You act like the NSA doesn't know what they are doing.
They followed that balloon with a spy plane and jammed its transmission while collecting all the data it was trying to transmit back to China to know exactly what it's purpose was.
It was a very smart move.
China told our government to shoot it down.
Why would you do what your enemy wants?
>Wikipedia: There is no international agreement on the vertical extent of sovereign airspace with suggestions ranging from about 30 km (19 mi/100,320 feet)—the extent of the highest aircraft and balloons—to about 160 km (100 mi/528,000)—approximately the lowest extent of short-term stable orbits.
It is though.
Sovereign airspace can extend up to the Karman Line which is at 100km or 328k feet above sea level, or infinitely depending on the laws of the country.
There's no agreed upon upper limit.
Countries can't just fly military aircraft in other countries airspace and not expect some kind of response.
It being steerable or not makes no difference to that.
