Yeah, I generally believe 538 and they try to account for this stuff, but it’s been pretty suspicious to me.
Like things were trending toward Democrats steadily for months, and then suddenly October hits and everything takes a hard turn toward Republicans for no clear reason.

It seems fishy and I’m trying to just ignore it.

Yep.
And even beyond the basic question of who you ask, there's a ton of ways to weight the result by how you apply screens and make statistical "adjustments" to try to equate your sample to the population as a whole.
This is what regular pollsters have to do too, but there's a huge difference between doing it in a neutral manner, and doing it in a biased manner.
