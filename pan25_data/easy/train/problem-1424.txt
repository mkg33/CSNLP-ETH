To avoid having to remove him from office Republicans didn't allow evidence and refused some witnesses at his 2nd impeachment.
If they had they would have had no choice but to remove him, they couldn't deny the evidence.
They also worked with him on his defense, that's the jury colluding with the defendant.
That's why I was dead set against the 2nd impeachment, I knew it would go nowhere and waste time and money.
I knew he'd become even more brazen having gotten off twice, I didn't quite see the insurrection coming though, but I knew he'd think he's untouchable.
The point of impeachment is political, it's like a mark on your soul, it doesn't work on someone without a soul or shame.
It has the exact opposite effect on Trump.
The constitution establishes a democratic republic.
That means it’s representative.
That’s means it’s supposed to be based on the peoples opinions.
The court isn’t supposed to be interpreting our laws.

Trump's pardons violated every ethical guideline.
He pardoned everyone who could testify against him.
There is nothing in the Constitution that says the President can't be charged with a crime.
Quite the opposite actually, the Supreme Court ruled that giving the President blanket immunity went against the belief that no one is above the law.
It's just become practice that they be impeached and removed from office first and nobody has challenged it.
Thanks to a corrupt Republican section of Congress Trump was never removed and therefore pardoned those who could have put him in prison.
