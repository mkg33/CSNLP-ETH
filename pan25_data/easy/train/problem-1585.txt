I agree with this even more because before WWII, many people overestimated Italy's military capacity, similarly to how Russia's military was overestimated before this war.
From what I've read, Mussolini's generals at least warned him that Italy was not ready, unlike Putin's generals who seemed to tell him everything was going to be easy.
And for a potentially very uncomfortable situation.
How about Hezbollah sneaking a couple Igla manpads into Israel and targeting passenger jets.
Same story for nuclear miniaturization technology.
They proved out a LOT of designs for thermonuclear efficiency and stability testing that could only, until just very very recently, be verified via life fire tests.
The US now uses super computers to model things accurate enough to be expected to be doing not just physics package sustainment design work (materials science gets fucking weird when you are bombarding things with neutrons), but new warhead design work.
Making an easier to maintain but still similar yield thermonuclear device has LOTS of advantages.
