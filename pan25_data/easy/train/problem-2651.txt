occupation/colonialism: the best argument anti israel clowns have is the occasional house being bulldozed in the west bank, or a wall being there which IS inconvenient, but again, an incredibly RESTRAINED response to rampant terrorism.
the wall was put up in response to the second intifada which was busses, weddings, pizza parlors, etc being blown up by suicide bombers with rat poison/shrapnel strapped around them etc… again, no other country on earth, or in history, would have put up with that shit.
britain, the real colonizers, basically tried to split the country in two when they pulled out, the jews accepted, the arabs didnt, they wageda surprise attack (on the primarily outnumbered holocaust survivors, on yom kippur, the holiest day of the year for jews) and lost, oops, ever since then they have played victims for “not being allowed back into their homes” which if the “right of return” was given to their now super inflated numbers, would immediately destroy the one functioning democracy in the middle east….
No.
It’s not not the fault of the Internet, or globalization; that’s on par with using video games as a scapegoat for school shooters.
