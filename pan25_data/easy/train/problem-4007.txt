When you commit a thousand war crimes a week, each new one gets less impactful.
We all fucking hate Russia by now, but what are we to do?
Start WW3?
The Japanese had already humiliated the Soviets/Russians.
They had next to no experience or capability to participate in amphibious landings.
The US was already at their doorstep, burning down their cities, strangling their supply routes, invading outlying islands.
They had the Worlds largest Navy and an enormous and experienced amphibious force.
The notion that the Japanese were somehow uniquely motivated by Soviet action is Soviet propaganda.
No.
It's because they want to be proud of the power of their country, at any cost.
It goes much deeper than just current media.
Going beyond housing, several schools in each municipality across the country have also started up reception classes where Ukrainian children can be acclimatized to the Danish school system and learn rudimentary Danish, using Ukrainian nationals as interpreters, before being phased into the normal classes alongside Danish children after about a year.
In the municipality where I live alone, there are seven such classes serving around 150 Ukrainian children, and the first arrivals are about to start entering the normal school system which would make room for more in the reception classes, should more arrive.
Not quite.
The Japanese didn’t have special reason to fear the Soviets.
They were trying to use to Soviets as an intermediary to find wiggle room in The Potsdam Agreement.
The Soviet Union was only important in so much as they were party to the Potsdam Agreement and hadn’t declared war yet.
There was hope they could use the Soviets to negotiate.
