Yes, which is likely why we're seeing this half-measure.
Doing so would be a point of return in declaring the Putin regime a state sponsor of terrorism, which itself would have significant, overlapping, and accumulative geopolitical and economic ramifications.
It would also significantly increase tensions with the Russian government.
I'm not saying that the US shouldn't (or won't) do that, but this is a significant step in that direction.
