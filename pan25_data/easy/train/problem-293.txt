The last eight to ten months have been a shitshow in China, but nowhere near the American shitshow.
This isn't/wasn't a "my rights" situation, it was a "fuck biohazard!"
situation where 1/300 people in America died over two years vs about 50,000-100,000 Chinese people with worst case numbers out of the 2019 Wuhan outbreak continued over the same period.
I wish COVID Zero had ended in Feb 2022 but I feel like there was some unfortunate politicking to be done in Shanghai and the city took one on the chin for it, then the country followed.
That said, if less than four million people die of COVID in China, it's not the same result, and I don't think it's going to be anywhere near that.
Time will tell.
That nature article doesn't present excess deaths of individual countries unfortunately and only discusses the global burden, which apparently is far higher than that is reported based on their modeling.
I've lived here throughout COVID.
The first five months was a bit touch and go, but the next 18 was pretty awesome considering what was happening in the rest of the world.
In April 2020 the city I was living in, Hangzhou, started reopening.
By December we were only wearing masks on public transportation.
There was a long time of, if you left as a foreigner, you couldn't come back without a new visa, so we kind of got stuck here unless we wanted to do a lot of paperwork or get a job in the US (ew).
Was still a fun time.
I went to lots of cities, made lots of friends, had a good couple years.
My friends back home posted a lot of Bread on Insta.
