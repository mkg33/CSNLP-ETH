I was a lobsterman in the 90s the catches have significantly decreased since then.
The only regulation that has changed is the of pots you are allowed to fish.
The fisherie kills lots of whales through entangelments , always has.
You cant put miles of heavy gague line all over the most productive areas of the shelf and not impact whales.
The whale gets the line in its mouth then spins to try to dislodge it.
It turns it into a tournequet around its head with weights(traps weigh about40lbs each in the water) hanging on it.
The whale suffocates or bleeds to death trying to untangle itself.
The fishermen show up to tend the gear and cut the most often dead whale loose to sink, often with pod members following it.
Lobster gear should not occupy the same areas that wright whales frequent.
Deal with it.

Go google actual entanglements.
They’re almost all from canadian gear, because they don’t enforce their laws.
