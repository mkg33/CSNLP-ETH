In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Seriously.
John Birch Society, Paleoconservatism, Tea Party, Alt-Right, QAnon, MAGA, it’s all been the same thing since the 60’s just rebranded and repackaged every decade or so.
Just like the current trans panic is just recycled satanic panic from the 80’s.
And it’s a cancer.
Also…political parties are very un-American.
People develop an emotional attachment to their political party.
Once that emotional attachment is present Republicans have a hard time seeing the lies and scandals.
Its like having an abusive lover someone is emotionally attached too.
They cant see it.
Everyone else who is not emotionally attached can see that lover is a piece of shit…except for the person with emotional attachment to the lover.
They are blind from emotional connection to their lover.
Same thing goes for people who are attached emotionally to their parties.
So stupid.
Religion.
Around 40% of the country is convinced that the GOP is the "Party of Jesus" that will save them from having to coexist with gays.
For 40 years, preachers have screamed from pulpits that the flock must vote for Republicans or be condemned to hell.
