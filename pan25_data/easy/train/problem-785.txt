All you need to know about railroads: years ago, when they wanted land to run tracks over, if you didn't sell to them, they sent thugs to beat you up and take it.
They killed millions of workers building them.
They sold junk bonds in railroads to fund them.
They got laws passed to break railroad strikes after troops were used along with company thugs.
They feel like they own their workers.
Hours of service laws never existed up until recently- you would work 6 hours rest for 8 hours work, federally changed to 10 hours rest after max 12 hours working (though you can be on duty not "working" indefinitely they have to add the extra time to that 10 hours after you finally "mark off" i.e clock out) for a max of 6 12 hr days in a row before they have to give you 48 hrs off.
Of course if they "deadhead" you home (on taxi or a train) where you are simply moved from a hotel or location back to home terminal on that 6th time it resets your clock for that guaranteed hrs rest.
Or they let you go over 24 hrs in a hotel which resets your clock as well- effectively letting them work you 7 days a week indefinitely.
They know this, they do it on purpose.
They sit in the weeds with binoculars or drones (and ghille suits, it's happened) watching to write people up, their managers have monthly Quotas for discipline, or they get in trouble.
Biggest bastard managers get promoted.
They have quarterly competition for most discipline assessed over regions.
The culture is fear from top down.
Mindbogglingly stupid.
Any Democrat, like Whitmer, who wants to be the nominee in 24 needs to speak now.
My company isn't even particularly generous.
Oh yeah, it's also American.
My colleagues state side don't even get a quarter of what I get.
