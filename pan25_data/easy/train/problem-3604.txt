Saudi Arabia are the perfect hosts for FIFA: wealthy nation, with a long history of investing billions into pointless vanity projects, and a strong willingness to take huge financial losses in exchange for sports-washing their reputation.
I'm not trying to.
I could imagine it to be like phantom pain, only affecting the whole body.
Also panic from not being able to breathe or speak.
It must be an extremely traumatizing experience.
All while you can't even get the soothing effects of adrenalin because that is produced in your body, not your severed head.
Exactly.
All of our ridiculous methods of "humanely" killing someone actually make it much worse.
Just for whatever reason people think that the electric chair/gas chamber/lethal injection are more humane, probably because we expect them to be less gristly than beheading, bullet to the head, or the good ol' cattle bolt, but they are more drawn out and prone to major malfunction.
If you're going to kill a man put on your big boy pants and just fucking kill him.
