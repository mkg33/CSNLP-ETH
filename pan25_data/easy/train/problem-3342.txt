I have no idea what that information would have anything to do with ability to do sports, but I'm also not an MD.
It does seem like they might be a general indicator of overall health and could point to other general medical concerns.
Plus they do seem to be a typical, general health question included on medical questionnaires like height, weight, do you smoke.
(I've seen them plenty of times as a man.)
So whoever added them originally wasn't necessarily motivated by any ill will, just standard questions.
Granted, given the specific population of high school age kids it may not be as helpful since as I understand, plenty of those adolescents are still in the process of puberty and have irregular periods anyway without it indicating anything; and given the specific purpose of a sports only physical, is it really relevant (idk it might be).
But yeah, if people who aren't actually doctors are making changes now it certainly seems politically motivated, unnecessary, and awful everything.
Yeah that's their stated intent, you nailed it.
But that is just a smokescreen for the actual reason behind moves like this, which is to do everything in their power to make it harder to exist as a trans person, starting with kids because it's easy to argue that they're just going through a phase and need to be protected.
Apparently protecting them involves dehumanizing invasions of privacy.
Thank god, what a weird push this was.
What even was it supposed to prove?
Whether girls had missed their periods?
Whether they had them at all?
Just such a weird and gross obsession.
