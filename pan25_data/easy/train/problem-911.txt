We thought that this was going to be the start of a new massive missile strike, but it turned out that they only fired 4 missiles total and that was the end of it.
Out of the 4 Kalibrs that were launched, 2 were shot down, but 2 others managed to get through our air defense.
Both of those hit Khmelnytskyi, one of them struck a military target, which is a pretty rare target for Russians, but the second missile hit some street with residential buildings, damaging many of them and shattering thousands of windows.
Thankfully nobody died, but 2 civilians were injured.
I am utterly dismissive about Russia's offensive capabilities.
They wouldn't be turning convicts into hamburger if they had any better options with combined arms operations.
Personally I'm pretty optimistic.
In a few months, the Ukrainians will have a couple hundreds of tanks from the west on the front and that will allow them to launch devastating offensives and add a ton of pressure on the enemy across the board.
But seriously.
To really deal with it they need an offensive in the south from Zaporizhia down to Melitopol where Kerch would be in constant range of HIMARS and could be hit like the bridge at Kherson.
