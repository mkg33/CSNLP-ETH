This is the dumbest take on protests.
Everyone always makes up a story that doing any protest in the streets is bad because it stops people from going to the hospital.
As if every street magically becomes a hospital express lane as soon as anyone decides to have their voices heard.

What's your take on people driving, which stops people going to the hospital because of traffic?
Also super against that?

Who are "they"?
The commercial entity of Schiphol Airport, who want as many flights as they can achieve, or the government, who want economic growth at any cost?
In either case, that's not going to happen.
