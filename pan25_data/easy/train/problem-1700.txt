The thing with Argentina is nationality is jus soli and there's a loophole where minors can give their parents residence permit (which isn't the case in most/all jus soli nations).
Bravery is commendable.
However, preserving oneself should not be a bad thing.
Especially when they're in a fragile position of carrying a baby.
Self-preservation is inherent in everyone.
I wouldn't fault someone for not participating in a Vietnam War protest.
I don't fault people for wanting to leave Russia.
If someone is a vocal Putin supporter that fled Russia to avoid sanctions, fuck 'em.
That's not the case here.
Regardless, people react differently to stressful situations.
Personal experience here, but when I served, I noticed that I freeze when confronted with high risk.
I'm nothing but useless in the frontlines, on a protest or anything of that sort.
And I'm a non-pregnant 30something dude.
Let alone a pregnant woman.
It's only sheltered, pathetic people who think that self-preservation is their highest calling, who think that the history of fighting against tyrannical, genocidal governments is someone else's problem while they "raise awareness" from the sidelines.
