It is black and white.
But it is evident that US is not doing this for freedom or anything they are telling us.
They have the same reasons that Russia have.
Interests, about money about influence and about having a government that is influenced by them and would of course follow them in different choices and opinions.
I am not talking about the Ukrainian situation and I don’t want to enter in this dialogue, I am saying that causing a WORLD WAR as it has always been so, it’s about what nations thinks and want to archive and gain from it.
Economically, Politically and culturally.
So it would not be China fault.
Or Russian.
It would be everyone’s fault to not be capable to prevent this situation.
And let as always, simply greed and money and power blind every other interest, even people’s life.
Afghanistan for example.
If the US went into Afghanistan and it turned into another Vietnam, would they have resorted to a draft?
I was old enough to remember that the anger after 9/11 was intense, and that could have created enough momentum to win that war at any cost, even a draft.
