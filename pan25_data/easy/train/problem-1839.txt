Simple legislative changes which would correct obvious historical injustices, such as removing gender exemptions from the mandatory obligations of citizens, or removing the obligation of every citizen to spend a significant amount of time studying the language of a specific neighbouring country, while other foreign languages can naturally be chosen on a voluntary basis, have long been outside of the scope of any real Finnish political discussion.
I find this subject fascinating.
It’s a total blindspot in Finland’s otherwise pretty egalitarian society.
The guy's a troll.
Many on the extreme right in Finland are sour about having to study Swedish in school.
Finland is a bilingual country (5.2% of the population are native Swedish speakers), so it's not "the language of a neighbouring country".
It's the language of their own country, spoken by people who have been Finns for at least the last 300 years.
Finally!
This is by far the biggest inequality in the whole country, this should have happened years ago.
When women need to serve too, then we finally can call ourselves an equal country.
