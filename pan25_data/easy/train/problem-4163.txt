So they were too scared to even actually find out what the limits of that amendment were?
Not a great argument for them.
And not at all any justification for them removing new data they do already have after they specifically said that the CDC could study that stuff back in 2018 4 years ago.
And it still does not address that since 2018 there has been 0 restrictions on the CDC studying this so they had all the time and money to do so but did not and then rather than update the data they simply removed it entirely.
So they removed data and then after having the restrictions they complained about being removed they didn't actually study a very important aspect of the thing they wanted to study and then deleted the only data they even bothered to present on it.
You’re right.
I hate hearing people say, “why punish responsible gun owners,” then be completely ignorant of all the things we could be, and don’t do, to punish “irresponsible gun owners.”.
