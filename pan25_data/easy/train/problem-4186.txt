I suspect there's a form of idiot logic at play most times.
If they accuse someone of lying, for example, with no proof.
They are convinced they are being lied to.
Why?
How do they come to this conclusion?
Because it's what they would have done if the roles were reversed.
It's why all their wacky statements smack of projection all the time.
They know they're lying and assume everyone else is too.
By that logic, wild accusations like this make a fucked-up kind of sense.
Coupled with a "throw-shit-everywhere-and-eventually-something-will-stick" mentality, just creates a relentlessly shitty mess to wade through everyday.
That helped.
The other thing is when it was being tracked it was being blasted by AWACS RADAR so it wasn’t really getting any good signals intelligence either.
It’s like trying to listen for footsteps while someone blows an air horn at you.
Absolutely.
There are too many people out there right now like her and Kanye getting a complete pass on their behavior because it could be mental illness.
Fuck that.
You have to a hardcore asshat to act like they do non stop.
There is zero excuse.
