Hell, in the , one or two of 'em actually say something along the lines of "Yeah, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were doing what they were supposed to be doing, which is firing at their easily-targetable enemy.
On the other hand, what the fuck where we doing there?
".
Having your army act as "separatist forces," hiding them amongst civilians, and then screaming about "atrocities" committed against Russians by the defending army is not legitimate.
Maybe if we didn't see Russian army AA guns shoot down a passenger jet we might have ... no, no we wouldn't.
Everyone sees what Russia did.
No one wants this "move your army in and pretend they're local volunteers" to become a legitimate way to seize territory.
No one but your own population buys this "self-defense" garbage, and I bet most of them don't even buy it around the kitchen table.
There it's "our country, right or wrong," and "for the love of God, keep your head down.
".
"Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not address the Makiivka strike in his nightly speech on Monday".
