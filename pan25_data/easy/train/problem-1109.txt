This was actually one of the benefits of the mutual disarmament that Russia engaged in earlier with Reagan/Gorbachev.
They also simply couldn't afford to maintain all their nukes which were becoming real issues, but mutual disarmament allowed them to cut out a bunch of inventory -- \-- while not looking like they were crumbling to their people.
I do like russian authors.
Though I think this russian soul basically comes down to you're fucked if you do and you're fucked if you don't, so put off the ass pounding as long as you can.
The dying horse being beaten in Crime and Punishment represents the russian soul.
But so too does the evil fuck beating it.
Not Finland, but Americans using Finlandâ€™s territory.
Also they could put those pesky scary Patriots, so better have a million people to invade Finland just in case.
Hardly anyone actually left.
Even polish clothing brands (reserved, bershka) who said that they left never actually left.
They just changed names to Re and Be and still importing from Poland.
