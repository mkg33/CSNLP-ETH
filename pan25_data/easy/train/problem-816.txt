“In god we trust” is not our TRUE motto.
It’s “e pluribus, unum”.
The former was a thing dreamed up during the cold war and the latter was a thing from the late 1700’s.
“From many, one” suits our nation to a tee.
The roots of our nation were laid down from the backs of many races, many nationalities, to form one new nation.
In a world where religious attendance is dwindling, “in god we trust” does not fit our country for a few reasons, the main one being “which god?” Since there are thousands to choose from….which one?
Show proof or evidence as to why and how that god makes the cut?
Another reason god doesn’t fit our nation’s image is….why would we idolize some genocidal, narcissistic, tyrannical, jealous, and petty figure such as the alleged god character from the bibble?
That dude doesn’t represent my values.
His first impulse when something doesn’t go right is to massacre and destroy.
Why put him on a pedestal?
He belongs relegated to history, like Zeus and Ra and deserves to be considered similar to Hitler and other global villains, although Hitler was real.
