I dont think losing all their properties globally, all your investments hemorrhaging, losing most of your work force, and ultimately being executed by the system they put into place is what they were thriving for when the USSR fell my guy.
Capitalists dont tend to like losing things and arent fond of dying either from what i hear.
Yeah things were working out great up until... 2020?
but Putin hadnt gone full swing facsism yet.
Unless you are somehow saying this recent war and other nations hemorrhaging money to crush russia's militarty complex and economy is some sorta end goal to make oil in russia slightly cheaper which makes baffling little sense when you have a military complex like in the US that will just go take over a middle eastern country for oil control with a lot less money lost.
Thats what a capitalist wants.
Take over an area, strip it of all its cheap resources, leave it for dead.
Ironically the USSR was extremely efficient at that for a communist state.
