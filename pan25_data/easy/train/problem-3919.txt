ZEV credits (which by the way are not paid for by the government, but other manufacturers who fail to manufacture ZEVs) are now an almost insignificant portion of Tesla's overall revenue.
This.
Tesla, SpaceX and the Boring Company are potentially legitimate national security risks with Musk at the head or on the board of these companies.
Putin and the Kremlin may have kompromat on him and could potentially get Musk to give them insider info on NASA and the Artemis Program, or on the Falcon rocket family and Dragon and Starship spacecraft proprietary info and designs, like a certain character in For All Mankind.
Maybe to help the Russian and Chinese manned lunar programs, and/or to sabotage the US one.
They could get him to hand over information about US auto manufacturing and transportation grid, or proprietary info on Tesla and Hyperloop, etc.
Or even clientele data or metadata from Tesla cars' cameras, computers and chargers.
Not even just the Russians.
Possibly the Chinese and Saudis too.
