Sure, but if it's just going to do break down into a situation where nobody ever feels like they should obey congressional subpoenas ever again, then long term, the power of Congress will be diminished and as will democracy and responsible government in the US.
That plays into the hands of the Republicans.
It would be in the Democrat's interests to try to use this situation to give more teeth to Congressional investigations.
Short term that doesn't seem like a win to the Dems, but given there seems little they have to hide (at least compared to the GOP), they could play the long game since they will be back in power in the House before too long.
And having enforceable subpoena power against Republicans who do have a lot to hide would be very useful.
(Which is why I don't think there is any chance of Rs going for this, I'm just throwing the idea out there.
Proposing it would at least force the Rs to fight against it, even further revealing they have no real interest in proper governance).
