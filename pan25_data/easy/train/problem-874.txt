Let's be clear.
Supporting Ukraine, a large country with a large population, and with several shared borders with NATO countries, and with 8 years to ramp up their preparedness after Putin's land grab in 2014, is a far easier prospect than somehow stopping Russia from overwhelming a tiny country like Georgia in the middle of central Asia.
(And even that wasn't a full invasion.
).
Non-democratic country invades democratic country.
Defending rhe democratic one maintains democracy.
People have known this since day 1, it'd part of why there is such great support for aid for Ukriane aid.
Seriously.
It's harder to find a conflict with a more clear divide between good and evil.
Hell, even WW2, between Germany and the USSR was one evil dictator fighting a war against another evil dictator.
In this conflict, we have literal evil empire on the march, trying to squash the freedom of an innocent people who bore no threat to them whatsoever.
Ukraine did not start this conflict.
Ukraine wasn't amassing troops on the border, plotting a dash towards Moscow.
