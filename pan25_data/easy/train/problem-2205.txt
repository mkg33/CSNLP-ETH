Early on they managed to push well into France, but after Truman accepted an armistice from Germany and sent bombers from the Pacific theater to bomb the Russian oilfields, they managed to slow them down enough to ship Little Boy from the Pacific to France and, luring the Russians into attacking a river crossing with most of their invasion force (I forget which river) they nuked them.
I don’t know.
I would have agreed with you until quite recently; live and let live and all.
But damn, the Russians will never stop.
If we’d have listened to Patton, before Russia had nukes, they now could be like France.
The French don’t really like us (us=U.S.)
as much as we like them but they tolerate us and we get along mostly.
We visit each other and have mutual friends and all but we (we=U.S.)
don’t get to dictate to them, as we shouldn’t.
I wouldn’t want to eat Russian food though; maybe that’s why they’re so cranky.
Temporary anomaly.
Probably, that attitude is the biggest factor that knocked then off the top spot on the first place.
