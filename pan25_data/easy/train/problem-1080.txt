You fill out a form and pay a fee, in my state it's $5k for the house.
From there you collect signatures of registered voters in your district; when you have 120% of the amount you need or when the deadline comes and you have at least 100% of what you need you turn them in.
From there, the secretary of state validates the signatures you turned in.
Assuming you submitted enough valid signatures, what happens next depends on what you wrote on the form: independents get placed on the election ballot.
Party-affiliated candidates get placed on the primary election ballot; each voter will only participate in one of the primary elections.
From there it's only about getting enough votes.
Given the resounding success of his operation in Brazil, soon after Bolsonaro came to power, Grigori moved to the US, where he took the identity of an entitled-yet-discriminatory “biracial latino jewish homosexual” entrepreneur, and started his job of looking for the most gullible district in New England to re-establish operation.
Grigori is now George Santos, and works for the US government for the 2nd stupid district of NY, where he has access to secret information and top secret and can plot the downfall of the American nation.
