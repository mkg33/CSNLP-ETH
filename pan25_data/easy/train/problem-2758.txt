Also important to note that when supporters of this bill or similar legislation point to a lack of money circulating, companies are annually recording record profits.
This is to some degree a result of a capitalistic society that’s so dependent on stock markets (different can of worms I won’t get into lol) but this is also literal evidence that there is substantial room for employees to be paid livable and respectable wages/salaries.
Blanket ban on strikes.
Pay is determined by what "feels good" to a legislative body.
And most importantly we have to punish them for daring to think the job they do, which has the obvious effect of collapsing the education system if they were to collectively skip out on a single day of work, is worth any more than 20 bucks an hour if I'm being REALLY generous.

I like how you quoted me saying that wages aren’t the driving force of inflation but then responded as if I said wages don’t affect inflation.
Please refer to my earlier point about how inflation outpaces wage increases, hence being moot and providing no actual benefit.
If wage increases caused inflation, why are inflation rates considerably higher than wage increases?
Also, there is literally no job on planet earth where a 1% raise a year is not a literal decrease in pay; even inflation rates that are considered economically acceptable/healthy are like 2-3%.
Doesn’t matter if you’re a CEO or a fry cook, that “raise” is a pay decrease.
