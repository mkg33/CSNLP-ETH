Putin's conjecture is that you don't rise to power, and restore Mother Russia to Glory (from the 1600's) as a World Power through the love of the people, great quality locally-manufactured products, and sound diplomacy.
This is so sad.
Ukrainians don't want to slaughter their brothers from across the border, but they are fighting for their lives.
And Putin just keeps sending these kids to their deaths.
In today’s media environment, much of which is built on the goal of affecting public opinion (do yourself a favor and watch The Century of the Self, a documentary that can be found for free on YouTube) it’s essential to have a toolkit for critically analyzing and parsing information, otherwise we’ll just be jerked around by whatever propagandists want us to believe.
No.
In the Tyrant's mind, you rise to power through sheer strenh, brute force, and the willingness to literally murder anybody who "stands in your way" (read: opposes you, even in the slightest).
You become a World Power by taking what was once Mother Russia's 350 years ago.
