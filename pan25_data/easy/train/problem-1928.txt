If they take TSMC, then they effectively has a leverage over the global economy that they can politically utilize.
Caterpillar?
That mining equipment that you're about to ship out to that iron mine in Australia?
Nope, sorry.
That equipment is going to this new rare earths mine.

Don't like it?
If you ever want to see a contract from the Defense Department again, you better start liking it.
Absolutely.
I was trying to avoid going there because the point I wanted to make was that Hawaiian and Alaskan statehood were formal establishment of statehood for territories under complete US jurisdiction for 50+ years prior to statehood.
The US didn't just invade and annex those territories in the 1950s.
The Bayonet Constitution was absolutely a brutal act of colonialism, but was separated from statehood by 60 years.
This is fundamentally different from what, say, Russia is doing in Ukraine where it is annexing territory within months of occupation, or China claiming legal sovereignty over Taiwan precedes de facto sovereignty over the island.
