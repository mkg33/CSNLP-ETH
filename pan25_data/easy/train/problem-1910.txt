I don't know about you but I find it upsetting the Nichols families taxes that year will go toward paying any sum of money to cover the cost of their murdered father/son/brother.
Lawyers protecting the police, the public administrators doing damage control, etc.
They don't.
Talk is cheap.
Let's see what they actually accomplish first because so far I'm not impressed with the DOJ.
This SCORPION unit had multiple complaints against them and a mile long list of previous victims.
Where was the DOJ then?
Charges Include Federal Civil Rights Offenses, Unlawful Conspiracies, Obstruction Offenses, and Use of Excessive Force.
This is a seriously good point.
As far as I could tell he really never was arrested.
Just beaten to a pulp with multiple camera angles for the world to see(with redactions) and sent off to the hospital to die while everyone covered for them as they celebrated and have his family pay hundreds of thousands in medical expenses.
When you really look at it, it was more of a "neighborhood murder party"?
than an arrest.
