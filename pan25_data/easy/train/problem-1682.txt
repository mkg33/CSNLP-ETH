In one of the Jack Reacher books, the main character breaks down why people join the military.
Some do it for patriotism, some for family tradition, some to escape their living situation, some for the opportunities, some for personal growth.
And thereâ€™s also some that just want to kill people.
The Ranger I dated back during his twilight tour \[final stint before retiring\] had used his educational opportunities during and after getting out and is now a therapist dealing specifically with military and nonmilitary PTSD folks.
He still holds a few security clearances so people can talk to him.
Understandable.
There are a few who have a very good ability to compartmentalize.
I should have been more accurate in saying that a great many won't.
Some who lost friends often wear a silver cuff bracelet with their names engraved, and that's the only indication you'll have.
It used to be against uniform policy (not sure now, I retired in 2018), but when a Chief of Defence Staff wears one, who is going to argue.
That's actually really interesting.
It just seems like it would be the further the distance the less PTSD (killing someone hand-to-hand vs gun for example; I'd imagine being close enough to look them in the eye would be more traumatic).
