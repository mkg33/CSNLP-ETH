That turbine can burn many different fuels.
It's best run on JP-8, same as all US/NATO vehicles, but you can run it on nearly anything - diesel, gasoline, alcohol fuel, etc.
The problem isn't the 'what' but the 'how much.'
More than that is the specialized maintenance requirements - it's a very modified arrangement that you don't see in most turbine applications.
You can't very easily find parts that will spin in a pinch.
The rebuild processes and tolerances are much different than even high-performance diesels.
This whole thread is a joke, right?
On going conflict... People dying daily... "Too long to train."...
It's a joke, you're all fucking trolling, right?
You can't be serious.
You can't possibly take yourselves seriously in this conversation.
This has to be a joke.
There's under 200k Russian troops at the border.
They BARELY want to be there.
$13 billion in support.
They're using drones to drop shells.
We've all seen it.
$13 billion will easily pay for one drone and one nade per individual infantry.
This isn't a real war it's smoke and mirrors to try to keep putin from being rightfully overthrown.
The logistics that y'all are going over are a fart in a cup that you're all sniffing.
