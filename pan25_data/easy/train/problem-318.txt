Man, the right wing has really ruined the word "truth" for me.
Whenever they think they're saying the truth it's always a pile of 50's right wing propaganda that they're just saying is facts because they can, and whenever they think they're finding the truth it's always some wild conspiracy bullshit that just so happens to let them get back control of the government so that they can then achieve their horrid dreams of banning abortion, keeping the drug war going forever, putting LGBT people back into the closet forever unless they willingly "convert", screwing over the poor, and making society in general worse and more authoritarian.
Bull and shit.
You of all people, Ginni dear, were quite aware that the Trump campaign lost over 60 court challenges because they had nothin'.
I doubt your hubby can explain the law to you, he doesn't know it either, but the right wingers you contacted about the "Biden crime family on a barge off of Gitmo" sure knew what you were trying to sell.
Bull and shit.
Mr. & Mrs. Bull and Shit.
