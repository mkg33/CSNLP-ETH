It's funny seeing how much propaganda over in Spain has begun aligning with the GQP propaganda.

Criminalizing gender non-conforming clothing is being proposed by republican lawmakers.

Possible Russian interference over Brexit and other elections, after a report was conducted by Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament which found The British government and intelligence agencies failed to conduct any proper assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum.
Claims the government had “actively” sought not to delve deeper into the perceived threat of Russian interference.
It said the government “had not seen or sought evidence of successful interference in UK democratic processes” at the time, and it made clear that no serious effort was made to do so.
“The report reveals that no one in government knew if Russia interfered in or sought to influence the referendum because they did not want to know,” said Stewart Hosie MP.
