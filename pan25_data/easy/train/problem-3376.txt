In Haiti, the government is completely ineffective; gangs steal, rape and pillage with impunity.
If you send in contractors with tools and materials for rebuilding, a group of armed men will most likely quickly steal those tools and materials at gunpoint.
(Any female employees can expect to be sexually assaulted as well.
).
“It’s hard to overstate the extent to which the security situation in Haiti collapsed in 2022,” said the UN in its review of 2022, noting that “practically nowhere in the capital, Port-au-Prince, could be deemed safe, as rival gangs fought over territory, terrorising increasingly desperate citizens, already struggling to survive a humanitarian catastrophe”.
This is a pretty tall ask.
The complete collapse of law and order has completely wrecked the economy, except for the booming "steal stuff at gunpoint" sector, so (a) is pretty difficult.
Also, a lot of people who still manage some semblance of a middle-class lifestyle (satisfying (a)) may have made some deal with the gangs (so worry about (b)).
And most people have family members who can be threatened, so...it's really hard to find people to let into the green zone who aren't security risks.
