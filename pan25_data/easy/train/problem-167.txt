Considering the secret service was able to wipe their phones after Jan 6th and nobody noticed until months later, and considering dozens of our undercover agents have been killed or withdrawn after TFG was allowed to abscond with hundreds of top secret documents he stored in unsecured locations, maybe there are more pressing security concerns within our own government?
Just a thought.
well we kinda toxified everything else in life seemingly including games with gambling reinforcement, based on the 00's and how youtube broke through the forest to show you the tree you were looking for before google even bought them, i think it may be more of a tail wagging the dog situation and a proper inoculation of media with self correcting moral dilemma thought experiments ala star trek when it was good in its prime stints should vaccinate against the negative feedback loops which nobody truly likes but utilize as an effigy of their own interpersonal dilemmas which they face relentlessly without resolution.
