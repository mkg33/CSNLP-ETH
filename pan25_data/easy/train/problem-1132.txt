Yes, but dictator was a normal office in the Roman republic (basically whenever there was a crisis, the Senate would empower someone to act as Dictator for a while, as an individual with absolute power to run the government for a time).
Julius Caesar wasn't the first Roman to be a dictator for an undefined period of time, nor to seize the dictatorship by force (see, e.g.
Sulla).
It's been over 1500+ years since the Roman Empire's politics played out and entrenched these rituals into our cultures, people continue celebrating Christmas as a Christian holiday because they do not care what Emperor Constantine or Theodosius got up to in the 4th century, they care about maintaining the traditions and celebrations which their grandparents and parents passed onto them.
Christmas was pagan back in the days when Germans were illiterate and England didn't even exist yet, whatever, pete_68's wife here probably just wants to continue celebrating the culture which she experienced with her living family.
Wrong.
My community wholeheartedly participate in Diwali celebrations.
Firecrackers are fun, no matter what religion you follow.
Just like presents are fun.
