So I havenâ€™t read the brief, but is it safe to assume the issue is that there is no statutory fair use for trademark as there is for Copyright?
If the scotus sides for the toy company, then would they be creating a judicial fair use for trademark?
And lastly, how is this case different than Vuitton?

Copyright parody and trademark parody are extremely different.
Trademark fair use is also very narrow.
Trademark parody is not well understood.
Oddly enough, one major case in trademark parody involves Chewy Vuiton against Louis Vuitton.

Chewy Vuitton won.
It's the case I use in my trademark talks.
