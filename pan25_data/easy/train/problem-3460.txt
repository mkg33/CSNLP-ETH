Republicans, unhappy with the deal.
Seek to sabotage it.
The US falls out of compliance with the deal, leading the unfriendly state to renege on it's own obligations and continue pursuing nuclear weapons.
I'm talking about the 1994 Agreed Framework that would have ended North Korea's nuclear program, but it broke down in 2003 when the US failed to meet it's obligations to build power plants and supply fuel to North Korea to help it move away from it's current nuclear reactors.
This isn't call of duty.
They would definitely respond militarily and economically by closing the Strait of Hormuz.
Let's not jeopardize lives of soldiers so easily and innocent civilians in the mix just because we don't like their regime and fears of a nuclear program that wasn't a problem before Trump killed the nuclear deal that many nations agreed upon and Iran was following.
Just plain wrong.
The deal was absolutely intact.
Until Trump decided to actively kill it.
Thats it.
Even the shit they do today has nothing to do with making it harder for them to get nukes.
