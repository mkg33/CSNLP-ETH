EDITING: because someone below compared it to "premeditated murder" as though abused women sit down with their little listical, a checklist of items they need to murder their mean husband like a weapon and plastic and bleach or something like that.
I forgot people on this website lack brain cells.
It's more like this: he's hitting you, and finally he stops, maybe turns around to punch a wall instead, so you reach for the nearest blunt object and hit him in the head.
He r\apes you and finally passes out drunk, and once that happens you reach for the gun and shoot him.
The point where he STOPS is the point where self defense is LOST in some places and that's the problem.
It's not like these women are planning a gone girl scenario, they're scared for their lives.
And in many cases, getting away from him may have even been the original goal (in fact in a lot of cases I would imagine it's this, it's not like we're talking trained about assassins who aim for the head.)
Sure she could pick that moment to run, but most women who leave abusive relationships are murdered, literally, it's the most likely time she will die.
"Just leave" isn't an option for most women in this situation, it's never as simple as that.
Imagine saying that to someone covered in bruises too.
"Well why don't you just break up with him" you say while she's sitting there with a black eye.
And sometimes the situation IS that extreme that she feels like she has no choice.
Instead of coming at her for being in a miserable situation, maybe YOU should figure out how to make sure she has safe choices.
Maybe you should call your politicians and ask what laws they are working on to help stop domestic violence.
Maybe you should volunteer or donate to a shelter.
That's textbook premeditated murder and it should absolutely remain illegal.
Don't try to justify murder because the victim is unsympathetic.
