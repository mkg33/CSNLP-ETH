More like as long as the right wing media sphere keeps them nice and paranoid of that being a reality they will keep voting for tax cuts for rich people.
For conservatives who think the “tax cuts” they advocate for are to help the working class, this lopsided distribution is the case for all their tax cuts, every time.
This is why whenever states have a surplus Dems will typically want to do rebates or put it in social programs while republicans always want to do tax cuts with it, it’s just a way to give the rich 95% of that surplus.
Trumps tax cuts for the working class weren’t fuckin shit, and even then he made the working class ones temporary as an extra fuck you to the working class the GOP pretends to support.

The corporate profiteering, purchasing of politicians, employee exploitation and overall economic unfairness must stop.
We need a stronger safety net at a time republicans are talking about cutting it.
Unreal.
