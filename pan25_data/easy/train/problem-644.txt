From January 2021 until recently, Trump’s rhetoric has risen and fallen largely out of public sight, as he’s embraced weird theories (like those of MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell) or debunked nonsense (like the film “2000 Mules") as ways to advocate for his own reinstatement.
Why now?
Because Elon Musk released the bombshell Hunter Biden files, which shockingly revealed that the Biden Campaign asked Twitter not to allow Hunter Biden dick pics to be shared.
Clearly this was a defining moment in American history and Twitter conspiring with a political campaign to censor any information must render not only the election moot, but the Constitution must be set aside so that the losing candidate can be installed as President.
Why now?
Because the 11th circuit ruled that Judge Cannon didn't have the authority to make decisions that basically could have uprooted the entire legal framework of the country to run defense for Trump over this highly specific case.
Trump thought he could basically Chewbacca defense his way back into presidency by making the DoJ kneel and kiss the ring courtesy of the legal system.
