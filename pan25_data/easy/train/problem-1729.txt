This isn't much of a concern.
Jews are the most solidly blue voting block in the nation after Black women.
Definitely seeing anti semitism rising, anti LGBTQ, anti asian, anti humanist, anti education etc etc....
Thanks, that does help a bit.
Still, ethnicity and race are different.
I can see one can be accused of being antisemitic, hateful, etc.
to Jewish people (by ethnicity or religion), but I don’t see how it is “racist” by the conventional definition of race.
I was just making that distinction.
The separation is due to Palestinians who don't want to be Israeli (totally understandable) and want their own territory (also totally understandable)- which they have - and self governance, but they voted in terrorists organizations who have been blocking all future elections from happening for decades and turned Palestine into an authoritarian terrorist state and refuse to actuality govern or help Palestinians or improve their lives, outside of using Palestinian hospitals and schools as terrorist bases and Palestinian children as human shields.
This is well documented by Amnesty International.
