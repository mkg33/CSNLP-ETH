There are at least 20k Russian troops in Belarus right now.
But it's not like they have secure supply lines all the way to the border, those troops are useless and isolated if the Belarusian military decides not to side with them.

I think that, if you read Clifford Stoll's The Cuckoo Egg, which was about an early hacking attack, he implied that the United States already had a Hubble-level telescope pointed at the Earth by the late 1980s, and that it also had software systems that could search international telephone call recording databases recordings for specific words.

Belarusian army and security forces have some of the highest salaries in Belarus and loyalty is always prioritized over merit when selecting officers.
Oh.
Does Google Earth use regular aerial photography to supplement the satellite photos?

In reality, spy satellite technology advancements have not been focused on resolution.
Instead, the improvements are around coverage, latency, and automatic classification.
