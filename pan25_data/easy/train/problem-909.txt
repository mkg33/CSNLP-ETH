I've been saying for about 10y now that the GOP is headed down a road they can't recover from, they are stuck between a couple massive forces....They have very unpopular positions on most things, their biggest block of voters isn't being replaced by younger voters as they age and die, so they have to keep escalating with more and more deranged and crazy shit to scare people into voting for them, but that turns off moderate voters, but they can't moderate because they will lose the crazies, so they try to thread the needle but it's becoming more and more untenable.
Their only hope is to just rip the bandaid off and moderate in a substantial way and be a fractured and ineffective party for a generation, because they are just going to keep shedding old voters and they have so turned off younger voters with their insanity that they will likely never get them back.....I for one would never vote for a GOP candidate, I don't trust them at all, and anyone willing to put that (R) next to their name on a ballot, with all the crazy batshit baggage attached to it is suspect from the jump.
