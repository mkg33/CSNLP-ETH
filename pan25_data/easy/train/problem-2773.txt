It's done specifically so the Canadian feds show up to shut it down.
Apparently this is necessary to audience a challenge on the law on prohibition of hard drugs.
Seems insane to me...
Personal use and possession was decriminalized.
Not gonna be able to have a retail location, the quantities required to sell and sell to people.
This is gonna get shut down quickly.
Because they’re oppressive countries with harmful legislation and insane punishments (death penalty for possession/suspected trafficking in some cases) for drug possession?
Drug addicts are not necessarily bad people, or even criminals, outside of the ridiculous drug laws they’re breaking by using drugs.
The vast majority of drug-related crime is due solely to the fact that drugs are illegal.
People are going to use drugs, end of story.
You can either punish them for it at a high cost to your own community, or help those who want to stop but are stuck in an endless cycle of addiction, shame, and secrecy.
End the stigma on drug use, the obsession with punishing drug use, and the for-profit prison system who intentionally turn addicts into criminals for financial gain.
My guess is you’ve never had a loved one who was also a drug addict.
