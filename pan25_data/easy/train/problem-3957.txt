I wonder if this will tip the scales in favour of Romania-Moldova unification again.
I know support has been up and down over the years in Moldova (remains high in Romania) but you have to imagine threats from Russia could push them in the direction of the West and maybe the direction of Romania.
It would certainly be a very easy route to membership in the EU and NATO, just like East Germany.
Would be costly but maybe the EU would help with the bill...
Fascinating.
I speak some French and Spanish, and looking at the words, they “look” Latin-ish but I’m getting tripped up on some of the accents on the letters.
Might be easier for me to get by listening instead of reading.
Todays Republic of Moldova is an unfortunate out slice of this same continuum, which wouldn’t even exist if not for the aftermath of the WWII as it was artificially separated from the Kingdom of Romania, where USSR wanted to revenge for Romania's alliance with the Third Reich.
No.
An unprovoked attack on NATO territory owned by a member country is an article 5 trigger, _if a country chooses to invoke article 5_.
