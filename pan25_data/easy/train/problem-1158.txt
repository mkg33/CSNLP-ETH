I invested in a personal heating blanket and wrap myself with it on cold days with socks and sweater when at my desk working.
We don't even need the heat anymore.
Before I would need to heat up the entire room.
Thanks Putin for putting such great ideas into my head to save money on energy prices.
He's really helping us poor folks out.
In the week 49, 2022, or from December 12 to December 18, 2022, the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) received the largest volume of natural gas from Russia via the Ukraine transit route, at 311 million cubic meters.
The imports are falling but not as much as predicted.
I'm legitimately confused.
Isn't Putin the wealthiest man in the world or one of them?
Wouldn't that mean he'd have lots of resources?
Or is his wealth on paper?
I thought he hoarded lots of cash and gold etc.
Unfortunately some European countries cannot replace Russia as a supplier.
Gas pipelines take years to build.
The EU made the somewhat vague claim that “phasing out our dependence on fossil fuels from Russia can be done well before 2030.”.
