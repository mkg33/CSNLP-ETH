Cause, to them, life is black and white.
They hated Obama and everything he stood for simply because he stood for it.
They assume blue voters hate Trump and everything Trump has ever done or that's ever been done under his name.
They don't understand nuance and complex thoughts.
They don't understand that Trump is a criminal piece of shit who happened to preside over a few good pieces of legislation.
Would Dems give back this parks funding if they could also undo all the other shit he did?
Of course, it's a golden pebble in a mountain of shit, and it doesn't make up for raising taxes on the middle class (with a delay built in so his dumbass voters think it's BIden's fault), nor for the insurrection.
However, it was a good thing.
Obama did things that, mentioned separately from him, republicans do like - they just can't stand giving him credit.
Democrats/Republicans.
2 hands joined to the same body, one hand washes the other.
Itâ€™s by design, both parties have been infiltrated domestically and foreignly.
Itâ€™s time to setup new political parties for the people.
