This isn’t about the charges being investigated.
It’s about whether the FBI can access those documents.
Terrifyingly (and stupidly) he is making an argument that would basically invalidate the Presidential Records Act.
He’s saying he as President had the authority to convert Presidential records to personal records because he was the President.
Of course if a President could do that then they could just decide that any documents that implicate them are personal and not subject to the PRA, essentially meaning that the PRA is useless.
Of course the Court will rule against that stupid argument.
It’s also a dumb argument because the FBI takes personal records all the time when executing search warrants so his argument isn’t even relevant.
It’s a complete disaster of a filing that isn’t going to go anywhere.
It’s his lawyers basically admitting that they don’t even have an argument.
