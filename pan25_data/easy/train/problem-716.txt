Ah, thank you, I have never heard it used that way.
I see now it’s a more antiquated definition.
I’ve only heard it used with the 1980’s - present definition, which is an area in which you excel.
I was wondering how the heck he thought I was saying Republicans excelled with voters on abortion.
The other top priority with voters that killed Republicans was abortion rights.
That one is a little different because it isn’t quite fully “self” inflicted as the Supreme Court is supposed to be apolitical, but I still think they sabotaged themselves by pushing back against abortion rights for so long… so when Roe v Wade came down, people blamed them as much as the Supreme Court.
I don’t know what a heel house is, but if you mean why do I consider the abortion problem that Republicans have in the 2022 midterm to be only partially self-inflicted, it is because (in theory, at least) the Supreme Court is not beholden to the Republican Party and is supposed to be apolitical.
The overturn of Roe v Wade hurt them, and while they certainly deserve some blame, it’s ultimately still the Court’s decision.
