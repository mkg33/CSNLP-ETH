FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and Trump’s lawyer and mentor from 1973-1985 Roy Cohn (who was registered as a Democrat but advised Nixon and Reagan and introduced Trump to Rupert Murdoch) were both homosexual pedophiles who were part of a pedophile ring operating out of Suite 233 in the Plaza Hotel on 5th Avenue, which Trump bought for $407M in 1988, 30 years after Susan Kaufman witnessed it with her ex-husband bootlegger Lewis Rosenstiel of Schenley Industries in 1958, and Rosenstiel reportedly recorded audio from it.
Cohn was disbarred in 1986 after attempting to defraud the dying and comatose Rosenstiel in 1975 and putting a pen in his hand and forcing it into signing a will amendment leaving Cohn and Rosenstiel’s granddaughter Cathy Frank his beneficiaries.
Donald Trump was the last person to speak with Roy Cohn on the phone before he died of AIDS in 1986.
