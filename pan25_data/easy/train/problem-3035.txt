So glad to see this at the top.
He said we were leaving and we left.
Regardless of WHEN we left, the same crap was going to happen on the ground.
The news media - and a lot of his "supporters" were just beside themselves with the awfulness of it.
Yup, it was awful.
And it would have been if he waited a year, two years, 10 years, left a small force there to be killed by extremists, doesn't matter.
There was no workable exit.
We just had to leave.
All of the same people that would be bitching and moaning about losing Americans while occupying the country had their moment to virtue-signal and be "good" people.
But they had no other solution than to stay.
It needed done.
It was unpopular and he would get unwarranted crap for it from all sides.
It was not politically expedient.
But he did it.
That's what a leader does.
It's exactly why you don't elect someone like Trump, as Trump would have us all dead by now in a similar situation (notwithstanding the possibility that he is a direct collaborator with Russia, where Trump likely would have left NATO, possibly leading to direct conflict between Europe and Russia, as I mean in any possible foreign policy scenario with potential dire consequences).
