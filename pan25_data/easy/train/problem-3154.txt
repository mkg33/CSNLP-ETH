Yep, Herschel is claiming that he's a Texas resident in order to claim an exemption on the property taxes on his three million dollar home there, and at the same time he's claiming legal residency in Georgia to run for Senate, as well as claiming GA residency when he registered to vote there last year.
Did he vote in GA?
If he's still a legal Texas resident then that's voter fraud, and if he's going to stick to his claim of being a GA resident then that's tax fraud back in Texas.
Either way he's a fraud.
But we really need to vote in Warnock everybody needs to vote for Warnock the Democrats really need to take the Senate so they can get their gun control through the disarm all of us people and take our rights away so please people agree with this idiot and vote for why not so we can put this country out of its misery and quite delaying the inevitable whoever's post this is uncommenting on your whack job.
same thing this morning.
went back at 6:30pm and no line.
The volunteers told me 6:30 was a pretty ideal time as normally the long lines have cleared out by then.
