This is fucking nonsense.
Men are accusing a man and punishing him.
If God has to punish him let the god punish him.
Not a group of people should punish him.
Then where is Allah for him?
Where is Jesus?
Or else??.
This is completely nonsense.
Now, as this young man gave hugs and chocolate to people who were protesting the Islamic government of Iran, that means that according to the Quran they were fighting against Allah, by spreading corruption in the land, namely, showing support to those who do not agree with women being killed for not wearing (or incorrectly wearing) clothes women are demanded to wear by Allah in the Quran.
Change?
People will literally give you their first born to die in order to prevent the "depravity of the west" from taking over.
They'll cry about abuses , no rights and death for chocolates and then they'll roll the rug and pray, without skipping a beat.
Or European and colonial history?
These Christianâ€™s had to dehumanize the rest of the world so the could commit the worst acts imaginable against them.
