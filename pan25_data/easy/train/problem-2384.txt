The SOTU featured an interesting exchange where Biden brought up the fact that some of the GOP wanted to end social security and medicare.
This is supported by a significant minority of House Republicans but it polls absolutely horribly with the general public.
Biden cleverly used the vocal minority of the GOP to put them all in a negative light.
Huckabee-Sanders could have used her platform as a rebuttal to push back on these accusations but she didn’t.
She wasted the opportunity and Biden will likely sew a small and temporary jump in the polls following this speech.
Because she wasn’t using it to actually respond to Biden or try to uplift her party.
It was a chance for her to promote herself on a national stage and that speaks to the ineffectiveness of the party.
Republicans inability to prioritize their parties goals above their own has already led to massive Republican underperformances and they’re not changing anytime soon.
Yep.
I honestly think that if we dumped all Republicans into their own country, it would be a lot like the Taliban trying to govern Afghanistan rn.
Once they enacted all of their archaic ideas that either don't do anything or make life miserable, they would just sit there twiddling their thumbs until their failed policies collapsed the country.
They don't want to govern, they want to fight.
Or get rich.
