I disagree with this, although I'm Ashkenazi myself, most of my social group (including my husband) are mizrachi or mixed.
The dividing lines are more along the urban and "rural" (Israel doesn't really have rural, more just periphery) lines.
Since, during founding years of Israel, the Ashkenazi ruling class sent mizrachi people to live in the periphery, more of the periphery is mizrachi, but if you look at a place like Ramat Gan, which is located in central Israel, still fairly well off economically, and lefty, but still has a large Iraqi population, you'll see that the fact that they're urban is more significant in their politics than the fact that they are mizrachi.
Trump has not fallen.
He spent 4 years rigging stuff, appointing corrupt politicians, taking advantage of his position, promoting hate and instigating a coup.
And there has been 0 consequences for him.
He's still out there playing golf somewhere in one of his dozens of ludicrously big mansions.
If that's "falling", I hope you see me fall sometime.
