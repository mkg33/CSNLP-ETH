Yeltsin?
The drunk?
Lol That was a blip on an otherwise communist timeline.
Putin the Soviet KGB member.
The father of modern communism took the country back to its former “glory.” The vast majority of companies are owned by loyal oligarchs.
They do the governments bidding.
That’s how you have government owning the means of production without actually owning them.
That’s the slight of hand with modern communism.
Same thing on China.
Oh and most of the oligarchs are from the communist Soviet Union.
Russia re wrote their constitution in the 2000s giving putin unlimited power and getting rid of those pesky freedoms they had gotten.
They did so by going full blast of culture wars gay bashing public school bashing and changing libel laws.
If you had a problem with it they called you a pedo.
Well if that doesn’t exactly describe what the republicans are doing I don’t know what does.
I’ve been saying it for years and they keep on following Russia playbook to a T. Just last week little Ron Desantis wants to change libel laws in Florida.
Calling them fascists turn an eye to the danger and what their future actions will be.
If they want to ally themselves with Russia I will call them a communist cult.
They call us commies for wanting affordable healthcare.
This man was a raging murderous lunatic - probably schizophrenic - under any normal circumstances genuinely certifiably insane.
It never changed.
It told you it changed.
Communists going to gaslight.
Somehow we believed that Russia wasn’t communist even though it was being run like one from a ex KGB member.
Why can’t I call Russia communist when the entire elite and oligarch class is from the communist Soviet Union?
They employ the same methods the same controls and the captured land in Ukraine they errecting statues of Lenin and Stalin.
It would be easier to call Russia communist and republicans communists for supporting them.
The only difference is Russia now has thrown religion into the mix.
