He's no longer really likely at all to come back.
He was only made leader because he was seen as an election winner and he burned that reputation through losing a two hundred year old safe seat.
He may well lose his seat when the expected by-election is triggered by the inquiry into him lying to parliament.
He's not coming back.
Having seen his attack lines against Jeremy Corbyn fail last week when someone pointed out that he's no longer the leader of the Labour party and the country ain't interested, Rishi Sunak is getting desperate and has decided to take aim at an easy target that every other member of the G20 (except Saudi Arabia and India) and even his two immediate predecessors has already criticised.
Why are people hating on him?
Isn't he basically a Democrat from an American political perspective, I doubt you'd be as hostile if Biden said the exact same thing.
When I made the Biden comparison to highlight the double standards, you singled out Sunik because he's rich, which made me assume you thought Biden wasn't as wealthy.
