Dude, absolutely no offense, but that's the dumbest possible thing to get pissed off about.
Prior to the Geely acquisition, Volvo was owned by Ford - and Ford only bought them for their patents and invested zero money into the brand or their products.
By the time the Chinese came in, Volvo was on its last legs - aging products that barely anyone wanted to buy, the company would shut down in few more years of going like that.
Then Geely came in and basically gave them unlimited money to develop the SPA platform which was massively successful and turned Volvo into the luxury brand it is today - add the modern and improving drivetrains, and the company is genuienly very successful, with good and pretty reliable models that are selling.

Also to reinvigorate US manufacturing.
There's a bunch of other stuff that was passed to increase incentives to produce in the US (or make it easier).
