Having lived during communist years in an Eastern European country, I can see those kind of protests happening (but small in size, be it individual protests or small groups), but you would have no proof of it happening, except urban folklore.
And that's because the repressive apparatus made sure you didn't hear about it.
All the media was fully controlled with limited to no foreign media allowed.
It's not like today with information traveling instantly and so many recording devices available, you were literally in the dark.
In my country people had issues with the authorities even if they protested or made political jokes in private, at a drink with friends, if one of those friends was also an informant for the authorities.
And for those you even have proof, once the files were made public.
My parents couldn't even travel in the communist block (friendly country) for holidays due to what was in the files.
Exactly.
People that grew up in societies with basic rule of law can find it hard to understand places like China.
This was one of the biggest culture shocks for me when I lived in Shanghai for a few years.
Additionally context: the university here is Tsinghua University.
THE top science and engineering university in China.
Can think of it as the MIT of China.
Pretty fitting.
