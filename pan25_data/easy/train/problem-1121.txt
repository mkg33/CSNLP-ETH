it was the conscripts that got 2 weeks of training - almost zero weapons practice and mostly trained how to build trenches and sandbag walls, given a shovel , pistol and 60s era heavy machine guns which are actually crew weapons.
So heavy it takes 2-3 men to transport and set up and their vehicles so low on fuel they weren't allowed to use them to transport the heavy guns around .
Conscripts were sent to front lines mostly to try to secure defensive positions while the regulars and mercs push forward.
But conscripts started to get completely rolled .
Which cut off supply chains to regulars .
Really bad planning .
Large amount of conscripts just surrender positions or themselves immediately because they were also told they would be shot or jailed for retreating.
Unironically yes.
Russia is still one of the bigger gas providers and Ukraine is one of the biggest cereal producers.
If Russia manages to sphere Ukraine then the west won't have a lot of options left.
Even if Russia loses (assuming that there is still a Russia by that time) it won't take more than a couple of decades to rebuild economic ties.
NATO needs to score a decisive victory as soon as possible so it can have an advantage on the negotiations table.
