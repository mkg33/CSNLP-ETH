It's hard to tell exactly why the incumbent party is often at a disadvantage, but there is a third major reason that Democrats lost seats in the house this year despite their overperformance, and that is gerrymandering.
Every decade in the U.S., a nationwide census checks the population of each state and uses that information to determine how many seats each state should have in the U.S. House of Representatives.
During this time each state also redraws district lines deciding which citizens will be voting for which representative.
Some politicians use this redistricting process to draw lines that are favourable to their party by grouping voters in such a way that they have an advantage in one or more seats.
This is called gerrymandering and it is a major reason for most Republican gains in the House.
If gerrymandering was illegal, it is quite possible that Democrats would have not only held both the House and Senate, but that they would have gained seats in both chambers.
