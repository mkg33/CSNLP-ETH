Oh it’s good, guy.
If it makes you feel better, they had him on the ground AND had his hands held behind his back while getting punched and kicked.
So let’s re-ask this, if his hands were behind him and he was on the ground, in what way was he not complying?
Was it when they held him up for a bit of soccer practice?
Or was it when he was clearly following their confusing demands and attempting to stop the escalation of violence?
Don’t worry, I still have a few more questions for you.
When did he reach for the gun?
Why did his tox screen come up negative for any substance?
Why did these evil fuckers rip him from the car with guns and tasers already engaged?
Whew, that’s quite a few questions so far, but since you’re confident that he did something wrong and deserved this, I’ll keep going.
Why did they magically decide to chuck and cover their body cams?
Why did they high five each other and laugh with one another while Tyre was literally dying right next to them.
Why was one guy angry enough that he kicked him and then came back a bit later to punch and kick him again?
Are you able to go ahead and answer any of these questions?
exactly.
and until i see that happen every fucking cop is the same in my eyes as the ones doing the dirt.
and maybe even worse, since they create an environment that allows these types of abuse to happen.
