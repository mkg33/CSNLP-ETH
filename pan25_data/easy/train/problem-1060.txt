I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Feminist and I thought it was hilarious.
He's in character and his character is an old-timey 20th century racist from the former Soviet bloc.
Part of the comedy is us laughing at how backwards his thinking is and how blatantly bigoted he is.
We're laughing at Borat being piggish (and he's unaware of how backwards he is).
Not at Dr. Biden.
Since I’m being attacked by the anti-feminists, I’ll go head and step a foot further into the shit and say however anyone reacted (laughing etc) isn’t the issue- it’s about normalizing the opportunity to make jokes about sexual predation and the fact that the only socially acceptable response for her to make was to laugh.
Borat is also a HUGE Antisemite.
Remember his "Throw The Jew Down The Well" song?
We're laughing at him for being pig ignorant and blatant with it, and how normalized it is where he comes from.
The extra layer of comedy is because the actor himself is Jewish.
It's like when Mel Brooks, himself a Jewish WWII veteran, played Hitler.
