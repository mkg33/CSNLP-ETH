That distinction is reshaping the Republican base as the 2024 presidential primary kicks off.
The MAGA vs. RINO dichotomy that defined the GOP for much of the last eight years is increasingly obsolete.
In its place, a new dynamic emerged from interviews with more than 150 Trump supporters across five pivotal electoral states.
In between Republicans who remain firmly committed or opposed to the former president, there’s now a broad range of Trump supporters who, however much they still like him, aren’t sure they want him as the party’s next nominee.
Eh.
You’re giving them too much credit.
It’s more a matter of internalization.
They won’t ever cop to the fact that he’s a liar & a criminal so they pivot to acknowledging they would like a candidate without all of the controversy & unfavorables that Trump comes with when, in actuality, they’ve accepted that they can’t win with Trump because the guy just keeps fucking losing so they’ll cling into the next guy who comes along & feels exactly like Trump.
