….as a Canadian and an immigrant if you talking about nazis in American politics XD how lmao what how dare you… you’ve never suffered anything.
Do you understand how bad other places and governments treat their citizens I understand that we should not take shit from anyone and always continuing to get better, but to compare things like that to atrocities in the past or even some countries and governments that exist right now in the present is fucked, America’s is a shit hole lol but not for the reasons you think it is, hate living beside u guys, you’re whole countrys IQ is room temperature, and we use Celsius.
Umm… no.
Go back to eating your avocado toast.
16 is an arbitrary age to declare being “free from age discrimination” and is part of the woke nonsense.
Yes, by definition, any law based on age is discriminatory.
Why is that bad?
Would you like 7 year olds being drafted?
10 year olds working in coal mines?
12 year olds buying cigarettes?
Woke nonsense.
My examples are actually targeted towards Germany.
I don’t try to paint nazis in a bad light, I wanted to emphasize the fact that we in Germany do have right wing extremist and nazi parties which can be voted for without them being any kind of actual „problem“.
I didn’t want to imply „nazis bad“ but wanted to imply „anyone and everyone should vote, democracy can handle it“.
