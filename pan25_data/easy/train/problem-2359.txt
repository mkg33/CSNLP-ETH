LoL.
I remember with Hilary Clinton, one that Republicans were going so hysterical about.
She had a meeting planned with some foreign diplomat.
So she had a list of things to go over, which got marked classified as they didn't want others to know what would be discussed until it was time to discuss them.
When the time came, she had her person send her the talking points, at which moment, there was no longer a reason for them to be classified, because she was already at the point where she was talking about what was on her list.
But years later, they were still marked classified and people were in their faux outrage mode over it.
