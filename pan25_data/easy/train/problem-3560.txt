Wow.
All the while claiming the other side is doing it while actively doing it.

Larkin called a private emergency executive meeting to discuss “unelected personnel”.
The city council then voted out Zimmerman (the sitting mayor), which moved Sarah Leland, the vice-mayor, up to the mayor position… which she immediately relinquished and nominated Larkin to be mayor since she had no vice-mayor to take her role… which the council then approved… effectively ousting Zimmerman and replacing him with Larkin through a series of council votes.
Not really.
Neither 1st nor 2nd amendment is unlimited.
I can march on city hall and get arrested if I don't follow certain rules, like having a permit.
Same with the 2nd, I can March on city hall with a gun but it would be illegal to walk into city hall with one.
