To speculate that 1/10th of the entire Russian military is dead and that 25% of it's invasion forces are dead is far-fetched.
There'd literally be nobody left to fight.
The US Army maintains about 7-15% combat forces vs infrastructure support.
Even throwing people into a meat grinder during WW2 was 19% combat forces.
If Russia actually lost 10% of their combat forces they'd be entirely crippled.
Assuming WW1 level 'chuck bodies at the enemy' % of combat forces the US ran 28% combat forces.
Russia would have theoretically lost that.
It would have completely collapsed.
It's not mathematically possible for Russia to have 100k dead soldiers.
At a terrible deaths to wounded ratio you'd be at 200k out of commission.
Of around 400k troops sent in and 1.1M total military size it's just not 100k dead Russians.
“you're gonna be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood, talkin' about, you know, the Pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.”.
Only one website is calling it 100k deaths.
Everyone else is reporting 100k casualties, including the US and UK intelligence reports and NGOs on the ground and a media project in Russia has barely identified 10k dead Russian soldiers by checking obituaries, social media posts and physically going to cemeteries to find headstones.
It is rather clever this.
It won't mean anything but it makes the Kremlin have to admit there is a war and then the domestic conversation changes (for the negative).
