It’s irrational to think the same problems don’t occur domestically even when we have seen them first hand.
Yet they act like the things they are going ballistic about elsewhere aren’t possible on the real front lines of the conflicts here on the home front.
And it comes across as sheer abandonment.
So why fight over there and anger people and then not acknowledge it when the same things they are fighting are happening prolifically and definitively domestically.
Absolutely nothing.
I have failed to gain sufficient interest by telling the truth, but I am restricted in that manner.
Nature requires everyone to choose to accept their evolution from Animal to Creator individually and of their own free will.
Nature does not employ slaves, God is not a psychopath, he did not create a psychopathic organism.
It’s humanity that chooses that; we are the psychopaths, we are the semi formed embryo in the reproductive process of the Multiverse.
We don’t even understand what we are, or what’s ahead of us that we are sacrificing due to our failure to end our 10,000 year old economy based on war and that humanity chose to create shortly after we gained independent thought, and the requirement to create our own future together.
All we choose to produce is chaos, everything we create we weaponize and dedicate it to war and the exploitation of human suffering.
