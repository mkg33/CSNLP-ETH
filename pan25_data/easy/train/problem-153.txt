1967 Morocco bugs the meeting of the Arab High command allowing Israelis to listen in and be told that there is 0 credible intelligence of an attack by Arab forces, as they are simply to weak to mount an attack, result is that Israel launches a surprise attack on its neighbours and Abba Eban goes to the UN saying Israel is being attacked by its neighbours.
And so.
I keep saying so what.
Think Israel or the US IS TRUST worthy with nukes?
Donâ€™t kid your self.
I wish there were no nukes at all.
But as long and the US, the only country that has actually used against another country, has them then it is free for all for everyone else.
Sorry for your feelings.
Regarding chronology of the wars with Israel, I already used time posting it here in the thread, its in one of the comments next to yours, im gonna refrain from repeating it, suffice to say the narrative of an innocent Israel is completely unbelievable with the current historical sources available, of course western schools are largely at fault for deciminating propaganda instead of history, leaving many people dumbfounded when it comes to this subject.
