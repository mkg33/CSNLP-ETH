Limiting anyone's offensive abilities in terms of nukes is a good thing; it's the whole purpose of NATO.
Massive coordinated overpowering retaliation.
I don't know about that.
I know several people (even on reddit) that had said "why are we supporting Ukraine so much when they are not in Nato?".
If Finland is attacked by Russia, can we really count on the Nato contries to help Finalnd?
I mean look at how the major powers of Europe are just giving Ukraine enough to not lose immediately but not enough to win.
Without the US, Ukraine would be really screwed.
I still feel the US should immediately declare them as Major non-NATO allies (the President can designate a nation as an MNNA thirty days after notifying Congress), which while it does not automatically include a mutual defense pact with the United States, it does confers a variety of military and financial advantages that otherwise are not obtainable by non-NATO countries (for example exemptions from the Arms Export Control Act that are enjoyed by NATO members).
Man.
Most of the times back when Trump was president, I was just in a constant state of despair but watching that video made my fucking blood boil.
Especially when nothing at all was done about it.
Still fucking pisses me off thinking about it.
