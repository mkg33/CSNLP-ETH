Ive sacrificed everything to live with as small a carbon footprint as possible and you're right, im completely alone.
Humanity is a selfish, stupid, and suicidal creature.
Enjoy your last years.
It's already too late but putting that aside, you'd be better served hiring naked women to hold signs, putting up billboards with climate alarming climate facts, engaging teachers everywhere to make sure climate change is more thoroughly hammered into kids, lobby politicians, become politicians, or most critically, actually tell people some actions they can take individually to have an actual positive impact.
Maybe thats the whole point.
If i wanted to protect my business , hire some homeless or some broke students desperate for cash, stir some shit up to damage reputation of actual climate activists to gain social hatred against their groups and to secure my not so climate friendly business model for a while.
Some of the actions these "climate activists" did were suspicious already.
I wonder if anyone investigated any of them and their cash transfers.

Literally almost anything, including doing nothing, is better than harassing and antagonizing regular people trying to live their lives.
The climate belongs to no one.
It is not a cause and the fact you think it is means that the message is not getting through.
If you think it's a "cause", you have no idea what's going on in your own reality.
I couldn't give a damn about extinction rebellion and find them annoying, myself, but we've triggered an extinction that we will be a part of.
Unless you're dying of something else, you're going to die from something related to climate change.
