If it helps, the consensus seems to be that rat kings aren’t real.

As usual, it all depends on the voter turnout.
I don't see how Trump could get any more votes than he got in 2020 because he hasn't don't anything at all to sway people that didn't vote for him.

The only thing I think could change the vote is if Biden makes a major mistake in the coming two years or have an international incident that wouldn't be his fault but that Republicans can blame on him.
