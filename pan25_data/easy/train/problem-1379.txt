Its sorry to see the same European powers which were once a mighty and highly respected to their words going from actually being threatening to as threatening like some authoritarian junk like NK or Iran.
European nations and leaders have been largely acting like a Scrappy doo being held by Scooby doo (America) trying to fight everyone including Russia, China, India and several Asian and African nations over Oil price from Russia.
The conflict has clearly exposed to the whole non-Western world how weak and disunited EU is in the face of danger with no armies of their own and no stomach to tell their citizens that their nations don't command the same power they had 50 years ago to dictate terms to other sovereign powers.
Yeah.
They just sell the oil to China because China is such a nice country and will give them the money they want and not just 50$ because the spare them from loosing their image by selling it to the EU.
Also how will they transport the oil?
Last time I checked you need a pipeline or special ship.
Russia has one pipeline into China and that is not connected to the western pipeline and oil deposit.
So they would need to transport it by ship which is very hard in winter since Russia can't use the Baltic or black sea Ports.
So they could use other countries pipelines and ports but that would increase the price drastically because they would need to load and unload it onto ships at least twice and pay the other countries.
That would make the oil more expensive than any fracking oil.
