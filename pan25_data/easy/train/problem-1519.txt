On December 27th, members of the Elad settler organisation, accompanied by Israeli police, took over a property in the area of Wadi Hilweh/Silwan which has been rented for decades by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate to a Jerusalem tenant.
Seems pretty straight forward to me.
Somebody lives there, lsraeli nationalists don't care, so they kick them out.
It's not legal and it's asshole move.
How is this okay?

The EU missions in Jerusalem and Ramallah express their deep concern over the implications of this action on the property rights of the Christian Churches in Jerusalem, including in the Old City.
Attempts to take over the property of Christian Churches must be halted, as they pose a serious threat to the peaceful coexistence of all three monotheistic religions in Jerusalem.
