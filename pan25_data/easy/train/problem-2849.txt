I've done technical hands on engineering work my entire adult life.
Every time I go to a new place you have to start over and learn the systems at the place you are at.
Usually just the fundamentals are the only thing that transfers.
If there's one thing I've learned about myself in this, it's that the speed at which I learn these new systems directly reflects my motivation.
I imagine most people are like this really.
I also imagine Ukrainian soldiers are -extremely- motivated to get these western systems onto the battlefield.
Opportunity.
It’s no wonder the Baltic states and most of Eastern Europe sprinted to get NATO and EU membership when they could.
Ukraine’s problem was its leadership couldn’t make up its mind what it wanted before the Maidan revolution: align with the EU or align with Moscow, never mind the NATO question.
Meanwhile, the West equivocated on Ukraine’s self-determination or acceptance of Russia having a major role in Ukraine.
This would be magnified for these anti-Russian groups.
Russia was able to eventually prevail with Chechnya and with Georgia (though western analysts started having seeds of doubt about the true effectiveness of the Russian military).
Ukraine has provided much more resistance than even Chechnya or even Afghanistan in a “special military operation” that was expected to take three days.
It has so far withstood what has essentially been Russia’s game plan with Chechnya and Syria with the its resourcefulness in combining its own knowledge of Soviet/Russian military doctrine, western military tactics it’s picked up, along with the functional military equivalent of Salvation Army donations from NATO.
Ukraine’s victory would give hope to those groups that they could prevail against the Russian military even if not protected by NATO’s nuclear umbrella.
