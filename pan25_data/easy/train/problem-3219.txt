Musk's mega-wealth is tied up in Tesla stock.
How exactly is he going to pay taxes on something that he is holding and not really selling?
Because that's how billionaires avoid taxes - they tie their compensation and net worth up in stock (which they seldom sell so they avoid capital gains) and then they live off of super low interest loans that aren't taxable using their stock as collateral.
Their NW of stock grows to colossal scales and they live off of loans that barely have any interest.
It's a tax avoidance strategy called "Buy, Borrow, Die" and it's possible because they have world-class credit to take out low interest loans and they don't have to sell their stock to incur capital gains on their NW.
Kids?
Mortgage interest?
He’s got 3 kids.
He’s already well ahead when it comes to credits right there.
Not necessarily.
Personal tax returns don't show the value of any real estate he owns or any businesses he owns.
They also don't show how much he owes in debt.
