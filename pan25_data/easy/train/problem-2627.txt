Honestly, over the years watching what has gotten left leaning news sources banned versus the knots the mods have tied themselves in to keep right wing sources is very telling.
Is this a liberal sub?
Of course.
But the allowed source content averages pretty strongly right, by design.
They've tried to control the conversation in one of the busiest political message boards on the Internet by controlling what can be posted.
So far it hasn't worked, but maybe one day.
So if the conditions of the environment are neutral (being extremely generous) and the people answering and having the bulk of the conversations not getting removed for incivility seem to be more strongly “liberal”, wouldn’t we conclude that it’s not the sub but the population that happens to be mostly liberal.
And we shouldn’t be surprised by that.
