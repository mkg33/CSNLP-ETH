Don’t get me wrong - when I was at the protests for keeping Roe & for other civil rights support I was impressed with how far we’ve come.
But I also knew these people aren’t showing up when my community needs people to march for us.
I knew that in my gut because I was here when Matthew Shepard was killed & I was here when Brandon Teena was killed.
People were too afraid to be seen because they thought the tv footage might hit the news & people in their small towns would see their faces on the news or the paper.
And looking around I feel like that’s starting again.
I never felt you could slide backwards.
How on earth could this happen after all the work we did to get accepted.
What lies have the southern evangelicals been telling about us during that same time period for this amount of ignorance and stupidity and hatred to be leveled against us; now?!
How did we miss this?
The Episcopal church is not exactly a marginalized denomination.
And they're far from the only denomination or faith leaders trying to oppose these horrifying attacks.
But it just doesn't seem to get any traction.
