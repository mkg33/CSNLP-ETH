There is and was for many years official polish version, see above comment - Miller's report, made by a polish commission in 2011.
It just shows how effective PiS is at disseminating their conspiracy bullshit, that foreigners on reddit just assume Macierewicz' work is the polish report and only polish report.
The more "official" Macierewicz version becomes, the more muddied the waters are and the closer to insanity we get.
Just to take it to a logical conclusion - if we assume the conspiracy theory as truth - Poland should invoke Article 5 against Russia already.
After all - if he believes Russia planted a bomb killing polish president and 95 other people, this is a major attack against us.
Imagine what USA would do if Air Force One crashed and official version would become "it was a bomb planted by country X".
Country X would be up to eyeballs in Marines.
This is PiS smuggling their politically expedient conspiracy theory into what should be an obvious condemnation of actual stuff that Russia is completely responsible for.
Unfortunately, the right-wing PiS is engaging in nationalist propaganda.
