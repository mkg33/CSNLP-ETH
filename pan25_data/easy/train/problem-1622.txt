Maybe someone wanted to extract the natural resources underneath it or build a resort or something?
Now that the painting has been destroyed they can quietly do that once the heat dies down.
Alot of folks exhibit various characteristics, classic of right wing ideology.
Wing wing/converative beliefs are not in any way related to American republicans, nor a party of any name.
I’ve met plenty of aussies who show disdain for “others” and only want western culture to exist.
Plenty who hold deeply racist beliefs, who believe they are surpreme to others simply because of their heritage.
This is an inherint characteristic of right wing ideology.
One can exhibit these charactaristics without self identifying ones political leaning.
Political leaning doesnt mean voting or participating in electing governments.
“political”, “politics” and legitimate political process are very different things.
Cool.
You're OK with the Quba Mosque being demolished.
It's just an old building, after all.
Or, better yet, the National Museum of Denmark.
That's a lot of old graffiti.
