I want to like your idea.
It certainly makes sense that anyone owning a deadly weapon should be vetted for being of sound mind, and it certainly makes sense to have a licensing scheme, and all of these things should be available at nominal cost.
I also think that there is too much emphasis on personal freedom and not enough on accountability - when a six year old is able to find a loaded gun with one in the chamber and the safety off and then shoot someone, people in general are getting too fucking complacent with the huge responsibility it is to own a weapon.
Most pro-gun people will bring up "how safe" they are with their guns when these conversations come up, but in their everyday lives, they leave guns laying around when kids are present, have bad trigger discipline, don't follow very basic rules about knowing what's behind your target, etc.
Oh.
I’m well aware.
I don’t have any delusions it’ll ever actually change.
Merely remarking on what it would take to actually see change.
This country is still the same as it always has been.
The veneer just gets refreshed every 50 years or so.
This cycle looks like it’ll be a Christian veneer.
I’m not really sweating any of this, in 100 years or less it won’t matter anyways.
