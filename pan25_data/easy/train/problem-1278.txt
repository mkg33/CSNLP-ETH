The buzz is nethanyshu is planning to revive the Hashemite Kingdom proposal, of simply handing off the West Bank to Jordan (more like forcing them to take it at gunpoint).
This is the response.
Many 'left-wing' politicians are socially conservatist and many 'right-wing' politicians are socially liberal.

“Growing numbers of countries” - really I’ve seen a lot of liberal westerners get more upset about the treatment of Palestine.
I’m honestly not aware of a different change in support.
What are you referring to?
Also, your history is wrong -- Arafat attempted assassination before Black September occurred.
Black September happened because Arafat tried to kill the king of Jordan twice, and the end result was a civil war that then led Arafat's fighters to travel across borders, eventually sparking war in Syria and in Lebanon.

I would be surprised if Palestinian armed groups become powerful enough to meaningfully impede Israel’s freedom of action.
Clearly it would be nice for them if they could do that, but it’s not as though Israel’s army is sclerotic in the same way Russia’s has turned out to be.
