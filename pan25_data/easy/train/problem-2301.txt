I wouldn’t put it past them but I’m also not going to let myself get sucked into conspiratorial thinking without more evidence.
With the thousands of documents that are removed during the transition of administrations I wouldn’t be surprised if there are classified documents sprinkled in others (Obama, Bush, etc…) because I can imagine it’s easy to happen.
In fact if we lived in a society where “petty revenge” wasn’t the goal, this would seem to be a good opportunity to update oversight to make sure this isn’t happening in the future.
Maybe review past presidents/vice presidents documents and be sure they also don’t have documents that they shouldn’t have.
Classification is complicated.
Remember, some (not all, but some) of Hillary Clinton’s classified emails on a personal email account were on matters that were retroactively classified after the fact and weren’t yet classified when they landed in her inbox.
That is not how it work.
Biden returned the documents as soon as they were discovered- he get slap on risk.
