What is the role of a live pope in a pope funeral?
The entire system is designed to don't have a living pope when a pope dies, so they have to figure out what role Francis will have (or most probably they already know, but didn't make it public).
Yep.
I might be wrong, but this is what I’ve seen and experienced in life.
It’s a real case-by-case thing, moment by moment.
Which kind of makes sense to me, because everyone is different, every situation is different, and you just can’t know everything that’s going on.
There are stories of Christians in the early church going into a city and then leaving it with all of the inhabitants healed, there are also stories of them going to a place and God tells them to turn around and leave without doing anything.
This particular passage you’re quoting just predicts that these things will be done, it doesn’t say when and where it will be done, so you can either read it as a promise that it will happen all the time, or that it will be a case by case thing.
I haven’t seen it happen all the time, but I have seen it happen.
Literally every religion has pageantry and outfits worn for different occasions.
Maybe just leave religious people alone and don't mock their beliefs.
In a world where so many are depressed and have no purpose I have profound respect for people that believe in religion even if I might not.
