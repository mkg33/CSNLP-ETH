No not at all!
All they want are the oblasts they illegally declared as Russian and don't have fun control of and are actually losing ground in to stop being contested and just given to Russia asking with Crimea and all of Ukraine's oil and gas and ports and it's most industrial areas and guarantee that they never make an alliance with anyone but Russia or join an economic zone without Russia and Zelensky to step down and be replaced with someone who will obey Russia and in return Russia will probably stop attacking for a while and focus on psyops to extinguish Ukrainian national identity and less overtly absorb them into a new Russian empire.
So sad.
The whole world is mistreating poor Putin and his former ally Donald Trump.
All they wanted was to rule the world with violent nationalistic, domestic and/or global oppression.
Can’t a kid have dreams anymore?
Firehosing.
I like it.
Guess that’s why that fucking trump did something outrageous every single day for four years.
Plus the last two years he’s thrown so much shit at the wall to see what might stick.
And blah blah blah the whole time.
