All of those generals and other ppl that have some sort of position in russia should just instal hidden cameras in their offices.
So if they get shoot their family,friend etc.
Can just go get them and then upload the footage to the internet so we can have some proof of what is going on behind the scenes.
Imagine some idiot coming into the office and he says that putler is not happy and shoots him ,it would cause a loot of outrage among the elites and of course make them consider finally taking a stand against this tyrant in fear of them being next in line.
Of course they probably now that by now but having videos like this float around is never a bad thing.
Wow Vladivostok.
So (jokes aside) is this people that aren’t a fan of Putin’s war and mobilization?
Vladivostok is so far away from Moscow/St.
Petersburg it’s probably like a Wild West (wild east?)
and possibly the culture is influenced less by those far away centers of Russian power.
Maybe a local mafia even.
But also, it’s a city so there would be people more aware of events than rural areas (in general terms).
I’ve seen isolated incidents of people resisting mobilization.
Any chance someone with more experience and knowledge of Russian culture wants to add something?
