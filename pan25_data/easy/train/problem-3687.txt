Minnesota is about to pass legal weed, some of the best voter access laws in the country and highest turnout, budget surpluses, abortion rights enshrined in law (wisconsin it's illegal but the AG is not prosecuting cases).
Not really.
Think about it, if it's more than possible to do for other people, and it's still involves working for 36 years in one field, on top of the four years of training to get there, minimum.......
But also, the kind of people who think retirement ages should be in their mid to late 60s are the same people who thought social security wasn't insult to their parents, because they died before it could be instituted a century ago when it was being debated.
Or another way, if I die of cancer, then they find a potential cure for cancer, I don't want my children to fight vociferously against it, because it's unfair that it didn't personally benefit them at the time.
I feel like everyone is acting like a late 50s retirement ages unreasonable, and I don't understand that.
We've seen that the finances work, with good unions that withhold enough money and have a proper compensation plan in place, people can and do.
And I think that's really amazing.
Why wouldn't that be a good thing, not just for teachers, but for everyone?
