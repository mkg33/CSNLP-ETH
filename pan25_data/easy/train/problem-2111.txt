You know the US gov didn’t write this article?
A fringey barely accepted business insider wrote it and some redditor posted it.
Welcome to the internet.
The US basically fell behind in tank development and eventually rushed out M60s based on the WW2 Patton to fill the gap, then developed the Abrams over a period of something like 15-20 years, one of the key design goals being that the armour should be capable of taking hits from certain Soviet tanks so height was less of a factor and more attention was paid to things like safe ammo stowage etc.
They were not.
Soviet era tanks have a very poor defensive design.
Their size and turret design means they are unable to operate effectively from prepared hull-down positions and they have horrendous speed in reverse.
They are, however, very fast going forward and their low silhouette was thought to be a tactical advantage on offense.
The Soviet “defensive” strategy against NATO was always to make a massive offensive push into Germany and try and knock Western Europe out of the war before America could bring troops over.

What do you think will happen to the US economy if China feels empowered enough to strangle or invade Taiwan and all high-end factories will cease to export chips to the US?
Further development of advanced economies relies on advanced chips.
The strenh of the US response in Ukraine impacts China’s calculus.
From a strategic perspective, everything what is happening is good for the US and bad for China and Russia.
Why would you interrupt this?
