I throughly enjoyed this response, well written and eloquently put.
Yes there are certainly exceptions to every rule, without a doubt.
I didn't come from a religious background nor was I raised in a blue collar household.
As a matter of fact, my entire life my parents were staunch Liberals, consistently voted anti-conservative and routinely talked trash about anything anti-liberal or centre right oriented.
The fair majority of my opinions were generated at promoting peace, whether in conversation or action, despite my current occupation.
I elected to serve rather than follow, which generally brings additional conservative values.
I am pro choice, an ally to the LGBTQ2+ community and am to put service before self in all aspects of life.
Liberal free spending has caused a great deal of tax payer burden at all levels (provincial, federal) within Canada.
A nation which has never seen such debt to GDP ratio ever demonstrates that free wheeling social programs are not always the best solution.
I am fiscally conservative, I am socially centre (if the program is needed and will value every Canadian, not just select voters) but I greatly believe that the Government should be maintained small and allow the economy to flourish rather than flooded with tax payer funds.
I am and do vote Conservative, but not American GOP style, Canadian centre-right.
I have voted Liberal in the past, as it was the responsible choice at that time, though hasn't helped greatly today.
Our Liberals have slid far to Left from their centre- left position.
"I'm Canadian.
Taxes are too high, the debt is out of control, and it's the fault of liberal social programs.
