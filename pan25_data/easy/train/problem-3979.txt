It’s like you’re trying to describe liberals in the most flattering light possible but the truth is their inaction makes them complicit and therefore bad people.
“Goodness” is not a character trait as much as it is a description of the actions people do.
If I give my food to the homeless than I’m a good person.
If I stand silently on the sideline while fascists takeover I’m complicit and therefore not a good person.
The truth is the “good people” you describe don’t take more drastic action because they don’t care.
They believe that their institutions, or a hero, or the silent mass of other “good people who agree with them” will save them.
But Hitler had it right when he said “the only way that we (the fascists) could have been stopped is if our movement had been crushed in its infancy”.
Therefore “Good people” crush fascist movements in their infancy.
They don’t fucking standby passively.
It's inexcusable.
We have the numbers, by several million in fact.
People just have to be bothered to show up.
The problem is the only time the Democratic electorate pays attention is when an election is hyped up like the season finale of the greatest HBO show ever.
Obama said as much to a bunch of journalists 3 days before he left office.
