If he could start all over, it would be very easy: The Chinese pharma company Fosun invested very early in Biontech and signed deals with Biontech, similar to Pfizer, allowing them to sell it in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
The US had no problem to act like Pfizer is an American vaccine.
China could have called it Fosun and do the same.
In Hong Kong Fosun actually sold the Fosun Biontech vaccine.
But only in Hong Kong.
It worked, of course.
But not for the rest of China.
Why?
There was Mao Zedong Thought (and multiple cults of personality), Deng Xiaoping Thought (which repudiated a lot of Mao and mostly without the cult of personality), 16 years of Jiang Zemin and then Hu Jintao holding the line and retiring after two terms and shepherding the PRC into the world's second largest economy and an uplift of hundreds of millions into the middle class.
It is not private.
All companies belong to the state.
Look at the Alibaba Group, the biggest "private" company in China.
CEO and founder Jack Ma found out the hard way who really owns Alibaba.
And it was neither him, nor the shareholders, but the Chinese government.
Both practically and according to Chinese law.
So in what sense is it private?
And this is all ignoring the giant elephant where they try to paint Chinese infection rates as catastrophic because they're "at an all time high", their all time high is the exact same as America's all time low and they have 4x the population, they aren't comparable in the slightest.
