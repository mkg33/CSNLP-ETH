I hope they get cut off from all foreign defence manufacturers and everyone stops all military contacts with them, maybe that'll be the kick in the ass they need as they're too small to make all that they need for their army.
There are rumors that Germany might cut off all defence cooperation with them and stop selling them military equipment, if other nations follow suit that'll be some powerful motivation to stop being obstructionist.
I can totally understand Swiss neutrality in 1939 when surrounded by potential enemies but now they're just exploiting the fact they're surrounded by friends so they don't have take a stand on anything.
They freeload off the security NATO and the EU provide.
Neutrality just means obstructionism.
Their ‘neutrality’ has been eroded for quite some time.
The reality is that in a conflict, there’s only three categories anyone can fit into - friend, enemy, or unimportant.
It’s time for the Swiss to pick a side, because at the moment they seem to be on Russia’s.
