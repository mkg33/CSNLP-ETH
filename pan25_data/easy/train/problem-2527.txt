Now Lenin is a very interesting figure.
I do not subscribe at all to the great man theory of history, but if I did, I would use Leninn as proof.
The October Revolution does not happen without Lenin.
Even though he blinked during the July crisis, when people took to the streets and demanded the Soviets take all the power, he is the single driving figure pushing the Bolsheviks to launch their coup.
And after the Bolsheviks did not gain a majority in the Constituent Assembly, he gave them a nice poison pill.
He drafted a law to have the assembly give all power to the Soviets, and if it passes, he wins, if it fails (which it did) he can accuse the Assembly of being anti revolutionary and shut it down and take power.
What?
Napoleon did something to Russia.
You would have thought that Russia might have mentioned something like that in the over 200 year since it happened?
/s.
Napoleon?
The guy who lost a war because he was too proud to admit he was in an unwinnable situation, but still continued pushing forward in the worst way possible?
That guy?
