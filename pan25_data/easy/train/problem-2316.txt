So the goal is to make bigoted people not be bigoted with a mandatory training?
Good fucking luck with that.
I guarantee these folks aren’t that good at paying attention to classroom instruction, especially when it’s geared towards humanizing people they despise.
You’re better off trying to get a goose to shit gold.
What if — and bear with me for a sec as I haven’t fully thought this out — what if, the same way conviction of a sexual offense places the offender’s name on a registry that (as far as I know but again, haven’t thought this through) cannot be wiped, conviction of a hate crime (i) remained with the offender, (ii) placed the offender’s name on a registry, and (iii) that registry was widely available to the public?
Agreed.
When these programs are created it's doubtful that the people administering them are under any illusion that they'll be able to rehabilitate everyone who passes through, but even if they are not be able to change everyone sometimes the lessons taught can percolate through the local community.
