Christianity is actually a subversive revolutionary ideology, which allowed Martin Luther King Jr. to fight for civil rights from the Christian Left.
In the New Testament in James 2:15-16, James said “If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, ‘Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,’ but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?
Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” In Luke 3:11 (NIV), John said “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has food should do the same.” Matthew 25:40 says “whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” Which means loving others is loving God, hurting others is hurting God.
And Jesus condemned the rich, who hoard money while the poor and needy suffer.

Isn’t Christianity heresy?
Weren’t people like the celts forced to become Christian or face the knife?
