The lawsuit against him, Hikaru and Chess.com is a PR stunt.
Niemann's complaint was filed and part of the public record, and it had no new information and basically accused them of colluding to ruin an up and coming rival's reputation.
No evidence mind you just accusations that they are working together.
Nevermind, Chess.com's evidence or how defamation in the US requires proof of malicious intent, which he doesn't provide any new evidence to support, or that he intentionally filed the lawsuit in a state not related to their residence, Chess.com's headquarters, or the location of the tournament.
It is basically asking to be thrown out for jurisdictional issues alone.
Not that it can't also be dismissed for lacking merit.
Personal jurisdiction is over people.
The claim here (which may not prevail) is that Magnus and Niemann were in the Eastern District of Missouri when Magnus and Nakamura made their statements, and when chess.com decided to ban Neimann from future events (which is his monetary injury, since chess.com now runs a majority of the paid chess events).
