Kansas is an interesting state politically.
The state legislatures are always red, but the statehouse is definitely not.
If this were a recent development I might say it's because of an increase in city (and thus more democratic leaning) population, but this change in party for the statehouse has been happening regularly since the 1900s (except for a 20-year span after WWII when Republicans held it).
Thank Christ.
I am a recent felon done with my obligations.
I could not vote on the abortion amendment a few months back and was absolutely sick about it.
After I completed everything I called the election office three times to verify I was able to vote, then on Sunday I checked the website again.
Due to what happened in Florida when I gave my state ID yesterday at the polling location my knees went weak, half expecting someone to materialize from the corner to arrest me.
Voter intimidation is real.
I voted.
It was a pleasant experience.
I went preparing for the worst.
Just a reminder for everyone not to take your right for granted.
