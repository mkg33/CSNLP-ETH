Edit: Since many people are pointing out that there's an engine replacement for the B-52, I'm aware.
But it's like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound.
You can't fix a fundamentally flawed design with better parts.
Nobody in their right mind would think about powering a heavy bomber with 8 tiny business-jet engines, but it's the only choice they have with the wing geometry that they're stuck with.
If the US were to procure another heavy bomber from scratch (which nobody wants to pay for, hence why the B-52 is going to have a 100 year program life), they'd start with something like a 787 which has a similar MTOW and produces more thrust with its stock engines than the BUFF does with its 8 tiny inefficient engines.
Cosmoline.
It's like wax and grease mixed together.
I have 2 old rifles from the Soviet Union, an SKS and a Mosin Nagant.
They both came to me wrapped in waxed paper and coated in the stuff.
It took hours to clean that gunk off and when the guns would get hot from firing, they would drip and smoke.
Took a long time for that to finally stop haha.
