They're also desperate to keep India from divesting from Russian made weapons.
India has increasingly been trying to diversify its weapons procurement through domestic production and contracts with western countries.
They may figure that licensing out their designs may be the only option to keep the Indian market now.
After all, Russia's tank losses in the Russo-Ukrainian war have been so horrific that they're likely not gonna have anything to spare for export for at least a few years.
That's assuming the war ended tomorrow, which it definitely won't.
India has been sanctioned before FYI.
India will not forget her old friends, new friends and diplomatic relations.
India does not have the system of allies We are in love with the world even though some don't love us Muaah!
Who helped Indians post-independence with their agricultural, scientific, economic, military and nuclear ambitions?
It wasnâ€™t the U.S, UK, France or Germany.
It was the fucking Soviets.
India has a lot to be grateful for and they are giving that back by staying neutral and not aligning against them.
