I have never seen something like that.
This almost looks like an air defense uturn.
I can't imagine anything flying 600 odd km with rockets still burning.
Only other guess would be some air launched ballistic missile from some unknown platform.
Because the brightness on those suggest rocket motor, but unless this is some fancy 2 stage hybrid of a type I am unaware of, it couldn't have been launched from Ukraine.
Think of something like tochkta which burns for like 100 seconds or so.
If this is real I can't wait to see speculation on wtf this could be.
This could be something really creative like fixing a drone airframe around a tochkta u, flying to a certain distance then shedding the shell and igniting to what I imagine would be close to hypersonic velocity.
Basically an air launched tochkta, similar to how Russia made"hyoersonic" missiles by air launching iskanders.
Escalating is COMPLETELY irrelevant.
They cannot be negotiated with.
They will never honor any peace agreement, the same way they did not honor any of the previous ones.
