Every relative in Iran I speak to tells me the same thing.
That something has changed.
There was a shift in the mindset of the people.
They stopped being afraid.
This is exactly why it is ignorant, you seem to think that the majority of Iranians support the regime just because the Iranian regime pumps out propaganda videos of people burning American and Israeli flags, chanting death to America and so on.
The average Iranian isn't more wicked than the average American for example, just like how the republicans have gathered support under false hopes and aspirations by manipulation the Iranian regime has done the same thing.
I’m not even close.
I don’t give a fuck about Apple or Android but obviously you do.
Get over it.
The downvoted prove that YOU are the one failing here.
Afghanistan however had billions and billions of dollars of American support, equipment, and a constitutional democracy.
But the Afghans refused to unite for any common goal, and were easily overrun by the Taliban despite superior weaponry.
Afghanistan is controlled by the Taliban, not because it is the majority will of the people, but because they have no uniting vision to fight for.
America tried for a decade to force them to have a common vision, and we rightfully pulled out because the truth is you can't force that upon people.
They have to come to that organically by their own, and the current situation is truly sad.
