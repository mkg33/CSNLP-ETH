Missouri set up a quasi-public non-profit corporation called MOHELA to act as a loan servicer for student loans.
MOHELA earns a flat monthly fee from the federal government for each student loan they're responsible for servicing.
Missouri passed a law obligating MOHELA to pay $350 million into a state fund that helps fund Missouri's public higher education institutions, of which about $250 million has been paid so far.
The argument is that loan forgiveness will reduce the number of loans MOHELA services, which will reduce MOHELA's revenue, which will affect their ability to pay off the rest of their financial obligation to the state of Missouri.
