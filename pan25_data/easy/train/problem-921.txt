Dude, that’s messed up.
Totally entrapment!
I don’t know how they are getting away with that shit.
Someone needs to challenge them on appeal.
That shit should NOT be allowed.
Taking drugs and not breaking any other laws like stealing or violence should not be illegal.
The drug laws just let law enforcement wipe their asses with the constitution.
Such a fucking racket.
And weed laws are the worst of the lot.
Fortunately, I’ve lived in Oregon for a long time and the cops don’t fuck with people who aren’t dealing or into violence.
That’s legit.
The Republican Party’s internal factions will be increasingly at each other’s throats and they are already losing control of legislative chambers due to internal division alone, not to mention the fact that they are starting to lose seats even on heavily gerrymandered maps in a lot of places and came very close to losing a lot more “safe” seats.
What I wrote is a pun.
Missouri: Show me the Border state.
The joke is that parts of it are so bad you just want to leave.
