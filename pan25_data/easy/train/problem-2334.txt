Here’s a article about the source of the rumor.
The gist is people back in his hometown thought he wasn’t interested in women and it’s been a persistent rumor for a while, even hinted at by the senator he originally defeated.
No definitive proof for or against but DC ironically views sexuality of senators/representatives as off limits so it will always be unknown.
I agree.
Distinguishing between ideology and application muddies the waters a little, as with any other political philosophy.
But yeah, right wing anarchists and right wing libertarians should, at their logical conclusion allow for anyone to marry, and you could argue abolish the institution as a whole.
I imagine a pure anarcho capitalist would probably support the dissolution of the state, and therefore marriage, but idk if any of them have genuinely thought that far ahead.
Anarcho capitalists are nut jobs but their philosophy would probably support same sex marriage.
They’re essentially libertarians that are even more anarchist in nature, because as noted libertarians don’t actually believe in libertarianism, they are just disgraced tea partiers.
