It really strikes me that they made really sure she WAS dead - falling from the 6-7th floor can be survived - I survived 10,5m - but 16th floor is kinda 100% deadly.
And there are generally not so many buildings that are as high… yes, a suicidal person can look that up, look for the largest hotel, book a room on the top, and just jump - it’s possible - but to have to accomplish a lot of very well planned steps would radically reduce the possibility to actually do it.
Love the Russian humor.
This is ultimately the problem with fascists and authoritarian regimes: eventually all the competent people who would disagree are either rounded up or sufficiently cowed into silence, leaving you with incompetent leadership trying to execute its vision with incompetent sycophants.
So far in the history of the world this has not ended well.
Corrupt authoritarianism can emerge from both central-planned government-run industry as well as monopolized "privately held" industry.
It takes real distributed power and competition to avoid the perils of having too much power in one place.
