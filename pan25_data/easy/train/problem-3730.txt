I was responding to the fact the poster claimed it was "for the best" since the transition of power went smoothly and without bloodshed, even if it wasn't the outcome they (the United States) wanted.
His point being that the lesser evil of the situation was accepting an unfavorable outcome but one that lead to a peaceful conclusion.
And he's not the first to gesture such notions.
The report said that when an inspection team visited KBL in April 2011, the currency counters were only being used to count cash declared by normal passengers but were not connected to the internet -- and, therefore, not the FinTRACA -- and they weren't being used at all whenever any VIPs flew breezed through.
Additionally, high-ranking officials and others known as "Very Very Important Persons" (VVIPs), were allowed to go through their own lounge without going through the main customs screening and did not have to submit their cash to the bulk currency counters.
This is nonsense.
The US never backed "radicalized" fighters deliberately; they funded the ISI whom was given a freehand in Afghanistan, and they chose to provide the bulk of the fund to radicalized fighters.
