It’s sort of a natural consequence of how the UN operates in regards to Israel.
They spend a lot of time and energy passing resolutions condemning Israel, far more than any other country, and for at least a few years now more than all other countries combined.
You can criticize Israel and still think that’s nuts, and still understand why Israel would stop listening to the UN.
So insidiously disingenuous.
You start weeping for these “children” in the comments, knowing DAMN WELL that this 16 year old was a member of a fundamentalist militant organization.
When confronted with what you knew ALL ALONG, you obfuscate and say “the Israelis made him shoot at them, he’s still a kid!”.
Again, stop being idealistic.
Stop ignoring the reality that the Arab authorities have rejected the existence of a Jewish state and have forgone their previous opportunities at peace for the chance to eliminate the Jews all together.
Forget what you personally want to see… what realistic outcome could possibly be accepted for peace when the continued sentiment from many surrounding Arabs is “death to Jews and/or Israel”.
