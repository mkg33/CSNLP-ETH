To be fair, Ma Ying-jeou didn't assume office until 5/20/08, so it was still under the DPP president Chen Shui-bien when the earthquake happened.
I really wouldn't say the relationship between Taiwan and China were good between 2000 and 2008, when DPP / Chen Shui-bien held the presidency.
Anti-secession law was passed in 2005, and China had been buying off Taiwan's allies on the world stage (i.e.
Chad, Senegal, etc).
I also remembered Taiwan was invited to become a member of the World Health Assembly by the US, but under China's intense pressure, the topic never came up.
When the news media asked Chinese WHO representative if their strong stance against Taiwan's participation in WHO would result in the health needs of the 23 million Taiwanese not being heard, then China to UN diplomat Zukang Sha responded angrily, "who gives a shit about them".
It’s not surging.
The Covid hot spot map shows that there are hardly any cases in China.
Im sure open travel is gonna be fine.
Edit: I forgot that satire was dead.
Giggling.
China doesn't need help.
Refused aid in 1960, 30 million people starved to death.
Refused aid in 1976 earth quake, 200,000+ dead.
Refused COVID vaccine, one death per day; or so they say o.o.
Currency protectionism is a common measure imposed by almost every developing economy today.
All things being equal it’s not the most ethically sound of measures but where one party is still developing its capabilities, it makes sense to do so to circumvent another party’s economies of scale.
