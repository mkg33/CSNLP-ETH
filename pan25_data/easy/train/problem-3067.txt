Again do you have a source or did you make up that figure?
The only source I could find from the IAEA is behind a paywall.
This is total non-issue, and like dihydrogen monoxide only demonstrates how scientifically illiterate most people are.

Bioaccumulation, many fish giving off radiation inside another fish will cause a higher concentration of radioactive materials than the surrounding water.
Two.
Your supposed understanding of environmental sciences shows that when it comes to radiation exposure and toxicity levels for tritium, you don't know shit.
As for your last erroneous assumption, marine organisms are already exposed to levels of tritium greater than what is contained in the waste water.
The surface water in all the oceans of the world contain higher levels of tritium than what Japan will release.
So if there was any concern about marine organisms, especially fish, ingesting the infinitesimally small amounts of tritium they'll be exposed to in the waste water, then marine life would already be too irradiated from ingesting the naturally occurring tritium in sea water.

Marine ecosystems depend on microorganisms who thrive in the surface of the ocean (where dumping happens) and are more sensitive to radiation than humans (except the dinoflaggelates I suppose) and local extripation will occur.
