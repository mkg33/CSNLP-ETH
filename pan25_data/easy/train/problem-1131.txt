We only need to keep it solvent until AI and robotics can render working for a living unnecessary.
When all manufacturing, food production, delivery, and so forth happens without any human work being used, profits will go parabolic, vertical even, and wages will drop to zero, which means costs drop, but income drops faster, so you have cheap products that cost you nothing to keep making them, but nobody can afford to buy anything.
Money loses all value.
Capitalism implodes.
Social Security no longer matters.
You need something you just ask for it and it's made to order and delivered to you as time allows.
Nobody gets rich because everybody has whatever they need and without scarcity, there's no value.
Even today, you can't sell air.
You can sell time on an air compressor, or buy canned air for the delivery mechanism, but nobody's gonna buy the air out of your tires.
It's worthless.
Eventually, everything will be like that.
Congress created social security.
Congress could enhance the benefits afforded us with social security or cut the benefits at anytime if the president signs off on the legislation.
