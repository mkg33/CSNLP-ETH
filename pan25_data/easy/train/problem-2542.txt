lol.
I've seen reports that the one we shot down over lake huron was a ufo.
supposedly we sent 4 - f16s out and only 1 returned.
the other 3 got shot down.
Im not saying you necessarily need to do homework on every article you read, but if there's something you think sounds like bullshit - just fact check it by cross referencing with legitimate news outlets (reuters is a good one for international stuff imo).
ya.
you'd think.
I'm not saying it's true.
I'm just saying it popped up on my phone thru my "news break" app.
There are articles online about it and it's all over Twitter.
I didn't go looking for this information or saying its in anyway true.
But something is definitely weird.
This is the 4th "ufo" the US has shot down in the past week.
The 1st one was identified as a balloon and the other 3 have just been called "objects" or ufos.
They're not even dismissing the possibility of aliens either.
they're just saying - "we don't know what it is or where they're coming from".
And I've seen other reports that these are popping up in other parts of the world as well.
Supposedly China and I think it was Australia.
Who knows wtf it is.
Could just be some private civilian company.
Could be freaking drones.
I have no idea.
In any case it's concerning..
