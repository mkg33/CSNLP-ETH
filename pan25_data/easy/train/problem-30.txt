One of my friends in school was Pakistani and she told me that it’s also one of those “you can’t use it but we can” situations.
Her family and friends and cultural circles used it, because it actually meant “Clean” iirc, which is an important virtue in Islam, so amongst themselves it was actually an acceptable word to say.
Yeah earthquakes can come at the worst times.
The Great Hanshin quake caught me and my gf naked in a love hotel with mirrors on the ceiling.
Gotta love Japanese construction though.
The next night I woke up to an after shock raining dust down on me.
I was living in an old inn that they rented out as cheap apartments.
Wooden pillars and those kind of made from mud walls.
That gave the building good flexibility.
Still that moment of "can I make it under that desk before the ceiling comes down on me?"
was not fun.
Then another time I was in a high rise hotel and just getting dressed.
The swaying and watching the other buildings sway was a disorienting experience.
Kinda cool in a way but not a thing I'd like to repeat.
Northwest Louisiana, so tornadoes and hurricane remnants.
But now I'm in Pittsburgh, so I don't really know yet.
There are occasional mild earthquakes in the northeast sometimes.
