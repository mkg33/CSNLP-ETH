Same people argued for extreme violence and enforcement against First Nations people who briefly block roads for protests, and then tried to hold the entire country hostage because "wah, mask hurt face!11".
Yuuup.
Religion is such a corrupting influence.
Every goddamn religion is the basis used for these freaks to justify fundamentalist extremism mixed with nationalism, sexism, and racism worldwide.
It will be a big nothing.
It's being planned by the same idiot that sent the manifesto ( Or whatever you want to call it) to parliament.
No need to panic he'll be lucky to have 10 supporters.
Conservatism and religious zealotry are blights upon humanity.
They have left untold oppression, subjugation, authoritarianism, misogyny, xenophobia, bigotry, science denial, theocracy, willful ignorance, childhood indoctrination, inequality, war, murder, and draconian bullshit in their wakes.
It's funny.
They claim "We won't live in fear!"
when they're so afraid that they're now deep in denial about covid, and so obsessed that they have rearranged their entire lives around it.
