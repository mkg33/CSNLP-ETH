"Most kinds of renewable energy are also “carbon-free”: they do not emit CO2 or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Because of this, and because renewables like wind and solar power are so popular in climate activism, the terms “renewable energy” and “carbon-free energy” are sometimes confused.
But not all renewable energy is carbon-free, and not all carbon-free energy is renewable.
Nuclear energy is carbon-free: a nuclear power plant does not emit any CO2, or any other greenhouse gases.
But it is not renewable.
Nuclear reactors use uranium, and if we run out of uranium, we can never get it back.

Personally I think a solar/nuclear mix is great, bc the excess power generation around the summer solstice allows you to put all your scheduled refueling and maintenance downtime for reactors during the summer with minimal grid disruption, and lower storage overhead.
