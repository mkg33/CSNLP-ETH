The only thing I would remind you about the corruption is the source of that money that drives it, much of it is America corporations.
CIA was the 70s and 80s face of it, it’s still major American corporations owning the mines that drive urban politics that keep resources from the locals, that allow toxic environmental damage in those communities.
Ok it’s a bit disingenuous to say all companies are American.
I seem to remember some are Canadian.
I’m sure there are others, like Chinese or Japanese operating there, but I don’t know for certain.
The villages I visited had American and Canadian owned mines.
Such beauty corrupted and laid waste.
Hell, the American mines in Utah are barely better and if it’s weren’t for the EPA signed by Nixon there’s probably be as bad.
Wonderful!
Even if it won't "do much" as other people have posted here, I think it's great for the Iranians in Iran to see that they have outside support.
Just knowing that others care, even if they can't actively help you at the moment, can be enough to keep spirits burning.
Nicaragua is interesting.
I wonder if they had more mineral or oil wealth if it would have been as successful.
My brother helped liberate the country as a Ne recruit then spent the next 25 years in the Middle East.
He said the people loved Americans until you got 50 yards outside the perimeter.
He didn’t get the irony.
