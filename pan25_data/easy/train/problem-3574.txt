From what I can see a lot of the combat in Ukraine is with BMPs are BTRs which they will be good at taking out, while older T-72s can only reverse at 4-6kph the Leo 1A5 is a lot faster and is built to do shoot and scoot, using the surroundings as protection .
The Leo 1A5 can still be an effective weapon in taking out enemy IFVs,APCs and other lightly armored vehicles and annoy enemy soft targets with HE shells, while the protection isn't the best I believe the Leo 1A5 will be able to use the older but still effective western optics and targeting systems and will have a older thermals, but anything is better than nothing.
What do you mean?
Your sentences only make sense if you believe that all the other countries already gave every tank available.
And that would be a very stupid assumption.
Danish news reports that 99 ex Danish Leo 1A5s is stored in a warehouse just south of the Danish border in Germany, will be sent to Ukraine and that Ukraine thanks us for our contribution to the war calling us "True friends of Ukraine" as far as I know from Danish documentation the 99 ex Danish leos are almost Standard Leo 1A5s with minor modifications to suit their use, the gun is the standard 105mm.
