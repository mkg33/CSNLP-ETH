Raising livestock of any kind for commercial purposes such as food production is a messy business and herds have always been susceptible to outbreaks of various diseases throughout history.
These risks are acceptable because food production is necessary, and people eat meat.
Absolutly.
But especially ones like this.
I can understand food animals, I don't like it but I get it.
There is zero fucking reason shit like mink farms should still be a thing.
We need to stop focusing on the obvious (Re: Clearly attributable to Covid because a person has died while actively having a covid infection) Covid mortality and go back to the conversation about how Covid is killing people months after the fact, still permanently disabling millions, and yet is now treated completely incomprehensibly as if it's gone away when it has not.
Mink?
Because it’s the minks that have the ability to potentially cause an avian virus to adapt to a mammalian one.
I’m guessing though you meant chickens but they aren’t an issue.
Mink are specifically the issue here & they’re bred for luxury fabric, not food.
This warrants very close monitoring by authorities and necessary countermeasures despite any economic impact.
H5N1 is capable of making COVID look like dress rehearsal.
We have been comforted by its inability to sustain human transmission, but that could change, and if it does, it will likely be due to a similar scenario as outlined in the article.
