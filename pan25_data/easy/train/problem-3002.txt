Was a dump from Otero county.
I know many people that see those rigged dumps and say, what’s wrong with this country?
You can take a dump on Boebert and it’s totally fake, totally rigged.
Everyone says it.
/s.
According to the CNN numbers at the time of this post, I unfortunately project Boebert to win by 640 votes if every district finishes up with the same margins currently reported.
I didn't say that.
I said that the outstanding counties are predominantly D, three of them I believe, of varying levels of pro D. One of them I think is just a couple of points; that's not necessarily going to yank the numbers the other way.
She's currently 400 votes ahead, which is the biggest margin they've had for a long time, and I think there's only a couple thousand votes left.
Add to that, a lot of the late votes are coming in from overseas military, which skew heavy right.
