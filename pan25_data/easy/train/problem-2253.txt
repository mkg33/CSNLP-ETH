This pattern repeats so often that when you zoom out you realize it’s grift, it’s gaming the system.
When a derailment happens, an oil rig explodes, or grandma gets sick, “who could possibly have foreseen this?” Palestine, OH or Deepwater Horizon are presented as simply the unforeseeable, unintended consequences of “small government” virtuous intentions.
“How were we to know?” But eventually you realize that’s an outright lie.
Gaming the system by exploiting hospitals you don’t pay for but are available when you need them, or exploiting energy infrastructure that you don’t pay for but is available when your prices go up… those things are not accidental side-effects.
Those are the design features of Republican philosophy.
What you realize after a while is just how deeply “baked in” classism is to Republican political thinking.
Grifting the system is fully justified because the victim of the grift isn’t “the system” but rather all those ‘suckas’ that were too ‘stoopid’ to know how to game the system.
It’s OK to steal openly from your neighbor because your neighbor is one of “those” people, one of the undesirables that is just ‘freeloading’ off of social systems.
And by freeloaders, they actually mean “people who were stupid enough to pay as you go.”.
Basically?
It was exactly that those agencies were just overworked and understaffed.
When that happens, shit gets missed.
It's just that simple just as it is in every other job.
