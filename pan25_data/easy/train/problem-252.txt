Trump truly believes that he is a mastermind, that he is the ultimate manipulator.
This delusion is his true Achilles heel.
He has been played, over and over by actors whose interests he doesn’t fathom, simply because his narcissism precludes any understanding of a bigger picture.
Any gain for him, big or small, is to be pursued as an end in itself.
He sees no consequences for others because he sees no others.
Once you understand his psychology, manipulation becomes elementary.
My god.
Give this guy a break.
After all he donated pallets of Trump water to the poor underprivileged people of Flint, Michigan, and Jackson, Mississippi during their water crises.
(Oh wait, that was Ohioan’s.)
But he did gv the Flint and Jackson people McDonald’s and gave them hats, didn’t he?
I mean there’s good people on both sides am I right?
He didn’t do that either?
My bad.
Oh wait, look up in the sky, I see a weather balloon transporting a laptop.
