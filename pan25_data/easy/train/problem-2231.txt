When you lose your elite fighting troops in such a rapid and short time and replace it with inexperienced consripts and far less armaments, is it still the same tank army?
Sherman Firefly?
Can destroy a Tiger from beyond the ability of the Tiger to effectively return fire.
Hypothesis: Western democracies are equivalent to Authoritarians in Russia or China.
To test this hypothesis, conduct a series of experiments in both systems: 1) Being openly gay, 2) Publicly protesting against the govt., 3) Being a rich, peaceful neighbor.
Looking forward to the results!
So, sure, you might have entire regiments getting shattered and reformed on a regular basis, but when every soldier is trained as well as a Guardsman is, when they doctrine is as rigid and as well-drilled as the Guard is, when the very culture from day 1 tells you that the man next to you will fall and be replaced by another, when you have the ability to do this kind of insane thing on a scale of billions to fight hundreds of massive battles happening simultaneously across an entire galaxy, you have a force that is utterly unique in its capacity to sustain losses without losing its ability to fight.
Tiger?
Heavy tank that was completely obsolete by 1943, front armour about the same as a Sherman, mediocre gun, and extremely expensive to produce.
German tanks kinda sucked, tbh, but armchair generals don't tend to look any deeper than armour thickness or theoretical penetrating power of the main gun.
