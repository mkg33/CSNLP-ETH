This entire conflict is disgusting.
Violent terrorists on any side of anything are disgusting.
The violence is outrageous and inhumane.
Evil.
Fucking surreal.
Anyone who would ever inflict this type of violence upon another human being for any reason should never have been born to begin with.
You are evil incarnate.
How can continued terrorism and violence possibly be the answer?
Where is your fucking brain?
How is this type of thing helping anything or anybody?
Why do people turn into monsters and do these horrendous things to other human beings?
Other human beings who carry the same value and worth as every single other human being on Earth, regardless of political, religious, or racial differences.
Who gave you the green light to play god?
Absolutely surreal.
Brutal.
Ugly.
Horrific.
Sad and senseless.
The only positive about this is that there is one less piece of scum terrorist on Earth polluting our civilization.
“Apartheid”.
So, again, what you’re saying is that Israel doesn’t want people that want their country “wiped off the map”, living in said country.
Do me a favor, THINK about wtf you’re saying.
