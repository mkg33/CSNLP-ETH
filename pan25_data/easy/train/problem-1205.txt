Given Trump's attitude towards his children it is not only plausible, but extremely likely, that a significant number of people did more to raise them than he did.
If Walker claims to be one such, sure, why not?
I have heard no information to the contrary, which makes it one of his most credible campaign statements.
It raises questions, of course, such as why he wasn't raising his own children instead and what he means by intelligence, but the basic claim on its own is believable.
He absolutely could have been a less shitty father - to Trump's children - than Trump.
What a world.
Multiple degrees in psych and behavior science here - Dissociative Identity Disorder is definitely a real condition.
But it’s also a popular condition that liars and grifters like to use to manipulate people.
They usually use a concept of DID present in popular culture/Hollywood that’s not correct, rather than the actual manifestation(s) of the condition.
(This isn’t a commentary on Walker.
I’ve never read his book and don’t know much about him at all - I’m just giving more info.
