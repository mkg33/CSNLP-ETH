So I've been keeping a close eye on the races.
Both CA 13 and AZ 6 were favored to go red but are now >1%.
In Arizona all remaining red counties are tiny with 95% counted but Pima is only 82% counted, is a much larger county, and is currently +8 dem.
I think we will flip that one.
CA 13 is my district and it is SO close.
Dems are trailing by only 85 votes.
We went blue in 2016 and 2020 but midterms do tend to go red so we'll see but looking at the counties it for sure looks doable.
If we flip those two and all else stays as it is predicted to be we will get exactly 218 in the senate house.

Exactly.
And several of those members giving them that majority are in very hazardous districts where they won by the skin of their teeth here.
Theyâ€™ll be very antsy about their futures.
Public Safety Employee-Employer Cooperation Act - federal protection of collective bargaining for public safety workers.
Still get judges with the Senate though.
And the GOP majority in the House, should they in fact get it, will be razor thin and therefore prone to infighting.
