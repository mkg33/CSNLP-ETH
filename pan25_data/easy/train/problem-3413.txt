It depends on what we're talking about.
Jets have a u shaped curve to cost for example.
They start off expensive, drop in cost per unit as economies of scale kick in, and as they age they become increasingly expensive to maintain.
At a certain point it's more affordable to buy new platforms, and you can't upgrade old air frames/platforms forever for a few reasons.
And yeah, in general new tech (especially cutting edge tech) is expensive.
Completely agree.
The Trump administration was strangely intent on damaging the US through whatever means necessary, internally and on the world stage.
Shitting on allies, courting adversaries, cutting aid to Ukraine through blackmail, inflaming every domestic racial and social tension, cutting any beneficial programs, and funding wasteful pointless ones.
Most appointments he made had previously stated intentions to dismantle the very institutions they were appointed to.
Crazy that people still doubt he was a Russian plant when he was working off as them.
