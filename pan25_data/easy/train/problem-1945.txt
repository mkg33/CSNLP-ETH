That’s what I hate about the argument we’re just giving Ukraine a $40 billion+ blank check.
We’re not.
We’re either buying everything on behalf of Ukraine from American weapons manufacturers (hello American jobs and Lockheed stock prices), or European countries donating old jets and tanks and we buy new American weapons for our existing nato allies.
I honestly don’t think Ukraine is getting any actual cash, and if they are, it’s very little.
As in just to pay their soldiers and stabilize their central bank.
We give pallets of cash to corrupt shitholes were warlords and dictators and no one bats an eye.
Exactly.
This guy, among others, couldn’t possibly think anyone takes them seriously.
I mean sure, we have to at least hear it because….we’ll, it is Russian so I wouldn’t be surprised if they tried doing something this stupid.
But at the same time…..it’s just comical.
Absolutely.
I spent most of my teenage and young adult years cursing the military industrial complex......But in times like these we have the luxury of saying F around and find out and I am grateful for that.
