The initial impetus behind the process is that if enough grassroots energy is created around a proposed law, signatures will be gathered and people will have a voice, but because the rich have to destroy everything in this country, that's not effectively how it plays out.
So, yes, the state questioning some of the referendum laws that have been proposed is a very good idea.
The way the initiative and referendum laws work here in CA are supposedly to let the people have a say in what laws are passed.
Sounds great, right?
Except the process has been co-opted by rich special interests that have the money to pay people to stand on street corners collecting signatures about ANYTHING.
If you throw enough money behind it, enough signatures can be gathered to show support for pretty much any old thing you want.
People don't really read the petitions they sign, they just often think they are helping out the worker who's standing on the corner collecting their John Hancock.
