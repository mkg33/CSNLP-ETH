i visited russia for two weeks with a bus of classmates about three years ago.
we had to go through like 3 border checks, and every time we would all get out of the bus and go through customs inside the building with our passports while the bus was searched and sent through to pick us up on the other side.
on the last border check, i got inside the customs building and realized i had left my passport on the bus.
i couldn’t get our guide’s attention and most of the other students had gone through.
so i went outside hoping to catch the bus before it went to the other side but unfortunately i was too late.
i didn’t see any option other than slowly inching towards the bus hoping someone would stop me so i could ask for help getting it from the bus/getting my guide’s attention.
however i was scared shitless when three heavily armed guards came running at me yelling in russian.
i just put my hands up and word vomited that i just needed my passport from the bus on the other side.
took some tense time to get my message across but they ended up getting my guide to get it for me.
not totally related to your comment but i wanted to share lol.
The people drafted and killed/injured/missing are already massively hurting the russian economy.
They already have a very very low birth rate and their population was declining BEFORE they started sending most of their young men to die.
