Our system is already set up to over-criminalize black folks.
Our society already treats all sorts of things poor people do as crimes in ways it doesnâ€™t for the wealth.
And race in the US is tightly correlated to wealth inequality.
And black neighborhoods are already super over policed.
And black suspects are already much more likely to be taken to trial than white suspects.
And racist cops (aka most cops) are already more likely to stop and frisk black citizens just walking around.
And they are more likely to pull over black drivers.
Etc etc etc.
None of that justifies under reporting though.
Once people are aware of over-reporting they can do something about it and push for change.
However, if Fox and the rest of the right wing media eco-system pick up on the fact that a few Democratic areas skew it the other way, they can wave it off as 'both sides pull this trick, it doesn't matter'.
To be correct we need to be honest.
It's better for everyone to tell the truth and it helps insulates you from an attack like that.
