Again, it's not an inanimate "government", it's not putin's clones doing it, it's russians doing it.
And you being a coward doesn't justify cowardice of others.
Iranians didn't get the memo apparently.
It’s not so simple huh?
Either they compete under no nation (which the IOC is proposing) or they’re granted citizenship / something of the sort by another nation, and for that country to kick their own athletes out instead.
So you want Australian, Ukrainian, Danish etc athletes to not be able to compete if IOC allows athletes with a nationality of Russian to compete without a flag or anthem?
Ukraine and some other countries are saying either don’t let athletes of Russian nationality compete (even under no flag or anthem) or we won’t let our athletes compete.
And let’s say the IOC decides not to ban all Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing.
Then the Ukrainian athletes are forced by their government to not compete.
Training for years just to not be allowed to compete.
The athletes on both sides are going through a similar thing in respect to competing in the Olympics.
