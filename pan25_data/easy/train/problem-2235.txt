By restricting access to western insurance, finance and maritime services, they can enforce compliance with the oil price cap since most insurers offering these services are based in the west.
Ooooh.

Hmmmm.
What did they do for a couple thousand years before electricity and the use of petroleum products for energy?

Ok, and India is a developing country that desperately needs to develop its’ economy in order to provide citizens basic necessities which are taken for granted in Europe such as toilets, electricity, and nutritious food, so the cost of them giving up an economic opportunity is much greater than for the extremely rich EU (in comparison).
I’m sure there’s many more arguments to justify or criticize the EU’s disapproval of India purchasing Russian oil while it continues to buy Russian gas.
No two countries (or intergovernmental organizations) will ever be in perfectly comparable circumstances but in the grand scheme of things this just screams “rules for thee and not for me”.
