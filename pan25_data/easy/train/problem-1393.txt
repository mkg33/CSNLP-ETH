It isn’t about democrats taking up the responsibility.
And why should protecting basic fundamentals of this country, freedoms and norms ALWAYS be on the shoulders of democrats.
It is seriously annoying.
The state is gerrymandered enough that these people cannot likely be voted out, unless their own party chooses someone else.
DeSantis is the moron that these people have increasingly put in charge of their lives.
This is the government that the majority of the state wants.
Florida schools are garbage as it is, so remove AP altogether and allow those students to have worse outcomes than their peers across the country.
They won’t be able to compete on the upper end and they can then compete directly with those “illegals” that their parents keep complaining about, for manual labor jobs that they are also under qualified for.
Got it.
You are not in Fl.
Glad you see the danger of this guy.
Keep spreading the word, he’s built an army down here and has corrupted the courts and state congress.
He gets to the Oval Office.
Nothing will stop him with the corrupted Supreme Court Trump seated.
