Only if the house cat is scared of humans from being abused by them, it has not been my experience after petting and playing with hundreds of cats in my life.
Out of hundreds of house cats in my life ive never met one before that attacks you without any provocation at all.
Nor did I hear of anybody in my life that has been put into the hospital by them, even though house cats are very common here.
