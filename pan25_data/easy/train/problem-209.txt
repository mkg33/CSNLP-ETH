What people don’t realize is just how much his dad set him up for success.
His dad, Don Gaetz, was a FL state senator for 10 years.
Before that, he was the superintendent in Okaloosa county.
As a superintendent, he took Okaloosa county from 27th to 1st in the state in education.
This earned him the ability to chair the state senate education committee as a first term senator.
In this time, he sent letters with his name in big bold letters across the top every year to each child that scored a satisfactory score on any of the standardized tests in the state.
Character assassination is our politics now.
Fight on that field or die upholding an abstract code.
When they go low, stomp on them.
Dick Carlson is internationally politically powerful, and he is very successful financially.
Dick’s beliefs have rewarded him all of his life.
He doesn’t believe it’s the luck of the draw.
It’s his righteousness that makes him rich and powerful.
Dick and Tucker are spreading their righteousness through media.
And it’s working.
