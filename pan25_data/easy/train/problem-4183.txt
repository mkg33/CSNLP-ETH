I have theory and hear me out… during the time when Kanye started spewing out his antisemitic garbage publicly, Trump coincidentally posted about disloyal American Jewry... again.
I wouldn’t put it past him if this was all a tactical effort to enact revenge on a part of the population in this country that overwhelmingly rejected him compared to other religious groups.
Jews have always been a vital voting block that rallies against conservatives in this country and how curious that he had dinner with these two clowns and then opened the flood gates of anti-Jewish hatred again.
I feel like this was on purpose… I feel like this was trumps revenge against American Jews, a group he has singled out for many years as disloyal and we all know how much “loyalty” is important to the orange clown.
Exactly.
All these disloyal jews, look at all this we are doing for them, so ungrateful.
You can't trust them.
They are not part of us, but they have all the money and power and influence.
It's not fair.
