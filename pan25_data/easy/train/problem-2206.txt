Also Žemaitaitis is a very shitty politician over here.
Populist, has made some pro russian remarks, vocally questioning legit charities/initiatives and all around a fucking parasite .
I agree.
Personally i try to fight this whenever i see this online.
But I think its in big part foreign stans who overlook Lithuania.
Polish youth (at least youth i grew up amongst) was very conscious about commonwealth being a union and the fact that it wasnt Poland on its own but Poland and Lituania was considered to be the "cool factor".
I mean Dillon and Dutch handshake in "predator" kind of cool.
Industrialization and manufacturing still win wars.
It’s exactly what we saw with SpaceX and the Boeing/Lockheed partnership.
For decades we operated under the assumption that space was fundamentally hard and that we needed these bloated contracts to operate.
Then Elon Musk and SpaceX came around and absolutely crushed the old school players in the market.
Every other space company is obsolete because of what Falcon 9 can do in terms of cost and reliability.
Even the next generation vehicles like SLS are basically dead on arrival due to program costs.
It’s absolutely insane the stagnation that industry caused in the space business.
