A week?
I live in Chicago but work in the burbs so I always gas up by work to avoid Chicago tax.
It went from $2.99 to $3.59 overnight in the burbs.
It went from $3.59 in the city to over $4.
Disgraceful.
After nut-cases like Trump, Bobo, MTG, Gaetz, Lake & Santos I will never, ever vote for a single Republican again.
I used to vote Republican, almost straight ticket.
But never again.
If I don't like the Dem I've been voting third party.
The GOP has turned into a circus of reality tv scripted clowns, attention-seeking whiners, nutty white Christian Nationalists & outright Nazis, whack-jobs repeating conspiracy theories, and a mainstay of corrupt & corporate-owned amoral degenerates regurgitating childish talking points and voting for whatever they are paid to do.
(The Dems have a large portion of this last group too).
Republicans have lost me for life, and I know I'm not the only one.
Never again!
