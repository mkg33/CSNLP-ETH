Oh, we need the paper Everybody loves the paper But sometimes there's two or three papers in there and ya gotta... so I wrote 'get a better job' for the tip And the waitress came over, a big, strong waitress, with tears in her eyes, and you know what she said, she said 'I just want to thank you, Mr. President, for saving my life, I never thought about doing that', can you believe that, people?
She didn't know that she could just get a new job until I told her.
