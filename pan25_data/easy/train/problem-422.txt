Cancer is a race to see what dies first, the patient or cancer.
Your description is apt and I have to hope that in the future we will look at how we treated cancer today and call it barbaric as you said.
Although this is the best we have today, it just feels miserable and even if you win, it might be a pyrrhic victory.
Hopefully, you are doing much better today.
Someone posted a series of things that seem like it has merit on a thread like this, but: it was a combination of hoping Zelenskyy wouldn’t win and his puppet regime wouldn’t get ousted so he could play the long game, followed by logistical issues for prepping the invasion due to COVID, as well as issues that caused the new pipeline projects for Russia to Germany and others to become defunct, to him basically running out of long-game options (Trump losing meant he couldn’t bide more time) and having to play the hand he had - and he decided to do it in the midst of the worst economic setback in history with his plan hinging on that Ukraine supporters would be too broke to properly back Ukraine’s forces, and also counting on the rebels to do most of the work while indirectly supporting them.
