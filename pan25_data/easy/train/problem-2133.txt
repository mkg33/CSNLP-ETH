It was a way to cut off the gas to Europe without being in breach of contract as a supplier.
They had already sabotaged Nord1 a few weeks before the explosion, saying a German-supplied part was damaged and they needed a replacement sourced in Canada that (presumably) couldn't be released due to sanctions.
They turned if off citing the repair work.
Germany managed to procure the part and offered to send technicians to help them fix it.
Russia refused to have it delivered.
Then the explosions occurred.
The companies apparently have all the data archived, and the satellites almost certainly cover the entire Baltic Sea as well as the world to the extent of their orbital inclination, so it should be very possible to backtrack and forward track those two ship's courses over several days, especially forward.
Good point.
In this case I’m wondering if there was a tone sent to trigger that.
I do know of underwater sensors that can pick up sounds from many many kilometers away.
So if that’s what happened then I guess that would be easily found out.
Thanks for that info.
