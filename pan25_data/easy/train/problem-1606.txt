It’s almost like using tough on crime rhetoric for the last thirty/forty years has primed democratic voters to believe republican talking points so that when you have to choose between tough on crime candidates these voters will always choose the one who is tougher, which will always be a republican.
Instead of spending years educating voters on what we know (more police does not mean lower crime, higher rates of use of force by police directly correlates to higher rates of crime, and crime isn’t reduced by strenhening the justice system but rather addressing the conditions that led people to commit crimes in the first place), you spent year after year legitimatizing the bullshit talking points that helps the GOP win.
Well that sucks.
I'm in central IL, and we know about 'the devil you know' here.
The Blagoivich scandal eventually led to a GOP governor and senator here.
In 2010 my district was drawn to lean blue but went red.
I've literally never had a Dem rep, but will in 2023.
Shit happens.
Hopefully NY gets their shit together.
