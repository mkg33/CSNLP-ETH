Haha Michigan here.
This was a topic of conversation just this morning in our office.
A co worker genuinely told someone this being nice, and was horrified when we told her to not say that if she ever went down south.
She was very concerned that she messed up.
North Korea hasn't invaded anyone.
Their military budget is lower than South Korea's.
The country has shown no intention of aggressive military action.
The missiles are paper tigers meant to show that this tiny country with outdated military equipment can at least fight back against the next attempt to kill off one-fifth of its population.
Obviously, a country as small as North Korea is going to be threatened when regional powers with ties to NATO militarizes given its history.
North Korea doesn't talk about forcibly reunifying their neighbors, how could they with the smallest military in the region?
North Korea isn't building up their military, so how could it have an offensive build-up?
You minimize the threat of the US, but why?
It is the most militarily aggressive country on Earth—it has the largest military-industrial complex in history, is the most frequent military aggressor on the planet, has a history of occupying the Korean peninsula, and has literally genocided North Korea's population, killing one-fifth of its population with carpet bombing and chemical warfare.
You would talk about Nuclear capacity, in full awareness of the irony that the nuclear powers in the region—including the only country to use nuclear warheads on another country—have this capacity while North Korea has only been speculated to do so?
