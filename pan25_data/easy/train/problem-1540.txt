The funding is excessive and pleases the military industrial complex, but this is more than a border dispute or even about the Donbas or Crimea, it’s about the whole of Ukraine and has been since the very first week it started in February.
You got selective amnesia or something?
The Russians went straight for Kyiv, battling in its suburbs.
and tried to assassinate Zelenskyy multiple times.
They even took over Chernobyl at one point, have since seized the entire Azov Sea, and this latest incident was about an air strike on Lviv near the border with Poland, our NATO ally.
If anyone is being the imperialist aggressor here it is Russia, and in the old school Czarist sense when they took over Ukraine in the 18th century and tried to wipe out its national identity even then.

Isn’t the investigation still ongoing?
I’m with you tho I highly suspect it was an Ukrainian missile, however I question why a soviet era rocket was used.
Was Ukraine not given newer military equipment, also how does an old Soviet era missile even work in newer air defense system?
These are questions I’m curious about.
(I have no real knowledge on military equipment so I might be asking dumb questions).
