Reminds me of the time I had my brother in a choke hold, after our feud had finally come to a head.
He's flailing around and struggling and he's definitely lost the fight, but he starts shouting "don't make me do it Don't make me do it" For like a minute straight until I finally ask him, "do what?"
And he be all like, "don't make me gouge your eyes out!
".
Russia needs to mobilize so that another million highly educated and productive Russian citizens can go other places to strenhen their economies before this happens.
I should be easy enough to do for a while.
Just keep sending your troops to their death, release press statements threatening nuclear armageddon every other day and randomly assassinate your your people.
Nobody should notice anything for a while at least.
Putin once had a reputation as a masterful geopolitical strategist.
But he has never had the reputation of someone who can competently govern, especially when it comes to fostering economic growth.
Blame, threats, corruption, and assassination of those who disagree with him are his tools.
Russia is not being governed.
It is being swindled and blinded while the state force feeds propaganda into homes telling people to blame the United States, LGBT, and Europe for their problems.
