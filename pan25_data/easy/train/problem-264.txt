I just hate how little they actually think it through.
They seem to think real life is an action movie where a bad guy pulls out a gun and the hero sees this, pulls out their gun and takes out the shooter saving the day.
In reality we see what actually happens.
Someone pulls a gun and shoots, someone else pulls their gun to shoot back.
Now people see 2 people with a gun, no idea who was the original shooter and chaos ensues.
Now if you followed the gun nut logic you have 10 "good guys" pulling out guns, all confused about who is the danger, potentially shooting at each other.
We already have examples of cops shooting the "good guys" in the confusion because public shootings are extremely chaotic and people don't have real time footage of what happened like we do after the events.
Also most importantly, bullets don't just magically hit the intended target and stop.
If you shoot at someone and miss that bullet is still going to travel and potentially hit a bystander, even if you do shoot someone that bullet can go through them and hit someone else.
"Vulnerable minorities?"
Maybe deal with the racism/sexism/homophobia so those demographic doesnt feel the need to protect themselves.
