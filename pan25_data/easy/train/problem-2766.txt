The only reason NATO accepted Turkey into its ranks is because they served a strategic geographic role in being the only pro-West country (at the time) to have a geographic border with Russia.
For Turkey, the reason (at the time) they submitted their bid to join NATO was because they were under threat of Soviet invasion.
The West graced them will full membership instead of "defensive cooperation" was because they supplied troops to fight with the West during the Korean War, and again, served strategic geographic importance.
The U.S. would go on to house their nukes in Turkey to keep pointed right at Moscow.
How hilarious.
The one nation in NATO that never met the qualifications for NATO membership is telling others they aren't qualified.
Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
What a fucking trip.
