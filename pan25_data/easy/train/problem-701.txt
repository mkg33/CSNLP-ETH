It could be accurate, but it assumes an awfully high level of morale for these Russian troops, to actually stand and fight to the last man like that.
Not seeing it.
Unfortunately, that won't come without heavy losses for the Ukrainian as well, so it will always be a shitty deal... it's probably one of the worst decision someone will have to take... Kherson is really important strategic-wise it seems, but with the amount of man and firepower the Russians we're probably able to gather in the south side of the Dnipro, and taking into consideration that it looks like population was mostly evacuated, why not let them sit there and try to press on the direction of Mariupol and then Southwards along the reservoir until they would be able to pressure that zone on both side?
Nah.
Russians are trying to do what Chechens did to them in 1995.
Lure into the city, surround and destroy.
Casualties include injuries.
If you charge a room there's a good chance everyone gets shot, but if you're wearing armor and he's wearing his sister's tampons...who's getting out alive?
