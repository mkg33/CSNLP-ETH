This is the correct reason.
C'mon guys, history shows us that after the first failed putsch they don't just give up.
They're going to try again and now one of their insane Q-anon leaders is on the House Committee on Homeland Security for fucks sake.
She's going to get all the information she reliably can about possible locations to attack with her insane fellow insurrectionists, someone much smarter than her will pick a target and plan an attack on it that's sure to go much better than Jan 6th because they'll have laid out plans and will have people in the places they need to be for their attack to succeed instead of just relying on the mob to do what they want for them.
I certainly hope the FBI, DHS (I know, I know) and whatever other agency is keeping an eye on her and who she's in contact with, especially looking out for classified materials she might leak to her coconspirators.
Moderate republicans don't exist anymore.
They've filtered them all out of the party so that only Trump loyalists are left.
This is the hole they've dug themselves into.
