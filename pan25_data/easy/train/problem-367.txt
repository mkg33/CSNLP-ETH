I was in Vegas on the strip this summer on vacation, and just walking around I witnessed two crimes in the middle of the day around noon.
One lady had her purse snatched, and a homeless guy dressed as a clown was assaulted by a black tourist passing by who just didn't like him for some reason.
Police were no where to be found, never saw them at all on the strip.
I know this is just a personal anecdote, but if the strip is this unsafe during the day I can only imagine how bad it is at night.
I went to my hotel room after 9 PM.
Then these voters should vote Democrat because they will enact sensible gun legislation, serious background checks and enable municipalities to designate gun free zones like schools, playgrounds, sporting events, concerts, etc.
Don't bother.
The Republicans are rural dominant, and have thus evolved a strategy of blaming the inevitably blue cities for high crime rates in red states.
On one hand, it's correct that Democrat cities have high crime.....because cities always have higher crime, and Dems almost always control cities.
Lies, damned lies, and statistics.
