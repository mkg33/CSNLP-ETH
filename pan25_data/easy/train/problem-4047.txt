It's possible that the US military has infiltrated the Chinese nuclear apparatus to such a degree that we have the location of every Chinese nuke, but not particularly likely, given that the PRC has devoted so much effort to keeping that particular information secret.
For what?
Nukes?
This stupid war has proven Russia’s military is awful.
The nuke threat is all they’ve got and it’s guaranteed mutual obliteration.
Russia needs to cut its losses.
It's not delusion, it's deliberate misinformation.
Putin knows exactly what he's doing, he just doesn't care.
As long as he keeps up his own Big Lie, he stays ahead of the headmans axe.
In a limited counterforce nuclear or sub-nuclear exchange, Russia’s military would get annihilated.
We probably don't have that info now.
China goes to great lenhs to conceal the locations of all their nukes, transporting them between silos via a network of highly restricted tunnels known as the "Underground Great Wall of China" and storing them in underground bunkers designed to withstand nuclear strikes.
It's the foundation of their second strike policy, designed to make it as difficult as possible to do exactly what you describe without getting nuked back.
