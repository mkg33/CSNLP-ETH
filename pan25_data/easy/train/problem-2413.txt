Conservatives in deeply red states have repeatedly defended child marriage under the truly disgusting argument that a child married to an adult is less likely to get an abortion, and that it's less "shameful" to the family to have a child pregnant out of wedlock, even if it's a result of grooming/pedophilia.
In essence, it's arguing that if an adult rapes a child and gets them pregnant, it's better (in the mind of republicans) to force them into marrying their rapist then it is to be shamed for having a pregnant child.
Truly sickening stuff.
From Article:"Currently, Wyoming is one of just eight states in the country—including California, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Washinon and West Virginia—without a minimum age requirement for marriage...".
Me?
Not at all.
I'm more stating that humans arent fully developed until like 25.
They're not really mentally able(generally speaking, specifics may vary to be clear) to care for children earlier than that.
It's not a failing of our education system, it's just biology.
