Ah okay, you're just not familiar about the election.
Makes sense.
Maloney has always been in a toss-up district, very close to EVEN, leaning a little towards D or R in the Cook PVI depending on the year.
Cook, Politico, RCP, Inside Elections, and FOX all rated this race as a toss-up.
"Robert Zimmerman has extensive experience in national and international media relations, branding communications and crisis management.
He has compiled an extensive background in government and community service.
Zimmerman oversees all of the agency’s public relations, crisis management and branding communications activities, while personally leading account teams servicing some of the firm’s largest clients.
".
Republicans successfully overturned precedent despite a majority being against it and democrats being fully aware they were going to do it and you think that isn’t a prime example of terrible ideas but successful execution?
Lmao see what I mean?
Before the election, results in the House were predicted to be catastrophic across the country.
Now because of Maloney's historic performance, all you can complain about is a region, not the country.
I guess Maloney would have had to win 435 seats to have his performance recognized.
