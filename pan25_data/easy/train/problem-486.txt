“Among those detained and indicted by a federal grand jury in South Florida on Tuesday were Antonio Intriago, a Venezuelan American, and Arcángel Pretel Ortiz, a Colombian living in the United States, the owners of a U.S. security company who prosecutors say organized the plot to murder the former Haitian leader.”.
This is basically it.
I fully believe the CIA would hire assassins to do a regime change mainly cause they have before.
I just dont think they hired these assassins to do this regime change.
The group is bizarre as you mentioned and the fuck would the US want with Haiti anyways when its most plentiful resource is trouble.
These morons were trying to pull a Hawaii but forgot that the overthrow of Hawaii wasnt very popular with the US government either and got accepted because of a strategic value element that Haiti being right off our coasts anyways does not have.
“Mr.
Moïse, 53, died after being shot 12 times when a team of Spanish-speaking commandos stormed his home outside the Haitian capital in July 2021.
Prosecutors say the plot to overthrow and ultimately kill him was hatched in South Florida by businessmen who hoped to reap lucrative contracts under a new administration.”.
True.
But poor countries worth invading for economic reasons generally have easily-exploited natural resources or incredibly valuable locations or something like that.
Haiti's natural resources are all hard to get to and would require massive investment to profitably exploit.
Cheap labor is abundantly available in more stable countries.
