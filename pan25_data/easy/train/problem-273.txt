The Ranaghans had seven kids and at the time (1996) also hosted three other people who were in college and underway.
One of those underway members was Jesse Barrett who Amy would go on to marry.
Another of those underway members was someone named John Timler who would go on to marry Amy's sister, Eileen Coney ().
Dorothy Ranaghan would have assigned tasks for household members to do, and they would likely have had dinners together as if they were part of one big family.
There would be a special focus on Saturday dinners called "The Lord's day meal".
Beliefs wouldn't be taught as a college lecture, but instead they'd be brought up in dinner conversations and by the example set in the household.
Then underway members would attend monthly retreats and weekly group meetings where practices and beliefs would be more specific.
Exactly.
Coney-Barrett was appointed to take rights away from women and minorities.
There's no way she will recuse herself from any case that gives her an opportunity to walk the US back to a pre-civil rights movement social order.
