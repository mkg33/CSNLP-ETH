Mixing up tons and kgs is really easy mistake to happen, I'm sure I've mixed them up in the past, saying something like average car weights 1500 tons, because I in my head initially think of how much it is in KG, but when I finally say it I say tons because it feels more appropriate to describe something heavy with tons.
Bro.
You think we’ve been buying $500 hammers by the truckload for the last 30 years just to let Russia get a nuke off the ground?
Always remember that the shit you see is what you’re allowed to see.
We’ve been doing mystery missions in space, and I don’t think they’re science missions.
While Russia was reeling from losing the Cold War, the U.S. economy was roaring ahead full throttle and compared to Russia, has never stopped.
Russia is so fucking far behind us when it comes to military weapons and technology, it’s unbelievable.
If they fuck around, they’re gonna find out, and I really hope they don’t because the Russian people will ultimately be the ones to pay for Putin’s misstep.
They need to surgically remove him and his gang before shit gets to that point.
