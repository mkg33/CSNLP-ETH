The whole f35 R&D and procurement of just under 2500 planes is going to cost the US 412 billion dollars (in today's money), with 1.3 trillion in operating costs until 2070.
This requirement is totally irrelevant.
F-16s have operated for decades over open water and in the artic without issue.
The requirement was based off the F-104, which is nearly 70 years old now.
Ask r/canadianforces how woefully inept, undermanned, underequipped, and underfunded the Canadian military is.
Even with this purchase, far from a "world power".
- probably also more people in command/coordination positions due to the F35's specific capabilities.
There's not much point.
Russia will never meaningfully produce the SU-57 and China gave the entire world a good view of how much of a wet dog the J-20 is while trying to intimidate Taiwan last year.
There's nothing to contest the F-22 in the air as is, and it doesn't have a ground attack role.
Much more sensible to look forward.
Sure, having dedicated interceptors/dogfighters, separate dedicated ground attack aircraft, and an AWACS coordinating them all could theoretically be more effective.
But the military isn't big enough for multiple specialized aircraft.
