The whole mercenary, "war for profits for the stakeholders," "genocide and war crimes pay more," thing is just way too close to dystopian fiction for me to feel anything but uncomfortable as hell that we, in America, have a significant portion of our politicians on the side of the imperialist agressor invading his neighbor whose whole strategy is to commit war crimes against the people of Ukraine, murdering civilians and making survivors suffer as much as possible.

He’s very controversial.
It’s more baffling that such an awful country as USSR under Stalin still managed to pick the right side of history.
A lot of people say Putin is trying to be Stalin.
Problem is, Stalin wasn’t trying to be anyone.

Putin is Stalin from AliExpress.
He talks a lot of shit and can’t back any of it up because Russia under Putin is not as totalitarian.
And if Stalin worked for his ideology, Putin is just another bandit from the 90s and all they value is cash.
Obviously.
I knew robbery and murder got you in there.
But like, you wouldn't go to a concentration camp for a speeding ticket, I figured poaching was more along the lines of that.
