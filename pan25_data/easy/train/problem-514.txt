A weapon specifically designed for export that can shoot down drones?
Sure Ukraine has a need, but how many sales can they get from that after this war ends?
Who's the next we equip with weapons that has an enemy sending drones at them?
If you mean a cost effective way for our own militaries to take down drones, then they already are.
The US army is going all in on laser technology.
a 50 kwatt laser slapped on the top of a Stryker vehicle, it can get to an area to protect it quickly enough against drones weighing anywhere between 1 and 1,000 pounds.
It can also target artillery and mortar rounds.
I don't see them wanting to share new technology like this anytime soon.
Inertial navigation involves differentiating a noisy signal to determine orientation, then using that to subtract a huge acceleration offset due to gravity, then differentiating that twice to go from acceleration to velocity to position.
Even the tiniest drift or noise in those sensors will make the answer diverge from reality extremely fast.
The MEMS sensors in phones will diverge in seconds.
US ITAR classifies sensors with sufficiently low noise and drift to be useful as weapons, you can't export them.
