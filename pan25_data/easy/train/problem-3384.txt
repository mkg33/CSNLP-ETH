Let me make this as perfectly clear as possible - The claim being made is that the US schools should stop teaching children about the HISTORICALLY ACCURATE FACT that America's territories were taken forcibly from Native American tribes through a combination of genocide, forced cultural assimilation, and broken treaties.

ALL of those settlements on the land granted by broken treaties are EXPLICITLY stolen lands.
Ergo, we UNEQUIVOCALLY were founded on stolen lands.
There isn't a big gray area here unless you're trying to ignore historical injustices.
