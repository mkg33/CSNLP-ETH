It was actually a strategy by the Russians in WWII.
They had not sufficiently ramped up their military industrial complex prior to Hitler invading - so many "soldiers" in second waves of attacks were not sufficiently armed and were instructed to pick up the weapons of their fallen comrades.
Not really.
They try to draft people who don't protest, and cities protest the most, whereas rural area do the least.
Buryatia is more rural and army there was always the way to get money and to climb up the social ladder, they got higher draft numbers.
Once initial news of deaths came out, protests began, they started to draft less.
Whereas Tatarstan was always openly oppositional republic which got lower draft quota.
Makes me wonder.
I make beats and was in contact with a Russian guy almost daily about making music.
We weren’t super close or anything but about two weeks before the war he stopped texting and just stopped posting music altogether.
Thought he might have been taking a break, tried to contact him about the war and his thoughts (he seemed very liberal and against Putin).
I just hope home boi ain’t in a ditch somewhere, he had some good tunes too…….
