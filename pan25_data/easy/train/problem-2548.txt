I used to have a script for that back when shitty doctors thought I had super adhd (I'm bipolar/schizophrenic).
That did NOT end well.
Blew through the script in a week and was in a mental crisis center 2 days after that hallucinating that the gov't kidnapped me to steal my "amazing inventions".
I've never invented a thing in my life lol.
It really does, if you pick the country where I live for example (Brazil), areas with a lot of conflicts, deaths and killings are usually where drug factions are competing for territory and market with each other, states where one is the dominant one have less violence proportionally, now, monopoly is not good for the consumer in the end, especially when it's done by the government itself but we are dealing with illicit business here so at least, not competition means less war between cartels or drug factions.
Lol, what?
Do you seriously believe dismantling a drug cartel is a quick task?
This type of operation takes years.
No major organised crime groups are ‘secret’, the question is how you effectively stop them and make charges stick.
The authorities don’t just randomly wake up one day and decide to kick in some doors.
