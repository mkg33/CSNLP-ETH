Well, you got a couple of options: Ask Russians that live outside Russia that admit that life is better where they are than back home, that Russians need to stop stealing from one another as a fact of life, who donâ€™t automatically try to figure out how to screw over everyone else, and that believes that what Putin is doing is wrong and needs to be stopped and learn from them how they escaped the mentality.
Jokes on you.
That bitcoin post where I was asking if I should get in 5 years ago you're referring to....I did.

GG.
As a software developer and a server administrator I can virtually guarantee you that nearly every public facing IP address is the target of Russian- originating sniffers on an almost daily basis.
China too.
I have no plans to help the Russian people, societies change from the inside; outside influences can help but ultimately unless it overwhelmingly comes from the people within, any external pressures will most likely only work while being applied, assuming they work at all.
