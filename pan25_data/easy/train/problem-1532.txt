They did not.
They spent 3 years bolstering testing and surveillance capacities on the assumption that Covid could be eliminated.
Almost zero preparation for a mass infection scenario.
There’s a few reasons.
For starters, during the Chinese civil war, Mao’s communists managed to win on the mainland, however Chiang Kai-shek’s nationalist government escaped to Taiwan.
The communists tried and failed to invade, and the Nationalist Republic of China has continued to exist their to this day, so to the CCP they’re a loose end.
That alone might not be enough to make them so hostile, however, the island has a massive amount of strategic value.
For starters, it’s basically the centerpiece of the “First Island Chain,” essentially the US’s geopolitical containment strategy to contain potential Chinese aggression, as the name suggests it’s a chain of island nations and territories partnered with the US against China stretching from Japan to Malaysia, all of which can act as platforms to place weapons and aircraft to contain the Chinese navy in the event of a war.
Second, Taiwan intentionally made itself even more strategically valuable by becoming the world’s premier producer of advanced computer chips, to the point that total control of the island and its industry by either side would be a crippling blow to the other.
