Every time there is a major data breach the media spins up to speed and talks primarily about the hackers, we get it they are criminals.
Itâ€™s a gaslight.
you expect the media, heavily embeded into a corporate-focussed society to be critical of corporate culture?
of capitalism's reckless abusive tendencies?
that might push people to want a system that puts people first, not profits for billionaires.
you can't have that.
I like the idea of a statutory fine of $1000 per person whose medical information is leaked charged to any company which leaked it or is hacked, with $500 per person being paid to anyone doing the hacking (along with immunity), so long as there's no damage or service interruption and the hackers are not associated with the company or anyone who's worked there in the last year, the hack was due to security which is less than standard for the industry (like a default password on a router or an unlocked door to a server room etc), and any leaked data is turned over to the enforcement agency without being released to the public.
