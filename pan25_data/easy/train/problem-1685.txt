Unfortunately, it's because we have one decent sized metro area that is Omaha and Lincoln.
Everything else is small towns and rural land.
Since we've got so much rural land, the people in these areas tend to have satellite tv and either satellite or mobile hotspot internet.
The ultimate problem with satellite tv is that both DirecTV and Dish have Fox News in their basic packages and that has poisoned our entire rural population.
Until the last five years or so, rural internet was relegated to being data-capped satellite internet or barely faster than dial-up, so most of our population had very limited and biased access to information.
How brave of you.
“I have no sympathy for people suffering from gerrymandering, political propaganda, and republicans in charge changing rules to maintain power”.
Really showing the little man!
Colorado here.
When I see a license plate from a neighboring red state up here around Denver I figure they’re either buying weed or getting an abortion.
So much freedom in them red states!
