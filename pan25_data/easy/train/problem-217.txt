The further right wing they get, the more pro-Russian and anti-western they become.
Conspiracy forums (all basically taken over by the alt-right) are all in now on the idea that the West is an immoral and degenerate empire allowing LGBTQ and transgender “groomers” to indoctrinate children, exploit them sexually and eliminate traditional notions of gender identity completely.
All of this being led by a cabal of high ranking world and business leaders through a network of shady orgs, secret societies and international bodies of various kinds, with overtones or direct assertions of nefarious Jewish/Semitic involvement.
To that extent they’re very much pro-Russia, as Russia has been the main driver of this propaganda for quite some time now and holds themselves out as the main (or only) defender against the West’s perceived threat/influence.
American Senators, all Republicans.
In the middle of an unprecedented campaign of foreign interference (by Russia) on social media that uniquely benefited Republicans.
And those American Senator traitors went to Russia to meet with Putin to thank him.
Not 1 of them told him to stop.
They should be prosecuted and locked up.
