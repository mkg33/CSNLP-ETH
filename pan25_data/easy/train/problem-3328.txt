It took decades (and the advent of genetic genealogy) to sort out what had happened.
The deceased man had been born Robert Nichols, who at 18 had been inducted into the Navy and posted to a ship that was subsequently attacked by kamikazes.
He returned home after the war and slowly developed severe mental illnesses; he apparently abused and soon abandoned his family, basically went missing for years, and eventually ended up living a bizarre life culminating in identity theft and decades of behaviour that in hindsight marked him as a victim of severe PTSD.
(His suicide was likely related to a terminal diagnosis he'd just received.
).
