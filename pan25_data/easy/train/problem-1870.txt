Of course it’s connected, everything is connected in ecology.
But I feel like when people always make every ecological problem only about climate change than that’s really giving the wrong impressions on how to effectively tackle them.
This is a good example of that.
I get the impression that this trend of making everything about climate change reinforces the view in the general public that by solving climate change will basically solve all our ecological problems, and that’s just not true.
Even if we are completely carbon neutral, there would still be deforestation, mass extinction, destruction of natural habitats etc etc.
And the measures to tackle these problems completely are often very different from the obvious ones to tackle climate change.
Literally that.
If you don't believe me you can google it, that's what Lula said.
If you don't want to google it, who's the brainwashed person here?
Edit: Rainforest is not self-sustaining/self-regenerating anymore, so "undoing" things is not enough...
