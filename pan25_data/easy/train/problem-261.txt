The GOP will eat themselves inside out for days to figure it out.
It's not ideal given the precarious nature of Congress.
However, the Dems gain nothing by conceding their position given the slim majority the GOP has.
The Dems will be offered nothing in exchange for supporting McCarthy, nor will they be offered anything in exchange for supporting some random GOP figurehead that some of the GOP might splinter off to vote for as Speaker.
This is one reason why the GOP are eating themselves alive: some of them protest voting by voting present to spite McCarthy will only make it easier for Jeffries to be Speaker.
McCarthy (and GOP leaders) cannot risk this, _on top_ of McCarthy wanting Speakership himself.
Hahahahahahaha ahahahahaha.
I can’t even… what?
This is the most basic thing a party can do and they can’t even Jesus Christ.
Democracy is majority consensus, generally speaking.
No majority consensus has been reached, and it hasn't gotten to the point where they'll settle for a plurality because a majority is impossible.
Like eh17368 said, you need 218 votes to win, since that is the majority (434 members in the house, currently).
There's some additional rules that may lower that number, but that's the standard.
