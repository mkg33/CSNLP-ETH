My grandmother is 84 years old, born under German occupation.
She had to evacuate to the same basement she hid from the Nazis (and then Russians again.)
Part of her family died from one of the multiple famines Russia organised in the rural areas.
Many elderly people here have had a very hard life and they deserved none of it.
I’m thankful my other grandmother and grandparents didn’t live to see any of it.
When see saw searchlights in the skies as an old woman she still clutched her heart.
She was barely 10 then ww2 started, remembered everything and was left deeply traumatized even though they had it “easy” in evacuation with a harrowing escape and a very hard existence.
It sometimes gives me comfort that they both had lives after it all, families and happiness.
But it never really leaves you.
"Retribution" sounds like Catholic theology permitting violence.
True Jesus teachings advocate loving everyone through patience, tolerance, kindness, and perseverance.
He is an old man.
I would say time has run out and whatever happens he basically got away without real punishment.
Maybe a shame of losing it all is best we can do to him, but hardly much more...
