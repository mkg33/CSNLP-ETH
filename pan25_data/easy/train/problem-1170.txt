Like, I've never even heard of anyone in my country starving to death before.
Not in my lifetime.
But starving to death used to be pretty damn common.
Still is in many places.
Another decade or so of sluggish/negative population growth will effectively remove an entire generation.
It's not a problem.
It just kind of means you lost.
Game over.
What's the point of survival if you're just gonna end your own bloodline?
Like, why continue?
Just seems kind of a waste of time, honestly.
Unless you're gonna do something big to make your mark in the world another way, but I doubt you're gonna do that.
The reason we're here is because those before us reproduced so that we may do the same.
It's kind of the purpose of an organism, you know?
North America (except Canada, maybe?)
is the exception - Europe will struggle in the coming decades.
Even if their populations remain nominally stable, they will have to reckon with higher and higher median age as well as political backlash from imperfect integration of immigrants.
