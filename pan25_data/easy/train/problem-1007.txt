They said the article could inspire apathy in the Australian public who could still very much do more to support saving/restoring the Reef (things like Coral grafting, waste reduction & not voting for Liberals/Nationals).
That was from an article by a guy not-at-all associated with the scientific community trying to 'raise awareness' about how bad the reef had got - and was quickly but not quite as loudly denied by the actual people trying to save the reef.
It's not pretty good though, is it?
Large swathes of it are dead.
More than half.
Much more than half.
I spent four months living on the reef in 2019.
I dived 4-6 days every week.
I went from Airlie Beach down to the southern end in that time and I saw very little healthy live coral.
It was very depressing, enough so that I cannot imagine wanting to visit the reef again.
Yeah absolutely!
I don't mean to be negative about it by any means - and their message was the same.
Don't go home telling people that the reef is dead, tell them about the technology being used to rebuild the reef.
It spurs excitement and investment into new technologies to help the cause.
