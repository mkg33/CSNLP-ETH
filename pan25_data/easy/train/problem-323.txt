This is exactly the spirit every democracy needs to adopt.
Every democracy needs to unite against fascism and fight against it wherever it appears worldwide.
Fascism can never be allowed to fester or it will grow into an uncontrolable disease.
Fascism needs to be crushed in its infancy.
It can never be allowed to gain even a small amount of power.
Universal healthcare, universal education, strong social support systems, widespread unionization....
Of course I am.
People have some fucking bizarre habit of turning people into saints just because they oppose some other asshole they hate more.
Biden not being Trump doesn't make him a great guy either but I get the same response there too.
Fascism has historically been a reactionary ideology in opposition to socialism and social justice at large.
In a lot of ways socialist ideologies are resurgent and demonstrated to be successful in market economies (Nordic model), but this is an enormous threat to those with the soft power of billions of dollars.
yeah good luck with that.
A lot of countires are stuggling with them.
They are everywhere..it's just like world politic was right before world war 2.
Big asshole nation invade neighbor because he think he should get what he want no matter what and other cockroaches coming out of woodwork screaming me too me too me too ..
