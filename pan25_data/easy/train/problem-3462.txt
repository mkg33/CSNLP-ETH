Russia already decided it was more important to keep them where they are anyhow, even when every warm body is needed in Ukraine.
That should speak to it's value enough.
There is no democracy in libya thats a fact but under the current situation with militias controlling the capital I don't think having elected government that's could bring stability to libya won't be an easy task at all in the other hand the Sharing of power between between Bashagha and hafter is the best opportunity libya had to achieve that.
So I really don't know how militias is any good for democratic process they are literally the main obstacle to Libya stability and Peaceful transfer of power.
Anyway I was clear with you that this militias isn't anything better than Wagner they even could be more dangerous after the war end also i was clear about the fact that's there is no pro-democracy in libya.
Any way I don't want to enter I unless argument I was just try to explain that's what happened In libya isn't a war between good and evil that's is really Ridiculous.
