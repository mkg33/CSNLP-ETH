Pfft.
Even with the most extreme ruling possible, they are no longer in a strong enough position in state legislatures to overturn a Presidential election, and when you look at how their internal divisions are now starting to cost them control of legislative chambers even when they hold majorities of seats, I think their position will only weaken further.
So, in terms of where I'm at, little has changed.
I remain vigilant, but not too deeply concerned that the Court will give the broadest ruling possible.
And, make no mistake, a narrower ruling isn't good, but it could be a lot worse.
I don't think it's wise to look at one ruling and assume how the Court would vote on an entirely different issue.
This court was designed by McConnell to dismantle abortion rights, something the right has been working on for 50 years, and it did exactly that.
That doesn't necessarily mean that the same court will say "what if we just like, ended democracy all together?".
That's not what this court was crafted to do, and unlike abortion, it hasn't been a hot button political issue or something the right has been fighting for for half a century.
