I used to respect this guy before he invited me to his sexual gettogethers.
He told me I would be part of the "family", and when I said no he got me fired from my job.
Liberals tend to see the world as a place where observable differences are superficial, rarely reflecting actual value (low Hierarchical world belief), cosmic purpose or intent (low Intentional world belief), deserved status (low Just world belief), or attention received (high Worth Exploring).
Therefore, most hierarchies require reform (low Acceptable world belief).
Fortunately, however, the world is getting better and change is taking us in the right direction (high Progressing world belief).
Therefore, embracing change and rejecting inequality (the textbook definition of liberalism) is just common sense.‚Äù.

Maybe Senator Hawley should read the piece about that human stain.
This is the Timothy McVeigh who didn't care about the families of the 19 children he killed - "I understand what they felt in Oklahoma City.
I have no sympathy for them.
".
The only families that stay 100% conservative generation to generation are the wealthiest ones and even these parents will have children that change affiliation.
Good point.
I think I remember reading about at least one dating app made to cater to right-wingers that did not do so well ultimately.
