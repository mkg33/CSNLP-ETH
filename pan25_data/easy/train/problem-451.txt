Ok - great.
I agree...
But in all seriousness, how do we change this?
The politicians who benefit from this astoundingly large amount of influential campaign contributions are the ones who make the laws that regulate these contributions.

Your argument is completely disingenuous.
You're suggesting that $1 from a rich person is somehow worse than $2 from the poor and middle class.
It's completely ridiculous.
I agree with your edit.
Lots of great ways to structure the caps...
But the hard part is to get the politicians to write policy that limits their ability to raise money and ultimately gain power.
That I think will be next to impossible.
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try...
