Voters should too.
It's little more than a fantasy to think educating politicians on civics is going to solve America's disrespect for civics when the people that elect those politicians don't.
Voters have an unforgivable disregard for civics and too many of them want politicians that don't either.
This is ultimately why civic minded politicians lose American elections.
Trump and everything his victory normalized was the consequence of a problem that started from the bottom up, not the cause of it.
Absolutely!
To fit our media addiction, the presidential primaries should be a game show.
The first round would include questions of general knowledge like the Constitution, world history, geography, and science.
Fail that round, you are out.
We require immigrants to demonstrate a basic understanding (well beyond the average citizen) of civics.
Why not the people making laws?
