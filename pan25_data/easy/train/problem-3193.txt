“Shoot for the moon.” Jfc.
That’s sad.
“Shoot for the moon” because they asked for a raise, paid sick leave, and one more day of paid vacation.
Holy shit.
I have nothing good to say about that.
This country really has become a nation of people that would polish the boots of the state and the boat shoes of the corpo overlords with their tongues so long as it doesn’t disrupt their day to day.
Fuck the amazon unions bc oh no now you cant have same day shipping.
Fuck all the workers, make them work harder and longer, fuck the conditions, who cares about the conditions because its all about consuming, all about consumerism, all about brands and fucking capital.
Disgusting.
This nation is rotten to its fucking core and if there is an ounce of hope in this country it lies in the union saying “fuck you” and striking no matter how bad it hurts if both bills aren’t passed.
Country needs a general strike.
Country needs a labor revolution so people really see whose backs their lives are built upon.

Pathetic.
Watching all the media portray this as “avoiding a strike” and not “siding with the rail bosses treating their employees like slaves” is fucking sick.
Then the Dems being corpo sellouts and voting for this is pathetic.
Dems are anti-labor, dems aren’t left wing.
The Dem party is a centrist party with a handful of left wing reps.
