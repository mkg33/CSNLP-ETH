I work for the railroad.
That 100k is an over inflated pile of lies.
Different crafts make different amounts, some make $30 an hour, some get paid by the job, corporate pays management $85k a year.
Then they take out retirement, 1.5 times social security, union dues, medical, federal taxes etc.
I get about 60% of my pay from gross to net.
After ten years I have 15 days of vacation and 1 personal day, 0 sick days per year.
Some crafts have more, some have less.
They continue to cut jobs and demand the same or greater work, they let the tracks, cars, buildings and vehicles fall to disrepair to save a buck.
In my time at work we have had 1 year total that didn’t have a fatality.
A guy in my shop died 3 years ago, I’ve nearly been severely injured multiple times.
It’s dangerous work and unforgiving.
I don’t need sympathy, I simply ask to be given sick days, my first raise in 3 years, and the ability to go to the hospital without worrying about losing my job.
