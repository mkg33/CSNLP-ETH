The concept that anyone thought for a second that Trump actually gave a fuck about them always blew me away.

He can blame “woke” culture all he wants but this is a guy who thinks that any veteran is capable of teaching a class.
The training required, none, just that you served.

You can put a bow on a turd but at the end of the day it’s still a piece of shit just like those fools.

It is common knowledge that Jefferson and our founding fathers had slaves.
This does not tarnish the good they did but condemns the bad.
It happened.
