Fuck irans sovereignty They’re a fascist/ religious zealot government that openly kills its own people and publicly executes them so they can instill fear into them Love Oboma but he made mistakes.
He didn’t stand up to Russia when they invaded Ukraine and made a deal with Iran that couldn’t be verified because Iran didn’t allow proper inspections of their nuclear facilities.
They’re not trying to build nuclear power plants If you believe that then you’re an F-ing infant Look how well all tha diplomacy worked in Russia And China I’m not being prideful about Israel handling there business I’m just glad for once a country that has a problem is taking care of it and not involving the U.S. in it Anyone who side’s with the Iranian government is someone who’s opinions are a complete waste of time Your POV is ignorant and a sad example of claiming to grasp a difficult situation in the real world Go pound sand!
Of course you know.
We all fucking know.
He takes care of his lieutenants, and they wanted him back.
They wanted their money train to get back on the tracks and moving.
