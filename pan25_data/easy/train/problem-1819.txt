for Reddit's discussion thread on what Section 230 means for Redditors, how the platform developed its amicus curiae brief to the US Supreme Court, and what is at stake in next month's hearing.
Reddit asked Mods to offer submissions to the Supreme Court, not as experts in regulation of social media, but instead, as people who could speak to the practical implications of Section 230, based on our experiences moderating content at this platform.
So?
You think Reddit should be able to defame or damage people because itâ€™s only a small percentage?
This is peak American exceptionalism aka corruption.
Are there tweaks I'd like to see?
Yes.
I have issues with algorithms pushing people to more divisive and radical content.
There are also issues with some very vile (but not illegal) content being posted and allowed to remain, but I'm not sure how you address this without the government telling people what they can and can't say.
(This would be a violation of free speech.
Sites telling you "you can't say X" isn't a violation.
).
, I made my submission under my real name (and I volunteer as a Mod under my real name), because I believe that someone who is participating in a public policy decision has a responsibility to respect the highest standards of public transparency and public accountability, by exposing himself to public scrutiny.

Reddit find a way to protect themselves, leaving moderators open to legal action, this wouldn't effect non-American moderators.
