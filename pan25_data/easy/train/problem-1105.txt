It bears being said that the post-coverage summary provided by the AP News is far more stable than the reporting offered at the time.
Sadly, the latter is the impression I'm sure many voters of a certain disposition are more likely to remember.
At the time, we didn't have full details -- initial reporting claimed it was the fault of the on-site ballot counting machines.
There was some mention of a reading issue with the ink, but most of the talking heads jumped to the conclusion that the counting machines had a shared system error of some kind.
Even with those stations mentioning the ink from the printers, talk was focused around the inability of the counting machines to read the ballot, not the printers that created it.
Thankfully, talks across the board did mention that these machines had been inspected and thereafter stored and secured prior to the onset of early voting -- nearly 1.5 months ago.
Even the Republican pundits I heard recognized that Lake's claim against Hobbs to recuse herself the week of the election wouldn't had no impact on this current issue.
Pathetic.
Doubt anyone who voted for her will support this nonsense.
Law suits are expensive, time consuming.
How is this better for Arizona.
