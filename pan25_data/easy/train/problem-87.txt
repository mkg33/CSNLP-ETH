Donald Trump, still under investigation for seizing classified documents after he left the White House and facing penalties over his organizationâ€™s business practices, may soon be criminally charged for his actions related to the January 6 riot.
I think it may happen.
The GOP will throw Trump to the wolves as the scapegoat to appease the public, so the rest of the traitors in Congress walk free and plan the next coup with DeSantis.
Trump is no longer useful to them, even as an idiot distraction.
They have MTG for that now.
Honestly successfully prosecuting a US president would set a major precedent.
And a GOOD ONE.
Because if the president can never be prosecuted for crimes committed in office then it means we de facto have one that can literally do anything... As long as their party doesn't vote to convict in an impeachment trial.
