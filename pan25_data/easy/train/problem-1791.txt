Transnistria has a population of 347,251 according to wiki, 29.1% of which is Russian.
So that's another 101,050.
So just over 200k total Russians in a population of about 2.8 million with Transnistria included.
Or about 7% of total population.
Unfortunately yes.
Anyone able to speak a single russian word seems to be fair game for Putin these days.
That puts Moldavia well over 50% 'russian'....
Spreading fascism and terrorist content is normally considered a violation of broadcasting regulations.
No.
There is no legitimate security concern in regards to NATO.
That's what Russia says, yes, but its propaganda that silly people buy in to and I guess you have as well.
Once again what security concern does Russia have from NATO?
Is NATO ever going to invade Russia when it's purely a defensive pact?
No.
Russia literally has nothing to fear from NATO except that it stops them from attacking neighbors.
Russia has had NATO countries bordering them for decades and NATO never once attacked them, now all the sudden when Ukraine is getting closer to NATO it's a problem?
It's all bullshit because they wanted to steal land from Ukraine and they can't do that if they're in NATO.
It's literally Just Russian lies and propaganda when they say it and dummies in the west eat it up.
They don't have "security concerns" when it comes to NATO.
NATO is never attacking them, it's a defensive pact.
There have been NATO countries bordering Russia for decades and never once have they been aggressive to Russia.
Russia spouts this bullshit because they know stupid people in the west will eat it up.
Their sole "Security concern" with NATO is that is stops them from attacking and stealing land from neighbors.
