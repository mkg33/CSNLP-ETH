The last 2 days were pretty quiet, there were no missile strikes, but as usual the towns that are close to the border get shelled every day.
I don’t think there were even any reports of Kupiansk getting shelled these past 2 days, but it still could have been shelled, just not reported, there aren’t that many people living there nowadays after all.
Though there were also no missile launches from Belgorod, so if it was shelled, then it was done by regular artillery and not missiles.
Not necessarily.
The initial invasion force didn't even have it's MREs on hand because they traded them away for vodka.
They'll send these guys out with just enough and tell them to live off the land by looting civilian homes and capturing cities.
Russia practices just-in-time delivery.
They keep large warehouses well behind HIMARS range, and put in a gargantuan effort to shuttle just enough supplies to keep their sector from starving.
Russian supplies within Ukrainian range are scattered between thousands of squirrels nests and caches in the woods.
