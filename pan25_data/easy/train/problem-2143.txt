In 2020, inflation dropped to a pandemic low as demand was driven down thanks in part to fears associated with an emerging global virus, as a result, prices dropped or remained low as well.
When the country began “re-opening” so to speak and began easing up on Covid restrictions, prices rose as demand surged while supply chain issues never let up.
Even the stock market overcompensated in many areas, as stock prices rose to all time highs due to the nature of an unnaturally inflated economy.

The theme here is a consistent one, that inflation is not the fault of solely one person, party or president, that inflation isn’t caused or influenced predominantly by one problem, and when you take into account the unprecedented circumstances that have contributed to this global issue and the fact that all of these problems culminated into one perfect storm at just the right time, it should emphasize the idea that inflation is an issue that's been largely outside of the immediate control of anyone, including Joe Biden.
Will this stop conservatives from putting on their blinders and spewing inflammatory rhetoric at Biden and Democrats?
probably not.
