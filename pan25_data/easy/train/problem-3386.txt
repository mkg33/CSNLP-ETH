I used to live in Florida, and left only to pursue my higher education, and then figured I'd move back.
But It's been going further and further Right to the point where I've even been told, "we don't want nobody from a Blue State livin' here - you move here and you may wind up disappearing".
(Florida is basically a Christo-Fascist Country now...) I mean, that's a direct threat; but it reflects a significant group of people there who feel confident enough that they could hurt someone and the government would have their back - and yeah, I believe this.
So no, I'm not willing to risk my life for that - I'm comfy where I live now, and am surrounded by great people.
Florida needs to clean itself up; it's not up to me to ensure that happens.
Politicians?
You mean the GOP I assume.
This will be the new normal if the GOP assumes power in both congress and the WH.
I am afraid Americans might be just dumb enough to do exactly that.
