This team and the broader effort to identify emerging diseases was created under the Bush Jr. admin and expanded under the Obama admin because of the science and understanding that global population growth trends indicated that it was a question of when, not if a global pandemic was going to happen.
Yep.
They talked for nearly a decade about repealing and replacing Obamacare, and when they had the opportunity to do so, they never came up with a replacement plan, and when they attempted to repeal it, they failed there too because enough of them figured out what a disaster that would be for them.
No, there was a way.
Trump disbanded the team whose mission and directive was to identify emerging diseases, in particular coronaviruses, in places like specifically China.
Who would have known!
How they even got enough votes and members to take over the house is beyond me.
There must be an enormous amount of brain dead idiots living among us in America.
Like I'm talking about 50 to 60% of the people living in this country have no brain.
