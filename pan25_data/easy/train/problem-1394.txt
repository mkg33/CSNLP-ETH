So a rapid reduction to net zero, ultimately leading to a policy of gross zero (certain freedoms to be "essentially prohibited").
And based on an underlying threat that if temperatures keep rising, the proper response could involve.
Seems contradictory.
If you have more regulations to control for climate change it will disadvantage poor people, which would in turn hurt the environment..
Indirectly.
The court's premise is that if temperatures keep rising (which may happen no matter what Germany does), the government should enact "severe" or "comprehensive" losses of freedom.
Government is removing current freedoms to slightly increase the probability of saving future freedoms--from the government.
Good.
More people should sue their own governments for the criminal negligence of ignoring climate change.
More people should be protesting too, and blocking fossil fuel business entrances.
It's time to really put massive pressure on our institutions to take climate change seriously or WE ARE FUCKED.
