The Chief Justice has enormous administrative power.
William Howard Taft, after he was President, became the Chief Justice and he completely reorganized the appeals process and the federal judicial districts.
This need to be done again today.
Justices used to ride circuit on the circuit courts, despite not having been explicitly nominated, confirmed, and appointed to those lower courts, so it seems that they can move within the judiciary without running afoul of the Constitution.
That being so, why couldn't an offending justice be relegated to, say, the Federal Court for the Adjudication of Maritime Law in Alaska (a court I just invented)?
Or a federal court for adjudicating traffic citations on federal land (military bases, national parks, etc)?
This.
The Republican majority are gangsters.
There is no “test” or even consistency to decisions.
They just make the call that they think will benefit conservative agendas the most.
