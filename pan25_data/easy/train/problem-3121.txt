"It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that mental lying has produced in society.
When a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind, as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime.

“Federal and local prosecutors are investigating whether Representative-elect George Santos committed any crimes involving his finances and lies about his background on the campaign trail… Questions remain about how Mr. Santos has generated enough personal wealth to be able, as campaign finance filings show, to lend his campaign $700,000.”.
How can you not understand this?
It’s very simple.. he fabricated his entire persona and people voted based on a total and utter fabrication of his life.
Some of which were utterly disgusting including claims about the holocaust and death of his mother during 911.
To make it worse he also has serious issues with his campaign finance that is at present under investigation.
This is nothing like any other candidates who lie or misrepresent small facts.
That is a big deal.
Themes of anarcho-capitalism, social democracy, socialism, and more collide and conflict as successive lens/perspectives reveal the root remains unchanged and just as rotten as ever.
“Mr.
Santos also deleted a reference to past philanthropic efforts.
He previously claimed he had founded and run a tax-exempt charity, Friends of Pets United.
The Internal Revenue Service and the New York and New Jersey attorney general’s offices said they had no records of a registered charity with that name.”.
