What is wrong with these people, blaming oil thieves for the degradation.
Guess what: there was NONE of that before Shell released millions of barrels of oil and ruined everyone's livelihoods and homes.
It was a pristine, lovely delta, teeming with fish and wildlife and with oysters dripping from tree roots along the shores.
Shell literally covered it in crude oil goo.
People went from walking on grass to walking in oily muck.
No schools, no electricity, no infrastructure, yet millions of dollars were flowing out of their land every month.
After decades of that crap people started stealing oil and you say it's all their fault now.
GTFO.
Since you are well informed about the proceedings, you should also know that criminal organizations are responsible for almost 500K barrels stolen a year and equally responsible for most of the oil spills in the Niger Delta region.
Thank god.
I almos thought you were the personification of the walking American patriotic stereotype.

Since Nigeria has neither the expertise nor the capital to extract its own resources, it would be either allowing a foreign company to operate or to simply leave the resources in the ground.
Did you not read what i said?
The pipeline woud not exist if shell hadn't put it there in order to exploit a third world country's resources and therefore couldn't be blasted.
Criminal organisations wouldn't even be able to steal that oil causing damages in the first place if shell hadn't been extracting oil in the first place though.
