You do realize that his direct role in creating most of the music you hear is fairly limited, right?
He's a talented lyricist and definitely has a lot of creative input over the entire process, but the list of collaborators (sound designers, engineers, composers, other artists) is a mile long.
He is the prominent figurehead of a giant team of people who actually creates the music.
Eric Clapton at least wrote and played his own music.
Ok, ok, we’ll put aside for the moment his bipolar delusions of grandeur, malignant narcissism, liking Hitler, associating himself with Christofascists and white nationalists, and his support of an ex-president and a fascist movement that nearly destroyed 246 years of American democracy, and just agree that Kanye West is good at the rap music.
Dude needs help.
I may have heard one song from him, but I know he’s famous and very wealthy.
As famous as he is, as wealthy as he is, most people I believe don’t give a shit about him.
He is likely surrounded by sycophants and wealthy enough to get away with it.
Someone close to him needs to get him some mental health.
IMO.
