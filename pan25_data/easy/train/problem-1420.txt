This speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding of Chinese governance.
The ones with true power, like Jiang, don't need to hold office.
Jiang stacked the party with loyalists so he could be certain he would be able to continue influencing politics despite being formally retired.
Xi needs a third term because he lacks a clique he can continue to influence upon retirement.
Not necessarily.
While the Saudi royal family is a very authoritarian regime they do make a strong effort particularly internationally to ensure that what they do does not overly affect the economic situation of the country as that would directly harm their personal wealth which is one of the leading drivers keeping them in power quite frankly.
China sees maintaining its political strenh as that force.
Does democracy brings prosperity or prosperity eventually leads to democracy?
Examples abound of all kind of results and democracy is not the constant in the get rich cohort.
China follows Taiwan and Singapore's authoritarian path.2 (When Taiwan grew the fastest and not riding the coattails of China, was under KMT authoritarian rule, democracy was a recent development).
You can only compare each leader with the period before them and Jiang's years were transformative, miraculous even.
Much is attributed to Deng though his work is be the champion of change.
Deng himself only took small incremental steps towards opening up, eg when private enterprises were first allowed, the size was limited to no more than 6 people!
It was really a low low base that China emerged from in the 80s.
Wait, is Jiaotong usually officially translated to Transportation?
If this is the case it feels like reputation suicide to me.
