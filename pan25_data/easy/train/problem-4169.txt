Russians as a people are taking the biggest L on planet earth.
Do nothing and actually enable a corrupt mafia govt to steal literally every cent from you for decades all while cheering it on then not give a single shit as your literal brothers aunts and uncles are genocided in ukraine for literally no reason at all.
I know its not everybody but holy shit russians suck ass at life.
Theyre poor as shit in the most resource rich country on earth and cant be bothered to do anything about it.
Yea its tough now but thats because they let it go on for decadessss.
Fucking do somethingâ€¦.
I think their mindset is something like this - get born in poverty and struggle your entire life, watch some movies or go on the internet and find out other people (mainly americans) have way easier and better lives while also getting fed all kinds of propaganda by the goverment, older people and even family and then start blaming everything else instead of your self and your country which stops you from doing something about it or about your self and to be fair you dont have a lot of oportunity to do something.
I live in the poorest region in the poorest EU country and we have the same problem.
