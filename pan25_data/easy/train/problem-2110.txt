Idk why you people are downvoting him.
He is right to question the legitimacy of US intervention in Syria.
Under the Obama administration, the US cited a very vague excuse for invading sovereign Syria.
The US argued that as a member of the UN and without UN SC authorization, a “victim country” (US) can act in self-defense and intervine due to the unwillingness or inability of the Syrian government to stop and or eliminate the threat that (IS terrorist) poses to the US - Which in fairness, it’s a very silly excuse when we have Iran for example, funding terrorists in the region, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan harboring terrorists and we don’t invade them?
Why?
Well, those other countries aren’t vulnerable and in a civil war with various factions.
Obama saw a vulnerable Syria, friend of Iran and IS was an easy excuse to take out an adversary.
Yeah seriously.
I wouldn’t be shocked if some time down the line we see far right Kurdish groups spring up as a result of their treatment.
We’re giving them every reason to start hating us.
The Kurds deserve recognition and security.
