It is a company of 14.
Explain what good would it do to have tanks delivered now to Ukraine to stand around where they can be bombed, as there is no crew, no mechanics.
All crews and mechanics will be training in Germany.
Note that 2 battalions of 40 tanks are planned.
So 80 crews?
4 persons in each.
Tanks, spare parts, probably tank towers, who knows what else, will be delivered when crews are ready.
Makes no sense before.
No other country will send them before.
I read that they plan a joint delivery, but I canâ€™t verify of course.
Training to be started the next days.
Russia that win in Ukraine would mean it will create one Union State with Russia , Belarus, Ukraine, most likely it would try to absorb Georgia, Moldova and maybe Kazakstan , You would have a completely new empire on your doorstep which have it's main drive force based on expansion, no way you can guarantee it wouldn't attack Baltics having such a big human resource in it's disposal and control over all of that new territory and resources.
