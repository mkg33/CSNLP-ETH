Ok ill bite lol.
1812 was a win outright against the brits.
No naval conscription afterwards right?
Korea?
I think this is the most obvious win.
North korea fid not defeat s. Korea right?
Vietnam… ambiguous, usa never lost a battle but S. Vietnam wax corrupt and frankly we confused a civil war with our cold war so perhaps strategically a loss at the political level not the military level.
Afghanistan pretty much the same as Vietnam with one caveat.
We won but tried to stick around and nation build.
Stupid abd expensive idea.
Bottom line first rule still applies, dont fight usa .
Bad odds😱.
A limited truce is an option, say that they are willing to stop attacks on Russian territory, and will not attempt to encircle or attack any troops making prompt withdrawals, but any Russians still fighting are valid targets, and if Russia doesn't start withdrawing within 24 hours or has significant forces inside Ukraine after a week, that Russia violated the agreement and go back to targeting all military targets.
