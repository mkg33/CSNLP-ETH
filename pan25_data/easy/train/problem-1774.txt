It really helps if people put all the trash in bags.
The yard around the dollar general I worked at was covered in trash cause everyone just threw trash in a bin and took it outside to the dumpster and then never closed the dumpster.
I can only imagine how bad it is when the trucks come to collect it.
I used to actually clean my car and just throw everything in my trash can without a bag until I noticed it all over my street so I started putting it in bags and now the only trash I find is from my neighbors.
Why privacy considerations?
Your numberplate is your fucking car.
The camera will read your number plate (like they already do) and they will just print the number on the bag.
All they are doing is printing your number plate on the bag that is it.
The big big letters and number are already visible on your car.
they arnt putting your name an address on any information you couldn't get by looking at your car.and seeing as they already write your number plate on the recipt how is it any different?
apart from now you have to clean up after yourself.
