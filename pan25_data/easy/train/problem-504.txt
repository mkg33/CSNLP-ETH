It was literally: "I think with utter speculation that Bernie would lose in the general" when voters actually loved what Bernie was selling for the exact same reasons voters liked JFK and Obama: authenticity, passion, and vision.
So what happens when the DNC and media trounce on him?
Of course he loses.
He lost primaries because democratic voters are scared to stand by what they believe in and are more worried about what others might think, even if their views are informed by misinformation or apathy.
And so on.
There was definitely a concerted effort on the part of Hillary’s team to push Trump because she thought she would fare better against him in the end (similar to the thought behind the DNC’s strategy during these midterms).
Democrats won this time but we’ve seen what happens when you implement this strategy and lose: the country gets screwed.
Not necessarily.
Where i live (this isn't the case every where) you can vote on either side of the primaries.
So I know people who voted on the conservative side during primaries, but Dem in the general.
