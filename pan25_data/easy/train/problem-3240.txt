You’re watching, how fast Fascism can take over Florida is going to turn into a fascist state completely if Ron DeSantis gets his way, and there’s enough, Trump cult members down there to make it happen.
Americans have got to get off their asses and understand this country is real close to being lost to fascism, it can happen here, it will happen here, and if we don’t stand up and fight against it, it is over as we know it Does anybody remember this country did have work camps?
World War II, Japanese, anybody remember?
And sadly, that was a democratic president, which really makes me nauseous, but it’s time to take fascism serious in America.
It’s not the left it’s the right, how can people not see that?
And even Fox news came out today and Rupert Murdoch admitted that his hosts tell lies on purpose to get ratings, they had to admit today that they knew Donald Trump lost the election, but kept spewing his big lie for money, we are in a world of shit in America.
Machismo.
Fascists show disdain for women, disregard for chastity, and condemnation of homosexuality.
