That’s what I don’t understand about Putin’s plan at this point.
The Russian economy sinks further and further into the toilet while the countries that he hates the most work everything out without him.
If he cares about his legacy certainly the Russian economy would be a part of that?
He’s going to leave it in ruin.
I remember the US being referred to as a "Hyperpower" in the early 90's, because rather than being just a "superpower", a hyperpower has uncontested global supremacy of military power, political power, cultural power, financial power, technological power, and educational power.

If you had a job for over a year you can likely get a line of credit for much more than that.
The interest rates will be high either way.

The CRAMs protect the assorted fortified locations from incoming fire (anti-radiation missiles, bombs, rockets, whatever you want), while those fortified locations provide overwhelming firepower against any incoming force.
"money if fake" does that make it useless?
Money is the way we interact with society, it doesn't really matter if it is real or not.
If civilization is gonna collapse then get as many credit cards as you can, loans too, max them out, don't pay them, set up a $5 a month payment plan to by yourself time to drain other cards and lines of credit.
Eventually go no contact and change your mailing address and phone number.
I don't know why you would do that if money is fake though, whatever that means.
China also cannot effectively blockade Taiwan.
To do so would mean putting naval assets on the ocean-facing side of Taiwan, where Taiwan has all the advantages.
Taiwan as an island is incredibly easy to fortify... you needs boats and planes.
There's no way to drive across, and precious few harbors capable of supporting troop landings.
As much as China claims the J20 is a gen5 fighter, it's covered in radar returning rivets.
It's not gen5 enough.
