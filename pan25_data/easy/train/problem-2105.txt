To call absolutely any attempt at negotiated peace appeasement is the exact same opinion as promoting global warfare.
Are you shitting me?
Most conservatives in the prairies here, where I live, are absolutely not the kind of people who will support Ukraine.
They think zelensky made up this whole war just to make money.
I see shitty memes all day from locals about how zelensky, trudeau, and biden are all making tonnes of money off this "fake" war.
They actually claim it is staged, or not happening at all.
In hindsight, appeasement was terrible, led to the annexation of Czechoslovakia entirely which made the Nazis stronger (capturing hundred of tanks, artillery, etc), and it only encouraged Hitler to keep pushing France and Britain's buttons, but at the time appeasement was rather popular in Britain and France where the wounds of WWI were still quite fresh and ever-present.
Looking around and seeing a bunch of scarred and maimed veterans, or thinking of all the brothers, fathers, uncles, friends, etc who died in the last war, I think it's kinda understandable why people in those countries weren't so keen on rushing into another big war, especially one over some people (ethnic Germans in this case) who happened to fall on the wrong side of a border after some hastily-drawn borders in 1919 (or so the thinking would go).
At least it did buy the Allies some valuable time to re-arm.
Canada's military contributions are an embarrassment.
Mostly because our military has been chronically underfunded.
Trudeau wants to feel important, but riding American coat tails for protection gives you a pretty tiny voice on the world stage.
