It's not just money today.
For Disney its about brand management, specifically being family friendly.
Queer families are families.
They've been preaching diversity for so long it became untenable to have diversity of color but not of gender - especially when you consider how many queer people consume and produce media.
I like sports.
I fucking hate nationalism and how every fucking international event has to become a referendum for every limped-dick loser's sense of personal pride.
Olympic medal tables are fucking cringe.
The fact that something like India-Pakistan cricket (or USA-USSR contests in the recent past) is connected by media to actual geopolitical tensions is tacky and tasteless.
And the fact that so many people are addicted to spectacle that they'll passively endorse this world cup, a human rights shitshow even by FIFA's own standards, by watching it is disgusting.
The lowest effort thing people could do to stop this from happening in the future is just not watch the games.
But they won't because it's "more than a game.
".
