China also undermines their own geopolitical position if they support Russia too strongly.
It tarnishes their legitimacy if they don't support territorial integrity and opens the door for more nations to support Taiwanese independence.
Yes.
The most striking example is probably the Liaoning, the first Chinese aircraft carrier that is in fact the rebuilt Ukrainian/ex-Soviet Varyag kutnezsov-class carrier (though bought under cover as a floating casino).
100%.
I speak Chinese as well on a daily basis + spent time in China and am familiar.
It’s quite alarming to be honest, from media to diplomats, the hostility towards the west is immense.
I’m happy/comforted that the world is finally wising up.
I spend a good amount of time translating and sharing Chinese media/news/history/politics.
Maybe.
China still would need to deploy more resources if Russia turn back into western lapdog (Yeltsin era) again, plus with with war on terror ending, the western bloc need to throw all those pressure on someone else.
A Yeltsin II government might very well decide to let NATO park an army near Xinjiang or Mongolia.
