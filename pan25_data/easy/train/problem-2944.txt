How the Democrats didn't use that baffles me.
It is literally why Democrats need to be so much more assertive.
He admitted that he knows the system is broken; that it isn't objective but subjective.
Because there exists a justice system people like Trump have relinquished control of their morality.
Since a system exists to punish wrong doers then they can do what they want until they are caught.
If they are caught and punished, only then is the action proven to be bad.
If they are bad but don't get in trouble then they aren't bad.
It is a simple train of logic but Democrats don't take advantage.
Usually because Republicans don't admit that they did anything wrong like Trump did, but he said what needed to be said so that Democrats could retort with, let us stop people like Trump.
He said it, he invited it, and if he was charged with wrong doing before then he would have stopped or done something different.
He said he does what he does because he can get away with it.
So stop letting them get away with it.
Trump admitted he was a criminal and won.
So now that is the bar for everyone else.

Possible.
That does not change the fact that people are spreading a lie about trump.
It's detrimental to the situation at hand and honestly dangerous.
