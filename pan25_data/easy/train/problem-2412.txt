I’ll throw in my two cents here.
I’d argue this is really just human nature + what happens when you’re a minority but there’s a decently large group of people of your background.
I moved here at a young age and my interests for some reason happen to the whitest things possible, yet I can’t say it hasn’t been isolating from time to time.
Chinese students isolate themselves the same way frats isolate themselves on campus, it’s a mechanism to seek comfort among people you’re most comfortable with, which often means people of same ethnicity or with same experiences growing up.
I used to judge this behavior a bit without considering why they do it, but after my visits to China with my parents and seeing all the “laowai” drama and how middle age white Americans, who can’t speak a word of Chinese, crowded at bars getting wasted 7 days a week, I really can’t judge Chinese students for sticking to themselves.
Exactly!
Every argument that brings up the US is a red herring on the table to distract from the issue of Ukrainian sovereignty.
Ukraine is it's own nation, it's allowed to build relationships with whoever it damn well wants.
