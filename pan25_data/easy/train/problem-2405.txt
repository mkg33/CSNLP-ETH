Iraq was launching Scuds at Israel in the Gulf War.
So we sent Patriot systems in.
They could not stop supersonic Scuds, they were only designed to hit subsonic bombers with a huge radar cross section.
Even if they hit one, the body of the Scud would still be landing in Tel Aviv and smashing an apartment.
A Patriot can hit a cruise missile tho.
It's just a small airplane.
Remember afghanistan?
Because you do not seem to remember what went on there.
The truth is we could fight over there but we could not win and a war with russia is going to be the same.
Fantastic!
And instead of constellations, the stars will spell brand names and other advertising.
And when something breaks, there'll be the blue sky of death.
Absolutely untrue.
Canada and Denmark just resolved a border issue recently.
Additionally, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Romania, Estonia, all had border disputes before acceding to NATO (and sometimes, these stand to this day).
Croatia (acceded to NATO in 2009) has border disputes with Montenegro (acceded to NATO in 2017), Serbia (non-NATO), Slovenia (acceded to NATO in 2004), and Bosnia and Herzegovina (NATO Membership Action Plan since 2010).
Well there was a time in the past where we figured out we really couldn't stop the bad guys.
We couldn't fight them in their own country or...we could but it was of absolutely no use at all.
