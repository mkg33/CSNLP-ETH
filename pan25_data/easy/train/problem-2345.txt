Trump got caught trying to extort Ukraine to get them to announce a Biden investigation and the laptop was their backup plan.
It's shameful, to be honest with you.
And now they have a friend in this wannabe Tony Stark who never actually built anything in his life.
He didn't found Tesla.
He bought a controlling stake and booted the people who actually did and now the cars explode.
He founded SpaceX but he's not an engineer and that company would be nothing without its NASA contracts.
He used The Boring Company to razzle-dazzle state and local governments, distract focus from local transit projects then ghost these places.
Now he's running Twitter into the ground just to own the libs.
Thanks, Republicans.
Thanks for totally taking one for the team and obsessing about children's genitals, their sex lives, and now some cokehead's penis.
Thank you so much for all of the time and effort you spend obsessing over these things.
While the rest of us are out there, enjoying life, thinking about banging our girlfriends or wives, you are thinking about Hunter Biden's cock and which genitals children have.
Congratulations.
He didn't get rich.
He was born rich and made a few good bets.
But expertise in one area is not transferable to another.
That's what Zuck is discovering with the metaverse.
