Corporations in this context refers to any legal status granted to an entity rather than an individual.
If I enter into a contract with a farmer for an amount of his future harvest and then he dies I can probably still claim from his heirs, but not always (and an "it depends" often results in new laws).
If we set sail on this trading voyage and I pay for the supplies, what is my guarantee to be made whole from the income?
I could transfer this debt to the corporation of the voyage and then have everyone take equal shares of the profit.
I'm no longer paying for the supplies myself and still qualify for the results.
Having a company (or whatever the fictional person is called) enter into the contract instead provides stability and durability since the corporation that entered the contract can survive the individual who signed it.
Okay?
There are also a lot of consequences if the plaintiff's bad legal arguments are upheld and Norfolk Southern loses.
It's a tradeoff.
We shouldn't let the plaintiff win just because the defendant is shitty.
