Zoning plays a huge roll though.
Charlotte is a big city but if you look at the land that is zoned for housing within city limits 84% of it is zoned for only single family housing.
So many housing issues are caused by places making it illegal to build more housing/density which then causes more and more suburban sprawl combined with housing prices consistently outpacing wage growth.
Towns like the one you grew up in would grow regardless as the area becomes more attractive but with Charlotte itself (and many other big cities, San Francisco being the most notorious example) making density illegal the growth is pushed out to surrounding areas to a much greater degree.
The end result is endless suburban sprawl.
Frustrating.
I understand the animosity others have of being priced out of their communities.
Developers and those who see change inevitably as progress see their opposition as luddites and as backwards - I just want to feel financially secure as a long time member of a community thatâ€™s changing under my feet.
