I remember 20 years ago digging a hole in a snowbank so I could sleep - I wasn't even sure that I would wake up the next morning with the freezing temperatures, but I was too tired and hungry to stay awake.
I've also met some of my greatest friends, and learned some of my most knowledgeable lessons in homeless shelters.
When people are stripped of all possessions and vulnerable...man, those were REAL times.
And I'll never forget any of those people.
We want AOC, who voted to screw railroad workers, abstained on the hideous Iron Dome vote because Nancy Pelosi to told her to, when she could have help defeat it, ghosted Amazon workers when they were preparing to strike, forgot about caged latino orphans as soon as Biden took over, and voted to heavily fund the cops, right after she personally felt threatened by 500 MAGA AutoZone shift managers in antlers, waddling around the Capitol impotently.
What's that based off?
Republicans aren't voting her.
It's an easy campaign ad.
She's voted 90% with Democrats as a Senator.
It will be the right leaning Dems and those that always lean incumbent.
