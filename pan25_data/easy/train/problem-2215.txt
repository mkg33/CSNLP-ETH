The summit focused on trade agreements concerning oil, technology, infrastructure, and security, and resulted in an agreement that the two nations would not interfere with each other's domestic affairs.
China is little more than a paper tiger.
Sure their economic power is strong, for now, but their military power really isn't able to project that far from their borders.
Not to mention that they are just as plagued by corruption now as they were before, only it's people Xi likes or doesn't view as a rival.
And if you all think the US birth rate is low, China's is far lower.
Xi can't get people to have more than one kid.
That's what over thirty years of forcing a one child policy will do to your population.
You make extraordinarily salient points.
I enjoyed reading your input.
As for the question you asked at the end, I found this bit from the article:
Both nations have ambitious infrastructure projects, and Saudi Arabia needs money to diversify its economy.
The US didn't install the Saud's, they were already there.
We just propped up and protected an absolute tyrannical monarchy because of oil.
