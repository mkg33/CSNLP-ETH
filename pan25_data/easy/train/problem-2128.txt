The local Druze (and Bedouin) communities largely supported and fought alongside Israeli militia during the civil war/first Arab Israeli War/Israeli War of Independence (whatever you want to call it).
Reasons being the usual reasons ethnic minorities fear irredentist movements - a movement trying to reclaim all of Israel/Palestine and re-establish a Levantine Arab (Palestinian) identity throughout is inherently a threat to all ethnic minorities, not just Jews.
Therefore the Druze community (and most of the Bedouin community who fought) fought on the Israeli side.
Absolutely untrue.
They are Arab speaking (as their main language) which by definition makes them Arabs.
They do not identify as Muslims, which is maybe what you intended to say?
Exactly.
Mfrs don't know something, Google it for 5 minutes, then make a confident statement while they really have no understanding and then everyone's confused or misinformed because they're too damn lazy to spend time learning for themselves.
This is humanity's biggest weakness lol.
