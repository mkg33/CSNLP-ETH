Refreshing to see a realistic take on Reddit.
I’m happy the Ukrainians are getting patriots but we need to be realistic that splashing a shitty Russian drone with a $5m Patriot missile isn’t the win we think it is.
If Russia can produce shitty drones and missiles at a higher rate than the west can produce effective air defense missiles than they can exhaust Ukraine’s current supply of missiles.
The west has given two NASAMs launchers to Ukraine and four more will arrive by November of next year.
I would be shocked if they get more than eight Patriot launchers in total.
Ukraine doesn’t really have that much air defense that can counter ballistic missiles.
What consequences?
They gonna lob a bunch more missiles toward Kyiv ... only to have them all shot down by Ukraines new missile defense systems ?
???
That Pootin needs to be erased from existing.
Consequences?
If Russia were in a position to offer consequences to the US they wouldn’t be in a position where they believed they needed to invade and land grab in the first place.
