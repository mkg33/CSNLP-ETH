As a Canadian who is ABC, and will never own a gun, even I agree that the hare-brained gun control bill the Liberals trot out like clockwork every election cycle or so, is a complete waste of time.
They make something that seems good to undecided voters in urban centres (whose votes they need), that doesn't actually do much in favor of gun control, and yet massively inconveniences tons of law-abiding rural Canadians (whose votes they would never be able to get).
I get it.
That is my background too, though not with quite as much firepower.
I get the traditions.
Thatâ€™s in my family.
I find it interesting that the Christchurch massacre was committed by an erroneously licensed individual using legitimately purchased firearms.
Same.
I have never not voted Liberal before.
Trudeau has convinced me that he has no interest in the liberal values that attracted me to the Liberal party in the first place.
If Trudeau steps down and the next leader is not Freeland, I will consider voting for the Liberals again.
But I refuse to vote for this government anymore.
