All I have to say is what a time to be a lawyer, imagine the tsunami of billable hours there are in the myriad of Trump suits.
Wonder if he will pay them.
This one is yet another lawsuit whose underlying legal principle was easily identifiable as not having merit by any pre-law college student, and yet several people with JD degrees pretended there was a cause of action here—fully aware that there wasn’t.
I would love to see a judge say “this case, on its own merits, appears to be frivolous.
Viewed in isolation, it’s debatable whether it rises to the level of deserving sanction.
But viewed in the broader demonstrated pattern of malicious litigation, I am sanctioning the moving attorneys on behalf of the defense, whose legal fees the moving attorneys will help reimburse personally.”.
I don't think he's a genius.
I just think he's a good manipulator.
He is very dumb on most subjects but he couldn't have gotten where he is in life if he wasn't good at manipulation.
I will give him that.
Litigiousness should become a monitored variable that is taken into consideration.
Each judge has to determine on a case-by-case basis whether (a) a plaintiff should pay some or all of the defendant’s legal expenses; and (b) whether the attorneys should be sanctioned, meaning they personally have to pony up some of that money.
But should it be purely case-by-case in isolation?
