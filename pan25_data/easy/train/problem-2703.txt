The outrage is always “they will get no punishment!” which is valid, but the real outrage should be how these monsters are allowed to propagate in the first place.
The outrage should be that a man is dead.
Complaining that the system is broken is not helpful to black people that are afraid for their loved ones to leave their homes.
It’s the same shit with mass shooters.
No one wants to look at the way society creates these monsters and looks the other way, or wants to hold responsible the cultures that are churning these wastes of breath out en masse, but then wants to be shocked and outraged when they do it AGAIN.

Start at the source.
Nip it in the bud.
These guys don’t have a fear of consequences, bc they’ve never had any and never will.
People complain that the system is broken, but then still rely on the “system” to fix it.
The same system run by the same monsters.
