They definitely have a large gulag labor force to build those stadiums.
They're cool with alcohol even if the food is a bit scarce.
Instead of fireworks, they'll launch ICBMs over the stadiums.
They won't need to air-condition the open stadiums, but players will have to respectfully navigate around the ginormous Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il statues set into the middle of the field.
What?
A bigger shitshow than Qatar?
All of the issues hosting that and no one still cared, and no one will care about this as long as they can watch their precious football, the majority wont care, the few will make a big stink, and it will disappear into history as it always does.
Definitely.
If they actually cared they would show it by not watching, but even that would be too much of a sacrifice for them, so they give the minimal effort because it’s the “in” thing.
I mean imagine if no one watched a round of the finals or something.
That would send a very strong message, and risk the advertising funds aka money the only thing FIFA cares about.
