“Religious Liberty” is a euphemism for shitty people using their religious bullshit to justify their bigotry.
We have gone from “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof…” to “Karen SHALL Have a right to ban homosexuals from her Bed and Breakfast because the Pastor of her McMegaChurch told her them folk aren’t right with god.
Amen Jesus.”.
Racism and misogyny and general hatred for all others still dominates the Republican Party, even its so-called "moderates".
How we get here?
The GOP has become the party fat lazy-thinking, small minded people who have no capacity for introspection or empathy towards others.
Those in power claim to be defending the constitution yet I doubt they read or even understand the first amendment.
I just hope their backward views anchors them to the past and anti-gay businesses and organizations dwindle into irrelevance as the majority see how ridiculous it is to deny a LGBT+ people/couples goods, services, employment.
No.
My issue IS a real issue, and THAT issue is my freedom of speech.
It's a right, given to me by my God, to express my opinions how I see fit.
