For real, these people are exhausting... Like dayum who would think saying that on order to become president of the United States a candidate procures sufficient electoral votes in the electoral college would bring all these "well actually's" out.

I'm not saying that i like the electoral college, nor am I questioning how or why we got to this point....
Yet, here we are, where winning the electoral college wins you the election.

Actually the Electoral College was about slavery.
Slave states had large populations, but a lot of those people would never get to vote.
If the popular vote were used, slave states would be irrelevant in presidential politics.
In order to get the slave states to ratify the constitution a system was cooked up that would award votes based on population rather than actual number of votes.
