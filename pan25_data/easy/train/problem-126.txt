They did a much better job than I expected minimizing loopholes.
I have thought of one loophole they didn't close, but it's too slow and difficult to matter much: a person subject to the ban can buy a piece of land zoned for commercial use that does not have a habitable dwelling, then somehow convince the authorities to have it rezoned for residential use, then they can build a residence on the property.
This is not going to be common enough to defeat the goal of the legislation.
Absolutely not.
If someone wants to buy a home here, they have to pay real estate taxes.
If someone buys the house next door to me and comes for a week a year, they help pay for my kid to go to school and ask for not much in return for their tax dollars.
Sign me up.
So if judges read this as literally as a computer would instead of realizing that the wording was messed up, every prescribed real property or immovable that subsection (c) was meant to bring into scope of the residential property definition is excluded, because a prescribed real property or immovable is of course not "other than a prescribed real property or immovable".
