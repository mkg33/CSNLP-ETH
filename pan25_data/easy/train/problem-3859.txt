Retrans station?
25U I assume (formerly known as 31U).
Pretty familiar story since I was also commo and also had a machine gun to worry about (it was actually a M240B an even heavier weapon).
But realistically I hardly had to worry about that weapon outside of training on it even when I was deployed to Kosovo, just a standard M16 and later M4 otherwise.
I ended up getting an article 15 though when training at Grafenwoehr because I was assigned to KP duty and my company commander gave me the wrong building and decided to collect everyone's weapon for the night.
I put a piece of tape on mine to quickly identify it and didn't know when I grabbed it the next morning that someone else had done the same thing so when I took the wrong rifle to the wrong KP my unit spent the day panicking over a lost weapon, just coming short of calling the colonel and locking down the base.
Sure.
I'm just saying each case is important or not important based on more than "president X has some classified docs he needs to turn over now that he's an ex president".
I don't think you disagree.
If any enlisted servicemen was found with one of these documents at their private residence, theyâ€™d immediately be arrested and held in confinement with no bail pending their trial, and probably be facing 10-15 years in federal prison minimum.
How are all these politicians just flaunting the law on this with zero consequences?
It really undermines faith in the system!
