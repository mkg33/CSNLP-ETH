How shitty of a company do you have to be to not give workers, working in harsh environments mind you, paid sick days and shame on the Biden Administration for not fighting for something so absolutely something so trivial but necessary for working families.
Moving a train is easy.
I could teach you to make a locomotive go forward and backwards in literally 20-30 minutes.
Running a train is hard.
There isn't a guidebook you can read to understand moving a loaded coal train through hills and valleys.
Even experienced engineers have to learn each section of track from someone else before doing it on their own.
Then there are regulations and rules.
Train signals aren't stop lights, you don't just have to know what they mean, you have to understand how they affect your train in the current conditions and scenarios.
There is also quite a bit of track without any signals at all.
All train movement is coordinated through a dispatcher over a radio, called a track warrant.
You have to know where the front and rear of your train is (the rear is 1.25 miles away sometimes) at all times and make sure you aren't occupying any of the covered track when the warrant expires.
Failure makes trains crash, and that is bad.
