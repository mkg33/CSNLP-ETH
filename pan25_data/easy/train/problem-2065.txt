>Maybe you disagree, and maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how it could've been resolved as a net positive.
Even if the unions ultimately prevailed, the damage to the economy, and to Democrats' electoral chances, would be deleterious, and handing Republicans more power in 2022 and 2024 wouldn't do anyone any good.
Certainly not unions.
Republicans would ride the backlash into power, and then gut the NLRB and pass anti-union legislation, both to help corporate interests, and to damage a major Democratic supporter.
If you want better outcomes, elect larger Democratic majorities, pass better legislation, and then dare Biden to veto it if you think he's not truly on board.<.
Irrelevant.
Biden proposes a military budget, he doesn't pass it into law.
Biden's stance on marijuana reform is equally meaningless.
He doesn't make law, Congress does.
If legislation legalizing all marijuana use makes it to his desk and he breaks out the veto pen, I'll agree with you.
Hell, I'll help you badmouth him but until then, no, you really don't seem to have a grasp on the three branches of government and their respective roles.
