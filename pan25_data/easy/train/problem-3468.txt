“It's not immediately clear what information the subpoena from special counsel Jack Smith is seeking, but it follows months of negotiations between federal prosecutors and Pence's legal team.”.
You don’t.
The negotiations were likely to get testimony without a subpoena.
Either that broke down and DoJ decided to subpoena, or Pence finally asked to be subpoenaed.
And again, it’s possible Pence himself even asked for the subpoena on specific questions.
I can see why that would appear to Pence like a negotiation, but maybe not to DoJ.
Sort of like a caught suspect telling the cops, "You can handcuff me if you want."
And the cop is probably going to say, "Yes, I know this.
Thanks for your permission."
).
Pence is fundamentalist-christian-crazy, but I don't think he's MAGA-QAnon-crazy, and he's definitely not Rebel-Against-The-DOJ-because-they're-the-deep-state-crazy.
Yep.
I hate it, but I get it.
There’s no good reason to incentivize elected politicians to put their campaign opponents in jail.
And we know for a fact that Trump would have done that to Biden if he could.
The lenhs he went to just to get an announcement of an investigation into Biden were horrendous.
