Something that the protests didn't account for was that the Iranian government was willing to kill/harm their own people repeatedly.
Edit: Many redditors are letting me know that the Iranians did indeed understand that there would be serve repercussions towards any protest.
All the power to them.
I know that the Iranian government isn't exactly known as an institution of long-term planning or elevated philosophical or academic thought, but it strikes me as a bad idea to sentance tens of thousands of young people to death and blind hundreds more when they are the generation that will eventually be caring for the elderly and having to fill positions in the government and economy down the line.
Seems like they're shooting their future in the foot with this one.
Unfortunately this protesting will eventually get suppressed.
The government is willing to kill them all and the protesters have no way to defend themselves against an armed military.
Population, sure.
But not a lone gunman, being afraid to deal with one dude is a failure in police training.
