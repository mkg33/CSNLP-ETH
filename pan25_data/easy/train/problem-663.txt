Yes, I do.
I also believe in God changing His views towards humanity over time, as the transition from the vengeful God of the Old Testament to what He became later in the New Testament.
I also believe in not fucking around with other people's religious beliefs or lack of them, and I don't believe in heckling someone in an attempt to convert someone to my religion.
I am a liberal Christian and I generally do not care what other people believe so long as they are not using their religion to harm other people or the environment.
Horrible.

Her life is on the line, the capability exists to save her life, and yet they can't do anything about it.
