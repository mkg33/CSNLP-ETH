This asshole had to have money stashed away somewhere and I donâ€™t mean bullshit crypto.
This guy had to have put away large amounts of cash / gold / diamonds.
He knew he was running this scam.
He had a way out.
I'm not into Crypto, but this situation is absolutely fascinating to me - a Hack/possible wholesale Theft/Abscondment/meltdown, whatever it is, lol.
Yeah, that's what my point was.
I'm rolling my eyes at the people who want to tax Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk on the value of their Amazon and Tesla shares.
He's been selling billions of dollars of Tesla stock over the last year, and he owes tax on any profit from those sales.
Taxing the value of unsold shares would destroy the stock market as we know it, because a lot of owners would be forced to sell shares of their companies every year just to pay the taxes on money they never actually had.
Not to mention that some smaller companies can see 100% spikes in their valutation in literally a single day and then go back to their previous value the day after that.
Now imagine if that spike occurred on whatever day is picked to calculate net worth and some owner of a smaller company has to pay tax on the temporarily inflated value of his shares.
That's just one example of how taxing stock value as opposed to stock profit would create many more problems than it solves (if it can even be said to solve anything).
