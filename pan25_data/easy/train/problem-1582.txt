My paternal grandmother worked in the cotton mill when she was 5 yrs old.
She stood on a box to do her work.
My mother picked cotton when she was 6.
Plus taking care of her siblings.
She was the oldest girl of 9.
My Mom tells me her earliest memory was standing on a chair stirring a pot on the stove and then washing dishes.
She has told me how on Sundays after church.
People would invite themselves to eat dinner.
Back then the men then the woman would eat first.
The kids got what was left.
She said at times there were only a few pieces of bread.
That she would give the smaller kids and do her and her brother would do without.
When she became an adult and had us.
She made sure we ate first.
She didn’t care what anyone else said.
My Mom holds a lot of Anger about how she was treated.
When she hears the news about how the republicans want to take us back to that time period.
She has a few choice words and gets really upset.
She’s 88 and it was a time when Women & Children didn’t have any rights and was treated like property.
