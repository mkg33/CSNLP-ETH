Why is a right-wing theory that even conservative legal scholars call obtuse and “indefensible” on the cusp of altering federal elections?

SCOTUS agrees with the Conservatives and limits the Judiciary's role in reviewing elections.
In other words this would be the first limit to be placed on Judicial Review which many conservatives have argues is overly broad and not what the Framers had intended.

Also, the Constitution explicitly calls out the Legislature's role in elections and not the Judiciary.
