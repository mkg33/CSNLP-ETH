There is literally only one "neoliberal" policy from the Clinton Administration.
This accusation is tired.
Neoliberal means something very specific, and no matter how many alt-righters join forces with literal communists, the definition is not going to change.
No.
Fraud requires you to be deprived of something, and the fraud must be intentional or negligent.
Even if you ignore the problem of realized damages, anything that involves the government behaving in the way that it's legally designed to act is going to be considered not intentionally deceitful or negligent, pretty much by definition, even if you misunderstand or misinterpret it.
Which is to say, if the "it was quickly taken back" part of this hypothetical happens because of legal process - a change of the law by Congress, a court decision, a new Republican president, etc.
- then it absolutely could not be considered fraud.
Not to mention, there's also the concept of "soveriegn immunity", which holds that the government can't be sued without its own consent.
