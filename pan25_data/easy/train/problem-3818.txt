Venezuela true government (not Maduro) is about to have a new leader, Guaido steps down and the US backs up the new elected leader.
This isn't about socialism versus capitalism.

Market Socialism absolutely includes economic planning.
It just allows limited private markets but most industries and natural resources are owned by the state.
The best example of a Market Socialist State was Yugoslavia and they absolutely had a planned Economy.
Cuba, which has adopted certain Market Socialist policies, allows a limited private market of good but still heavily uses state planning.
State planning is quite literally the hall mark of a socialist economy.
