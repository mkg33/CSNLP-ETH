Seconded.
Just want to add that video of that showed the 'executions' were because one of the last Russians 'surrendering' open fired, AND, a couple of them on the ground looked back as if they were waiting for a signal or to ensure it was happening.
At the very least it indicated they knew it was coming.
At that point it was self defense for the AFU and the Russians were all legitimate combatants.
This is Russian BS at its finest.
Well, unpunished outside of this whole thing being the single largest failure of a large global power in a war since 'Nam (the war on terror was surpassed in combatants killed within the first month or two), and making them the pariah nation of the second quarter of this century so long as China doesn't do anything monumentally stupid to Taiwan.
And yeah.
There are very legitimate geopolitical and military reasons why Russia doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO.
But guess what.
You cannot control what other countries do.
Overriding other country's self determination is the definition of imperialism.
And even ignoring the morals: If this had been a rousing success for Russia in military terms, it was still a bad idea.
NATO was slowly eroding.
Trump had crippled the trust Europe had on the US.
The world had grown weary of the US' constant imperialism, warmongering and disregard for human rights.
And then Russia goes on to remind Europe why they had tolerated the US' bullying for so long.
This was Putin's ego, his ambition for a legacy, overriding his geopolitical sense.
Had Russia stayed peaceful for a decade or two, NATO would have become unstable.
As is, NATO got their second wind.
