I see this along the lines of the same type of study that says BBQ causes cancer, the science is there and it probably does, but does my brief blip on this planet where big oil literally has poisoned the earth mean that not eating BBQ really will prevent me from getting cancer at any faster rate than all the other shit I’m exposed to?
Does not having a gas range, which basically every single high end restaurant and kitchen uses really reduce my potential for cancer so much?
I get that if you stack so many carcinogenic things up they will likely cause something sooner than later but at this point I’m more worried about the types of pesticides, chemical and fertilizers used in food processing being more likely to cause harm than gas ranges, especially when so many other gas appliances are in the mix as well.
No.
You're also heating the air enough to break down nitrogen molecules and produce nitrogen oxides as well as a little bit of carbon monoxide.
Totally.
That's why a one size fits all solution is ignorant to try to put in place.
Same with folks up in mountain towns.
Power can go out for weeks during a snowstorm.
They need gas to survive.
