I think because the US is so pro-gun, they often forget that there are still those of us out there that hate guns.
I don’t want to buy one, keep one in my house or even touch one.
I’m a liberal and I realize a lot of Maga people are fully armed.
I’m hoping the government and military (not local cops) step in to help us if there ever is a full out civil war type of situation.
I can’t imagine ever shooting anyone.
Part of my reason for hating them is I’m an elementary school teacher and I’ve seen what guns have done to our students and the constant fear they’ve created.
I don’t want to be a part of that.

And even if it’s true, they still lose.
Because they accused them.
