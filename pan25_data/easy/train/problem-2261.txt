The long awaited next big missile strike finally happened and it really wasn’t anything special, the number of missiles that was expected was vastly overblown, as it wasn’t the 120+ missiles that everyone was talking about, but only 69 and some Shaheds along with them.
It doesn’t seem that it did too much damage to our infrastructure, the problems with electricity are not widespread right now, and some blackouts are not due to the missile strike, but because some cities turned off electricity as preventive measures to lessen any possible damage.
27 BRIGADES?
In Bakhmut?
Bakhmut before war was 70 thousand city.
Considering that Ukrainian brigade is between 3 and 4 thousands soldiers it would mean that there are more soldiers in Bakhmut that were citizens before war.
Were are they living?
The streets should be full of soldiers in that case.
Over time missile harassments become pointless, counterproductive to national defense, expensive, and embarrassing.
Here we go!
I've theorized that M2 Bradley is a __FAR__ more important vehicle than M1 Abrams tank for Ukraine.
M2 Bradley is an IFV, infantry fighting vehicle.
Its primary goal is to provide infantry support.
Squads can load / unload from the vehicle.
Squads can shoot from inside the vehicle.
A rocket-launcher (including Javelin-like systems) and small 30mm auto-cannon equip the main armament.
