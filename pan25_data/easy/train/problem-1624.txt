The closer we get to default, the more interesting the options become, including declaring the debt limit unconstitutional and putting the pin back in the grenade once and for all.
So, the real question is, is enough of the GOP detached enough from reality to force McCarthy to not allow Congress to raise the debt limit and insulated enough from the need for money to push the US into default?
Sadly, I think the answer is yes.
If McCarthy allows a clean bill, he instantly gets removed by the Crazy Caucus.
If he doesn't, he presides over the greatest self-inflicted economic catastrophe in human history.
Yep.

Hope it works out for them one day.
