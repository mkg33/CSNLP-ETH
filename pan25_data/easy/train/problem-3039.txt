I'm happy your streetcar system works for you.
What they're proposing in Omaha will be too limited to serve the people well for how expensive it will be.
The Omaha city council is listening to the big money interests that will profit from this very limited streetcar proposal.
These interests have only recently managed to essentially take for free the land where the downtown library sat so Mutual of Omaha could build the tallest building in Omaha, much bigger than their entire workforce would need if consolidated and into an urban commercial office market so over saturated that a large percentage of it sits unused.
Yep.
Instead of funding a big, inflexible fixed grid of streetcars and waiting for its eventual completion, they could start right now by buying one bus for less than 500,000 dollars, put it on the street tomorrow, and change the route the day after tomorrow if that turned out to make better sense.
Then buy another bus.
And another.
Grow it and shift it as needed.
