They didn't mind COVID denial and anti vaxxer buggering up everything about the COVID response.
Yet the GOP top to bottom, denied the reality of an anguished death that consumed families and their assets.
Anti-vaxxing is here to stay for conservatives.
They've made rational, public health response a "personal freedom issue."
They knew they were literally killing off red hatters with kindful neglect cuz...it's more important to "stick it to the libs.
".
I think what this person is trying to say, and I agree with them on, is if Trump had actually won outright, he would have been exposed as a fraud and a loser in a second term, given that his economic policy would have had time to catch up with him, and the Republican Party itself would have lost a lot of power, except perhaps in the judiciary wing.
Trump would have had an even more unfavorable second term than W, given our current economic climate and the war in Ukraine, and might have even managed to get himself impeached AGAIN and removed from office if Dems had managed to take both chambers of Congress in these midterms, which almost certainly would have happened with him in office and Roe overturned.
