I grant that this is a dangerous road.
When a republican wins again we could see HIM use extraordinary measures to get done what they want.
But it's hard to spot an alternative that doesn't result in widespread and unnecessary economic pain.
It sucks that they way they want to win is to not fund things that have already passed through the process.
Refusing to fund things that have already passed is extremely anti-democracy.
Biden should frame it that way and simply threaten to do the coin if republicans won't fund already passed legislation.
Biden is now up against a republican party that will hold itself hostage to loony tune demands.
The inmates are almost literally running the asylum.
Democrats are in the minority in the House so there isn't much they can do.
The odds that republicans will break ranks to vote with democrats to pass a debt ceiling are very small now that a tiny minority (the true fringe edge of Fox news nutjobs) of them can cripple the Speaker and grind things to a halt.
Probably institutional investment types.
Could be from anywhere in the world ... bonds are basically an iou with interest fixed into them over whatever term they are sold as say 3, 5 or 10 years.
