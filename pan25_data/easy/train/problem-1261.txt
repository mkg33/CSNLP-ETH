Tbh every neighbouring ex soviet country hates Russians since generations now, and (pardon my generalisation but it is quite true) if you knew the average or below avg Russian, in a kind of superiority complex towards the other slavs they act the opposite of trying to rectify the fact.
What?
I’m not talking about the ones fighting, I’m talking about the ones running away from their dictatorship?
How tf is that the same as fighting for your country?
That's the intended purpose of granting people political asylum, saving them from actual political persecution.
A military draft doesn't violate any human rights by itself, and I'm not interested in saving Russians whose "political opposition" stems from selfishness and cowardice.
"Who said that?"
Krushchev snapped to the crowd.
And after a moment of tense silence he said in a softer voice, "that's why.
".
Unless a Russian can prove they're being persecuted by Russia on the basis of their identity or pre-existing political beliefs, they don't deserve political asylum anywhere on Earth, they should be returned where they belong to face the logical consequences of their government's policies.
So.
How hard do you think it'll be for most people to muster the courage to challenge a state that is willing to abduct and murder them?
Who is the most powerful figure or institution you've risked life or livelihood opposing?
Oh and being a conscript during peacetime doesn't count.
