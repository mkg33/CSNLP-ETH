In a prior career, I was the head developer for a FAA certified helicopter flight simulator (can log flight hours in it, so highly detailed sim).
When we were at Helicopter Association International Expo one year, we were approached by a handful of really excited Chinese business people, I was stoked to speak with them, was a huge language barrier but we got out google translate and had a bunch of laughs trying to get google to muddle through highly technical bits.
Eventually it emerged from the chat that they werent involved in a flight school or operator at all, but they really wanted to buy one of our sims.
Just one.
When I asked them how big their operation was, would they need more than one as they grow?
Did they have satellite operations?
etc etc... nope, they were carefully trying to not say they wanted just one so they could reverse engineer the whole thing and undercut a product we spent \15 million dollars developing.
I agree.
Maybe even a bit more cynically.
Challenges to established authority are rarely based on ideological purity.
It is more a matter of one person having power and another wanting it themselves.
How and why they throw out the old and take their place doesn't really matter.
It is just whatever gets thrown at the wall and happens to stick at the time.
