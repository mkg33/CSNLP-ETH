And then you've got people in the third world who's only concern is, how are they going to eat today.
They're NEVER going to be concerned with the environment.
It's never going to be on their radar.
And they're the majority.
History suggests quite a few possibilities: democracy, literacy, science, trade, peace, freedom, technology...
Sigh.
If only our population wasn't so horribly high.
We wouldn't be polluting as much, consuming as many resources, using so much land.
What is it, 7 billion going on 8?
We should have tried to limit it at 3 or 4, then we would at least have more time to work things out.
The problem is not unmitigated consumption (putting the blame on the individual), but exactly that being a corporate goal, unmitigated (corporate) greed, deregulation, regulatory capture.
The hell it isn't!
More people means an ever higher demand for food (tons of people say the meat industry is a major pollution source these days) and all sorts of products whose production involves pollution.
It means more natural areas like forests destroyed to make cities and farms, it means more and more factories, any number of which may disregard proper environmental practices.
It means more gas guzzling vehicles, not everyone buys electric vehicles.
