That's why it's increasingly about selling yourself as a service via fan engagement, patreon sponsors etc.
Not saying it's right - but it's what it is.
You fundamentally misunderstand why people pirate.
There are generally three reasons people pirate, price, convenience, and availability.
No way of knowing.
But even if it's 10 percent of the potential lost sales (just the ones I know about) then that's still 10 grand.
I'm trying to run a small business, really sucks how dismissive people are honestly.
You'll find a lot more people sympathetic to Musk or other billionaires than the guy who came up from poverty to make his own products.
Or maybe they just don't like hearing it because they would have to acknowledge something they did hurt hard working people, idk.
But worse not to say something has always been my motto.
In my experience of the last decades, piracy has essentially single-handedly created binge culture and generally raised a lot the bar for media consumption for millennials especially, essentially manufacturing the demand that has then been satisfied by streaming services, online shops like Steam, and so on so forth.
From all points of view it feels like volume of sales has ended up increasing as soon as the services have caught up and surpassed piracy's ability to make a wide enough choice of media available conveniently in digital format.
And every shift from this convenience and openness ends up resulting again in piracy becoming more desirable.
