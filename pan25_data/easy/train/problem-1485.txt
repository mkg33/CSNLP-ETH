Corporations can exploit illegal immigrants because these immigrants lack leverage.
They can undercut the American worker for the same job, and have to because if they don't have money they are at much greater risk.
This in turn creates a huge number of viscous externalities that lead to poverty, despair, and urban decay, both for the immigrants and Americans.
Illegals Immigrants have almost no incentive to attempt to invest in property or otherwise create long term wealth for instance-it can be taken from them at any moment.
It makes more sense to send money out of the economy to family elsewhere.
It's even good for the big corporations to employ illegal immigrants specifically because it's illegal, because they can then manipulate the system so that they aren't persecuted for this but instead sell out smaller corporations that attempt to compete using the same tactic.
I don’t get this dude.
Does he not realize that Texas, perhaps as much or more than any other state absolutely depends on immigrant labor?
It’s hard to imagine that big republican donors and employers aren’t like “hey, chill out” like Florida did.
I’m not making a right or wrong argument, just stating the facts.
