Many have said this is because NATO and the USA are scared of Russia since it has nuclear capabilities.
That’s fine.

We will get there eventually don’t worry we are currently busy fucking over mega corporations before they take over the world, dealing with global warming on our end, helping Ukraine as much as we can both military and legally as much as we can and trying to eliminate any dumb conservative leaders left so our countries can get along better, it’s a long process because there are a LOT of countries but we will get there.
We are sending 50 bradley m2s.
55 mrap, 100 apc, 138 hmwvs, 18 self propelled 155 howtizer.
