you think that there is a parliament.
those are incompetent servants of Orban.
Dictators like this (and in my country as well, that's how I know) fill their ranks with people who'd never get there without their help, it's the classic Machiavelli.
Then they get dictated what to do, and the dictator (see the semantic connection there?)
use it as an excuse because the representatives chosen by the people have spoken and he "can't go against people".
In reality they can't take a leak without permission and even their wives are not in illusion that those people decide anything.
Good analysis.
I'm also against the discussion of the reasons once the option of choice is granted because the idea of a choice is that we can live with all outcomes.
All of a sudden someone uses their freedom and becomes a target for it because the choice now seems to be conditional.
Work with them to resolve the differences if the outcome is important for you or drop it, not much sense in name calling other than creating more enmity.
