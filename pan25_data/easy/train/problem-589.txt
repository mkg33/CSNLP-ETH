I think for a lot of people, especially people who are beaten down, marginalized, and poor their entire lives, they come to a watershed moment where they realize their lot in life will never get better than it already is.
They get angry and bitter about it, but they don't really have an outlet, they can't strike at the ones responsible for their living conditions, they live too far away.
They can't strike at the proxies (local government/police/etc) nearby, to do so almost certainly ends with them dead or in a worse place than they are currently.
So when they're given an officially sanctioned target for all of their rage and bitterness, they take the emotions caused by their oppressors out on their new targets because they are "allowed" to.
Absolutely insane.
We need more boycotts and sanctions not just against Russia, but also against all its allies and trade partners.
It's time to punish the big ones, India and China, who are feeding the Russian war machine with money, parts and supplies.
