Thirty or even twenty years ago, the PLAN wasn't really a significant threat to the US Navy.
But they'd transformed from a brown water navy to a green water navy into the beginnings of a competent blue water navy.

China’s definitely far stronger than Russia at this point and after the war in Ukraine even more so Russia will only ever be China’s lackey now, and China wants to further dominate their neighbors as shown by their ridiculous maritime claims in the South China Sea, and they are succeeding both economically and militarily, and to do that they need both soft power and hard power like the US so that means both a big economy and a big military.
It doesn’t mean they have to use it just that it has to exist and actually work i.e.
be at least semi competent.
All the Indian shills raging about the US selling weapons to Indias enemy, Pakistan (something the Soviets did too, by the way) 60 years ago, watching Russia train with their enemy China, after selling China half their military over the years and help develop them the rest (voluntary and involuntary): "I sleep".
