It's really hard to fix because for literally decades those who embellish got promoted and those who didn't got fired.
When the time came to do shooting trials those who were honest about sub-par results looked really bad compared to those who didn't do the practice and competency tests and lied about it.
Who gets promoted?
The ones who report the best results, of course.
So, basically you need to rebuild the whole army by promoting Private Conscriptivich to the level of their competence, since Colonel Corruptski and General Olicarchich have so much muscle memory of covering their ass with "slight" embellishments and getting promotions by simply out embellishing everyone else.
It's a process that will take years, especially with the Darwinian training regime adopted by the Russians.
Seriously?
I'm frigging cracking up laughing.
That dude needs his head examined in a hospital on the sixth floor, and you know what happens on the sixth floor.
Putin miscalculated.
He wants to freeze the situation, so he can build the military he thinks he needs to subdue Ukraine and then come back and do it all again.
