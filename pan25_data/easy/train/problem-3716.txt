China insists that Taiwan is a part of China ruled by an illegitimate government, not that China and Taiwan are politically identical.
That is why China calls for reunification.

Best 500 Euro I ever spent.
Then we even got a video of thanks from the soldiers on the front lines.
I could see the stuff I bought in it.

We can of course relax our definition of "China" to be more inclusive, for example, by referring to a cultural and historical concept of "China", which perhaps may include all lands of all historical dynasties, such as the Great Qing, or the Mongol Empire (Yuan Dynasty).

Hard plastic dishware.
Other stuff like instant coffee.
