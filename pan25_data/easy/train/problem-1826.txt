Germany offered to deliver some tanks/IFVs as replacements for Soviet tanks that countries sent to Ukraine - which made sense, especially in the early stages of the war, because provided the Ukrainians with hardware they're already familiar with and didn't need additional training.
This wasn't the first thing that happened?
Poland wanting to send Leopards and Germany's approval have been in the news for some time now.
How was this not step 0?
Worked well with all countries that were offered it except Poland, with which the German government couldn't agree to terms - allegedly Poland had riddiculous demands like replacing the old rustbuckets they were giving away which were on schedule to be replaced anyways 1:1 by the most up-to-date Leopard version, which even the Bundeswehr has just a very limited number and the amount Poland was asking for was not even produced.
You might be 100% right in this case, I'm for sure biased here.
It's just hard for me to believe that it's not just another "west BAD" for the upcoming elections.
