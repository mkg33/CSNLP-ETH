Bolsonaro actually put the military in charge of reducing deforestation and it didn't helped at all.
That's mainly because the military kinda want the deforestation.
They like to build roads and infra there, to make it populated, so "France or U.S don't invade the amazon!
".
I think Lula is going to be way better with regards to the Amazon than Bolseanro, my basic point here is simply that's it's more about of resources allocated to combating deforestation than is about just simply regulation...
How so?
Would not preexisting laws preventing some company from digging up some random farmer's front lawn still apply here?
So long as the indigenous are normal citizens who go to work, pay their taxes, and abide rhe laws, why should they be treated any differently from any other citizen or group of them?
If laws are being broken on the part of these companies, then enforce them.
Heck, I'd go further and suggest that if a company is a repeat offender, then they should be seized by the state and have their assets auctioned off with the proceeds being used to undo the damage done by them.
