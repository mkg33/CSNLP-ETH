You’re basically guaranteed the ability to have a recognized marriage as long as you’re able to travel to a protected state and get married there.
However, not all lgbtq individuals have the resources or income to get married in another state.
While I’m lucky to live in a blue state, it is really heartbreaking to think about the hundred of thousands if not millions of lgbtq+ individuals that won’t be able to get married in their home state and will have to spend even more time and resources to receive the same protection as straight, cis-gender Americans.
But that's not how it works.
A law can't just give the thumbs up to ignoring an amendment.
If a state tries to, even if it were to cite this law, it would still be in violation of the 14th Amendment.
There's also a nuance here: How far can the federal government go in forcing states to do something?
If they go too far, there's plenty of legal avenue to challenge it as federal overreach.
Making it an argument of simply telling states to apply their laws equally, instead of trying to supersede them, is a much safer bet.
