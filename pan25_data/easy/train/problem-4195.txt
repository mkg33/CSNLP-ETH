Aw, thanks.
I hate teaching the present perfect.
The action itself doesn't have to continue, but the affect can.
For example, "I've seen "Jaws" and I will never swim in the ocean".
That one can be tough for some learners.
Do you teach English?
It's kind of a moot point if he only has one passport, but if he ever wanted to travel to Russia, he must visit his consulate first and get up to date papers (no doubt paying a bunch of fees too if not worse - not declaring yourself as a dual citizen is criminal now I believe) as entering Russia with a non Russian passport as a Russian citizen will get you in trouble.
Yup!
Putin doesn't just give people cool shit and not ask for favors.

Snowden denies he's working for the Russians in any way, but either that's a lie or he's unknowingly training new Russian hackers.
I mean, he doesn't have to physically teach.
They could have planted all kinds of surveillance on his computer and just watch what he does without him knowing.
That's why I think in one fashion or another Snowden is aiding the Russians either with or without his knowledge and consent.
