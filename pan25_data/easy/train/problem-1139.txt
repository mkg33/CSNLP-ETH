1999 Kargil War: The US began resupplying Pakistan in the late 80s (because time heals all wounds) and in 1998 both India and Pakistan had successfully tested a nuclear bomb.
So Pakistan decided to test their new strenh and picked up the border signs and moved a few meters into India.
There's literally absolutely no reason to do this other than that Pakistan was trying to flex its new nuclear muscles.
India responded by launching a military operation to reclaim their few meters of space and to create a new de-militarized space.
The Indians stopped there and by the time the US negotiators showed up the fighting was all over.
The US were dumbfounded because they had arrived to make a position that they'd support Pakistan and Russia would support India (the traditional result) and instead they found themselves unable to support Pakistan.
Are they?
How much experience does India actually have in designing tanks?
Their last tank wasn't all that good and came in so overweight it is functionally useless against one of their main foes - China.
Doesn't work well in the cold and too heavy to get to the front lines fast.
