And her main defense is that she is an “artist”, which is horse shit.
Web design, photography, and cake making, the three that seem to pop up in these cases, are services.
If you have like a catalogue of cakes.or a collection of website templates, are pre-set contracts or an hourly rate for photography that are available for the public to view, you can’t deny those services because of the costumers sexual orientation.

Every service has some amount of activity at or after point of sale.
Restaurants are only engaging in labor after you order, and it would seem insane to try to defend “sorry our chef won’t make that linguini for a gay couple.”.
Everyday services?
Or specific services pertaining to specific act that goes against the business owners religious liberties?
