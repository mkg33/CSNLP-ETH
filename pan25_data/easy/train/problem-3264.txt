Putting the NATO argument aside for a moment, they'd probably choose the land route.
It's what they've always done in the 12+ times Russia has invaded Poland.
The land is relatively flat with minor obstacles so it's not like mountainous or major waterways will keep invading armies away.
There's really no point to a Baltic sea incursion considering the risk of losing armies to naval battles, the only strategic location they have to protect is the exclave of Kaliningrad which they should able to hold off with sufficient naval support.
Historically Russia has always bordered Poland, and still does considering it keeps Belarus as a puppet state.
There's a reason Poland has been considered the punching bag of Eastern Europe due to it sitting right in between major powers with very little protective geography.
Honestly, should war between NATO and Russia break out, Poland is probably gonna have it the worst.
People mention nato etc...
I don't think nato even matters, tbh.
I don't think people in other places of the world understand the generational hate the Baltic states have for Russia and their bullshit, Poland being one of the main ones.
