I don't think that you understand how much stupid bullshit is marked as "classified".
Daily schedules.
Personal correspondence received from ambassadors or foreign dignitaries.
Daily briefing material that doesn't even contain any sensitive intelligence information.
On any given day, the Vice President and his staff were likely handed dozens of documents marked as classified, mixed in with hundreds of documents that weren't classified.
I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of Congressional and Executive personnel have some quantity of classified materials that have ended up forgotten in a box somewhere for longer than they should have.
Think about the number of times that you personally have accidentally misplaced important documents or mail.
The only reason why this is even news is because something similar happened with Trump and it took the FBI raiding his house to get him to turn over the documents despite months of requests and waiting for him to just do the right thing.
comical.
hope we enter an era where both parties expose each others bullshit left and right and everyone can finally realize they're all up to no good.
