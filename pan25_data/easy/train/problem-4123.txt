I'm a bit doubtful on whether this will happen though.
It would probably cause issues with Turkey, and with the US sending Patriots to Ukraine now, it's unclear how many extra batteries they can give to other countries, even on a loaner basis.
For what it's worth, Greece recently stated they would send their S-300 and other Soviet air defense systems to Ukraine if America would put a Patriot battery on Crete (so it would still be American-owned).
That S-300 system originally belonged to Cyprus but caused a major row with Turkey and so they traded it to Greece for other systems.
Greece apparently also suggested they would trade or work out some deal with other Soviet-era air defense systems they have, a number of which would be beneficial to Ukraine.
.
Also the modifications were probably minimal, they're probably just fired with a tablet, without any changes to the avionics, it probably doesn't even interface with the RADAR, because the HARM itself can function as its own sensor as long as its shot in the right-ish direction.
Peace was tried.
Russia wants to keep the territories they’ve invaded and illegitimately annexed.
As you can imagine, that peace “deal” wasn’t popular in Ukraine.
The war goes on.
