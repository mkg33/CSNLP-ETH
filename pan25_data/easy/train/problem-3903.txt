Technically, yeah.
The West is largely responsible for total, historical CO2 emissions (by virtue of being richest and first to have the new technology).
So, technically yes.
"According to the United Nations definition, countries within Eastern Europe are Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and the western part of the Russian Federation (see: European Russia map).
".
"Sudden Stratospheric Warming".
It's basically a collapse of the upper stratospheric polar circulation.
In most of the Northern Hemisphere that gets cold (mostly away from mountains) the all-time record lows were usually set during one of these.
It happens about once every 2 years.
While i do believe polution is bad, though not the apocalyptical lenh some of the fear mongers go to, i also find their solution to be as bad or worse than their system of predictions, electric cars are not a green solution, their batteries are a worse environmental hazard than gas with worse performance, its also how politcians want impose a "green tax" which will hurt the poor to middle income population than said politicians and the rich (ain't that right justin Trudeau ?
).
While blame is debatable (differences in tech levels, alternatives available, knowledge of consequences, etc.
), total emissions are just a question of estimation and fact, not opinion.
And the numbers are pretty clear on that.
