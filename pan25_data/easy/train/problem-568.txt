"The Carlson Report has been published now.
The leftist media that has been pushing their narrative about Jan 6th for years has finally had the other side shown correcting them.
They all have access to the videos that have been published in the Report, and they are welcome to make use of the segments presented.
I see no need for them to delve into thousands of hours of footage to just push their narrative and keep going on about Jan 6th, when it should be put to rest at this point and real issues discussed.
Where are their answers on immigration, the debt, healthcare and things that really effect people?

I don't like thinking like a conspiracy theorist, but turning over all the footage from the 1/6 capitol building attack to an overtly partisan media outlet that pushes obvious Russian propaganda sounds really fishy.
That groyper Manson girl wanted to sell Pelosi's laptop to the Russians, I believe, and then there were the tours and tour "guides" pushing people further in while giving directions.
How many people were acting on their behalf, other than the obvious?
McCarthy is bought, sold, and paying out.
