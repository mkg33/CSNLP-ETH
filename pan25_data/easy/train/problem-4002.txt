Trump often speaks in incomprehensible gibberish.
It's far easier to see this if you do not listen to Trump but instead read transcripts (or tweets/posts).
One hearing Trump must interpret this gibberish to assign meaning.
The most common approach is to ask oneself "what would I have meant for that stream of nonsense to come out of my mouth?"
which leads to the magic.
This approach means you naturally assume Trump meant what you believe since you're filtering his nonsense through all your own biases, beliefs and worldviews.
This happens almost instantaneously.
Then you look at this interpretation (which you created subconsciously) and stand amazed that this man, this Trump, speaks directly to your heart, says what you always wanted to say and "says it like it is".
