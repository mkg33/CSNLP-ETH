It's not easy to get some country into NATO due to unanimity requirements (see the relatively uncontroversial joining of Sweden and Finland, even that is a bit bumpy).
There was no direct political pressure to let Ukraine in quickly, there would've definitely been resistance by various NATO members.
Ukraine's military was in disastrous shape (thanks to Russian-backed governments) in 2014 and was only slowly improving, certainly not NATO standard before 2020.
There was also the problem of occupied Crimea, despite the meme, territorial disputes are not a complete blocker but it would've been a major stumbling block.
Unfortunately.
At least in the US, solar doesn't work when the grid goes down unless you have a battery system.
They make you install your system that way so you don't kill a lineman when he thinks the power is shut off.
Yes, undoubtedly.
But first thing first, now the most important thing is fuck Putler and his monsters off of Ukraine.
Seems like there is still a long way to achieve the goal, cos ruzzian animals won't leave by themselves.
Sigh.
