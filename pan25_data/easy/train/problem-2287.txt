Honestly the UK is on a trajectory of doom and I don't see how anyone will fix it.
The pandemic, the war made things even worse.
Maybe it's just like in 2008 when everything looked like the end of times and after a few years it will get better.
In the last few months, I go to Sainsburys, I can't buy a coke because half the time they are out of stock.
For about3 weeks straight my local Shell had no fuel whatsoever, it was just empty pumps despite it being open.
Some local shops don't get shit they order for weeks upon weeks.
Well the glorious Tory politicians the UK had seemingly burned or attempted to burn every possible bridge with the EU, the probable future Labour government is wanting the Tory vote so they’re pretending to be anti-Brexit so that’s a nope (but at the very least they’ll be easier to deal with) and I’m not knowledgable on how far we’ve drifted from the EU (I’m sure it’s not by a lot as we specifically have clauses in the TCA that prevents it, kind of) but working on realigning (and possibly signing up to new laws as a full EU member) with the EU will take time.
