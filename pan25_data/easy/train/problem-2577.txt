>Pevkur also suggested Russia would learn from what it has experienced in Ukraine.
"We have no reason to believe that the threat from Russia is somehow reduced or that the threat to NATO is reduced.
".
Only thing Russia hasn't seen significant depletion in functional combat abilities is rotary aircraft, only lost just over 10% of all Ka-52s and those can operate to a limited extent within AA covered airspace so they arnt as dependent upon dedicated SEAD aircraft.
Where did I say that?

You don't seem to be following.
Here it is very simply: Russia bribing Kadyrov to stop fighting ended the second Chechen war, not the Russians learning from the first Chechen war and fixing their military.
If they had done that then they wouldn't be in this position in Ukraine.
German reconstruction post-WWII followed its total humiliation and attendant soul-searching.
Russia is just not there yet, as there has been no fighting at home and nationalism / fascism is still a majority opinion.
A grinding humiliation in Ukraine and maintenance of sanctions for the medium term is the best possible outcome for the West at this point.
