The problems at USPS aren’t only in VT, it is nationwide.
Bills, critical medications, etc.
are delayed by weeks in some areas.
DeJoy has been silent about these severe problems across the US.
Postal workers aren’t to blame, they are short staffed in the extreme.
My question is why is DeJoy still there?
When a leader deliberately and systematically cripples an essential service, they should be ousted.
The Postal Board has that power but hasn’t acted or commented about it to my knowledge.
Representatives and Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, have been met with silence when seeking solutions and explanation from DeJoy.
This is the plan.
Curtail delivery to smaller population areas, then gradually go bigger.
Soon, everyone will go to private (DeJoy owned or political donor owned) delivery services.
Fuck up virtually the only part of US government that works reliably and consistently.
