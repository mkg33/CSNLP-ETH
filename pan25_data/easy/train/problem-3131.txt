If you leave a store and then I call it suspicious because you didn't come back, does that make sense?
Maybe you left home?
Maybe you left the country?
The correct word is unfortunate, not suspicious and suspicious creates issues.
The issue is the misuse of the word suspicious.
That creates issues in society.
There's nothing annoying about being able to articulate yourself properly.
You don't understand the definition of suspicious and you also don't mind the residual effect such a misleading comment makes.
That makes you ignorant.
Edit: For the ignorant down voters.
These people died of carbon monoxide poisoning with absolutely nothing to say otherwise.
There's nothing suspicious about that, it's unfortunate.
This article is useless, but there are significantly more detailed articles available.
Oh I'm sheltered?
That's cute.
I never said it was as violent etc.
As Mexico.
I said there are shitty places everywhere.
Carbon monoxide poisoning.
Airbnbs and Mexican law do not require carbon monoxide detectors.
Bring a portable one during your visit, even if the listing says the host has one.
