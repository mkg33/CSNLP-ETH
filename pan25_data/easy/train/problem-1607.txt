I still believe it comes down to how logistic and production fare on the battlefield rather than firepower and tactics.
Sure these tanks would help however russian logistic is still holding.
Despite the terrorist designation PKK members and sympathizers have been allowe to freely operate in Sweden, launching demonstrations while openly carrying symbols of a terrorist-designated group, raising money through various organizations for said group (money which will eventually go into killing people in Turkey) and Sweden refused to repatriate people wanted on terrorism-related charges back to Turkey before.
Is there sauce on that?
Every Desert Storm article seem to boast Iraq had a powerful Tank corp and such, but it was their lack of Air capabilities that done them in.
Not necessarily.
Ukraine is definitely better organized, but Russia has way more people and larger numbers of shitty equipment.
Ukraine is definitely benefiting strongly from western supplies creating breakthroughs in key areas, but with complex systems like vehicles they really aren't getting enough to equip nearly their whole army for the most part.
These tanks are about as many as would be in two US tank battalions, but that is not counting replacements for tanks destroyed in fighting so realistically this will be enough for a single battalion.
