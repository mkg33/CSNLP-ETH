REDMAP was created in 2010 - what happened after the 2012 autopsy was a combination of two things.
First, the 2014 midterms were the lowest turnout elections since 1942, and provided a massive gain for Republicans in Congress.
This helped solidify the notion that lowering turnout was a path to electoral success (Republicans have always been doing this, but 2014 was a case study in how to do it harder).
The path forward from there was to make inroads with socially conservative minorities, particularly Latinos, and do everything possible to suppress Democratic leaning constituencies.
Iâ€™ll save you the time.
Georgia has a Republican-controlled state legislature that was pissed that they lost not one, but TWO Senate run-off races in early January 2021.
They found that early voters disproportionately backed the Democratic candidates, so they significantly shortened the window for early voting for runoffs.
Oh!
That makes sense.
It's a shame election day isn't an arbitrarily picked day otherwise they could make sure everyone got rest AND protected the rights of their citizens.
Damn, what a pickle...
