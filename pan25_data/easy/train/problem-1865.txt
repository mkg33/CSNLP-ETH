For that same reason Europe couldn't eat many things, because they became highly dangerous.
In Europe bugs where exposed to a huge amount of pathogens and contaminants, so you wouldn't be able to eat one without risking it being covered in crap.
Also you were limited in what parts of the animals you could eat, not only because the animal lived in very toxic conditions, but also because the way they handled the meat was highly unhygienic and only the hardiest parts of the animal could survive, and even then only with burning (why do you think we sear steaks?
).
But insects can easily be bred and for a relatively low energy investment return a lot of nutrients, this could make fish farming much more viable and profitable which in return could cut down on fishing in the wilderness.
I had the same thought.
It's often played up like society eating insects is a sign of societal downfall.
When really that might be a staple part of a healthy human diet one day.
especially for something like space travel when protein would be a premium to grow in space.
