Electing a new speaker in the house, and then promptly voting for a different rules package that includes something a long the lines of "a motion to vacate the speaker can only be called if a bipartisan group of 40, 20 from the minority and 20 from the majority, call to do so", or "to vacate the speaker, every member of the house must call to do so" would essentially stop the republican party from being able to vacate the speaker at that point, as it would require the minority cauces (dems) to join in on it.
They can also just vote for a rules package that just doesn't allow for the speaker to be vacated during the 118 Congressional term, meaning it would have to change only upon death, registration, or after the next election cycle when the new congressional term starts.
Obviously something like this won't just happen, but it's possible if Dems want to play dirty.
It would also call into question what designates someone as a member of the Minority or majority party, but that chaos could be enough to grind the house to a halt, and stop it from really doing anything substantial over the next two years.
No faux investigations, no virtue signaling legislation, etc...
Yep.
I’m still salty about the Iran deal.
It was a good deal.
And even if not, certainly better than no deal and letting them do whatever they want.
But Obama did it, so have to undo it.
1)Emergencies happen.
People have personal emergencies happen all the time, even politicians.
During the speakership vote, Republican Wesley Hunt’s wife had a child and Democrat David Trone had foot surgery.
Life circumstances get in the way and may force a rep to miss a vote.
