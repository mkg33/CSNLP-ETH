One missing “not” can have a huge impact.
He may have followed up with “they’re going to free themselves,” but the damage is done.
The first part of what he said will be broadcast over and over.
Given that the US intervened in Iran before, people will easy believe this is only happening because of the US.
Plenty of Iranians already believe that and this will only add legitimacy to it.
Lots of people will think it was a Freudian slip.
“Meddling elsewhere” is an American economic necessity.
American weapons production and logistics chain support employs millions across the globe.
The Russo-Ukraine war is sustaining this economy to an extent, but it will not last forever.
Whether the target is Iran or some other unfortunate nation, the US military industrial system needs constant war to function.
So whether it’s a good idea or not we must always be in some overseas operation.
Mmmmmm.
We tried that once.
Something about a Shah in the 50s.
It's a large part of the reason they chant Death to America now.
