The worst option is 3, the fascist government cracks down on the population and has enough control of the military that it turns into something similar to the US invading Afghanistan = complete instability with constant gorilla style attacks against the now invading government by the civilian population.
That part isn't true.
The clause they cite includes that federal law overrules them.
Agreed on the rest though.
Do you think the apathy is also a result of a coordinated effort to damage concepts around the role government can play in people's lives, and possibly partly a result of a similarity coordinated effort to degrade the quality of public education in the US?
If this does come to pass that's my hope.
It would allow several left leaning states to go on a gerrymandering spree, solidify control, and hopefully get to a point where we can throw this bullshit out.
