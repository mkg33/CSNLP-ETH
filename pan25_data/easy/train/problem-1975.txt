It wasn’t.
Could have been worse, the Soviets wanted an explicit show trial, the western allies actually did their best.
But the fact it took Nimitz intervening to stop Dönitz going down for waging unrestricted submarine warfare shows that there was still an element of just trying to find them guilty regardless of hypocrisy, trying to make things crimes for one side but not the other.
