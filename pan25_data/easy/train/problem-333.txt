Imperial Japan used to have a policy that if the battle was ongoing they wouldn’t stop to assist their own wounded soldiers.
This led to higher than necessary casualties in the invasion of China in the 1930s but then in the battle of Khalkin Gol it resulted in a staggering death toll so bad that Japan abandoned the policy.
Med evac isn’t just a moral thing to do but rather it’s an essential part of a well functioning military.
Civilian criminals become military criminals.
More importantly, it goes against how a professionalized military fights - you have to be able to trust each level of the chain of command, from your teammates on up, in order to execute intricate combined-arms operations.
It takes training, often years of it, and it takes a camaraderie that you simply cannot create by pulling people out of prison jumpsuits and shoving them into cammies.
Precisely.
To make matters worse Russia also doesn’t waste med evac resources on them so if a prison recruit is injured they’re often left to die unless they can get themselves out.
