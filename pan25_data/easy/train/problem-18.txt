A multirole fighter capable of aerial combat as well as ground and maritime strike, the Su-57 incorporates stealth, supermaneuverability, supercruise, integrated avionics, and substantial internal payload capacity.
Yep.
The F35 is stealth, but can be detected by long range radar.
They'll know its there, but the f35s stealth is more about reducing cross section of targeting radar, which it's decently proficient at.
Targeting radar is turned on in 30 sec increments, and has to be relocated after 2 activations to avoid being targeted.
The F117 that was shot down was caused by both the F117 and the radar commander breaking with convention.
The 117 was flying a repeat route for whatever stupid reason, and the radar commander turned the radar on for a third time, and got the radar lock when the 117s doors were open and it was vulnerable to a lock.
