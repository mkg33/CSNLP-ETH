Because of this printing (and anticipated printing) the GHS collapsed against the dollar.
Foreign investors dumped their Eurobonds, local retail investors abandoned the GHS and bought hard currency instead.
As a result their foreign exchange reserves plummeted this year.
However, in normal circumstances I would argue their external position is sustainable as they run a trade surplus, get reasonable FDI volumes and are well integrated into international markets.
It’s not about that.
It’s about China gaining as much leverage as possible.
There’s going to be different tresholds for everyone but holding a debt that the other party cant pay over them is one of the best diplomatic leverages you could have.
And dont think that’s the only leverage they have.
This is a long-term plan where China no doubt will be able to cash in massive strategic rewards.
Maybe not for everyone they loan money to but some.
Let's say USA factories relocates to Cambodia?
well you'd need to spend massively to build new factories.
