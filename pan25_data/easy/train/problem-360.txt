I'll try to answer my own question here: the fears that the GOP stoke allows people to demonize "those people", which is somehow acceptable, especially if it's not overtly phrased as racist (and even sometime when it is).
But those that the Dems stoke require targeting of groups that we're told are off limits.
Climate change and income inequality require us to target the rich and "that's not good for the economy", while reproductive rights require targeting christofascists and that's "religious discrimination".
Its only fare game.
They made Trumps life hell for 4 years with countless investigation's and witch hunts including the Russia Dossier which of course ended up phony.
Now it is time to return the favor at look at the Biden's corruption.
What goes around comes around.
You think the Democrats did anything except try to ruin Trump for 4 years ?

Exactly.
Dems had a filibuster proof majority in 2008 because they had a coalition with southern Dems, which eventually got replaced by GOP reps due to changing political alignments.
