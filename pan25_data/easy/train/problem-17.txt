>The number of casualties in the flood remains disputed and estimates have been revised by the Chinese government and other researchers in the decades after the event.
There is no way of accurately assessing the casualties: much of the population, including officials, had already fled, leaving no government control and no one to count the dead.
In the shifting battles between bandits, Nationalists, Communists, and Japanese, counting casualties was not a high priority.
The Nationalist government, after initially claiming that the breach was caused by Japanese bombing, used the heavy casualties to demonstrate the scale of sacrifice required of the Chinese people; it claimed that 12 million people had been affected by the flood, and in 1948 it estimated the number of deaths, including hundreds of thousands of Japanese who perished during the flooding, at 800,000.
A 1994 PRC (People's Republic of China) official history of the war put the dead in the flood at 900,000 and the number of refugees at nearly 10 million.
Scholars exploring the archives now give much lower figures: 400,000–500,000 dead, 3 million refugees, and 5 million people affected (another estimate puts the number of dead at 500,000, and the number of homeless at 500,000).
I hope so.
This is absurd.
All us NATO countries are watching fucking Russia commit war crimes and openly trying to genocide everyone in Ukraine.
Putin is an evil bastard and NATO needs to figure out how to stop him.
Now.
YESTERDAY No more.
