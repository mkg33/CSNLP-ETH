So he's either a rube who is easily duped by the people he supposedly loathes (in which case what a dope to get elected) or he is so politically opportunistic and invertebrate that he'll do this insipid political theater every chance he gets to stay in office and not suffer the wrath of any part of the constituency.
It’s a yes or a no.
If he’s that stupid maybe he shouldn’t be in charge of anything, anywhere, ever.

Nobody tricked anybody.
He knew what was in that bill.
The bill was heavily publicized before the vote as being a bill to protect same sex marriage.
They're just doing the usual bullshit of trying to have their cake and eat it too.
Now, he's claiming he was tricked and doesn't support it.
At some point in the future, it will be convenient for him to point out that he voted for the bill.
That point will probably be when someone accuses him of being racist.
He'll point to the fact that he voted for this bill, which also protects interracial marriage, as proof that he's not racist.
