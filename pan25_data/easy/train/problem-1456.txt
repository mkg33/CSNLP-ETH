I'd rather have a constitutional monarchy with a powerless King any day of the week over a fixed Presidential two-party system with little to no checks and balances and mostly unfettered executive powers.
After watching the incompetence that was Donald Trump remain in office for four years, believe me, the rest of us are the ones laughing.
Constitutional monarchies have stood the test of time much longer.
You know when you hear about governments being taken down over no confidence and elections being held?
That's a good thing, that's democracy at work.
When was the last time your government went down and was re-elected after going completely stupid?
Never?
Oh okay.
The professional commentary I've heard and read has been that Sweden's Gripen E is the best fit, since it was designed for exactly the conditions Ukraine is now in: a prolonged defensive war against Russia where air assets are distributed throughout the country to avoid being targeted, and are designed to operate out of rough conditions for brief missions, without the opportunity to get to high altitude.
You don't need to.
NATO countries are, and always have been, capable of operating independently and unilaterally from the whole of NATO.
In total, only a maximum of three countries need to agree to the plan.
The country supplying the air frames, the country providing bases, and (if applicable) the country that supplies are being sent through.
