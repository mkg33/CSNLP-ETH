Thanks for providing a reference.
These things are usually missing when having conversations regarding slave wages.
The unpaid wages is an outrage though.
That wasn't their point, anyway the reason things cost so little are because hundreds of other retailers knock their prices down repeatedly to compete with each other so they get chosen, it's not like a company went to a retailer and forced them to sell for such small prices, they simply picked from the options that those retailers were offering, because they all want to get picked they're not going to ask for a wage befitting a completely different country, otherwise another retailer will swoop in with a lower price and get the business, as that happens over and over you eventually get to prices relative to the country they're being made in.
This is the exact count for the migrant of Qatar.
Here is an interview where the author of the initial Guardian article (Pete Pattison) explains that the number is every death of a foreign worker in Qatar, even a doctor who dies on an accident.
In his own words:
Read the article - In February the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) said over 1,000 factories producing garments for Nike, Zara, Gap, Abercrombie and many other brands, collectively failed to pay garment workers 60 million dollars over the course of the pandemic, the largest wage theft in global garment manufacturing history.
I am not denying it.
I am denying the out of context number of deaths that gets repeated everywhere.
