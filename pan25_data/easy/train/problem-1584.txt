I'm not sure we're actually agreeing here unless I misunderstood you.
Calling it Poland springs brings more awareness to it also being an evil company because it is the same as its evil parent, nestle.
The way OP on this comment thread was corrected was not helpful or informative or really even relevant if the actual lawsuit is with Poland springs.
And OP's reaction hints that this issue is one that hits a nerve.
Maybe if instead, the poster attempting to "inform," which may have come of as condescending correction, said something along the lines of.
"Suing Poland springs is essentially suing nestle which owns them, so a decade seems pretty short for trying to get any traction in a lawsuit.
