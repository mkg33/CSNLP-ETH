Bhai there were other periods as well also we had good relations with Ukraine as well a lot of our military parts were manufactured there as well along with us being the largest export destination of Ukrainian edible oil, also US supported us in the 62 war and then subsequent army modernisation.
WTF are you talking about?
Something better than nothing?
Then a list of US presidents and a PM of England?
What do they have to do with the original post?
is quite large due to a large population and a more developed services sector India is a lower middle income country and even there we are in the bottom 50% with Nigeria which saw an inflation rate of 20.52% due to this war) remember average Mexican is 2.5X and Albanian 2X richer than the average Indian in purchasing power, that has not seen a massive debt and inflation problem due to the sanctions, add to that our biggest rival growing ever larger with whom we have active border disputes with where people have died, yeah the government was going to choose to profit from it that too when they can negotiate the oil for $49 per barrel with lows even reaching $32 per barrel.
