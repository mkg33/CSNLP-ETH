Rep. Andy Barr‘s (R-Ky.) resolution to reverse the DOL rule will hit the floor next week, according to a senior House Republican aide.
The rule allows retirement plan decision-makers to consider environmental, social, and corporate governance investment criteria as long as they are in the best financial interest of plan participants.
Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers in the House have introduced a bill that would explicitly permit retirement plans to consider socially conscious investment factors.
The dueling legislative alternatives illustrate the polarizing nature of ESG investing on Capitol Hill and how workplace retirement plans have become the latest front in a partisan political war.
What?
Corporate America, especially the finance industry, welcomes ESG open armed.
Now, maybe oil companies are against but can ensure you most want this.
They specifically want a standardized measurement.
And ultimately, that’s what this is all about.
They want a standardized process for grading funds/companies on ESG standards.
Then they give the consumer an option of investing in a fund or not that rates highly or lowly on this ESG scale.
Use it or don’t.
