The various countries that went through nominally communist revolutions weren't relying on individual initiative.
They were relying on "Do what the narrowly controlled party tells the rest of you to do."
People have a remarkable ability to produce imaginary or minimally functional output when everyone's life depends on satisfying impossible central demands.
It makes me nervous tbh.
People thought Trump was a joke with no chance until he kept winning the primaries.
Who knows what will happen with Desantis who is less charismatic but more competent.
Even with this fascist nonsense he has strong support in Florida which was a swing state not that long ago.
I sure hope Desantis flames out but I wouldn't take him lightly.
The OP’s broader point was that American establishment was conspiratorially labeling these countries as “communist” by…accurately relaying how these Communist governments described themselves.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
These afor-mentioned Communist leaders were ideologically committed leaders, who were passionate about their political philosophy (and even fancied themselves great political minds).
They were obsessed with realizing what they deemed Marxism, as interpreted in a political manner by Lenin and then further realized by their own political beliefs.
