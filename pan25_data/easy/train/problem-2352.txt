I live in China, my best guess is that the party has thought “quick, everyone went home over Chinese New Year for the first time in three years and started comparing notes about how fucking stupid our zero Covid policy was now that grandma is dead anyway since restrictions lifted 2 months ago - and no one has any money because the economy died too - let’s distract them by showing how we aren’t inept because our military is progressing!”.

Exactly.
India will become the next China in terms of manufacturing and boost their economy and pockets of the elite that run India.
