The right to recall is not guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States or by federal law.
In fact, no member of the House of Representatives has ever been recalled.
According to the Supreme Court of the United States in U.S.
Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, "representatives owe primary allegiance not to the people of a State, but to the people of the Nation."
Consequently, though a state elects a representative, according to the Supreme Court, that state does not have the authority to recall that representative.
Dude.
If the democrats had as slim a majority as the republicans, they’d do exactly the same thing.
And you’d be all for it.
Y’all need to chill out and stop playing sides for teams who both hate us.
McCarthy?
The guy who his office impersonated?
Wow dude, grow a set and give us some fightin’ words.
Oh wait, same party where a piss stained raccoon haired septuagenarian insulted the wife of senator Cancun.
And Cancun Cruz just took it ….. like a prison rape victim.
