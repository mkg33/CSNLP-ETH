It's been raining all January in Minnesota.
This is usually some of the coldest, harshest part of the year, with temps well below freezing.
Snow was common, but rain?
Rarely heard of.
Appalachia here.
Thunderstorms with lightning - twice in the last couple of weeks.
Usually by now, there's snow.
Oil companies do see the writing on the wall with climate change, but their CEOs want to make money this quarter and this year and will likely not be sticking around long enough to take a hit for a few years in profitability waiting for their company's investments into new technologies to hopefully pay off in several years (nor will their shareholders tolerate a dip in profits as the company shifts its core business to a new technology).
It has been much more profitable (so far) for oil companies instead to challenge climate change science and convince regular people that the science is wrong, or that individual actions will lower emissions (rather than address this issue as the systemic problem it is and force a shift in technology).
Lol.
Nothing will change and yet believing nothing will change ensures it.
Such an uphill battle that cannot happen enough people in the correct positions make changes.
