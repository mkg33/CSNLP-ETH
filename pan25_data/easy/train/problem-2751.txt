Ruzzia has threatened to use their nukes over and over again since they've invaded and started getting pushed back.
How can anyone take them seriously at this point?
Fuck the risk and fuck people like you that think we should "be pushing harder for a peace deal rn", if Ruzzia is not taken care of now they will continue to keep making these threats, invading their neighbors and rattling their nuclear saber.
We have a golden opportunity now, to not only deal a crippling blow to Ruzzia, but also win over the Ukrainians as a long term ally.
An ally that just so happened to find massive reserves of fossil fuels in its territory a few years ago, most of which is just offshore of Crimea.
Exactly.
Many here act very cool but if the russians actually feel like they want to go out with a bang we can only hope the soldiers operating the nuclear weapons decide it's not worth it.
As weak and unorganized the russian army seems to be, just one nuclear warhead on Kiew, New York City, Berlin, London or whereever would change the world forever.
