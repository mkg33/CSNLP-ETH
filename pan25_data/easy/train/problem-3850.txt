Syria is controlled by Assad, who is only holding on to power thanks to Russia's stepping in and supporting him after the US (under Obama) decided to withdraw its support for the anti-Assad forces and leave a power vacuum.
You betrayed us.
You betrayed us when you looked the other way at Putins other war crimes.
And you betrayed humanity.
So Israel continuously attacks weapons shipments intended for Hezbollah and concentrations of Iranian forces in Syria, in close coordination with Russia to avoid causing Russian casualties and drawing it into direct conflict with Israel.
Takes these excuses and shove them up your ass.
The US is in a significant fight in the Ukraine.
But Israel doesn’t care.
They don’t think they owe the US anything.
It's hypocritical of you to accuse Israel of crimes against humanity for not endangering its existence by getting involved in a war between a nuclear power and its own bitter regional enemies, while these countries are actively supporting Russia and thereby directly supporting crimes against humanity:
Bullshit.
And absolutely a betrayal of the United States.
Israel has kissed Putin’s ass even after he commits war crimes.
Israel's support and subsequent stance make it an accessory after the fact to crimes against humanity.
And your defense 'of Israel in this regard makes you morally bankrupt.
You don't give a damn about humanity - all you care about is Israel and its increasingly authoritarian government.
Endangering existence?
Yet, you will certainly need help with Iran at some point Maybe Russia’s military failures in Ukraine shows you how impressive they really are Just saying!
