For the last couple of decades in particular it’s just been about controlling their own people.
Most of the world wishes they’d just shut up and grow up, but sadly it is a dictatorship and like most dictatorships, as well as the harsh punishments and heavy handed control, they need a carrot to balance the whip.
They could offer their people a better economy or healthcare or whatever, but that doesn’t really benefit them or their cronies, so they invent a boogie man and make the carrot protection from the boogie man.
Well?
Go on then.
Get on with it.
The narrative they want you to believe apparently is that they’re dragging this war out deliberately for some reason when they have the means to decisively end it.
It’s nonsense.
If they had more military might to throw at the conflict and end it sooner and in their favour they’d have done it by now.
Yeah seriously!
How pathetic and stupid does someone have to be to start a war and then throw a temper tantrum and complain that their enemy is fighting back?
