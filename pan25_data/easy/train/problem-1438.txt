That's just the "Disney version" of what they're doing.
The entire GOPer agenda has been to impoverish the bottom 90% - no real raises since the 80's, no healthcare, no retirement, no SS or Medicare - so they will be totally dependant on their employers for their survival, and swapping jobs will be like trying to get a job if the HUAC had declared you a Commie in the 50's.
In short, Republican legislation for the past 40 years has been designed to restore SLAVERY on a bi-racial basis.
It's in everything they've done - even the military TROOPS are targeted - they used money for Military Family Housing to fund donny's wall fergodsake - and the GOPers opposed every move to compensate troops injured from toxins - Agent Orange to Afghan burn pits - and the GI Bill that USED to cover the cost of college/grand-school now barely covers tuition.
What?
The best way to control the price of higher education is to have states stop cutting funding.
Universities (outside of private, elite ones) don’t charge what they “want”, their tuition goes up because state funding decreases.
Do you know how much professors and grad student teachers even make?
The money isn’t going there.
