I distinctly remember watching Morning Joe normalize Trump in real time during his 2016 campaign.
For better or worse, that show was very influential in shaping mainstream opinions among journalists, elected officials, and other leaders from both parties.
If the Morning Joe crew had treated Trump like the dangerously unqualified clown that he is from the start, I have no doubt that many high-level Republicans would have publicly taken that stance.
But, because Joe and Mika liked Trump, they touted him as a great businessman and a genius strategist who deserved to be taken seriously as a candidate.
By the time they turned on him, the base was fully in line, and every Republican politician knew speaking out against him would be the end of their career.
I really don't give a shit about Morning Joe or any cable news personalities, but no matter what they say now, Joe and Mika played a huge role in Trump's rise.
