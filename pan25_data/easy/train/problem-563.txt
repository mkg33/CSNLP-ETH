Russia has committed more documented war crimes.
That wouldn't excuse a ukrainian warcrime however.
As you pointed out though, this wasn't an unprovoked execution, it was perfidy by the russians, hence another russian warcrime.
Stop regurgitating propaganda then.
This incident was both miniscule compared to the other crimes of Russia and was caused by Russia.
You don't know what you are talking about and you are supporting Kremlin propaganda (or you're a Russia troll).
However...it wasn't.
A russian soldier opened fire on the ukrainians, turning the surrender to a combat situation which got all the russians killed.
\5 ukrainians are letting 11 russians surrender.
A machine gunner has his gun one the ground, lined up to hit all the russians on the floor if anyone tries to harm the ukrainians.
Then one russian starts shooting at the ukrainians at which point they obviously return fire.
The machine gunner alone probably killed all those on the floor in the first second.
And we see bullet holes consistent with them being shot from the machine gunner, not from the back.
