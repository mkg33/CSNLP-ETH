Someone just got released from gantonamo bay after 19 years after they realised he was innocent and US going to lecture india about minority rights.
Also CAA has nothing to do with discrimination,it's NRC you should be focusing on because that has potential to strip people of their citizenship.
CAA is about granting citizenship to minorities in neighbouring countries who consider them kafir aka blasphemer.
Why?
CAA has nothing to do with anyone other than refugees already in India, it provides oppressed religous minorities from neighbouring countries quicker route to citizenship.
What a joke!
I’m neither American nor Indian but I’ve been to both US and India, and without any shred of doubt I can say that US is so much more developed than India.
Cleanliness, infrastructures, every civic related metric, US triumphs India.
I find it funny that Indians who’ve never been to US, watch some YouTube videos of US rundown areas thinks that it’s like that in US everywhere lol.
Additionally, Islam isn't a monolith.
It has several sects and schools of thought, and violence and discrimination against sects happen all the time.
