I was really close (still am) friends growing up next door to a Ukrainian family.
I would go over to his grandparents all the time.
Every time I came over they would open up the fridge and the cabinets and offered me anything and everything they had in the house to eat and would get visibly distressed if I told them I wasn't hungry.
Wouldn't let me leave the house until I ate a bowl of ice cream.
Soviet leadership at the time basically wanted to industrialize and urbanize the state 'at any cost', and there was massive conflict between the central Soviet leadership and local land owners; the famine resulted from a combination of factors including poorly planned policies, sabotage by landowners, and significant drought.
Yes.
A relative of my foster mother was on the track of civilians escaping the eastern German territories during the end of the war.
She was a child and there with several sisters and her mother.
The mother decided to kill the children and herself when it was clear they couldn't outrun the red army because of the (now often proven) stories of crimes against civilians, especially women and girls.
The mother didn't notice that said relative of my foster mother survived her attempt to kill her.
I don't know though how she made it back to German territory after that.
