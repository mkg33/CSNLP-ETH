Nearly lifelong Minnesotan.
I lived in Iowa in 2016 .
Was a huge Bernie supporter and caucused for him.
Lean left but see myself as moderate-ish.
Could not force myself to vote for Hillary.
Didn't vote Trump, just couldn't convince myself to vote "for" anyone because they were both such garbage people.
I wish even Kasich or McCain ran cause I would have voted for them.
Could not stomach voting Hillary.
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.

Bernie could actually communicate positions and policies in sentences.
Clinton either wrote an essay or mouthed meaningless platitudes.
I cannot offer a single reason that I voted for her, except that Trump was Trump and that Republicans are trash.
