it also paints the FALSE picture that 50 or 51 senate members being the same party should be able to pass bills all by themselves.
that is NOT A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY, people arguing that "Democrats held all three branches and got nothing done" are going to bat for republicans, trying to get people to stay home and not vote.
It is completely unhealthy to pass bills requiring 100% of your party's vote and 0% of the opposing party's vote.
Republicans are so uniform that they have very good luck doing that, they passed many bills doing that, Democrats are very diverse, they only passed a few bills using that method, it is NOT TRUE that 50 Democrats is a "majority", and it is completely unhealthy to expect congress to operate without crossing the aisle, which republicans have been refusing to do for 15+ years now.
For real.
Plus these headlines suggest its going to be a big win tend to have the opposite effect of making democrats stay home because they think its a sure thing.
Republicans vote in bigger numbers on election day.
Nothing is over till its actually called.
All headlines suggesting otherwise should be treated with extreme caution.
