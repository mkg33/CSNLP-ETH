It is insane to wait with the comparison because "we don't have evidence of industrial scale mass murder of civilians yet" that compares to Hitler.
That is a bit too late to start warning "you know, this Putin guy sure seems similar to Hitler", the whole idea is to call it out before such atrocities will be committed.
Territorial guarantees -- worth nothing.
Russia signed 1994 Budapest agreement.
Recent history: Russia attacked Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Chechnya, Georgia, .... and Crimea, Ukraine.

His views, behavior, actions, methods, propaganda tricks and approach are exactly like hitlers - so he is comparable and euqatable to Hitler perfectly fine.
Just because he does not genocide like post-1941 Hitler, when the 'final solution' kicked into higher gear and "getting rid of Jews" was 100% synonymous with exterminate - doesn't mean they are not .
He is the same, jsut did not commit so much atrocities yet.
“Separatists”….
Gotta stop singing that propaganda.
They were Russian troops “on vacation “ that “settled” there.
