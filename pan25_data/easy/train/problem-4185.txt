Scaling up my old plans.
The city I grew up in ran a ballot measure that was rejected by voters to raise sales tax to build a new stadium in the first election I was eligible to vote in.
The city government decided to build the stadium anyway and raised the tax as well.
This pissed me off so I did the math and figured out that the cost to me personally over a decade was around $60.
I did some more research and found out that $60 was also roughly the cost of the plastic seats in the cheaper sections.
When they built that stadium I went to a baseball game with a big backpack and a screwdriver.
I still have that seat (the parts that fit in my bag, anyway) in my closet as I type this over 20 years later.

Exactly.
I've been paying into that fund since 1994.
If this happens, I'm going to play by the same rules they do.
I'm sure that money will be funnelled into military spending, as all things are.
I've got the time and the inclination and a stolen tank probably fetches decent money on the black market.
