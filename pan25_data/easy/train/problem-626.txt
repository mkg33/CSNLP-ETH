But even more damning than the public outrage is perhaps that even leading Swedish experts on primate behaviour have come out and condemned the park’s handling of its chimpanzees and the entire situation.
Saying that the zookeepers had a lacking relationship with its chimpanzees.
That the chimpanzees had no trust in the keepers, which made the situation way worse.
And that killing them was completely unnecessary.
The experts also say that it would be nearly impossible for the zoo to keep its remaining chimpanzees now, since the chimpanzees have been deeply traumatised by the event and have lost all trust in their keepers.
Before this event, the zoo was also part of a research project on the cognition of great apes together with Lund University – one of Sweden’s leading universities – but the university has now decided to suspend that cooperation.
They are indeed.
And I don't know the configuration of the space they escaped into, so I can't say it would have been easy to tranquilize them.
However, tranquilizing escaped animals with dart guns or with food is a common technique that competent zoos often employ with escaped animals.
So I'm just saying it's surprising that they killed four chimps instead of taking a less extreme measure.
