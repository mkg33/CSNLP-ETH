It is going to the workers.
The problem is they need a ton of workers per kid.
At least in my state, there has to be 1 teacher to every 4 kids until the kids are like 30 months old, and then the ratio goes to 1:8.
My girlfriend is a director at a daycare and I’ve seen their P&L.
Like 70% of their cost is labor.
The kids also need food and diapers, plus there’s overhead costs like rent and maintenance.
They charge almost $1,000 a month, and they haven’t done better than break even since before covid.
At the end of the day, they need to charge more tuition to make money and pay teachers more so they can be fully staffed.
If the government could subsidize more that would be the fairest way to do it I think.
But right now the teachers get low pay, theres a waiting list years long to get in, and they still lose money.
exceptional heathcare.
Only pain in the ass is i had to hand carry their entire medical record in a little book.
Historically immigration from many different countries has been a huge plus in diverse Western/New World countries unless mainstream economics is completely wrong or we’re dealing with an extremely supply constrained economy where every new adult/household is primarily another mouth to feed rather than another potential entrepreneur.
Iirc all but the least educated immigrants are net pluses to the economy in the USA and Canada, even if none of them converge fully with old-stock Canadians when adjusted for education and urbanization.
