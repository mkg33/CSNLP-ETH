34 here, literally the same feelings.
What drives me insane are the people even older than we who continue to deny that it's happening.
Like, fucking how?!
It's literally right in front of your eyes if you took a microsecond to look at it.
Not really a drastic collapse of population like south korea is also not manageable because it becomes almost impossible to support the elder population (we see it pretty clearly in east asia and it's only going to get worse there ) the only reason the west doesn't suffer from it is because the west "import" a huge work force in the form of immigrants but this resource is also finite because eventually those african and asian countries would get below replacement rate and then they would be short of people too.
That can be fixed if people would "just" work until the day they die and won't ever retire but no one wants to do that.
Especially the butterflies.
How can these people not see what's happening?
How about how tick "season" now lasts more than 75% of the year?
Summer rain storms happened at least once a week now once a month is generous, 70 degrees for days at a time in November, 60s at Christmas, etc.
