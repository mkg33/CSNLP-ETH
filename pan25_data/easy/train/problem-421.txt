Lose your job for taking an unpaid sick day?
Rail workers shouldn't strike, they should riot.
Fuck this dog shit country.
I share your anger, but realistically, it's necessary to recognize that the other side is drastically worse on these issues, and despite the total abdication of responsibility here, there are other situations where that makes a huge difference.
Fuck that.
Biden, call on the Rail companies to act fast to avoid a strike.
This is unconscionable that Biden is going to have Congress declare a labor strike illegal and force people to work a contract they do not agree too.
Fuck that.
It's not politicians who actually suffer the consequences.
You easily earn more as an ex-politician or furloughed politician on the lobbying, talk and authorship circuit than you do as a serving one.
Disgusting.
He could chose to side with the workers, but chose to do the bidding of the bosses.
Also, this won't prevent them from striking and the unions should make it clear they will strike if congress tries to override their freedoms.
