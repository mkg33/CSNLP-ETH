Millennial (older here), people always forget this, and I always feel bad about it, but when I was in highschool 9/11 happened, and then the year I graduated was when the whole Iraq war thing REALLY ramped up, and Rumsfeld and W were really screaming about war and people were super afraid/convinced of the draft being reinstated, and despite what they say now: 100% if they could’ve gotten away with it they would have.
I believe anyways.

We’re not doing that again.” And made sure it didn’t.
