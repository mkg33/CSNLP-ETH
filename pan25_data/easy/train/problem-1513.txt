>The unprecedented regulatory power the Obama Administration imposed on the internet is smothering innovation, damaging the American economy and obstructing job creation.
I urge the Federal Communications Commission to end the bureaucratic regulatory overreach of the internet known as Title II and restore the bipartisan light-touch regulatory consensus that enabled the internet to flourish for more than 20 years.
The plan currently under consideration at the FCC to repeal Obama's Title II power grab is a positive step forward and will help to promote a truly free and open internet for everyone.
No it's not.
It's over 10 years and graduates tend to earn more than non-degree holders.
A 15% delinquency/default rate among borrowers suggest most are able to pay it.
It's 15% of borrowers, so they make up a tiny portion of the US population.
The people most likely to be in that position are those who have student debt but never earned a degree, meaning they tend to have much less than that 25-30k balance since that's for those who attended for 4+ years.
Their lives aren't being destroyed, if they're in delinquency/default then they should be requesting to switch to an IBR plan.
