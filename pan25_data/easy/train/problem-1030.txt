A nuclear power plant large enough to power America as a whole is a nuclear power plant I'd prefer to not live anywhere near or down wind of.
I'd say the best would be a mix -- Wind generators in windy areas, kinetic generators in coastal regions, along with nuclear and solar in regions where the other two don't work.
Joking aside, wind isn't feasible in certain areas of the US so it'll need to be supplemented with something else.
Nuclear is the best candidate.
Is nuclear energy perfect an safe?
No.
Is it something we have now that doesn't involve dumping copious amounts of carbon into the atmosphere?
Yes.
I’m not an electrical engineer so I’m sure there are complexities to any solution but there are places doing HVDC transmission over hundreds and even thousands of KM, so having solar/wind/wave energy capture systems where they’re feasible and using transmission lines (either HVDC or “regular” HVAC) to get to areas where they aren’t seems like a smarter solution than trying to build an expensive nuke plant that has a 50 year productive life and makes the land unusable for twice that long.
