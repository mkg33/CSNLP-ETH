The reality is that 82% of russians support genocide of me because I’m Ukrainian and other 18% I guess are mostly silent biomass.
I don’t want to judge people by nationality in general, but when I see a ruZZian, what is a chance that he is either a pro-war, a silent supporter or a “russian liberal” trying to whitewash “poor russian people”?
The whole nation is a fascist, imperialistic, frankly evil people who are very happy to vicariously watch how their fellow countrymen kill Ukrainians on national television but as soon as it starts to concern them they are leaving the country or protesting how their soldiers don’t have enough equipment to kill Ukrainians.
Even the extreme minority of russians who oppose war are mostly sad that they are not winning and it’s a disaster for the “glorious motherland”.
Guess how many russians opposed annexation of Crimea or Georgia?
The answer is - not many.
I highly doubt Putin would make a nuclear strike, I think he values his life more since any nuclear strike would most certainly have an attack from NATO and if Russia in Ukraine is anything to go off of I give Russia a month maybe two against NATO if they've lucky, clearly the only real power they have because of the Mutually Assured Destruction doctrine which means any strike will be met with another and another until the worlds dead.
