Although I'm not an expert, and there are other ways the system was defrauded, the most obvious examples are businesses claiming more employees on their payroll than they actually had.
My understanding is that the requirements for proving payroll were not very stringent and many people 'employed' their own family members a few months prior with higher than normal salaries to get more money.
If you're looking to report someone it's easier if you are more familiar with their business.
However, just from that site with minimal information you can maybe draw some conclusions.
Look for the number of employees claimed.
For example: If a pool with 5 lifeguards claims 50 full-time employees that's a red flag.
Hilarious.
You can be sent to war, but you can't participate in the democracy you're expected to defend and die for.
How can people vote for these clowns?
Conservativism is proof American Evangelicals have actually abandoned the teachings of Jesus.
The parable of the wicked servant applies to these people.
