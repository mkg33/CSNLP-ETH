During Trump's presidency, I recall multiple times where Russia was releasing demonstrations of their 'new great military tech'...and then Trump was like 'see?
this is why we need to beef up US military!
'.
The general consensus is that these modernized variants perform well in a low-intensity conflict where there is little opposition, where they can keep the initiative, and where the tactical and operational tempo can be easily controlled; so they were effective in Syria.
But in a high-intensity engagement like Ukraine against a peer or near-peer force, you need to have effective battle and operational control all the time to keep the initiative; this is where technology isn't really a solution in itself, you need competent staff and good processes.
And this is exactly where Russia is lacking, they have AEWC aircraft with crap command capabilities because air wing commanders can and do override their tactical decisions, so why even bother?
The Soviet Union, even though it was operating far less technologically-advance GCI processes, was far more effective than that.
And this is a people and process problem, not a tech one; you can't just slap an IRST module on top of a Flanker and hope that it will control the battle space for you.
Helicopters, just recently.
Jets, not so far.
You don't just donate a jet to a country that never used that model before.
You have to train not just the pilot, but mechanics, you have to establish a supply of replacement parts and consumables.
