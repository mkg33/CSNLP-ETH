From the wiki: â€¦ In 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the FD&C Act was passed, which represented a "revolution" in FDA regulatory authority.
[85] The most important change was the requirement that all new drug applications demonstrate "substantial evidence" of the drug's efficacy for a marketed indication, in addition to the existing requirement for pre-marketing demonstration of safety.
This marked the start of the FDA approval process in its modern for.
These reforms had the effect of increasing the time, and the difficulty, required to bring a drug to market.
[86] One of the most important statutes in establishing the modern American pharmaceutical market was the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act.

I wasn't the one to say that it's better according to experts.
I was just also curious on the subject so I quickly googled it and this was an article that came up.
I was sharing the link in case they wanted to read more on it, not because I was telling them that they are wrong.
