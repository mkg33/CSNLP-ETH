I feel like this was written by someone who has never met a republican in real life so allow me to help you out here: many republicans refer to those people who stormed the capital as fringe wackos and crazy people who don’t represent the party as a whole.
They vote republican because in their mind, a few crazy people storming the capital doesn’t suddenly mean that the Republican Party stands for violence.
It’d be like if a democrat murdered his spouse.
Voting democrat after something like that wouldn’t be tantamount to endorsing spouse murder, would it?
Does that make sense to you?
If you spend decades cultivating and encouraging violent, seditious (racist, misogynist, transphobic, homophobic etcetera etcetera ad infinitum ad nauseam) discourse, you are making violence inevitable.
Am I fuck.
That's exactly the Republican position on Jan 6th - they had a guy charged with participating in a mock jail cell at the last CPAC where you could go get pictures with an 'unfairly persecuted patriot', for fucks sakes.
