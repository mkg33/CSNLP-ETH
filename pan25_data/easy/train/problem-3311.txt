Fucking ridiculous.
Massie said “State and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students”, but that is exactly how things work now with the U.S. Department of Education (ED).
ED is prohibited from prescribing, prohibiting, or otherwise controlling curriculum.
ED does not play any part in the hiring or firing of teachers, staff, or administrators.
ED plays no part in issues of unions.
On the K-12 side, ED is primarily a grant making agency, that gives supplemental funds for targeted programs and populations, and oversees/monitors the use of those funds to ensure compliance with Federal statutes and regulations.
Issues of curriculum, or homeschooling, etc.
are all issues that are already under local/state control, and always have been.
