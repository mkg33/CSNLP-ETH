I myself lost 6 of friends in one of the cities that effected.
But it is not because of the earthquake itself it is because the city mayor of that city reported that 'there is no damage here nobody hurt or under the buildings' so the help we needed never came.
There was a hotel named Isias Grand Hotel, my friends were in that hotel bc they were getting their education about the area for tourism guiding and there were 43 people, young tour guides...
The mentioned hotel was failed every each document about construction.
We learned that they crashed down walls in order to use 2 old building as 1 and the building has 'Safe Tourism' licenses because it is belongs to a relative of the ministry of tourism and culture.
Since mayor told there is nobody hurt here, no one come to help our friends.
They were all alive when the quake hit but bc of lack of help they all freeze to death.
We feel lucky we could reach their bodies by the help of volunteers coming from Cyprus, since in the same hotel they had children that come here for volleyball tournaments.
They were trying to find their kids but instead they found our friends frozen bodies.
And still there is no government based teams in that city to help the other crushed buildings.
We assume more then 100k people are dead under the constructions.
I cannot tell how devastated I am, 6 of close friends my schoolmates, my colleagues died.
They left there to freeze.
We screamed called for help from every way it is possible, nobody believed us nobody give a shit to us.
And it's all Erdogan and his government fault.
Exactly.
It's mind boggling how bad he fucked up what should have been an easy victory.
But, as you've said, he's a fucking moron so I'm not sure what I expected....
