Russia tried to spread their system via force and subjugation not by economic growth and prosperity they invaded their own allies under the Warsaw Pact , please explain how and why should us from their "area of influence" be interested in their system ?
They literally have nothing to offer us , if it wouldn't be an alliance with the US then it will be the next logical best thing , creating their own nukes as NK dose against US.
Their inability to understand this is what will push neighboring countries to arm themselves to the teeth , form alliances with their Rivals or build our own nukes.
If they are unable to offer something equal or better than what the west offers then they will always have hostile countries on their borders whether under an alliance or via nukes , us from their "area of influence" have had enough of them for 2 centuries now.
True.
I was thinking more that they weren't slaughtered or captured in large numbers trying to cross the river.
I didn't see any videos of large numbers of vehicles captured like during the Kharkiv offensive, a few vehicles but nothing like the earlier war trophies they took.
Maybe I missed those videos though.
