Yep.
From the article: "What explains Black Democratsâ€™ differences with other Democrats on questions related to gender identity and transgender people?
Black Democrats are generally more likely than other Democrats to describe their political views as moderate and less likely to describe their views as liberal.
Black Democrats have also differed from other Democrats on certain social issues, including whether the legalization of same-sex marriage has been good for society.
They tend to be more religious than other Democrats as well â€“ and more likely to say religion influences their views on gender identity.
