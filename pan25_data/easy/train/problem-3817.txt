Ex presidents are often read in on things and consulted with, but they are not magically granted all access security clearance for life.
That's and absurdly stupid claim.
"Federal agents and prosecutors have come to believe former president Donald Trumpâ€™s motive for allegedly taking and keeping classified documents was largely his ego and a desire to hold on to the materials as trophies or mementos, according to people familiar with the matter.
".
Some potential charges like violation of the presidential records Act or mishandling criminal information do not contain any significant intent element.
However, there is at least some possibility that Trump's lawyers could argue to the jury that this is all a misunderstanding over how certain documents were characterized as a defense.
I think that might just be an attempt to mislead the jury but a judge might still let them argue it.
