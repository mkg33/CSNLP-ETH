“Guaranteeing 7 paid sick days to rail workers would cost the rail industry a grand total of $321 million a year – less than 2% of its profits.
Please don't tell me the rail industry can't afford it.
Rail companies spent $25.5 billion on stock buybacks and dividends this year.” - Bernie Sanders on the right side as usual.
✊.
Thirdly, buying stock is not actively participating in a company and reflects the myopia of capitalism wherein quarterly profits trump the long-term profits and any other measurable aspect or metric of a business (some businesses that make less money are better for the customer and employees, not that an investor would actually care).
The house.
Which will now fail in the Senate.
That's the point.
The separate bill should have been the main and only bill to make the Senate pass that one.
Now, the Senate will pass the first and vote down the second, forcing the rail workers to vote but without the sick leave.
Then have Congress pass a bill forcing the Rail companies to give their workers fucking leave time.
Not forcing workers to work and making a strike illegal.
