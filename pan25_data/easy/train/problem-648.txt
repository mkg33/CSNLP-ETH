"Under Revolutionary law, young girls who were sentenced to death could not be executed if they were still virgins.
Thus, they were "married off" to Revolutionary Guards and prison officials in temporary marriages and then raped before their execution, to prevent them going to heaven.
The Mullahs believed that these women were ungodly and did not deserve paradise in the next life and that if they were deprived of their virginity, it would ensure that they went to hell.
Therefore, on the night prior to execution, the condemned girl was injected with a tranquilliser and then raped by her guard(s).
After the execution, the religious judge at the prison would write out a marriage certificate and send it to the victim's family along with a box of sweets.

Yeah fair sorry I kinda said it the wrong way meaning it as their life where they are is shit and it absolutely is not …complaining you can’t buy a house whilst eating maccas I’m pre sure it’s a bit different in a lot of other places sorry for the wrong wording I 100 agree with comparing life traumas is impossible I’m referring to the daily struggles of being able to go to the shop and not get murdered kind of thing.
No country should be governed based on religion.
Period.
Same story with religion influence on the government.
