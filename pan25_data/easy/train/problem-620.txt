My main symptoms that sent me to the doc were: crazy heat intolerance, debilitating fatigue that had me bed/couch-ridden and avoiding even drinking anything at times because I didnâ€™t have energy to get up to pee, intractable insomnia, periods of days to weeks of not being able to eat solid food, excessive sweating for no reason (I begin dripping sweat just standing up for more than 60 seconds), tachycardia upon standing (my HR would be 170-200bpm after a 7 min shower for example), random sudden bouts of high blood pressure that would then go away just as quickly, gastroparesis, vestibular migraines that felt like carsickness on steroids and made it literal torture to move, dry mouth and eyes, trouble emptying my bladder, difficulties regulating my temperature, horrible brain fog, and more.
