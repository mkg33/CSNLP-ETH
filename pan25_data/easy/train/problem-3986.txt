IT is super common for the undeveloped rural areas to not have gas or sewer lines and a lot of them don't even have indoor plumbing (no septic, bring in water pumped from a town well) and they live in houses literally falling apart, no internet service, sporadic cell service, but damn if they dont all have, without fail, enough power and a flat screen tv to get that propaganda pumped in.
These are people that can't afford to buy meat.
I would not at all be surprised to find out that they TV and service is gifted by regional government, backed by the regime.
This is literally the generally accepted doctrine, called battlefield isolation.
Artillery cuts the enemy ability to resupply troops in combat, which leads to their combat abilities degradation.

My comments that Russia is training a different set of mobiks and that military industrial capacity is increasing are at least getting net upvotes vs. downvotes now.
