The thing with the Challengers vs the T-72s is more about logistics, the reason it's taken so long to get western tanks supplied is that we have to set up a logistical train and make sure the manufacturers (who are private companies) are ready to supply parts.
We don't have that problem with T-72s because a bunch of the closest NATO nations are ex Warsaw Pact and can supply and even manufacture parts for the Ukrainians and are themselves looking to modernize on US and German equipment which is more modern and integrated into NATO logistics anyway.
Food.
Ukrainian grain feeds around 200 million people around the world, majority in Africa, exports 10% of world's needs.
2 years ago Morocco , I don't think it changes since then.
Tunisia also buys Ukrainian grain and its like 60-80% of all grain imported in Tunisia.
I have friend in Tunisia and he said when Ukraine stopped export by obvious reasons, there simply was no flour in Tunisia and no bread at all.
Anyway.
I don’t know what’s going on here.
It’s a lot of speculation.
But I’m pretty confident that Morocco’s going to win the World Cup in 2026.
