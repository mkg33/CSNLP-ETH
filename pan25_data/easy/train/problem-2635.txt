I would agree with that.
I lean more right on some things and more left on others and it seem now a days that's just not ok to either side.
I don't want to see this Republic literally burn; but, I'm tired of listening to damn near octogenarians tell my early 20's children what's best for them based on their experiences 60 damn years ago in a different world or even worse their personal religious beliefs and then screw them over out of greed and lack of basic humanity.
We elected these people on promises and then they get bought and sold by corporations like cheap hookers all the while we foot the bill with a decimated middle class.
They has mastered breaking us apart and teaching us how different and scary we are rather than how similar we actually are.
I am hopeful though post overturning or Roe, because I'm finally seeing people get fed up on both sides and showing up TOGETHER to make their voice heard.
