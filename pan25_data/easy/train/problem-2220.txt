The big motivator back then write that if you want to do business you need it.
And seeing how most of the logistics companies did business (still do), it was the logical choice.
The same friends were also convinced that there are more people in the world who speak it rather than German and French combined.
And the third one was that it was a much more useful language, and considering it was late 1990s Vilnius it was kinda true.
Plus everyone either had neighbors, other kids in the playground who weren’t German let’s just say.
No one back then could even dream EU and NATO and good life with multiple vacations abroad per year would happen.
And that instead of downloading movies with shitty ru dubbing, people would watch Netflix in original language.
French pronunciation is actually very regular.
The rules are slightly complicated and require a knowledge of grammar as different rules apply to different word classes, but they are very consistent.
Given an unknown French word, you can almost always pronounce it correctly, unlike English.
Edit: fucking autocorrect turned experience into experieNYC...
I believe i have figured out how to butcher english.
