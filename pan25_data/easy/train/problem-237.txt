Biden is cooperating.
Although it's not a good look at all that they keep being found.
It appears they are doing a thorough sweep now which is good.

Accountable how?
To the law?
What accountability does the law place on inadvertent possession due to unintentional non return?
Uh, no.
There was also that whole, you know, lying to investigators that Trump turned over all the documents, obstruction, Trump's insistence that they we're his personal property.
Etc, etc.
Trump obstructed and refused handing them over.
Trump attacked the DoJ.
Biden is cooperating and clearly his team is doing a sweep and turning them over.
What hypocrisy?
You literally have no idea what happened but it seems highly unlikely Biden stole the documents.
Do you understand hypocrisy refers to treating the same thing differently depending on who is doing it, not failing to pretend very different things are the same?
Stealing things is not the same as inadvertently possessing them and it's not hypocrisy to treat these things differently.
