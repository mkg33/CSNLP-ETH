So it was never a real course?
Just an idea for a course?
And when young adults take that course, secure in the knowledge that the AP board is providing time-tested, relevant educational material that transfers into college credits, you were just gonna say, “nope lol, we changed it to suit the whims of fascists, you have to take the ‘updated’ version where we banned viewpoints that didn’t test well with Trump supporters and included talking points from such political luminaries as ‘Michael the Black Man’.” Don’t forget to download our app!
So from the sound of it, they launched a pilot revision of the course last year, and then shuffled out anything that’s a little too objectionable, like intersectionalism and black queerness (secondary sources), over to the AP Classroom app, so course-takers in the future won’t be required to interact with media from historical scholars and researchers on any topic, only primary sources from witnesses and people involved, and then threw ‘both sides’ a bone on appeasement with the sudden inclusion of Black Conservatism.
