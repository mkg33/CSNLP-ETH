There are a lot of ifs in that scenario.
If a charismatic enough leader rises up (much like in Ukraine) for example, or a strong enough cassus belli arises I can see an international Chechen movement forming like the PKK to fight for freedom and an independent Chechnya.
The conditions permit that, I think, but there just hasnâ€™t been enough of a driving force to make it happen.
Itâ€™s really impossible to tell just based off of the current info; hard demographics would be helpful knowledge, but there are so many unknowns.
It's a byproduct of authoritarianism.
Because of the fear-based command structure and power resting with particular people rather than institutions, ass-kissing and lying ensues.
It results in a toxic command culture where no one cooperates, sometimes withholding information or resources because they want to undermine a rival.
It is detrimental to the group as a whole.
Exactly!
We diss each other jokingly but we all respect each other's roles.
