Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who leaked information about U.S. surveillance programs, swore an oath of allegiance to Russia and has collected his Russian passport, his lawyer told state media on Friday.
No chance.
In the US he knew he was only risking a few years in a minimum security prison.
Over there he knows he'd be looking at meeting Mr. Sledgehammer.
Naturalized citizenship.
As someone born here I never had to swear an oath but they did make us pledge allegiance a lot of times to the flag for some reason.
Exactly.
And it's a huge unforced error on the part of the US and its allies.
The sticking point on his coming back to the US was whether or not he'd get a fair trial.
The US, of course, refused.
Kucherena added that Snowden’s wife, Lindsay Mills, was also undergoing the Russian citizenship application process and that the couple’s children would likely attend Russian schools, when ready.
He said he communicated mainly in English with his client but that Snowden also speaks Russian, albeit “not perfectly.”.
It’s unclear whether Snowden swore the oath of allegiance at the same time as he was granted a passport, but the two are common procedures when foreigners become Russian citizens.
The text includes swearing “to protect the freedom and independence of the Russian Federation, to be loyal to Russia, to respect its culture, history and traditions,” and to promise to “perform the duties of a citizen of the Russian Federation for the good of the state and society.”.
