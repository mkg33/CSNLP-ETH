My wife got sick from Epstein–Barr 25 years ago and has suffered from ME/CFS ever since then.
She has gotten better since the original infection (she was wheelchair bound for several years), but she's never fully recovered.
I have heard some true horror stories from her regarding the difficulties she, and those with her condition, have endured from the establishment medical community who didn't believe there was anything physically wrong with ME/CFS patients.
The term "yuppie flu" was coined specifically to deride those suffering from the disease, as if they just needed to get up and shake it off.
It has been a herculean struggle to convince the medical community that ME/CFS is not psychological.
My own personal favorite is the doctor that tipped a wheelchair bound ME/CFS patient into the deep end of a pool to prove he was faking.
He was not, and nearly drowned.
Exactly.
It’s been almost three years for me and I am bedbound now.
I was an athlete before.
It’s hell on earth and it’s not like another illness.
My organs are shutting down.
Long Covid is slow death.
