Now let's say that everyone in the first group is unvaccinated and has the same social agenda as you, while in the second group they're vaccinated.
Each person in the first group infects 7 people (49 plus the original 7 for a total of 56) while the second group produces only 9 additional infections for a total of 12.
Even though the numbers I suggested only decreased infectiousness 25% and shortened the window 40%, there was almost an 80% decrease in cases over two weeks, and that isn't even including the cases that _would_ have been transmitted (ie sufficient viral load to cause an infection) but the infection was fully prevented by the vaccine.
A vaccine does not need to 100% prevent infection to _massively_ reduce spread.
Hi WyattFromDennys.
Thank you for participating in /r/Politics.
However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
"We’re requiring active duty military to be vaccinated.
We’re making sure healthcare workers are vaccinated, because if you seek care at a healthcare facility, you should have the certainty that the pro- — the people providing that care are protected from COVID and cannot spread it to you.
".
