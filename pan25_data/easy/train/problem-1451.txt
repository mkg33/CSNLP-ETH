Chill dude.
Idk why all the anger towards someone who’s just thinking out loud.
For the record I’m not a Republican (in case that’s the reason for animosity).

Regardless, Gerrymandering is an absolutely un-Democratic, horribly corrosive tool to systematically subvert elections and the will of the people.
Two wrongs do NOT make a right.
331M/576k = 575 representatives to be distributed based on approximate population counts .
There are only 435 reps in the house.
A huge point that everyone needs to know is that gerrymandering is a fundamental foundation of the Republican Party, it is literally called "Project RedMap", it is in their party documents, developed by the Republican State Leadership Committee, and the Republican Party spent 30 million dollars initially to start the project.
Yeah I agree.
I don’t know what the solution would be tho :/ because rural ppl shouldn’t get more say per vote but the problem is politicians would pander to city people and potentially screw over rural folks if they knew their policies would be more popular in cities.
An example would be if they decide to ban gas powered cars nation wide because people in the city want to go EV and the rural folk wouldn’t be heard where charging stations are nonexistent.
