So you're right, it's not a good reason.
But it is "a" reason and a "valid" one.
On top of the more bullshit nazi ideologies like superiority of the white Russian race and trying to reignite the glory of the former Russian empire as the self proclaimed successors of the Byzantines/Romans.
It all comes down to one insane man's greed and delusions, and complete failure to diversify a country rich and wide in resources.
With Russia’s declining population demographics they can’t consider anyone undesirable.
They’re facked every which way all thanks to Putin.
The only thing that nukes can have a positive impact for are planetary defense (that is, blowing up asteroids that are past the point of being able to send a spacecraft out to re-direct it; a last line of defense against asteroid-induced extinction) and perhaps for terraforming other planets, such as thickening Mars’s atmosphere by vaporizing its ice caps, helping to warm up the planet to the point that plant life could be seeded to oxygenate the atmosphere over a few millennia.
