Fucking weirdos I swear.
People are mad because of Canada's handling of COVID so now they will back anyone who comes up against him.
Yep, they don't see any irony in praising a man who locks down entire cities over a single case of covid and completely shuts down any free speech that isn't 100% xi jingping dickriding.
Unreal.
Regarding the incident, the Chinese do not seem take a sophisticated approach (which likely has more mileage in a heavily censored country) and Xi (leader of a "democracy with Chinese characteristics" and completely full of shit) may have just been feigning a belief that "leaks" had occurred (in what appeared to be staged confrontation given the camera--and translator moving out of the way).
His lecture and posturing makes little sense in any context if presumed honest.
There is straightforward motive for an autocrat to try to establish a pecking order given rapid escalation between the two countries (eg forced divestment of Chinese mining companies in Canada, arrest of alleged Chinese spy, and pronouncement of Chinese interference in Canadian democracy).
i.e.
Someone will be talking to me about ANYTHING and although I can grasp what they're saying, hell sometimes understand 90-100% of what they're saying when I speak there is a good chance I won't be able to grab the words I need out of my head and the grammar will go down the drain as I flip a coin on if I sound normal or like a pleasantly disabled 8th grader.
With that in mind I've honestly used a translator once or twice in the same way as Xi (but more in line with asking questions about a contract or something else where I need to be clearly understood and sounding like a disabled 8th grader will just make us talk in circles as I endlessly try to rephrase my questions).
Not really.
People mostly hate their own leaders for obvious reasons.
Obviously they can hate on the other leaders, but Xi isnâ€™t running Canada into the ground (or whatever complaints there are) and vice versa.
