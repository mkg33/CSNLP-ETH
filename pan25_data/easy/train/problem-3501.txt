Lots and lots of OSINT, waiting for articles to feed you information is painful.
I prefer digging through message boards, listening to intercepted phone calls, etc.
I kept logged data from each day of reporting from Ukraine.
Then periodically I have found various data points to fact check the data.
The nastiest one was when russia's treasury office released the yearly budget, which had the death benefits payout numbers.
Looking at payout numbers, you could extrapolate a number that pretty much verified the Ukrainian reported russian KIAs minus Wagner and Donbas numbers.
I've kept logging things and keep finding the Ukrainian numbers get proven correct months later.
Keep in mind, the reported equipment losses has begun deviating towards exaggeration in the last 3 months and the aircraft losses have always been wildly conflated as they typically report hits not crashes.
Thank you.
Some news media sources were projecting a very grave outcome for Ukraine for this latest massive Russian assault.
I feel like I am holding on for them as if they are my own children.
