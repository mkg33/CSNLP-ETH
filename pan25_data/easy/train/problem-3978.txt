It's like the military and the problem of an unjust war.
The soldiers are just workers; the commanders are just executing orders; the politicians are focused on just the political aspects; the defense contractors are just making goods.
Any subsystem, in isolation, seems free of blame and just another cog, but the machine is bad.
Thus, while many could stop what's happening and there are, clearly, many bad actors and those acting in bad faith, there isn't anyone to point a finger at, no bad person to campaign against that ends the issue.
Indeed, that's the problem with most systemic issues (police violence, systemic and institutional discrimination, corporate greed and exploitation, unjust war, poverty, etc.
): it's obviously wrong, many have the power to act, but there's no compelling logic that connects all those many to a simultaneous argument or single evidence; thus, nothing changes because the system is a circle without a master and no outrage is strong enough to hit enough cogs all at once to really do something right now.
The truly insidious part is that fixing things piecemeal is horribly difficult since any small change usually just makes the system less effective at delivering its existing benefits with little immediate reduction in badness, thus - giving it a horrid stability - it quietly shifts back to how it was once people stop looking at that particular piece.
No.
Wait.
My annual compensation, but I can't say that.
Hmmm...let me think.
IT'S FOR THE CHILDREN!
Yeah, that's the ticket.
