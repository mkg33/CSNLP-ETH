I want Democrats to be running on preserving our Democracy, and that requires pointing out who is working to undermine it (MAGA Republicans and the rest of the conservative cons).
I want them to reach their constituencies with that message and keep focus on it.
If they're reached by a tweet, a statement on her website, or a t-shirt, who fucking cares as long as she's working to get the message out?
What do you think she should be doing?
Sitting around stoicly and quietly frowning when someone says something racist or shoots up a house of worship or a gay club?
What do you think she should be doing?
Really.

I support all Democrats and Republicans fundraising on voting to impeach fascist seditionist MAGA republicans who attempt to overthrow American democracy and shred the Constitution to make Trump and unelected MAGA GOP autocrat.
If she wasn't fundraising on it, I would be pissed.
