In May, the Federal Election Commission deadlocked on whether to even investigate allegations that Trump’s campaign routed funds through the LLC and a closely-tied corporate entity to conceal details of the 2020 presidential campaign’s spending.
“The Trump campaign tried to sidestep these transparency requirements by routing hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020 campaign spending to undisclosed payees through two firms with ties to high-ranking campaign officials—thereby unlawfully concealing from voters the true recipients, amounts and purposes of well over half of the campaign’s total spending,” she said.
