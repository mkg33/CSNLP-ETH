The difference with this offensive will be, last time they tried to topple down the government of Ukraine unsuccessfully.
So last time they target and orders was to kill the politicians and all of the people opposing the Russian regime on they FSB list, and Russians had orders to not destroy the important cities, because they believed in 3 days they were able to overthrow the government and put some Kremlin puppet politicians on Ukraine, but it didn't work.
That's a brilliant and interesting take.
How about the US, what does it gain or lose from the current scenario?
Really eager to see your comments, thx.
It is going to be a massacre, not that much on the military level as on the genocide level targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure, but Russia the second biggest army of the world, have a big problem, they scorched earth tactic won't work, they are short of shells, their supplying depots and military convoys can be targeted from far away with Himars and other advance artillery systems.
