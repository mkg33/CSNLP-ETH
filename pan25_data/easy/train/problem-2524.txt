I just checked the list of the oldest currently living people and there are still 3 Americans alive who lived during the TEDDY ROOSEVELT administration.
That's fucking wild.
People like her were born in the context of the early 20th century where there were few non-religious people, I do not doubt that non-religious people will inevitably reach her age, but this will still take a long time to occur, and such vibrant and open non-religious communities only exist in highly developed first-world countries.
How?
If someone's dead they're dead.
I really don't get this idea that we need to use flowery terms for someone no longer alive.
I mean if someone's dead, I don't think they're gonna be too concerned about how someone phrases it.
What are they gonna do, rise up out of their coffin and go "Hang on, before you finish the funeral some journalist used a term I didn't like and I won't stand for it"?
Important distinction: verified oldest.
There are people who may have lived longer but we have no birth record of.
"Oldest person in history" is an unverifiable title because we have no idea if some random Mayan farmer or Sumar√≠an merchant lived longer.
Unbelievably long lifespans were recorded in many cultures but we (probably rightly) disregard them as mythology-- especially because scientist think that the maximum age is 130.
