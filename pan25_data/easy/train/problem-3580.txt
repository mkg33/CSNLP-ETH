He plays dumb.
The stupid potato farmer bit is something he plays up like Krustchev did.
In reality he was the college educated equivalent of a Western agricorp CEO, managing thousands of collective workers and high-end business deals.
I donâ€™t think he worked in a field a day in his life, he was a military officer before becoming a kholkoznik if I remember correctly.
Once he entered politics he cleverly eliminated every one of the old communist elite and the newly emerging democratic establishment, until he was effectively a dictator.
In power he began pulling strings in Moscow to introduce the Union State program of restoring the Soviet Union under a "democratic" regime, and it seemed the terms of this was that Yeltsin would make Lukashenko his Vice President and heir apparent, thus overnight making Lukashenko one of the most powerful people in the world.
I'm on the fence.
Ever since, his every word has been spot on for a vassal echoing its master, but every action has been to avoid joining.
It could honestly go either way at this point.
Deadpool let his "insanity" run surpreme, and the man w the photographic memory of combat styles, psychological prediction etc etc, couldnt do anything when "madness WAS the method".
