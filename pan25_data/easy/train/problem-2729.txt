Trying to spin the blame to the feds bc democrat president when the problem is due to a private company in a Republican controlled state.
Gotcha.
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) officials stated that data from 2011 through 2021 are inconclusive about the extent to which operational changes associated with PSR may have affected rail safety, but have taken steps to address potential risks.
Class I railroad representatives generally stated that these operational changes improved or had no effect on railroad safety.
In contrast, rail safety inspectors and employee unions identified safety concerns related to reductions in staff and longer trains.
In response, FRA has several efforts underway to monitor the effects of such changes.
These efforts include analyzing safety data, conducting compliance inspections, and reviewing existing regulations.
FRA also has planned efforts to address potential risks, such as employee fatigue and the effects of longer trains.
FRA's efforts may offer important insights into additional actions that FRA and railroads could take to address potential safety concerns identified by stakeholders.
