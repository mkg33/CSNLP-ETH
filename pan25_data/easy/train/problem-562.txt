Honestly this is why I try to be more specific when describing what behavior I view as "good".
What's considered morally correct is really subject to change depending on time and culture.
Compassion and understanding/empathy are more objective so I try to look for that as an indicator of being a good person.
Even that is debatable in terms of if it's morally good but I would bet many/most cultures view being compassionate and understanding as morally virtuous.
Poor guy.
Reconciliation between Orthodox and Catholic church is his life ambition.
He put all that time and effort making inroads with the Serbian Orthodox Church, whitewashing their bloody involvement in the civil wars of the 90s and kowtowing to their hate-mongering late Patriarch, only to have the Russian Orthodox Church do the same and worse.
Oh well...
It's a literal medieval organization.
Bishops run their own diocese as their own private fiefs because they are literally feudal organizational structures.
The Pope has very limited ability to intervene because the mechanisms for doing so were designed before cars or telephones or ships that could cross the Atlantic, the assumption was that the Pope would be working off of information years out of date so decisions needed to be made on the ground with immense latitude.
If a Bishop fucks up the Bishop can get away with it for quite a long time because the Pope needs to wait for a big old meeting to convene in order to do anything about it.
