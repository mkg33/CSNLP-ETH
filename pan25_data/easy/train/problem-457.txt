The federal government implemented a series of changes during the Cold War aimed at helping Puerto Rico diversify its economy.
Notably, there was a corporate income tax break given to companies developing industry on the island.
It was a huge success in some regards, although it wasn’t perfect.
Tons of industry, especially pharmaceutical, came to the island.
But it left a bad taste in the mouths of companies from Puerto Rico.
The answer that the federal government eventually came to was that some of these changes were reversed or phased out, including this tax break.
In order to try to make up for the lost revenue, the island’s government borrowed a lot of money while they tried to make up the ground lost.
And then, before they could fix the issue, the recession hit and the island was now stuck with tons of debt and no reasonable way to relieve it.
And the problem has gone almost unaddressed.
When you combine the economic decline with the rampant corruption and constant disasters, it’s obvious the situation calls for extraordinary action.
But the federal government isn’t going to take that action.
So Puerto Rico is stuck in place.
