The Torries strike again.
But the UK and US are the two biggest tax havens in world, so its no wonder these two governments would be against this type of reporting.
You are right about Ireland being independent and yes there are other countries that are tax havens, but the US and UK are still the number one and two when it comes to being tax havens.
The Tax Justice Network, where the article gets it data from, ranks the US and UK as number one and fourteen on its 2022 Financial Secrecy Index: They have a metric, Global Scale Weight (GSW), which is "presented as a percentage of all financial services globally provided by all jurisdictions to non-residents".
The GSW for the US and UK are about 26% and 14%, the highest of any of the countries, meaning they are the number one and two countries for hiding money offshore to avoid taxes or other financial obligations.
Wait.
Prepare and be ready to be a resource and guide as people in your life wake tf to what's going on!
Entirely true.
Ireland was probably the biggest offender.
For example, Apple used Ireland as it's home country (may still do so) to evade paying taxes despite not having any employees in Ireland IIRC.
Other companies were doing the same and Ireland is part of the UK.
