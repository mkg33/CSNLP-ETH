Guns are for everyone.
Imagine if they were banned.
You'd be shit out of loluck for defense.
The world is a scary place.
Better to be armed and not need, than to need and not he armed.
I'm typically what's called a "right winger", I'm really a Libertarian, but I support trans peoples, gay peoples, everyone, and I especially support everyone's right to own firearms & not be on a government list for bad actors to know who is armed and who isn't.
Congrats on taking the first step of defending your right to exist via a gun, the most useful tool for balancing the playing field against crazy lunatics who want to cause you harm or oppress you.
I support God, Guns & Gays.. And the right to be left the hell alone.
Nobody got time for harrasment & tyranny.
