It was the greatest night of my life; I had been invited to the Captain's table.
I had only been with the company FOURTEEN YEARS.
Six officers and me... they called me "Arnold" We had gazpacho soup for starters...
I didn't know that gazpacho soup was meant to be served cold.
I called over the chef and told him to take it away and bring it back hot So he did... the looks on their faces still haunt me today I thought they were laughing at the chef, when all the time they were laughing at me as I ate my piping hot gazpacho soup I never ate at the Captain's table again.
That was the end of my career.
If only they'd mentioned it in basic training Instead of having us climbing up and down ropes and crawling on your elbows through tunnels--if only just ONCE they would've mentioned that gazpacho soup was served cold--I would've been an admiral by now...instead of a nothing, which is what I am, let's face it...
I never got off the bottom rung, and do you know why?
It's because I didn't have the right nobby parents I'll bet Todd Hunter was fed gazpacho soup as soon as he was on solids No, I'll bet he was breast-fed on it One side gazpacho soup, the other side freely-dispensed chilled champagne.
