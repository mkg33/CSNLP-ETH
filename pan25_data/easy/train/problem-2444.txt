The 'box' bit though was less out of compassion for Goop's character, and more about the anticipation.
I know the fear of thinking, almost knowing, that people I love are very dead.
I was wrong, of course, but man, I was left alone early as a 4-5-year-old as parents went to do shopping, and if they didn't return in like three hours, I'd straight up panic and leaf through photo albums, literally saying farewell to them.
Kind of explains why I even 25 years later get really anxious when I know that someone I love's riding a bus or on a plane.
So the box scene, with the dude desperately not trying to know something he perceives is right (and sadly turned out to be) did a fucking number (7) on me when I first watched it as a teen.
Actually accurate.
Went back to France after fleeing the war in Ukraine.
Paid huge percentage of taxes.
0 governmental aid.
Left the country because it was unclear if they would take our kid away for not vaccinating against everything under the sun.
What a socialist hellhole.
I told a person helping refugees about the problems I was having getting help and she literally said that if I didn't like it to leave.
So I did.
They're still being a pain in the ass.
