It's not that they hate Americans.
It's that they want to get rich and they are willing to abandon all morals in order to get rich.
They are human beings who have forsaken their conscience in pursuit of personal wealth.
They are a human being who knows someone will pay a lot of money to press a button and they don't care what the button does.
How much money would someone have to pay you to press a button that killed a stranger?
What if they paid you $1 billion?
Maybe you have the morals to say truly that no amount of money could make you press the button, but there only needs to exist a few people who are willing for it to happen.
And it's not that the people pressing the button would hate the stranger.
They wouldn't know the stranger.
They feel nothing about the stranger.
It's not about the stranger.
It's about their desire to get the money.
No, seriously.
They are a threat to the well-being of most people in this country, even those who consider themselves Republican.
We need to fuck their shit up for good.
