Maybe yes, maybe no.
I wouldn't want someone reading a text from a religion not my own to my children/grandchildren.
And probably most people feel that way.
That has absolutely no relation to drag queens, don't know why you would try to connect those things.
I can certainly say that my 3-year-old grandson is quickly bored by someone reading to him in a bored or wooden voice, and LOVES being read to in a dramatic manner, the more exaggerated the truck sounds (for example), the better.
He would have a great time being read to in the over-the-top manner of a drag queen.
Seriously!
Drag is just dress up, play pretend, or to embrace another side of us.
It's totally harmless.
IDK why these conservative squares are fine with the Pope wearing a dress and big hat, but John down the block dressing up as Lady Gaga is different and wrong somehow.
Exactly.
They tell us to keep our lifestyle behind closed doors.
Well we did.
Those people were at a club exclusively for them to be “behind closed doors.” And you know what happened?
Some MAGA nut opened those doors and open fired.
We can’t be anywhere that is safe.
