When Trump and Pompeo released 5,000 Taliban and negotiated the turnover of Afghanistan to the Taliban in 2020 there should have been a provision for the Afghans who put US interest over Afghan interests in exchange for citizenship in US.
Vets leading this are fools.
As one of them, I served there because 10 years earlier, America only wanted vengeance.
After that was complete, citizens only wanted us gone.
The United States were never interested in making Afghanistan a westernized colony in Central Asia.
The people who believe otherwise are at best naive, and more aptly -fools.
My indifference is to those who think their service is altruism.
All nonsense.
The lesson to learn from Afghanistan is that while your political opponents may be overtly racist, and you feel the need to attack your political opponent in any way possible, you need to consider how you're going about it to avoid having implicit racism work it's way into those attacks.
And God knows there were plenty of avenues to use to criticize Rumsfeld, Bush, the defense industrial complex, etc, without needing to resort to a narrative that has "those people over there are all the same" built into it.
Nope.
The Trump/GOP is the one selling the anti-immigrant, anti-refugee ideology and the one who made no provision for Afghans.
The issue is trying to get Trump/GOP to care which they did not and you did not see any veterans group call out Trump/Pompeo on this when they signed Afganistan over to the Taliban.
Did we hear any in the Trump/GOP asking Trump or Pompeo to put that into the Trump/Taliban handover agreement?
