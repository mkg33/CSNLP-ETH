Problem is every time the virus infected another person, there is a possibility the virus mutate to another variant which can goes either way whether becoming more dangerous or milder.
So now imagine 1 billion people in China having it.
It is a 1 billion permutation there.
If China wants to follow their pride and ambition the ONLY chance they is to ditch the CCP and upgrade to Democracy, in which case they could replace US power, otherwise they are just a tool for the US and EU without much chance of displacing their power because their reputation is crap, they have no real allies and their huge population in an above average warming region does not bode well for future easy growth.
It is kinda sad.
China honestly did much better than the rest of the world initially on containing it and protecting folks.
But then they made some severe missteps including bashing vaccines initially when they didnâ€™t have enough and only wanted the working people to get them now resulting in the elderly who arguably need it most not getting it.
This and a few other missteps will potentially cancel out the good job they did initially.
