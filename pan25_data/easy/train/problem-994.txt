So, we have one man with clear intent taking government property days before he loses access, repeatedly obstructs lawful attempts to retrieve that property and by not returning the documents promptly, is now in possession of stolen property.
This clearly shows corrupt intent and although we can only speculate at this point what that corrupt intent is, blackmail and treason (through sale to foreign adversaries) figure pretty high in that list.
The fact that this was premeditated and intentional isn't even up for debate since Trump showed this clearly and publically throughout the whole incident.
Trump didn't declassify them (but that really isn't the important part anyway).
There is a clear and well established process for declassifying documents and there is absolutely no evidence that any of it was followed except in Trump's mind.
Even then, he only said that in a flurry of random excuses after he got caught.
Oversight?
Yeah, okay.
I keep forgetting it's (D)ifferent, right?
Ten years, and then they kept a lid on it in November because, well I'm sure you can connect those dots.
