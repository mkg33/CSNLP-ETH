> Hours later, at around 9:00 p.m. on the same day, a second package addressed to the Instalaza de Zaragoza arms company was detected.
The company sent grenade launchers to Ukraine under the Russian invasion.
The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Specialist Technician (TEDAX) carried out a controlled detonation.

I can't speak much for what things are like now on the ground, but back then, I met with enough people that had portraits of Franco, falange (and nazi) flags draped in their homes, loads of military dick-riding stuff, and blindly hated anything related to Russia, as well as a few that were the straight opposite, Soviet flags (not just communist or republican) and Russian paraphernalia.
Fachas dont love anything.
The common fascist will immediately jump against any perceived misdeed with hate and anger, and as of right now, the military has to follow what the government says, and with the government being a center-left one, they could consider that as a treason.
That's the level on which they operate.
Is this Russian intelligence operation?
Or just some Russian supporting morons?
Or Kaczynski style terrorism unrelated to Russia (eg.
Basque separatists)?
True, the thing is that... almost nobody gives that much of a fuck, to be honest.
Fascists here have enough trying to resuscitate Francoism.
However, I might be wrong and its about Ukraine all along, it just sounds very contrived.
(Although spanish fascists are indeed stupid enough for it to be this contrived).
Pure nazis, about a few that are mask-off, many more hiding under the "traditionalism" and "spanish pride" thing.
