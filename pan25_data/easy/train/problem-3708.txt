Man when you say things like this, it's like you don't actually watch anything he is at.
He gives an hour long state of the Union speech that involves linguistically splitting the gop and walking then to opposite corners, covers the global political landscape and the war, the economy, what he's doing in regards to all of that, and you guys pass around a 30 second video clip of him getting side tracked briefly by Corn Pop like the whole rest of the speech he wasn't delivering it in spades.
Right?
None if them think "hey, this guy's a cheater.
Maybe he was making up that 'rigged election' stuff!
".
Oh yeah.
I remember.
The right wing website Judicial Watch kept a running tab of all of Obamas travel expenses while President.
They said he was accountable to the taxpayers for that and highlighted all of the expenses for Obamas personal travel (Ex: visiting Hawaii with family).
Doubt it.
They will hope he holds on 2 more years and then they don’t have to hide any lies anymore.
They won’t care what happens to Biden after he is out of offic e.
