He had such similar traits as Trump, the “I’m the smartest person I know” rhetoric (right up until he was faced with someone in the same line who genuinely was smarter and better, at which point he became a puppy dog with his tail between his legs), the spending money pointlessly to flaunt wealth (the “poor man’s idea of what a rich man is” idea - things like a tv set in every room, despite hardly being home to watch tv because he’d spend all day at the office).
It really does become all consuming, this desperate need to constantly prove their own value, at the expense of everyone around them.
