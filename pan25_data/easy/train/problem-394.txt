DeSantis's reasoning is so risible.
The AP course isn't encouraging student to embrace political ideologies; it is simply describing the politics and theories proposed by significant figures in African American history.
By DeSantis's absurd rationale, it could be justified that prior AP courses can't even mention liberalism and conservativism even though I specifically remember learning about them in my AP US History course from over 15 years ago.
His priority is to obnoxiously insert his politics into the culture wars to distract voters like this stunt, the voter fraud arrests, and the baseless inquiry into Covid vaccines.
Intersectionality is real.
You are going to argue black gay men are treated the same as white lesbians?
Have the same history?
Same exact struggles?
Of course not.
That isn't what crt is anyway.
Crt is whatever boogyman Desantis decides it is, just like grooming bills that have nothing to do with grooming.
Ridiculous.
Slavery has been a human institution before the Talmud.
You calling me ignorant about this is hilarious.
