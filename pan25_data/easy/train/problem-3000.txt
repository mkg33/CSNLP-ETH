>“Today it had to become a pile of rubble.
Russian occupiers concealed explosives inside.
It was impossible to avoid having to blow the building up.
Thanks to the wit and skills of our sappers no one was hurt – that’s the important part.
Walls can be rebuilt.”.
No justification needed here, seriously.
I can’t even fathom that Russia would try and use their FAKE surrender as apparent proof that Ukraine are the baddies.
This is actually mind boggling.
I guess that’s part of the point.
>Ukrainian military hit four Russian command posts, 22 areas of concentration of personnel, weapons and military equipment, six ammunition depots and four other important Russian objects.
Good.
What could Lavrov possibly have to contribute?
To say the least, Russia is not cooperating or helping to foster security in Europe.
There is no practical reason for shithead to be there.
Ukrainian strategy remains sound.
They value their men over their land, so when Russians gain local superiority they retreat rather than mount last stands.
