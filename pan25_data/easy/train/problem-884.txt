I'd say, about 3 years - and it likely will include at least one major conflict with the Palestinians.
There do not seem to be any factors breaking the coalition apart in the near term, however the mere fact that Ben Gvir with his very hardline stance on the Palestinians has control over the Border Police (The Israeli police force in the West bank) as Head of the National Security Ministry creates a very significant chance of conflict (Palestinians will not simply accept any new crackdown against them).
Such a conflict could very well break the coalition sometime in the next few years, depending on who is blamed on it and how intense it becomes.
Zionism was consistently an overwhelmingly secular ideology since its inception, as well as Palestinian Nationalism.
Hamas is religious, and so is the israel Religious Nationalism movement, but both represent a minority even at their peak.
4 years.
The reason for instability of the last few years is that there were 3 blocks of parties that didn't want to seat with each other, where no one of them got 50%+1.
2 governments that were formed during this period were parties from different blocks joining and then being torn a part due to their differences.
This time, one of the blocks got 53%.
There is no realistic scenario of this coalition falling apart.
