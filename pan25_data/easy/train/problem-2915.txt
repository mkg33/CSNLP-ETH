Oh, he will be in the news again soon enough.
Probably will be about how he tragically fell from 30 stories for a 3-story building after shooting himself a dozen times in the back of his head.
Truly tragic.
If you pay attention to Russian media recently, as in the last 6 months but especially the last 3 - and which I will remind you, this media is all strictly state controlled, so the opinions presented there are at the very least state approved if not actually directed - you will see that it has explicitly genocidal aims being promoted, saying that the Ukrainian culture must be totally destroyed, that the people donâ€™t really exist and are just corrupted Russians, and if they resist this then they must be destroyed utterly.
And the raw resource sector needs workers.
And those workers are then taken out of the factories and into the oil fields.
The factories will be closed and you just import stuff from other countries with all your oil money.
Problem is when said countries start banning imports.
Surovikin was likely behind the strategy of attacking Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.
He is a terrorist in the literal sense of the word.
He was called General Armageddon because of his use of indiscriminate bombing in Syria, flattening cities.
