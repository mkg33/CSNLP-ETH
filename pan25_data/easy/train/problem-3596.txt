Wow.
What a misleading headline.
Stretched the words they used far as they could without lying outright.
It’s a contract that the majority of workers voted for.
That’s the entire reason it’s on the table.
That’s why we’re talking about it.

Contract negotiations occur after our current contract expires.
It goes on until a deal is made or one side calls for arbitration.
If that fails, there's a cooling off period in which the president may appoint an emergency board.
The PEB hears both sides last best offer then presents a recommendation.
Both sides bargain off the recommendation and come up with tentative agreements within 30 days.
Once 30 days is up, strike or lockout can occur.
The tentative agreements were drawn up and sent out for ratification, with 8 out of 12 unions representing about 50% of the workforce ratifying.
The other unions rejected, with one union rejecting 2 contracts.
That brings us up to the current situation.
Dec 9 is the end of the current cooling off period and Congress is set to force the tentative agreement on the remaining 4 unions.
