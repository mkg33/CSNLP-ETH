In a small village in Britanny, I've seen a church with an engraved stele in front of it.
No idea how old the stele is, the church itself is 19th century, but the stone probably came later.
Impossible.
What would they need the church for in this laise-fair world?
The power of the Catholic church stems from the fact that they historically were considered the only valid middle man between people and their god.
Seriously.
These are the same people that genuinely believe that there is no morality without God.
Empathy doesn't exist for them, only fear of punishment.
Additionally the entire salary of priests, bishops etc.
is not paid by the church taxes but by the state.
So you literally pay taxes twice to the church, they even mooch of your normal taxes.
Yep and they try so hard to lie to you why church taxes are needed.
They always put a big church plaque on kindergardens, Caritas, hospitals etc.
when all of those are mainly paid for by the state.
The church only finances a low single-digit percent of their cost.
