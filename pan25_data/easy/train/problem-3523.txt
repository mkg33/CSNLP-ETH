The District Court for the Northern District of Texas has 12 judges plus 5 more on senior status.
The district itself is subdivided into 7 divisions of which Kacsmaryk is the only judge in Amarillo.
Also the cases aren’t just randomly assigned.
There are factors for efficiency and propriety such as excluding judges where they might have a financial interest so they don’t have to recuse themselves, but I originally left out some of those details to get my point across more succinctly.

Agree that Kasmaryck’s willingness to take these cases without having them refiled in Austin creates the appearance of collusion on the part of his court, which has HUGE ramifications and potentially calls the impartiality of all three of those judges’ courts into question.
That's it.
That's how it should go.
Every state should have a similar structure.
If I'm New York state, and I'm pissed about something that happened in NYC that has Federal jurisdiction, I should have to file in the relevant NYC district, not Buffalo, not Miami--NYC.
If it's a state matter, same thing.
Not Albany, not Buffalo--NYC.
