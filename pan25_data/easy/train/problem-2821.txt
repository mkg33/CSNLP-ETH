Nobody is saying that you should trust them.
Stop twisting words.
The business has a right to protection against unreasonable search and seizures.
You trusting that business is something completely separate from that, and through contracts you can provide yourself additional protection from business malfeasance through threat of litigation that you cannot truly get if the business has no right to protect its records.
Which is to say that you have a choice in what businesses you work with and you can verify their policies with them and even enter into agreements on data privacy, and those protections extending to businesses protects you as a consumer when that happens.
What you say to your doctor might be privileged, but if your doctor's office, which is a business, isn't protected, then your records may as well be public, and since doctors have professional and legal obligations to protect your records AND the business is protected by the 4th amendment, one can presume that your doctor's notes on your conversation are generally safe from disclosure barring negligence, malfeasance, or data breach.
Seems like they should go to jail.
LLC's are people too, just they have no obligations to the people they screw.
They just pay a little more taxes.
Oh, well we have another obligation to my other business, so I guess we can't be held liable for ripping someone off.
