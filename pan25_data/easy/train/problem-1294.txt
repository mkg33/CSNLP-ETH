While I welcome any person to be cured from a serious medical condition, the cost-benefit ratio for this "treatment" is unfavorable.
A bone marrow transplant in Germany (where this treatment was performed) currently costs $228800.
This doesn't cover other costs like post-transplant care and medication.
If, however, a sufficient number of donors and enough teams of doctors were available, we might cure the suspected 38.4 million people infected with AIDS at a price tag of about 8.7 trillion dollars.
However, such a transplant is risky and might kill several thousand people in the process.
Still, it's not an impossibly large amount of money when compared to the world GDP of 104 trillion dollars in 2022.
The world spent about 2 trillion on defense in 2022 as a comparison.
Absolutely!
As someone who had to watch his older brother struggle with this disease both physically and socially while he deteriorated before my eyes in the mid 90's, this is a historical milestone and the leukemia implications make it even more so.
