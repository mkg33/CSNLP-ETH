No.
My mum voted to leave because she wanted ‘to take back control’ over our borders.
I asked how that was going with all the immigrants crossing the channel in small boats and she blamed France for not stopping them.
When I pointed out that we had ‘taken back control’ now and asked why we couldn’t use that control to prevent this happening, she stopped talking to me.
Logic is lost on them.
Disgusting sentiment.
Cheering on harm to innocent people based on the country they were born into could not be more gross.
etc.
etc.
the rest of your comment is just confused gibberish that I won't even address.
Go read a good book on why, for example, the US is contributing the most in weapons to Ukraine, why the US has such huge military industry complex, and what the US did to hinder the growth of European military industry... etc.
No shit?
You mean Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Belize, Panama, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Nicaragua, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, St Kitts and Nevis, St Vincent and the Grenadines, St Lucia, Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago, Dominica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Barbados aren't secretly US states?
NHS?
Are you kidding?
UK healthcare system costs only about $4.5k/inhabitant.
Compare that with the US (over $12k), Switzerland (about $10k), or countries like France, Germany, etc.
(all in the $6k-$7k range).
But very few Americans would ever seriously consider secession as a desirable act.
That's why for Americans we don't understand Brexit because from our perspective it was so clearly a bad idea driven by emotion and shortsightedness.
Because for us it's analogous to a state trying to leave the Union.
The cons so clearly and overwhelmingly outweigh the pros.
The same was true of the UK and their economic outlook pretty much just vindicates that.
