I think it’s worse.
It’s not even that he doesn’t care, but it’s what he actively wants.
Imo he’s trying to provoke other states into not accepting Florida students so that he can get points for “standing up for students” and blame other states for not allowing other kids to have a future.
Realistically, trapping kids in Florida by not giving them education opportunities elsewhere is punishing them for things they didn’t vote for, and had no say in.
Desantis can and probably will play into that and tell everyone while he’s running for President that “those liberal states don’t want our kids to have good educations, look what happened in Florida, they won’t let our kids into their colleges anymore… they’re punishing them for having an anti-woke education.”.
2006.
All the hicks did it and I remember several of them getting called into the office and there was a huge discussion about it and people thought they were going to all get fucked.
Then they told them "Once hunting season is over to never bring them back".

Ah damn it, I took the bait.
We're talking about DeSantis and education, and how Biden has engaged him, but that's not why you're here.
Your bad faith means I'm the idiot.
When do we get to the part how he is too old?
Remember people.
It is a statistical truth that the more educated an area is the more blue it is.
Instead of voting red to combat "wokeness" maybe look into why poorer, less educated people vote red and it'll start making sense why Republicans continuously gut schools and ban books.
