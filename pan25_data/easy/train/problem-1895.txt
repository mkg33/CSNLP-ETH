Our current system isn’t good, it prevents people from being able to get off the programs because of its low threshold to lose the help if someone gets a better job but probably still needs the assistance ti be able to actually pull themselves out of poverty, these services are supposed to be covering the necessities until the person can cover them themselves and just because you make 1.50 more an hour you suddenly don’t qualify anymore even though 1.50 an hour will barely make a dent.
However, the system we have helps people still and scrapping it does a lot more harm than good.
We need to restructure it in a way that helps people help themselves and doesn’t punish people for trying to better their circumstances.
