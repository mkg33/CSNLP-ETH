It was heavily pushed by Germany, not the U.S. Their motto is 'Wechsel durch Wandel', which literally means change through trade.
Since the early 2000s Germany has been fixated on that idea with Russia, as they have seen that happen for real with the way they dealt post-WWII with France, where their steel co-op would eventually develop into the precursor of the EU.
They, and the entire membership of the EU today, had experienced enough to seek the lessening of the potential again for war on the continent by the major powers that led to war-ravaged continent twice in the span of a couple decades and some change.
So, in their mind it made sense that building tight economic relationships with former Warsaw Pact nations and Russia that this would avert the potential for another war, as who would want to give up hard-earned and -fought economic gains, prosperity and increases in quality of living for imperialistic war?
I don't see how.
I don't see how there's anything immoral about helping another country with a costly and dangerous endeavor while wanting something in return down the road.
That's typically how international relationships work.
Oh my.
REALLY?
The imperial military industrial complex got involved in a war for Profit??
Say it isnâ€™t Sooooo.
