I was looking for this, when I was stationed at Fort Carson, I remember them saying 20 gallon of fuel to start an M1.
And only 300 mile range on a tank of fuel in optimal conditions.
Training and maintenance are a huge part daily activities for military equipment.
They canâ€™t expect the US to drop off 40 tanks and expect them to be in service the next week.
I think basic tanker schooling in the US Army is 20+ weeks.
Again, arguing incompetence isn't a valid excuse.
Ukrainians are not locked into their old Soviet tech and have proven capable of rapidly learning and implementing modern equipment.
German diesel engines are also very complex as they the best in the world, they require specialized maintenance as well.
I know you've read some articles and think you're an expert.
But Ukriane is more than capable of handling Western equipment.
We saw the same arguments again and again on why we can't provide systems.
Only for them to be used effectively by Ukriane.
You can keep coming up with excuses, but the reality is that ukriane needs equipment and has proven to be able to learn and adapt to use of western kit very well.
Humans generally make extremely poor decisions when confronted with unfathomable consequences.
Thankfully for us, the higher power has long been very aware of this.
