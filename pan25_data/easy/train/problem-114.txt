I’m sick and tired of these weak, poor, and ignorant conservative states warning against socialism when the only thing they can do is extract oil and rocks out of the ground or poach companies that would not exist without Californian socialism to move to their state.
You want one good success?
Yugoslavia.
Look at Yugoslavia under communism, it’s standard of living, literacy rate, population, nutrition, and industrial output, and then compare it to the former Yugoslav republics in the 90s to today.
They’re a mess of poverty, genocide, war crimes, starvation, and a dying population.
You can say they failed because it fell into petty nationalist squabbles once Tito died, and it became corrupt as fuck during market liberalization, but I will use Yugoslavia under Tito as a success story.
Authoritarianism and its consequences.
Socialism is actually pretty great.
The military is socialized national security.
Police are socialized local security.
Public schools are socialized education.
Much of the science that enabled the American standard of living was socialized scientific research.
California is the wealthiest state in the union and has one of the strongest social safety nets out there.
