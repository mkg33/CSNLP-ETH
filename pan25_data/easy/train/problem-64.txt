They have no authority in Canada regarding Canada's laws or Chinese law.

You think they sent an unguided intercontinental balloon to just randomly grab some LiDAR imagery (that they can get from satellites), risking international incidents with whatever countries it drifts over?
Not cool at all!

The friendly fire… no, no, we can’t do that.
They are our last resort.
Canada's Department of National Defence said the balloon's movements were being actively tracked by the North American Aerospace Defence Command, which is responsible for monitoring airborne threats to the continent.
The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces issued a joint statement Thursday night that said the balloon’s movements were being actively tracked by the North American Aerospace Defence Command.
