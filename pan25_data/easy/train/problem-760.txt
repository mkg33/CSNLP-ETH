No we didn’t Taking twenty years of people in this country and throw a stupid label on it over simplifies the problems we face as a nation.
Boomers were supposed to be born to WWII vets but guess what.
Mine was in Vietnam.
How does someone born in the 60’s have in common with those born in the mid to late 40’s and early 50’s.
Big difference.
Plenty of Silent Gen still around that were able to live off of one person in the household working.
This was not the case after the 80’s with Reagan who was from the Greatest Gen. Who do you think voted for him.
His generation and the generation after that and some boomers.
Every generation has those that think because their life has worked out why hasn’t it worked out for others.
Got plenty of the younger Republicans that think SS is an entitlement.
It’s terrifying.
I mean, there are republicans officials actively trying to start a civil war, and yet what’s on the news is what Zelensky was wearing and how this means Biden hates Russia and us starting a war with China.
Maybe I’m old but I remember that Russia (not it’s people but it’s government) has not been a friend to the US since WWII and that was only by proxy because Hitler was stupid enough to invade in the middle if fucking winter.
Where all this love comes for Russia is fucking flabbergasting to me, and they just want to focus on outfits and getting rid of drag shows.
I mean what the ever loving fuck.
