Seriously.
I was watching the news yesterday and they were having a panel discussion about Warnock and the midterms.
Someone made a comment about how well the GOP did in comparison to Trump endorsed candidates.
One of the comments was something like, "Republicans won in all their elections in GA except the Senate.
".
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.
If you want to help make this community a better place, consider !
Absolutely not.
They are going to shit all over everything and act like dumbasses.
It's going to be nothing but a bunch of red meat getting thrown to the orcs.
Thankfully.
Had the projected red wave came I would have lost my bank account and my rights to work, drive etc.
Still though I am worried that the next time Rs get power, then that will be the end of the road for me getting by without having to reliant on someone else, I am just expecting the next time Republicans take control, then I WILL lose my rights to drive, work, own/rent my own property, and have my own bank account and credit cards.
