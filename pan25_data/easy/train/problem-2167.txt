I adore the cognitive dissonance of conservatives now that they've been told by their media overlords that it's finally okay to shit on Donald.
"Yeah, he was the greatest POTUS in history, but he's always been a narcissistic grifter piece of shit who only cares about his own ego.
Also January 6th was A-OK and he's being unfairly persecuted by a fabricated witch hunt.
But he needs to go the fuck away immediately so he doesn't interfere with the ascendancy of god emperor DeSantis.
