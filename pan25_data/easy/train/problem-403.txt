Now it was Oda Nobunaga who first specifically started to disarm peasants.
He primarily did this though as a way to disarm the Ikk≈ç-ikki, an organization of warrior monks/peasants who wanted to overthrow samurai (nobility) rule; but Nobunaga also wanted to create clear separations between the classes, giving the right to carry a sword only to the samurai class.
Later in 1588, Toyotomi Hideyoshi also started his own sword hunt after he came to power, and while some believe that was in part due to a few peasant uprisings, it was well known that Hideyoshi also believed that there must be clear separations between classes like Nobunaga.
Cool.
Once again you are conflating together suicide stats and homicide stats.
If you break down by the relevant issue of gun homicides you see that California has very high rates of gun homicides.
Maybe I didn't make it clear in my last comment, when the stat "gun deaths" or "gun violence" is made it is usually done by combining disparate stats of suicides and homicides together in one stat.
This gives an inaccurate impression of which states have higher murder rats.
