I think at this point, he's a liability even by GOP standards, and I think even he's beginning to realize that sticking around is probably going to do him more harm than good.
This is probably his way of "compromising"; he's hoping that by stepping down from committees, there will be less of a spotlight on him and therefore less scrutiny, which he hoped would allow the whole thing to blow over.
Once he fully accepts that this is not going to go away, I think he'll step down and focus on how the fuck to get back to Brazil where being found guilty of a 10 year old case of check fraud is probably going to be easier for him to deal with than the laundry list of crimes he committed in the US.
Big deal!
Recuse himself from committees how noble of him.
Why not recuse himself from office completely.
Don't think that will matter now he has been sworn in because I believe will retain his lifetime benefits.
Amazing he is going to focus on serving his 22% who support verse the 78% who believe he should resign.
