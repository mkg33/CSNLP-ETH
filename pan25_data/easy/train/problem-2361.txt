So I get the etiquette and all, but I’ll continue to dis and deride him every chance I get just like he dissed our country’s veterans, people of color from “shithole” nations, immigrants trying to make a better life, the disabled, women, and anyone else who was, for whatever unfortunate reason, susceptible to the gravitational pull of the world’s biggest asshole.
My father used to beat my mom.
Years of this.
But even with evidence I brought directly to our principal and a cop of him hitting her then saying “yes I hit her” on tape, they said there was nothing they could do.
Years later my dad hid my mothers checkbook as she struggled to get it back.
She ended up scratching him.
He called the cops immediately and she was taken to our local jail.
The justice system doesn’t work and trump will face no repercussions.
It’s rotten all the way down to small town levels.
