I cannot and will not defend what happened to Tyre Nichols.
It is monstrous, the same way that what happened to countless others is monstrous.
However, I think about this guy and what he said, and I see how otherwise good people can get a distorted view of the world, where they see the worst of the worst, and it just never stops.
I donâ€™t know what to do about it, though.
Not if you consider how much funding is wasted on unneeded military grade equipment, and paying speakers to come to departments to tell officer the best sex they experience is after they put down a criminal, or that everyone wants them dead so they need to be afraid and approach every situation with adrenaline pumping.
Defunding also wouldn't hurt with reforms as the lack of multi million dollar lawsuits would make more funds available for therapy, descalation training, and hiring mental health staff to deal with members of the public in crisis instead of sending hyped up armed thugs.
Partially.
Personally, I'd like to see that done in tandem with raising the training and education standards for police raised to the standards used in Europe and other first world nations.
