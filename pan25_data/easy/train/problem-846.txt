While it is true that the Constitution grants the authority to the state's legislature, the state's legislature's authority is still bound by the State's constitution.
The legislature cannot exceed the authority that created it.
The legislature is created by that document, and not by the United States Constitution.
If the people of the state in the creation of their state have bound the legislature to some principle not contradictory to the United State's Constitution, then then the legislature must remain bound.
If those same states have also established an independent judiciary whose role is to settle disputes in matters of law, and some dispute arises out of a law passed by the legislature and the constitution of the state, then it is the proper role of the state courts to settle that dispute.
Always those two fucks.
If the Court rejects this, I honestly see them as voting to unanimously reject it -- being on record for supporting this is clear and strong evidence for a lack of constitutional knowledge and judgment, and reason for impeachment.
Yeah.
What's to stop us from getting a bunch of liberals on a bus and driving to a red state and declaring that we are the legislator and we decide the outcome of the election?
If the laws of the state are inapplicable and the state courts can't stop us, that leaves the federal government which also has zero power to determine state legislators.
