In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Alaska is incredibly different.
I believe one thing that separates them from other states is their large amount of citizen initiatives.
Anytime their state congress does something the majority of Alaskans don't like, they can sign enough signatures and enact a citizens veto.
If enough people petition an issue or an idea, it goes into the congress, and can even get it in as a ballot measure.
It was how Alaska got their minimum wage and legal weed with a Republican congress.
Also, alphabetical order has nothing to do with the Consistency/Participation Criterion.
What does that argument even mean?
Itâ€™s actually pretty easily manipulated by corporations who can back single issue candidates in target populations, basically building nefarious coalitions.
What criteria are you using to decide this?
Absolutely no voting system meets the Condorcet, Later-no-Harm and Consistency criteria at the same time.
So I don't think there is any 'non broken' system.
