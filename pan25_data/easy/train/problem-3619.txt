...but they are swallowing the pill due to China / North Korea - Liberal democracies must work together as much as possible.
If it was the other major party, the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) / Liberals - like the previous president Moon Jae-in, this would not have been possible.
DPK / Liberals are characterized as "Pro-unification (meaning being nice to North Korea, and also China to help foster reunification) and pro-human rights (improve social aspects in South Korea... but also standing up to issues related to Japan.
PPP / Conservatives in South Korea essentially stands for anti-China and anti-North Korea (be stern with them, don't be a punching bag), Pro-US (their formal ally / best friend), Pro-Japan (where business is concerned, and overlooking / ignoring WW2 issues, like Japan wants, to cooperate with Japan), and pro-business.
Historically, they were pro-business at the cost of human rights.
Interesting.
So I'm curious then, where exactly is the cut-off for "Europe"?
Could Russia join someday?
Or if Russia were to dissolve, which provinces(or whatever the term for their states is) would qualify if they sought accession?
