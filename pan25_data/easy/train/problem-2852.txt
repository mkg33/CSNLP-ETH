If Congress authorizes student loans and requires them to be paid back, the Dept of Ed can't just unilaterally decide not to do so and just forgive them all whenever it feels like it.
Regardless of how you feel about student loan forgiveness, executive agencies have to operate as Congress has authorized them to.
If Congress didn't explicitly authorize loan forgiveness and the Dept of Ed tries to do it anyways, it gets challenged in court.
Which is why these cases are working their way through since the question remains if the Dept of Ed has this power.
Educational debt forgiveness is thievery!
We need that money so every single year the entire US population can subsidize Florida, the pan handle and the east coast for hurricane damage….
it’s not their fault where choose they choose to live and Florida has no state income tax…so they deserve our help.
F the future of American youth.
F education….
if you educate future leaders, they might see through MAGA lies.
If you don’t force parents to give up their retirement to educate their kids, then they won’t have to depend on social security to keep them enslaved.
Stop complaining and get back to work socialist scum.
