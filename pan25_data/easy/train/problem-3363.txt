The fact is the man who claims so loudly to be such a genius in actuality has been a terrible failure at most of his endeavors especially when he’s been in charge.
It’s true he was successful at being a reality tv star and marketing himself but when it comes to brass tacks and the bottom line the reality is he’s always been a failure when it comes to business and does much better at marketing crap and selling the illusion or conning people than actually running an actual business.

After decades of using it as a wedge issue, Republicans finally got their wish, Roe is dead.
But now, turnout, that thing (along with gerrymandering) that has allowed them to be competitive despite being in the minority in literally every issue, is swinging the other way.
I live here it doesn’t.
There’s a mix of democrats and republicans.
My street was actually gerrymandered where half of the street is in one district and the other half is in the other.
