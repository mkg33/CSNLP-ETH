If I were a Ukrainian military leader I'd have the volunteer Belarusian regiment on standby to return home.
They outclass the Russian troops in almost every way (and probably Belarusian too) except numbers, and the Belarusian military are going to be fickle allies.
Having a couple of thousand guerillas supporting Belarusian protestors is going to be hell for any Russian and Belarusian forces trying to suppress them.
(BTW, I'm not advocating for the regiment to infiltrate and co-opt protests, but use the opportunities provided by unrest to weaken the Russian forces while they are distracted.
).
All that chemotherapy got Putin addicted to radiation.
First it’s Chernobyl, then it’s press release about contemplating using nukes, then it’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, then it’s back to “we are super serious about using nukes this time don’t you doubt us.
“, now we’re back at a terrorist attack on another nuclear reactor.
Someone needs to send him to radioactive rehabilitation.
I hear it’s a blast….smh.
