Iâ€™d suggest you go read up on what the US Military did in Korea and Indochina, places where the US went out of their way to inflict harm upon civilians and were particularly cruel about it.
Historians consider the indiscriminate napalm bombing of Korean civilians a genocide, something which does not include the executions of the multiple hundred thousands of suspected South Korean communists who were purged by the US-backed South Korean dictatorship and the US Military leading up to the Korean civil war and during it.
The indiscriminate B-52 bombing raids in Indochina and the use of Agent Orange were especially nasty as well.
Fortunately.
VERY FORTUNATELY our current leaders aren't playing with a 5th grade mentality.
This is something the republicans would definitely do, but unfortunately weakens the US's image worldwide.

I don't thing people in the USA really have a solid understanding of our empiricalistic history.
We haven't exactly been the good guys.
Can we claim higher morals then China?
Sure?
In some ways.
It doesn't take much.
