The comment essentially states that Ukraine's hypocrisy in pointing out past behavior is justified due to their emotional state at the moment.
That is not correct.
We can certainly emphasise, and understand why they're making the statements about Russia's past but it doesn't absolve Ukraine of their own past.
Then the comment heavily implies that past war crimes do not matter if the offending nation is currently in good moral standing.
That's a non-sequitir that only makes sense if you take the comment's first statement to be true, which it's simply not.
You don't get to decide which history matters and which history you can ignore.
It just reeks of revisionism because 15 years ago Ukraine would've been absolutely hammered for the pogroms and Nazi associations.
It doesn't make any sense to say oh Russia was so bad 90 years ago when you were no better.
You can compare NOW, but that's not what they're doing.
You can juxtapose current actions and label them as good or bad against a country's past actions, but you can't just ignore history and selectively choose which history you look at based on your views of the country in the current time.
The comment is just as emotionally charged as Ukraine's statements (which we can definitely understand) but to claim that it's a rational response is ignorant, since the author of the comment doesn't acknowledge their own bias.
For now.
You know the funny thing about nationalism is that it always finds itself a new enemy when none is available.
