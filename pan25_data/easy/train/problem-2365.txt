Mike Pence is weird, man.
He seems to think there’s a base out there for him but he doesn’t realize he was picked just to be the token for the evangelicals.
The evangelicals wanted Trump’s racism and demagoguery.
Pence was just the piety icing on the ticket for the last election where they still had to put up a pretense.
They don’t need that anymore.
After all the agony & violence this country has been through, “Benedict” Pence’s willingness to CONTINUE to actively shill for trump, even engage in ridiculous lies about bad legal advice Is dangerous, shameless & also makes him utterly unqualified to ever set foot in high office again.
Hey Mike!
You could have just used the 26th, told all the Cabinet to shit or get off the pot and you could have been in charged (which he was).
Showing the GOP that: "Well, he doesn't fuck around when the chips are down.
Maybe he is a good choice."
But nope, he let all MAGA and his own brother tell him he is weak.
He back tracks on that "Trump probably is sorry for wanting me and my family dead."
"Mother says to forgive and forget".
Instead he pretty much sealed his fate as: "I'll just pretend it will go away on it's own if I ignore it."
He will never get a nomination.
His career is over.
