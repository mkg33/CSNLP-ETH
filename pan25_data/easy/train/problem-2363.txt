They used to, but industrialization has changed all of that as families in the developed world have fewer and fewer kids.
The only places in Russia with growing populations are the ethnic republics like Chechnya and Dagestan.
Ethnic Russians reproduce at similar rates to their European counterparts, which is slightly below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per family.
While this war will be an absolute clusterfuck for Russian society and the economy, and will surely impoverish large swaths of society, I don't see how it will recreate the conditions conducive to having large families.
If anything, it will be even more burdensome for modern Russian families to raise children.
We've left the eras where most Russian families were peasants out working the land and benefited from having huge families.
And I don't forsee this war sending Russia back in time to pre-imdustrialization.
Absolutely ridiculous, of course.
Western sheep don't believe a single thing coming out of Russia but eagerly swallow literally everything Ukraine throws out there despite so many known fabrications ("Ghost of Kiev", Snake Island story, etc etc).
