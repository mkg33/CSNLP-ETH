It would be astounding if we could get to 10% light speed.
Even with 10% light speed it would take us 310 years.
We would need technology for a generational ship.
Nurseries, schools, fabrication, entertainment, sewage, life support, long term repair-abilty (hey look - new word).
We would need the capability for this ship, once it arrives, to have all the stuff needed for a ground site.
We're not even close to any of those things, hell we couldn't even get any of those things into orbit right now.
Each percent of lightspeed we manage to miss from 10% makes the whole thing harder.
Wormhole aren't naturally occurring phenomenon, and those structures usually required negative gravity matter, or some other equivalent that fall under the "exotic matter" umbrella.
Essentially things that are possible on paper, but not seen anywhere in our universe (and would kind of break it anyway if they were around).
problem is scalability.
We're talking about a absolutly HUGE space craft carry all the needed supplies to make any use of the planet.
I'm just a layman, but I don't see it happening.
I'd put more hope in ion engines, and oxygen reclamation from waste co2 then lightsails.
