In general, be courteous to others.
Debate/discuss/argue the merits of ideas, don't attack people.
Personal insults, shill or troll accusations, hate speech, any suggestion or support of harm, violence, or death, and other rule violations can result in a permanent ban.
Yes.
Due process is the judge reviewing the merit’s before the guns are confiscated.
After they are confiscated the person can appeal the confiscation.
And most require review and approval once a year so they aren’t indefinite.
Excellent!
Unlike the gun and accessory bans, these actually work.
Just make sure the red flag laws can't be abused, have a review process, and also apply to the police.
It's ridiculous that we have police officers with a history of domestic violence still allowed to own/carry guns.

In most jurisdictions assault requires attempted battery.
In other words just saying you are going to harm someone doesn't count, you have to actually take steps to do so.
Found this out the hard way when a friend of the family was shot by her ex in her company’s parking garage.
Multiple people reported him threatening her, but until he took any actual steps they could do nothing.
Even had a restraining order which did jack shit as he didn't actually violate it until the day he did and killed her.
