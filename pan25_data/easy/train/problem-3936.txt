Not just that but the savings from the giving the poor and homeless proactive care for free is much less expensive than the reactive emergency care they currently get.
When I worked at a major US hospital while the ACA was being drafted, they estimated that universal healthcare would save the average patient 25% in total direct and indirect medical costs.
At the time the government would reimburse hospitals for about 1/3 of the actual cost of unpaid emergency care.
The rest was added onto the cost of all other patients' bills, which is why Tylenol is $20 for a dose.
Otherwise the hospitals would close from the unpaid emergency care.
"electable".
My guy, Bernie has been a sitting U.S senator for how long?
The reason Democrats always get shit on is because they try to run on centrist ideas.
People actually really enjoy a lot of Bernie's policy proposals.
He probably could have been president of the DNC didn't bend over backwards for Hillary.
