What has been happening in Russia seems to have often been skipping due process and being no less than MPs getting the name of a conscript, finding the person at their place of work, and taking them away to the training camps, to show up in Ukraine on the frontlines a few weeks later.
Using my math?
My math is "all the women are still there, so there's no change."
You can quadruple the number of dead and it won't change anything.
Every hundredth man will just impregnate two women.
20 years later, the same kids are in college like nothing ever happened.
Demographically.
Russia has nothing to gain left.
At this point, they are just fighting out of principle and to kill civillians probably, because they can't kill much of ukraines military.
If russia should somehow take ukraine or bigger parts of it, which I don't see happening, they'll have to use their severly damaged military to somehow guard and hold all of this.
There will be constant guerilla fighting and russias still fucked economy will not have a way to replace damaged equipment.
