Ukraine's allies were hesitant to send the "big guns" to Ukraine at first, because the attitude was likely "I dunno if it will help, they'll probably get steamrolled anyway."
After a while, it was "Damn, they're doing really well defending their lines.
We should make sure they have the gear they need to hold the front."
and now, we're at "They've proven that they can go on the offensive, it's time to bring out the tanks and win this thing.
".
in Ukraine, most tanks are killed by Artillery, Mines, Airstrikes \Including drones\, or someone with infantry level rockets or missiles, whether its Stugna, TOW, Metis, Javelin, NLAW, RPG, or any of the dozens of different single use rockets out there.
Are you sure?
The way I heard it, they were refusing export requests, despite half a dozen countries at this point willing to send Leo 1s.
They will (supposedly) only relent if the US agrees to also send MBTs.
Eastern Europe apparently disagrees.
Poland in particular is literally threatening to send the Leopards without German approval, which implies that Germany is refusing to give it.
