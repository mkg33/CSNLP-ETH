Highly recommend reading the NY Times article.
Barr and Durham egregiously abused their power, did everything they could to shield trump from accountability while obfuscating trump's relationship to Russia, while also repeatedly misleading the public.
Not really though.
If Garland/Smith and the DOJ are trying to bury Trump's Jan 6 crimes, they're making it awfully hard for themselves by devoting massive amounts of resources to gathering evidence of the crimes, searching homes of Trump's lawyers and closest advisors and confiscating phones and electronics, investigating all the financiers and planners of the Jan 6 rally, and fighting extended court battles to overcome executive privilege claims to get testimony and records from Trump's inner circle.
No problem.
Something else I'll often point out in the defense of the Capitol Police is that it's actually pretty common in the modern era to let people incriminate themselves on camera and then prosecute later, vs cracking skulls.
Safer for all parties!
People underestimate how much of the timeline is somewhat out of the DOJ's hands, too: if some essential witness claims executive privilege to avoid a subpoena, the DOJ has to devote resources to fighting this appeal, often at multiple levels of court, sometimes over the course of 6+ months.
It's slow because it's slow, not because the DOJ is dragging feet: the important takeaway is that if the DOJ is devoting that much time and resources to obtaining a witness's testimony or records, it means they really fucking want it.
You don't fight so hard for evidence when you're trying to bury a case or avoid prosecution.
