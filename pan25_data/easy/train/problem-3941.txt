Federal minimum wage should be bound to cost of living per region.
If you raise it too high then you'll penalize small businesses in areas with low cost of living.
If you keep it too low to keep from penalizing the small businesses then it will be too low to live on in high cost of living cities.
You can't provide too many legal loopholes or exemptions for employers to skip out on paying minimum wage.
Tipping wages should be eliminated as part of that.
If it were pegged to specific stats then it could be allowed to change flexibly and not be stagnant for decades.
The other thing you could do is tie minimum wage to taxes.
If you are a company that doesn't want to pay minimum wage then fine, pay more in taxes and that money will go right back to your employees through TANF, SNAP, WIC, Medicare, and housing and the government will collect some administrative fees on top of that.
Have people working for you who are on government assistance at a higher rate than the general populace then you either pay your workers more OR you get increased taxes.
Otherwise your business is getting government subsidized labor for free.
