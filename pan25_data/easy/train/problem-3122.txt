One of the things that putting all the blame on Trump does is give other politicians on both sides of the isle political cover for their terrible resource management and decision making.
I saw someone here rightfully trashing Trump for getting into a pissing match with the New York Governor during COVID, yet leaving out his own terrible mismanagement of the New York response that led to many deaths especially in nursing homes.
At the time people were giving Cuomo accolades yet he was hiding data that was politically harmful and also made choices that directly killed patients.
I donâ€™t think being better than Trump is a high enough bar to set for our leaders, but that seems to be the new benchmark in US politics.
