Depends, does FIFA own, or have a contact to be the only league allowed to play in the stadiums they play in inside territories that aren't against human rights?
If so, very.
Are they owned by the city in which they were built?
If so, depends how much renting out the stadium costs, how much you can sell tickets for, and how many tickets you can sell to fill said stadium.
So it ranges from easy, to nightmare mode.
Presumably because Qatar has migrant workers it mistreats (they aren't African, but who's counting), they notoriously have very few rights for women, apparently they do have rights for disabled people (so this shouldn't actually be listed), and being homosexual is outright illegal in Qatar.
Why?
Do you think the politicians you vote for are just and the other guys aren't?
Have we not seen politicians and companies use social causes for their own gain?
It's all a grift to play on our emotions for their own personal gain.
Qatar, as I recall, has never openly supported homosexuality.
The world just keeps trying to groom them into submission - they don’t want it and it won’t happen.
