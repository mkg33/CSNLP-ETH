I didn't watch live but I watched the vice documentary and honestly it was far more upsetting to me than I thought it would be.
I was shaking.
I've spent most of my life deeply aware of all the shit we've done as a country, and angry about it, to the point that I really felt nothing for America as a concept.
But I watched that and I kept thinking, "what are they doing to my country? "
I felt so angry and heartsick and I'll never forget that.
Not even 9/11 hit me that way.
It's goddamn ghoulish.
Since it is coming out that they are going to be releasing this footage to Fox news, I think it is a good time for us all to open up a Freedom of Information Act request so that other people who wish to coordinate their own investigation and Report are allowed rather than the lying mainstream media that got us all into this problem with their constant search for clickbait narratives and their habit of reshaping memories for the easily confused.
Cool.
We’ll get to see the highly edited clips of people standing around peacefully protesting and ignore the violent insurrection part then?
I hate the constant moving of the goalposts and reforming reality to fit a narrative.
It’s disheartening to see so many people eat it up and ask for more.
