I Just found they talk about, russ vs UKr, cop15, but they dont say the content of the information, hope we have some news soon, looks very important.
Leaking diplomatic communications??
What??
What was told to the media is that JT told Xi to butt out of Canadian politics.
Whatâ€™s wrong with telling the media that?
No beans were spilt mate.
Representative democracy does not mean the population is privy to every communication a politician makes, although I can see some benefits of the transparency you allude to.
Umm...
It's called a readout, and it's something that every.
single.
head.
of.
government.
does.
When they meet with a foreign leader.
It is not 'leaking of diplomatic communications'.
It is perfectly standard practice.
Diplomacy requires patience, negotiation, trust etc.
and to throw early communications at the ravenous, dishonest media is an amateur move for a world leader, especially considering the amount of people who are at risk of being affected by trade sanctions China could levy if relations sour....it happened in Australia and whole industries were decimated.
