As in, are there any moderate republicans left in the House.
That would vote against McCarthy and join the Dems in voting for Cheney?
Do you know?
I think they mean minority Speaker as in a member of the minority party in the House as Speaker ... which technically could happen if a couple of moderate Republicans were fed up or they did the political calculations and decided a Democratic Speaker who can't control a House (as would be the case for a minority Speaker in general) would be better than a Speaker of their own party failing to handle the GOP House civil war.
As for the the rest.
IMHO Oregon is a bit strange.
It runs the ganbit from far left to far right.
Democrats outside of Portland and Eugene really hated Brown, and through her Kotek.
If they ran a more moderate for Governor and in the 5th it would have cleaned up and it wouldn't have been close at all.
Johnson only ran, and was a spoiler because of the dislike most the state had for Brown.
They weren't voting for Kotek no matter what.
