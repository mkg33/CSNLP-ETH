The difference is you and I don’t have a cult following from all walks of life giving us an outstanding chance of a hung jury.
Let alone, the state of our supposedly impartial, learned, judiciary branch.
I’m not even talking ideology, just a common sense right and wrong thought process.
I couldn’t believe Trump won the primary, let alone the presidency.
After 4 years in office, I couldn’t fathom almost half the country wanting more.
Look no further than some of our present politicians.
In my wildest dreams I couldn’t imagine some of them getting elected in the first place let alone re-elected after their on the job display.
In my cynical view, I’m not looking forward 2024, or even what happens leading up to it.
Sorry for the rant.
The recovery of classified information in the former president’s possession has been the focus of federal agents and prosecutors who are reviewing classified documents taken from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home and private club, leaving a gap in accountability for other papers, documents, objects and materials covered by the law that requires Trump to preserve all records pertaining to his official duties as president.
