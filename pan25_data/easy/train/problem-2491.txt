As an aside, as a lawyer I’ve always kind of felt that even grand jury indictments are a violation of due process.
Like sure it’s not a conviction, it’s just a step required in some states before they can bring you to trial, but even if you’re acquitted at trial a lot of people will see an indictment on your record and it can still make life difficult for you.
At grand jury you only see the evidence of the prosecution, they don’t present any defense evidence at all, so it can be very easy to get an indictment on someone’s record even if you might then lose at trial.
Obviously, in this case these are pretty rich and powerful people so it’s not like an indictment on their record will be a problem for them, but for the average person it could be (job searches, trying to get a loan, etc etc).

These people who are knowingly spreading the lie and those riling people up with fear and hate speech should all be locked up.
