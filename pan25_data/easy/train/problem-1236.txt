Good comment.
For Xi-Jin Ping to be deterred from attacking, I think Russia would need to lose the Ukrainian war, and maybe lose power (although it's unlikely he would, since he has eradicated almost all internal opposition).
I am worried that he will project all of his internal problems externally and distract his population by throwing them at a foreign enemy and by conquering Taiwan.
The USA and their allies, in the mean time, must remain mentally strong and not waiver in its opposition to dictatorships which aim to supplant the democratic powers, which feels less certain as time goes on.
Yes, Biden will keep opposing them, but he is old, will not necessarily remain in power for much longer and faces many domestic problems too, and we can't exclude that Republicans would become complacent agains't Russia and China should they win the next election.
I hope not, but it is something to keep in consideration.
Russia and China are using social media and bribes to try and polarize our populations and buy out our elites, which can cause a lot of damage.
They know a direct military confrontation would be a disaster, so they use assymetrical warfare to try and make us crumble from the inside.
Excellent.
The US and Philippines just recently agreed upon at least 9 bases at last since fter around 3 decades.
A formal alliance of hopefully finally JP, PH, US, AUS, and SK should be made.
