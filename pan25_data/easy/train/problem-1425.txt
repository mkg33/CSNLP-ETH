The limitations of the F-35, specially in carrying large weapons (Bunker buster bombs) prevents it from being effective against hardened buildings, those bunkers buried underground.
Dude what?
I asked in my first post if you were familiar with The Shaw Commission of 1930.
They issued The Shaw Report, and in that report they concluded that all Jewish land acquisition was done legally.
Here.
> Herzl was not alone in framing the settling of Jews as a colonial project, and other Jewish organizations (including those settling Jews in other parts of the world like Argentina, or non-Zionists organizations settling Jews in the Levant) also actively used the vocaublary of colonialism to describe the process.
Ok, I’ll bite.
Exactly who’s land was stolen?
How familiar are you with the origins of this conflict?
Are you familiar with the Ottoman land reforms of the mid to late eighteenth century?
Are you familiar with The Shaw Commission of 1930?
Pray tell.
The Ottomans were European colonizers.
Jerusalem was already ruled by European colonizers for 400 years before the British even stepped foot in the region.
Hell.
European colonization of Jerusalem is hardly a new thing given that the Romans colonized it before the New Testament was even written.
Given that the Romans were the ones that renamed it Palestine, you could literally make the argument that Palestine is a symbol of Western colonization.
