Looks like they added two more regions to that list.
There's no indication that they won't keep trying to take more in the future.
This is ridiculous.
What's stopping some other nation from waltzing into a territory they don't own, holding 'referendums' where allegedly '90%' of the population 'vote', then taking all the territory as theirs in the future?
Hi.
Russian speaking person here.
Not from Russia.
Never been to Russia.
People seem to forget that theres like 20 other countries with Russian as their first language.
Every African, Asian, South & North American, Asian Indian colony, wanted their occupation / colonization to end.
It did not.
There was a vague guarantee of territorial integrity, but no obligation to a defense.
Putin argued initially in 2014 that the memorandum was no longer valid because the legitimate Ukrainian government had been overthrown in a US backed coup as I recall.
Nah.
I live in Canada now.
Been here almost 30 years.
My whole family overseas doesn’t speak english though so that’s silly.
It’s our language as much as it is theirs and i do not intend on not speaking it.
