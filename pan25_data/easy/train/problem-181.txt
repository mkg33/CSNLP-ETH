How confident are you that the West has any accurate understanding of the situation within Russia -- elite attitudes, among the military, among the populace?
Is that even the right paradigm in which to think about Russia?
As a leading media outlet, how do you approach these differences and how do you judge the validity of sources of information within Russia?
It seems to be an incredibly difficult task for a western media outlet to report on the internal politics and national opinions in Russia about this war.
There are challenges of differing cultural perceptions, the sense that Russians are disengaged or fearful to communicate about politics, a never ending cycle of rumors and punditry, and the lack of a free press.
I remember this day really well.
Having received a letter from a long time online friend, getting messages and seeing the news I honestly thought that Putin wouldnâ€™t have been that stupid.
Seeing the speech from putin and then following the news coverage at work the anxiety of her and her family being safe.
Luckily she is but with the threat still on the coast, the Russians are looking very dangerous after the speeches over the weekend.
Sitting with her letter now open holding back tears.
