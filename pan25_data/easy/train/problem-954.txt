Most people look at someone else and think "I don't give a shit what they do with their lives" and others still think what someone else does effects them.
But what we need to realize is change doesn't happen overnight.
You can't force a society to simply except something they've been taught to hate instantly.
It's a long and hard battle that has to be fought consistently until everyone that hate it is dead and gone.
This is how progress has always worked and it will be how this works.
Just a few decades ago, or less, gay guys in America were afraid to be gay for fear they may be killed.
Most gays are pretty out now.
There are still some that hide due to families and such, but it's so much different now that it used to be.
It's progress.
Anyone is allowed to identify as whatever they want and dress how they like in most western nations, the government is involved because we have gendered/sexed institutions and systems and I guess they decide itâ€™s not worth the effort and resources/pitfalls for them to case handle individuals nor to dismantle gendered/sexed infrastructure and render everything non-binary.
