It‚Äôs more than that many were spouting the BS even as the fluid filled their lungs ü´Å on their hospital beds and many of their families then even went on to blame the hospitals for it all because it could never have been their own or their loved ones fault for exposing themselves/them to such an outcome before vaccines were widespread, no couldn‚Äôt be never.
We had a guy like that at my job.
He ended up taking all his holidays, going on stress leave for like 6 months, then quit cause he was "oppressed".
He was also an idiot who thought he was a genius and nobody liked him.
So these people are just stupid beyond belief.
And selfish beyond belief.
Gaming the system for stress leave was just the cherry on top of everything.
Your speculation does have some merit, Fran√ßois Hollande, our last president, wasn't super popular (he didn't get reelected) and was kinda considered like a weak man (not that it means much, we're a modern democracy, but his nickname was "Flanby" which is a flan or pudding, not very flattering), well i've been surprised that his foreign policy was far from weak, he involved us in Mali and i remember somewhere that he authorized more terrorist assassination than his predecessors.
