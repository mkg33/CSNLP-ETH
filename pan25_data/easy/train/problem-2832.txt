This is worse than we thought.
The NFT grift is bad enough, but he's guaranteeing anyone who buys 45 of these NFT's (so, spend $4500) a ticket to a dinner with Trump (a gala in South Florida).

Trump wants to ban criticizing the government, asking Trump hard questions, and catching Trump in lies.
Trump wants to dismantle the Fourth Estate.
We get it already.
His announcement will be that he had convened a grand jury and will be charging the justice department with collusion with foreign governments, obstruction of justice, inciting a violent riot/insurrection, and illegally holding on to classified documents.
