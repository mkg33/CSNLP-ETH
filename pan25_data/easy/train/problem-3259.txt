Belarus, on the other hand, is a dictatorship imposed by Moscow against the will of the people (since Lukashenko is very unpopular in Ukraine).
This non-elected dictator imposed by Russia is choosing to bring his country into war on Russia's side.
Ukraine, obviously, has a right to defend itself, including targeting Belarusian troops and bases used to attack Ukraine; but it would not be wise nor fair to wage war against Belarus as a country, rather than the Lukashenko regime specifically.
This isn't even a new concept - when Napoleon took power in France for the second time, countries in Europe declared war on Napoleon, not on France, as a way to show that they didn't want to attack France, just remove Napoleon from power.
Like 60000.
It's not real large.
Lukashenko has done everything he can to avoid sending the military, because it'd leave him vulnerable to overthrow at home, he's not exactly a popular leader by any means.
Absolutely.
Belarus is for all intents and purposes a sovereign nation deciding to fire on Ukraine.
There's no such as a utilitarian proxy state that holds no responsibility if it's another country using it's land to attack others.
