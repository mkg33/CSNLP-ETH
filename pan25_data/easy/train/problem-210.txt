You're assuming any of it ever actually happened, which is rather a lot considering the propensity of the Russian government to never tell the truth under any circumstances.
Considering both the personal and professional conduct we've seen out of the Russian military this year, I'm almost certain the above is pure fantasy and what actually happened was the Russian air force botched an airstrike and they had to come up with a way to cover that up.
Good point.
But its on a level I'm okay with accepting at face value.
It doesn't have the same "look how strong russia is!"
Idea they like to parade around and instead is about a person who had to make a very hard choice, like a captain going down with the ship (not the bret analogy).
Its showcasing one thing I think we can all agree russians have in spades: cold hard decision making.
We may not agree with those decisions all of the time (most) but I feel pretty safe saying they will make those choices harder and more stoic than just about anyone else.
