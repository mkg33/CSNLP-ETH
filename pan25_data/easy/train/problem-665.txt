I mean stop simping for China, it's very clear what ASEAN's most pressing issue is at the moment.
ASEAN and it's partners have a right to be concerned when a country within that group does not disclose details regarding miltiary activity with the nation that is the cause of their greatest current issue.
Disclosing their activities with China is a big red flag in terms of trust between the nations within ASEAN and those looking to partner with it especially given that China is the biggest concern at the moment.
The ASEAN is an assosciation created to strenh ties between those countries in an attempt to defend themselves from a mutual threat aka China.
It is being strenhed to help counter Chinese influence in their region and develop collaboration between those countries that have concerns about the increasing militiary threat of China and their increasing claims of territory in South China Sea and areas around those nations.
Letting them do what?
There's nothing to suggest that China did anything wrong.
Likely a naval collaboration of sorts and its not really any of Biden's business.
