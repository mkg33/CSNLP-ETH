The first was announced last month by the US, shortly after Germany announced it would deliver a system and now the Netherlands has joined them.
So there are at least 3 so far.
Poland has never requested deploying German personnel to Ukraine...
They insisted to supply battery which is happening after few weeks of histery created by German media.
I am tired of strightening these idiotic statements on every corner.
This has become ridicoulous.
How Poland which only supplies hardware could request other country to send their troops to Ukraine?
What twisted way of thinking it is?
Or it is only defence mechanism to create chaos and blur point of case?
Exactly.
Putin would probably love if Ukraine attacked Moscow proper so he could use it to drum up nationalistic support for his war of choice.
So far they are playing it smart by sticking to military targets pretty directly related to Russia's invasion.
Seems like you just have absolutely crystal clear messaging on what is and is not a target Ukraine/NATO will go after of Russia's.
1) Any unit on Ukrainian soil and 2) Any point of military attack onto Ukrainian soil.
