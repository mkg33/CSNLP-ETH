The unfortunate truth is that once you feel desperate enough, you and your countrymen will see/feel that such prices are worth the cost of change.
I don’t say that to dismiss how incredibly unjust and evil the forcing of such a decision is, but I do say it to emphasize how this conflict is not going to stop until the Russian people decide to do put an end to it.
If you truly care about your family and the future of your community (which I genuinely believe you, as most if not all Russians, do) I would suggest seriously doing absolutely everything you can to convince people that things are going to get exponentially worse for the people of the country and to stop the journey on the path your country is going down.
The only other option is to flee what is quickly proving itself to be a failed state.
If neither of those options are “possible” for you, then I suppose you can just resign yourself to your fate and accept whatever comes from either the regime or some other group of fascist bullies that push people, like yourself, around.
Disgusting and inexcusable.
But we also need to remember that Ukraine also committed their own massacre on Poles when the shoe was on the other foot.
Still inexcusable and incredibly sickening what is happening today.
just sayn to give some historical context.
And Poles are still willing to open their arms to Ukrainians.
