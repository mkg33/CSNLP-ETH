If loans can’t be forgiven, how are they even loans?
What’s an interest rate if not partially the approximation of risk of the loan?
What risk does a lender take if every loan must be repaid?
And exactly as you said, why is forgiveness afforded to corporations but not people?
In ancient times, society understood the risk of debt and most societies had forms of debt dischargement or jubilees.
They knew a society of debtors would eventually collapse as people have nothing left.
So now the pendulum has completely swung the other way where it’s corporations that are protected by the government while the people are the prey.
Let’s hope we don’t have to relearn this ancient lesson.
That's actually fairly reasonable.
You're restricting your ability to pay early in exchange for a specific type of (likely lower interest) loans for three years.
It's time limited, not randomly attached, and something to opt into in exchange for something else.
Additionally the early prepayment fee isn't huge.
Likely you'd want to wait the three years instead of eating the fee, but if you had to do it, it wasn't a deal killer.
