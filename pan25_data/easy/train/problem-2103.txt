There are mathematical tests you perform on stuff like this.
F-test, P-test etc.
That tell you how confident you can be on some assertion.
Usually you need to 95% confidence to make a definitive statement about something where you could not possibly completely know all the facts in entirety.
A low confidence rate is basically something you shouldnt even report.
It means they have no fucking clue basically.
Couls be a lab leak.
Could be bigfoot.
If you talk to people who are actually experts on relevant topics, they will overwhelmingly tell you that the evidence doesn't completely rule out a lab leak, but that it's very much not the more plausible explanation given the available evidence.
I'm pretty sure a supermajority would go so far as to call the evidence in favor of the not-a-lab-leak zoonotic origin hypothesis "compelling", or other language to that effect.
However, there isn't evidence for the lab leak hypothesis, and there is evidence that appears to support the not-a-lab-leak zoonotic origin hypothesis.
I totally agree with the last two things you said.
Also, Trump definitely pushes a lab leak to shift the blame for his lack of action that is for sure.
A potential lab leak could be true while also highlighting trump's incompetence and lack of care for anyone other than himself.
