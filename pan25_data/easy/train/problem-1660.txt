Honestly, as far as it goes, getting the vaccine and lock down wont get rid of it again at this stage, so beside cleanliness I cant see how you can expect the entire populace to keep vigilance on it while we are heading toward an economic down turn - well, unless it get DEADLIER, which i still see as unlikely to happen.
And the new variants have been less deadly, so it has been true so far.
With how we quarantine the sick, a mildly dangerous case of COVID would already spread less than one that only result in a slight cough, which should be enough of a bias.
We dont wait til people are actually in risk of dying to isolate them, unlike animals, an unhealthy human would spread less.
Maybe there will be a variant that have a longer incubation/spread time before actual serious symptom, but like I said, at this point there really isn't any good way to halt the world to stop the spread any more.
