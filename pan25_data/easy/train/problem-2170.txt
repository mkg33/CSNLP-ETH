Conservatives just want a "Dear Leader" to follow who will subject liberals to whatever cruel policies they can come up with.
DeSantis is succeeding at that where Trump no longer can, and since DeSantis hasn't gone through the media ringer yet (and possibly never will because the media requires an electable Republican to keep sports-like narratives going), he's the most likely person to lead conservatives into 2024.
Lol.
OK. Idk what to tell you.
Republicans underperformed everywhere in the midterm, except FL where Desantis led a landslide victory.
You can call his voters stupid, or whatever you need to make yourself feel better, but results are results.
You're confusing how shitty of a person he is and his track record on turning out votes.
All of the things you said are true, and so is the fact that he won his reelection by 20 points, and a far wider margin than Trump won FL.
That should scare the shit out of you.
It scares me.
Desantis is a skilled political operator.
He’ll make a sweetheart deal that strokes Trump’s ego and grift.
