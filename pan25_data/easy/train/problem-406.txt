Actually there’s nothing stopping him from appointing any number of justices, he’s just so much of a traditionalist that I don’t think he’ll do it especially with all the legislation he’s trying to pass.
There are strong arguments for expanding the court to 13 to match the number of federal court districts.
I prefer a planned approach I read somewhere of appointing 12 or 16 and then replacing one each year based on need or seniority so you keep a stable system without all the drama and you lessen bad incentives.
Also federalist society membership should be an immediate disqualification for the next few decades.
Thank you.
Historical "average life expectancy" seems to be one of the more misunderstood stats.
The "average" was so low because a huge percentage of people born didn't make it past early childhood.
For those who did manage to reach adulthood, 'life expectancy' was not that much shorter than today.
Exactly.
The GOP figured out a good long time ago that SCOTUS functionally has no checks on its power so long as you can’t form a Senate supermajority to hold it accountable.
