Unfortunately, this is actually really common.
I know a lot of people who think this way.
“If you wait until you can afford to have kids, you’ll never have kids” and all that.
I’m almost 29 and am at times harassed about not having kids yet.
When I tell people that, if I had a child now, it would push me into poverty they act like it’s no big deal.
Like being poor is fine as long as you have a baby because babies are fun and beautiful and worth a lifetime of struggle instead of waiting an extra 5 years to work on my career.

Completely agree.
Any social scientist PhD's hanging around looking for a research project?

The hypothesis I would pose is there is some level below poverty highly correlated with increased violent crime after addition of a new child to their family or something like that.
