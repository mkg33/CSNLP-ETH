All the women I work with just kinda, stopped working for the rest of the day.
I went to lunch that day to Eataly and they were doing a huge wine tasting.
I told my boss that I'd be staying for a long lunch and wrapping up my day.
She agreed that it was the right thing to do!
Republicans spent fifty years maneuvering extremists into our legislatures, our courts, and even the presidency.
We have to be willing to do the same and for far longer.
We have to be as relentless and single-minded as the ones who stole our rights away and, yes, I do consider abortion rights as MY rights.
Confront them with their own words, force them to talk about it, don't let them cowardly hide behind their supposed morality.
The Republican party, in its current incarnation, is a blight upon this world, an embarrassment that can't even govern itself, and a vicious monster that gleefully inflicts suffering upon people.
They aren't moral, they aren't a majority, and they sure as hell aren't silent.
We can't afford to be silent either.
