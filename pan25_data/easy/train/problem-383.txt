But I'm still under audit for my 2021 return and won't see my refund until well into next year.
Why?
I had to send in eight months of pay stubs to prove what I and my employer both sent in on my W2, and provide medical records, birth certificates, mortgage statements, and a whole stack of other documents to prove that my children are mine and that I paid for their needs for the year.
The same kids I've always claimed without incident.
Many of these were duplicates of things they already had.
This is not a result of identity theft or any suspicious activity - when I called, the examiner told me it was just a random audit.
There are many of us going through this but nope, Donald Trump can claim millions in losses and get a 4 million dollar refund, no biggie.
