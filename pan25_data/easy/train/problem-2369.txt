And the Soviet Union supported India what’s your point?
The topic is about the US “propping up” dictators against “popular movements” during the Cold War.
1.
The Pakistani regime whatever it was corrupt politicians or the army was never at risk of collapse or requiring external “propping up” except for maybe in 1971 but even then the state was already pro-US against a soviet-aligned India.
And secondly, there were no major democratic movements in Pakistan until maybe the large scale protests against Musharraf.
Obviously outside the Cold War and the US also did nothing to support Musharraf.
So again, the claim that Pakistan would have failed without US “propping up” is invalid.
Again while Jefferson self-identified as a Christian in the sense that he valued Jesus's teachings and morals he didn't believe Jesus was the literal or adopted Son of God which is kind of a prerequisite for being Christian (because if valuing Jesus's is teachings is enough then all Muslims of the world are also Christians because the Quran considers Jesus a prophet and actually says his name more often than the Bible) so by any reasonable categorical definition that doesn't include self-identification he is not a Christian or if he is then the entire Islamic world is Christian too which you do apparently think is a separate religion from Christianity.
