This is a very hard one, because in modern times you sort of need a secret service to kind of keep tabs on organized crime, foreign influence and stuff.
Sometimes you need people to just be able to assassinate leaders of organized crime without it being public, so they don't have to endanger themselves.
Yet somehow you have to keep politics out of this.
You have to make sure someone has an actual legitimate reason to lay eyes on someone's personal information.
I don't trust FISA courts, I don't trust the court system at all tbh, but definitely not secret courts.
This is kind of one of the benefits of having a military that's seperate from the police.
The military is easier to isolate from politics, and since they don't have power to act as law enforcement, they can kind of do the antiterrorism role better as long as they don't leak information, outside of protecting children or something, to the police.
Only 128GB of data?
That doesn't sound like much.
I bet you can take 100 ordinary people, do a Google takeout, and get way more than 128GB of data they weren't aware was being collected.
