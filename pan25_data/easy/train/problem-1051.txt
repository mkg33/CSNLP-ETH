There are approximately 6,200 undervotes in this race.
An undervote is a vote where the voter simply left this election blank OR marked in a faint or small way their intention (think putting a single dot with your ballpoint pen in a scantron bubble or maybe underlining a candidateâ€™s name as opposed to filling out the circle by their name).
IF there is a mark or indication which election reviewers can reasonably ascertain, that undervote then becomes a real vote which is then counted.
It is important to note that the vast majority of these votes will not result in a change to vote totals and that they are likely blank.
I simply point out that these votes exist in case we see further changes in the coming weeks and people wonder where these new votes are being tabulated from.
