I don't think you appreciate how fragile Russia's position is though.
Russia is increasingly relying on poorly equipped conscripts to make up the bulk of their forces because they simply have burnt through most of their military stockpiles and trained troops.
Those soldiers don't have proper winter gear and will either run or freeze to death after the first cold snap.
Russia wasted 16K missiles so that less than a quarter of them could get through to damage civilian infrastructure, and now they don't have the missiles left to continue their barrages.
The sanctions are taking their toll making it very difficult if not impossible to manufacture what they need to continue, while the price of oil dropping means that they won't have the funds to continue fighting indefinitely.
Meanwhile all those other satellite countries kept under the thumb of Moscow are starting to notice that Russia is getting pretty weak and won't act if conflicts start in areas outside of Ukraine.
Wow.
A whole generation of russian men will be wiped out.
Hopefully this will stun the growth of the population so they won't do anything stupid like this for a generation or two.
