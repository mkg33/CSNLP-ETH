There's no need to though, as smuggling cigarettes is easy AF since no drug dogs give a shit about smoking, and they couldn't even if they wanted to.
People on international airports in NZ would be arriving from countries in which smoking is legal, so most people would smell of cigarettes, making the dog useless (which they already are after 40 min of work.
).
Yeah, approximately 15% of lifetime smokers actually develop cancer.
This is one of the reasons why the tobacco industry was able to fight off the accusations for so long.
Just because you smoke all of your life doesn't necessarily mean you will die of lung cancer.
Yeah, I believe more than twenty percent of lung cancer cases are completely unrelated to smoking at all.
Vehicle exhaust emissions and dust irritation are also potential causes that almost everyone is exposed to.
Good!
I'm in my late 40's and several friends of mine that smoked heavy since around age 15 are already dead now.
The ones that stopped still have severe lingering health issues with lungs and heart related illness.
