Fear mongering, no party will be caught dead holding the bag for letting SS become insolvent and even if they do it’s not like it’s a set amount of money thats going to run out and that’s it (They are referring to the surplus fund that is getting depleted).
There is going to be workers after gen Z paying in that’s how it always worked, current workers pay for current retirees.
If congress does nothing and lets SS go insolvent that just means they’ll be paying 80% of the benefits ish not that there’s going to be nothing.
Never accept the right wing propaganda that you will get nothing, that’s what they want to make it easier to get rid, don’t give in.
Exactly.
And this is also a practical issue around income inequality.
The more money that is getting made above 160k and the less money being made below it further drives an SS dilemma.
Raising or removing it addresses the issue if not outright solving it.
Like you said, I'd imagine a lot of people above 160k wouldn't really care much either.
