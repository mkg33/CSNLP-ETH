I’d definitely make more in America as an engineer then I do in Canada and I’d have no problem getting a job since my employer has many sister companies in America I could transfer to.
I currently make $95k CAD with 10 years experience.
My main issue would be work life balance going to America.
It’s not as good as Europe here in Canada but miles better then America.
I don’t trust that I could get what I have here in Canada for work life balance.
I currently work 37.5 hours a week rarely any more then that and get 4 weeks vacation.
I’d need to get what I have now for hours and vacation or I wouldn’t go.
Americans are complaining about social issues, while Canadians are complaining about economic issues.
Each country has pros and cons, and each person has a different set of things they value.
University costs are manageable.
The difference in overall lifetime wages more than makes up for it.
People who make $15,000y more than they would have without the degree love to gripe about $20,000 loans they could realistically pay off in a few years if they lived like someone without a degree.
