Mind you, this text is 100 years old and if you swap Poland/Polish for Ukrainian it changes nothing, that mentality has been and will continue to be, which is why eastern/ central European countries were so loud about them:
Remember that the soul of a Russian, if not every Russian, then almost every Russian, is imbued with the spirit of hatred for every free Pole and for the idea of a free Poland.
"Although the Russian liberal spirit and Alexander's reforms tried to unite Russia with the West, the old conviction, common to us and to Europe, remained that the world of Western culture ends at the eastern borders of Poland, that further on goes Asia.
".
That of course doesn't mean Ukraine has to bow down to Russian demands to avoid further casulties but it's at least important to be aware of them, especially as "outsider" because it's easy to throw lives at the enemy you aren't "responsible" for and as much as people point out Russia's "wave tactics" and carelessness towards the lives of their own men, it should not be forgotten that Ukraine has to match that intensity and that comes with its cost too (and while I believe that Ukraine is doing better as defender overall, Ukraine's losses are also scary even if we take the more optimistic numbers).
