Yeah.
The official figure (which already exceeds 2% because of F-35 deal) excludes hidden costs of conscription.
This "free labor" is not really free as these youth in military could instead be in e.g.
university, graduate a year erlier, and work one more year before retiring.
A solid $50-100k GDP missing per soldier.
This is a huge expense that is not shown in official figures.
>	Neoliberalism (also neo-liberalism) is a term used to signify the late 20th century political reappearance of 19th-century ideas associated with free-market capitalism after it fell into decline following the second world war.
A prominent factor in the rise of conservative and libertarian organizations, political parties, and think tanks, and predominantly advocated by them, it is generally associated with policies of economic liberalization, including privatization, deregulation, globalization, free trade, monetarism, austerity, and reductions in government spending in order to increase the role of the private sector in the economy and society.
