The opinion focuses on the plaintiffs being injured because they were not given an opportunity to comment on the eligibility requirements of the law, which would be required for any legislative action taken by congress.
I just briefly read the opinion, but the judge goes to great lenhs to get to this deprivation of a procedural right argument and appears to blur the appropriate standards of review applicable to the matter.
He chose to expedite the hearing of the merits of the action to the injunction hearing, but appears to jump between standards by at times saying he has to accept as true certain allegations made (which would be correct for an injunction hearing but not a final hearing on the merits).
Again, I just read it quickly, but it definitely seems susceptible to overturn on appeal.
Oblivious?...
You literally said the dems needed to fool people into voting blue.
And I gave reasons why they didn't need to be fooled.
