Eh, debatable.
I mean, in the case of Finland and Sweden, correct.
Finland does have some archaic blasphemy law that is still, for some reason, in the books.
And Sweden has some weird laws about defamation of the king, despite said king having next to no real power, and is more symbolic than anything.
Neither are enforced much, but they exist.
I don't really agree with the whole "offensive Muhammad cartoon" things, btw (I think that it's kind of dumb and seeks to be offensive for little rational reason, as well as often being just a symptom of deep-rooted Islamophobia, which is common in countries like Sweden) - but if I had to have one or the other, I'd have the cartoon about Muhammad, because that's just religious blasphemy and involves a singular person, as opposed to actual atrocities that have hurt millions and left deep wounds on millions more, well after the events themselves.
What you want me to say to them?
Just some general insults?
Maybe some classics, like calling them a pig?
