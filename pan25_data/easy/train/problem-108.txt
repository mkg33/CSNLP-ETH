Don't be obtuse oil and gas are & have always been directly tied to global climate change and hydraulic fracturing purposely induces small earthquakes as part of its function but shale extraction has been directly tied to earthquakes in surrounding areas.
Poor souls.
The world is getting rocked by extreme weather these days.
Islands are disappearing, the west coast burns every year, places that aren’t used to snow are getting buried, hurricanes and tornados rip through with more regularity than ever before.
Oh and don’t forget Covid which could also be climate related as extreme weather changes the mating patterns and behaviours of animals.
The world needs to wake up, the fossil fuels are literally killing the Earth and the Earth is fighting back.
You're conflating two entirely different proposals.
Does fracking cause earthquakes?
Yes, we have enough data to say that.
Does the burning of fossil fuels from fracking contribute to global climate changes?
Yes, we have enough data to support that.
Does global climate change contribute, in itself, to an increase in earthquakes?
No, we do not have enough data to say definitely.
