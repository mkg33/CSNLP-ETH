“This is why I use words like ‘woke’: every time you write an article, editors ask me to use more ‘wokes’ in the article.
You can say ‘progressive’, but they’ll change it to woke, because they know the more ‘wokes’ [are in] an article, the more people love them.
It’s a buzzword that gets clicks.”.
But they aren’t saying there are actively, knowingly, and willingly not empathetic or aware of things (even tho they kinda are imo lol) but it’s important to consider their POV too they aren’t like actively against paying attention to societal issues they just only like to pay attention to one’s they agree with that affect them and any that they don’t understand they hate (because they are told too and mayyybbbbeee cause they are a lil light on the ole emotion intelligence scale lol).
Ding ding ding.
