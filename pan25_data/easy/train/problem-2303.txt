He campaigned on a promise to forgive some student debt.
He delivered.
Congress is useless on this issue, so he did it by exec action.

It's more than just tradition.

They cannot get anything done.
This has put more pressure on Presidents to use executives orders and even worse it has put more pressure on unelected bureaucrats to pick up the slack.
