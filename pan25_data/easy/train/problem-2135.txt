FYI, JWs operate no organized charity at all, not even for their own.
No little food pantry for the hungry, no free clothes closet so the poor can meet their dress codes for attendance.
Just the occasional well-off family giving my mother a big black trash bag of their kids' outgrown clothes in the parking lot.
Religion?
It's in constant flux, yet always gaslights you saying it's the same forever and ever.
I probably just don't have enough "faith" to "feel" like I "know" the answers of the universe.
But what I see and experience is a bunch of narcissistic grifters who think they're better than me.
Literally.
My mother got pistol whipped because that bible verse popped into her head during a very bad moment.
At first she was just focused on survival, living to see another day and finish raising her child, but started screaming and clawing because she didn't want the people at church to think badly of her morality.
A fact I only know because she told me so.
She only fought so no one could bible-argue she consented.
