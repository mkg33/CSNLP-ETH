In response to the events at Abu Ghraib, the United States Department of Defense removed 17 soldiers and officers from duty.
Eleven soldiers were charged with dereliction of duty, maltreatment, aggravated assault and battery.
Between May 2004 and April 2006, these soldiers were court-martialed, convicted, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service.
Two soldiers, found to have perpetrated many of the worst offenses at the prison, Specialist Charles Graner and PFC Lynndie England, were subject to more severe charges and received harsher sentences.
Graner was convicted of assault, battery, conspiracy, maltreatment of detainees, committing indecent acts and dereliction of duty; he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and loss of rank, pay and benefits.
[8] England was convicted of conspiracy, maltreating detainees and committing an indecent act and sentenced to three years in prison.
[9] Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted to the rank of colonel.
Several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted.
In 2004, President George W. Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld apologized for the Abu Ghraib abuses.
Exactly.
Countries which rely on human capital and market competition tend to be better at generating sustainable growth, and that's in part because such a system basically requires liberal democracy, which itself tends to promote stability.
It's a feedback loop.
