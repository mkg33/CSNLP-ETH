Look at Iran today.
Rioting in the streets, currency tanking, officials transferring wealth out of the country and standing on the verge of regime change,...
The punishment may be closer than we think.
At least we can hope this is the case.
Also planning, funding and committing terror against Yemeni, Syrian, Lebanese, Israeli, Palestinian, Iraqi and their own Iranian minorities, females and lgbtq, political prisoners and intellectuals.
All under the guise of religion.
Killing, torturing and raping in the name of god.
Exactly.
It’s been in the works for sometime.
The U.S. is going to attack Iran, and I never say such hyperbolic shit, but they’ve been piecing the reasons together for years.
Probably surrender.
You can’t make a common enemy not arm your enemy.
It’s like Russia telling USA not to arm Ukraine.
Doesn’t work like that.
Either surrender or keep on fighting without whining.
Yea , If you can’t fight, surrender.
You can’t whine your way into winning a war.
Specially if you are fighting with a nation that’s equipped with most nuclear weapon.
