They only know what they hear from their "news" sources and their news sources do not tell them that Trump's policies harm them.
The "do your research" crowd has never actually researched a single thing.
Mostly because they don't know how.
Imagine the Democrats fought a fair fight and didn't hamstring the candidate who inspired the disenfranchised, who was winning over the everyday folks that Hillary couldn't connect with, and would have won Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin.
Oh he did things.
He just didn't do anything good, at all, in anyway, for anyone, but himself and his cronies at least.
No American anywhere at all is better off because of literally a single thing he ever did in his whole life.
Politics are not at all the reason im saying this.
I'm saying this because its the complete objective truth of the matter.
This is not up for debate.
Honestly,..
I voted Hillary but I’m not convinced the left could accomplish what trump could for Covid.
They would have tried, and been denied by the right 1000%.
No way they’d approve a push for the Covid money through.
No rush for a cure.
No work from home.
Let the people die… The right would be 100% into impeachments and fake virus, constant worse protests than jan6.
