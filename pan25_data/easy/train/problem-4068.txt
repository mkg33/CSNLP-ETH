R's held all state-wide offices, including corrupt AG Paxton, pro-elder-sacrificer Lt gov Patrick, and over-reaching governor Abbott.
Border security spending by the state is up 3600% over the last 8 years or so, $4B to date under Abbott, and we now export immigrants to other parts of the US.
The state grew, and got +2 new house seats.
Heavy gerrymandering occured on its 10yr cycle in advance of this election- recall the national news of Democratic state legislators breaking quorum and fleeing the state to stop it only to face the legislative branch being defunded by the governor's unchecked disaster/emergency powers and his veto of their budget, which ultimately drew enough of them back.
The net new seats were split, 1D/1R.
So our US reps went from 24R/12D to 25/13.
While technically a draw, I'd call that a very small gain for blue.
I might even borrow a line credited to our governor after an elementary school shooting he did nothing about that claimed 21 lives- "It could have been worse.
".
Iowa.
We've shown we are no longer a swing state and are solidly red.
It's going to take a massive scandal AND a top tier candidate to have a shot in a close race.
