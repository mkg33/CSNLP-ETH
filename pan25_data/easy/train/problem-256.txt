Korean War is a terrible example to give.
In what world did they “almost push us off the peninsula”?????
It was an invasion by North Korea backed by China and Russia to take the whole peninsula and they failed miserably.
Was it a rough war?
Sure.
Did they accomplish anywhere NEAR what they wanted too?
Not even close.
Not to mention the fact that if the United States military wanted too, they could have just turned North Korea into a wasteland.
The only reason it wasnt is because there were forward thinking people in the White House who didn’t buy into MacArthurs bullshit.
They invaded with the idea of taking the whole peninsula and failed miserably.
Also, you forget the fact that NK was backed by the USSR as well who WERE on our level.
They had everything they needed to try and win that war and still failed.
It’s not a win for either side because neither side accomplished their goals.
That literally describes Israeli German relations.
Also, Japanese Chinese relations were better in the 70s-80s and wartime grievences were pushed aside because it suited China at the time to do so.
Nurturing anti Japanese sentiment is a decision the Chinese government made but it can and has chosen otherwise, inscrutable Asian 'honor' be damned.
