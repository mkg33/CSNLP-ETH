No, I am saying that the Iron Dome may not be a cost effective system for the Ukraine scenario.
To wit: does Russia have more than 20 precise missiles ?
Why, yes.
Does the Iron Dome have more than 20 interceptors available at a time?
Why, no.
If the Iron Dome has a 100% intercept rate, which it doesn't, will the 21st Russian missile be able to hit the battery and negate whatever good it can do?
Why, it can.
Therefore perhaps it is more efficient to look for a solution that either negates the launching of the missiles, like heavy counter-battery fire at the launch of the first missile, or look for a different solution.
Exactly.
Any nation threatened by russia has an opportunity to severely hinder or even destroy their ability to wage war, for a fraction of what it would normally cost.
This is a bargain for any country in europe and it’s foolish to think it’s not worth the cost.
Israel also has very well-performing counter-battery radars.
Perhaps that would be a better solution?
Interceptors are valuable.
Ukrainian lives are more valuable.
And all those Russia rockets will sooner or later be fired into one or into the other.
