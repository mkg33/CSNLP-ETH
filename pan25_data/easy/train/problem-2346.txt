There's a lot of possible mechanisms that will be widely accepted.
Even the main argument, of allowing the government to overturn SC ruling, would have likely been accepted if it required some kind of special majority (including opposition support), indicating that there is indeed a wide consensus against the SC ruling.
I personally wouldn't be against a 2/3 majority for this (but honestly, with how divided Israelis politics are, such a majority will pretty much never be achieved).
LOL wtf?
That's the same system Australia has, with the only kind of judicial review being whether any piece of legislation is unconstitutional.
If any legislation is allowed by the constitution, it can be passed, and the courts have to abide by it.
Courts can't just cast aside a law because they feel like it, they have to have grounds to do so.
Plus, Australia is a much more homogeneous society that Israel, which is n extremely fractured society in terms of religions (not justcreligious/orthodox/secular but also Jewish/Muslim/Christian), ethnicity, nationality, politics views, and class.
