No, because it's fucking Russia and underneath all the politics is this really disturbing culture of taking advantage of people, cheating, and controlling others.
That's what the average Russian does when they obtain some level of power.
It's kind of like the Republicans in America, but the entire country seems to be that way.
It's how the Democrats are actually a right-wing party, but the average American isn't aware enough of other cultures to realize it.
Why do you think Republicans are so silent, or actively against, the war in Ukraine?
It's because they respect the bullshit grift and want to join in!
Significantly in the minority unfortunately.
Most Russians are apathetic at best.
Hopefully more can find their courage and some light through all the brainwashing and authoritarianism.
Ignorant?
What?
“White goods” isn’t a racial term its classified as things like washing machines toasters microwaves air conditioners things with light iron if thats what you’re referring too.
But none the less we rely on china as a manufacturing country.
The opposition is significantly in the minority.
The vast majority either support the war or are apathetic.
