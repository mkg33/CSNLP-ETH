There just aren't that many nine figure+ contracts to win in individual areas of the defense industry and no government is going to have forgotten the situation Germany found themselves in - wanting to provide defensive armaments, a good proportion of their own citizens demanding it, Western opinion absolutely howling for it, but being hamstrung by the Swiss export contract.
The German money simply isn't coming back (Rheinmetall have started their own production line to replace it), and it'll be very interesting to see how many countries go back to buying from the Swiss.
exactly!
Most of these other places don't seem to even do investigative journalism, esp not on a story they got from someone else.
So anything they add is really not reporting, just fluff or loaded words.
Not necessarily.
I have personally slipped on a swiss cowpat while hiking there, to the detriment of my shoes and jeans.
Was an interesting ride home on public transport at the end of the day - lot of side-eye and sniffing.
