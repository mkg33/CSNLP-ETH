The way I see other politicians, whether it be Adam Schiff or whatnot, is that these records are to be carefully viewed and protected, and while it's not cool being next to Biden's Corvette, or Pence's playhouse.... there is a damn difference between that and what and how Trump handled this... Hell, remember he was trying to make a "deal" for them?
wtf?
Garland should probably just appoint special counsels to investigate all presidents and vice presidents who are still alive and then NARA can develop a significantly better retrieval system instead of letting politicians and their teams decide what to take from their offices, everyone else can see how the politicians respond and vote accordingly.
Yeah, no shit folks.
We know that Donald stole a bunch of THE most classified/top secret documents, and the dumbass still probably would've gotten away with it completely if he had just given them back, even after the National Archives were hounding him for months.
Exactly.
Pence and Biden had documents, self-reported, and turned them back over immediately.
There's a record problem there for sure, but those two did what they should.
