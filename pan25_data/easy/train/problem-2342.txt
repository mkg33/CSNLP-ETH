Well, you are not exactly mistaken, but as a hungarian I have to say this: a lot of us don't want this, especially the younger generations.
Our economy, and basically everything is already pretty shit here already with the exception of a very few cities and people.
Most people are just happy that they can get by, and that is just enough for them.
So when a guy like Orb√°n comes along, and says stuff like they protect the people from migrates, bad bad eu policy makers (Brussels), high petrol and food prices ect.
a lot of people believes in him.
Like almost religiously, because as far as I see it, as long as the situation is better or at least isn't worse in the eyes of the elderly (who are in majority) than the Soviet era was, than it is fine.
Many people project their fears not on to the (current) party, but on anything else, nationalism is also very popular since the Soviet era, which doesn't help at all.
A lot of people see some sort of destined leader in him, fighting for our hard earned freedom and independency.
Exactly.
It's a fundamental political strategy of nationalist parties.
You can't tailor your own strategy around trying to avoid it.
It's not dissimilar to how feckless the Democratic party is in response to GOP political strategy.
They expend so much energy trying to avoid being called socialists, to the point of acceding to unpopular GOP demands, only to be called socialists anyway.
