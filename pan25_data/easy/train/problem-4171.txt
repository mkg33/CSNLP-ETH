There are countless well-to-do Hell Lords and Ladies who couldn’t win, trick, ensorcel, or otherwise gain eternal control a human soul of their own.
Eternal Famnation takes a bespoke approach to earned suffering, and uses dangerous blood magicks and a little forbidden chronomancy to truly get to know all of the dirty deeds of our newly Damned!
At Eternal Famnation, we see disgusting skinwalkers like Marjorie Taylor Greene as more than just anonymous grist for Hell’s eternal grindstone.
We see the dignity these awful sin bags deserve while suffering for ever and ever in damnation, and help them find a “forever Hell” of their own.
Basically.
It encapsulates the fact that "right" is not a real thing, so much as just store-brand selfishness with extra steps.

C'mon Republicans!
Join with us in censuring MTG, and removing her from Congress.
Your governor of SC will no doubt appoint another stalwart Republican to replace her, but at least the new one will probably be sane.
