The data shows a similar pattern in Canada too.
Foreign buyers and empty homes were hot-button issues in the province of B.C., Canada.
But recent studies show that while it may be a contributing factor, it's not as widespread as initially thought.
Data analysis from Statistics Canada and the B.C.
provincial government shows total foreign ownership of the Greater Vancouver Region at about 6%.
However, a newer study by a professor at the University of British Columbia pegs foreign ownership at about 2%.

Empty homes have decreased by 36% since the vacant home tax was enacted in 2017.
There are currently only 1,398 vacant homes in Vancouver, according to the data.

Or the CCP just goes through the Canadian Courts and say the property was purchased with stolen funds.
