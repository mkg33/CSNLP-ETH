I disagree here.
What does india gain by stopping Russian gas and paying higher gas prices?
Nothing.
India has got to feed its 1 billion plus population.
Why doesn’t the west give a gas discount to india if india is so important to them?
If the west gives india a gas discount, then I don’t see why india would continue to buy Russian oil.
I’m pretty sure US and west have given india their tacit approval to continue buying Russian gas.
They really need india in future war again China.
I mean west is also acting it’s own interest to recruit India against China.
They are not doing it out of the goodness of their own heart.
It’s not like the west is giving free aid to India.
India is paying for that aid in $$$.
It’s a win win scenario for west.
They get money and an ally.
Not some grand gesture by the west.
I know some people try to justify this illegal invasion with mentioning USA’s illegal invasions that’s stupid,manipulative and it’s called whataboutism, but let’s settle this for once It’s not whataboutism if people mention USA’s or its allies invasions/interventions to call out double standards of people,media,celebrities and etc… or in this case just to explain how things work.
