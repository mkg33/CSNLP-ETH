Prediction: Joe (who already knows his age and therefore will and capability to confidently do the job are waning, and his bucket list presidential slot has been checked off) ...will endorse someone squeaky clean (far easier to do in the Dem party), younger and vibrant who aligns with him - things the Dems have been thirsting for - and the GOP's heads will explode when, a) he won't be running anyway after their 2-year smear campaign on his private-citizen son doesn't work, and, b) he does something else the people actually want after a long term of doing just that while the GOP opposed it all... while they're standing there, holding their dicks trying to pick a fight and making themselves, once again, look incredibly stupid just for the sake of power.
Why won't it work?
Because it is a GLOBAL oil market and if we produce more oil, it will just be sold to Japan, South America, etc.
In the past the USA banned crude oil sales but the GOP had that ban eliminated in 2015.
The USA cannot produce enough additional oil to push the GLOBAL price of oil down.
Exactly.
A republican promising compromise and positions that stray from the insanity of the gop platform don't have the power to follow through.
They're basically the kid running for student council saying they'll get pizza for lunch every day.
