They are treating claims as evidence.
They see Lake claiming that there was fraud and treat that as evidence of it.
They see people like Fucker Barlson make similar claims, maybe saying how one poll worker noticed how one ballot in a fraswingable district looked like it had two pen impressions on the signature but only one signature so it has to be fraudulent - only for his audience to continue repeating the claim/"evidence" without critically thinking that "oh, maybe the pen didn't work the first time and the voter needed to use a new one or doodle on a different page to get the pen to work.

And like a child who indiscriminately rejects anything that might challenge what they believe in or what argument they're trying to make, these conservatives blindly disregard and dismiss all information that threatens their worldview, their argument or narrative, while on the other hand, they gravitate towards and mindlessly embrace whatever information confirms their biases, their pre-conceived views and their prejudices.
