For me as well.
First time I had Covid, the recovery was rough.
For months afterward, I would climb the stairs in our house and be so out of breath with my lungs on fire that I’d be doubled over.
Finally talked to my primary care about it.
Started on a steroid inhaler and Singulair and things quickly improved.
Now recovering from the second time around….
Seriously.
I (29M) developed (luckily relatively benign, but still requiring medication) heart rhythm issues after COVID.
Now I’m scared shitless to get sick again.
I developed depersonalisation, derealisation, short term memory loss, information processing issues, overall general cognitive decline along with post covid thyroiditis, severe heart problems and IBS.
Yep.
It would be best to follow safe practices (masks, handwashing, isolating), getting COVID multiple times would be like playing Russian Roulette with your lungs, brain and your senses of taste and smell.
You may be fine this time, but there's always a chance of getting absolutely fucked each time you get it.
