My Muslim friends in the US, are Republican, I am non-aligned.
However peer pressure being what it is, what is the most rational party for adherents of Islam, to participate in.
(Which party best expresses Islamic values?
).
Islamophobia is rampant among the Republican base.
Your friends are voting against their self-interest.
Those people don't respect or want to allow for anything in the United States that isn't Christian.
I mean these are the same folks who tried to bury Obama's legacy by claiming he was a practicing Muslim as if that should be a huge stain on his character.
Democrats instead honor the 1st Amendment that works off of the idea Church and State should remain separate which means that every religion gets to be here and practice here publicly and privately but that none of them can supercede another by law.
Republicans believe that should be the case for Christianity specifically though which would mean States putting laws into effect that force your children to be exposed to their religion at your public school.
