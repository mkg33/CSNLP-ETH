The only reason i would agree is because Russia and Belarus are HUGE doping countries.
There have been countless times where Russian athletes have been coerced into taking drugs for the sake of winning.
Both of these countries are absolute liabilities for doping and I’m personally sick of it.
I hate having to punish athletes who oftentimes don’t have a say in how their governments work—i.e.
the war— but doping should be the biggest reason why these two should be banned for at least this year.
None of that “ROC (Russian Olympic Committee) either.
Complete ban from all sports.
If war and war crimes are criteria for not being allowed in the Olympics, then a lot of countries should not be allowed to attend, including Iran, China, Myanmar, the USA, quite a few African countries, and a few Western countries that still support Saudi Arabia's illegal war against Yemenis.
That's why the Olympics won't ban Russia because white people's lives are not more important than anyone else's.
We must support Ukraine; my country does just that, and I'm happy about it, but the idea that we should ban athletes because of their nationality is pretty funny and hypocritical.
