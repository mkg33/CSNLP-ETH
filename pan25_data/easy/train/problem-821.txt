Nurse here.
Something a lot of people also don’t think about: how many healthcare workers we’ve lost (due to death or just leaving the profession or at least the bedside), how many we’re actively losing, and how many we will lose.
I have no intention to leave nursing, BUT I will leave bedside nursing if it becomes any more risky for me and my family.
If COVID or another pathogen comes back and poses even more of a risk to my or my family’s health, or if anything happens at my work (eg pt brings a gun or assaults a worker etc) I’ve decided I’ll leave the ER for remote work permanently.
I love what I do but I’m also right on the edge of saying it’s not worth it to do bedside for me anymore.
And there are lots of bedside healthcare workers who are paid less than and have worse work environments than I do who are probably even more on-edge.
Exactly.
Pre vaccine I had a 40 year old healthy guy hospitalized for months, with complication after complication from Covid who passed away.
It was really terrible.
