Historically, the Crimean Tatars were a major problem to Russian ambitions in the region.
They were semi-nomadic raiders that occupied a fertile and resource rich area and prevented Russian colonisation, and they were also major roadblocks that prevented access to the lucrative and strategically important Black Sea ports.
They were also mainly Muslims with ties to the Ottoman Empire, and he feared they could be potentially disloyal and strike at Russian heartlands in case of a war - the Ottomans and Persian Empire were major Russian rivals in the 19th century during Stalin's formative years, and the three fought over control of Stalin's own native Georgia.
He targeted the Crimean Tatars with two genocides - the Holodomor and the forced deportations to Siberia.
It’s always factionalism.
What people don’t understand is that there is no such thing as a dictatorship, because even the most powerful rulers in the world always answer to somebody.
In Russia’s case, it’s the oligarchs and the military, which Putin needs to balance out.
If the military gets out of hand, they will overthrow him and install one of their stooges to retain power.
If the oligarchs aren’t kept in check, they will put one of theirs in Putin’s seat and just go on with their corrupt as fuck business.
