It’s incredibly dumb.
The whole thing is a joke.
People reacting like it’s some crazy new thing that major world players have the ability to take photos from above.
Like for fucks sake, what do you think all of these satellites have been doing since before the space race?
The reason the military didn’t do anything about the balloon is because its utterly irrelevant.
The reason they did something about the balloon is because the media made it into a big thing (which like I get, it’s weird and odd but the reason for the balloon and political posturing is a joke).
Actually no.
The US also has drones that spoof the radar signatures of different aircraft and even multiple aircraft in formation.
So while there's a golf ball on your screen there's also a flight of F15s escorting a heavy bomber wing that grabs your attention.
So you turn on active radar defense weapons to get the lock and suddenly you get an F35 launching anti radar missiles at your AA systems from out of no where (I'm not aware if the F22 normally having ground attack options).
If you can manage to launch any interceptor craft then the F22 will appear out of no where to take them out.
