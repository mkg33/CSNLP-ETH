Whenever my partner's asked to sign something he does a random scribble.
He's never been called out on it.
It hasn't ever come up.
They're just like yep, I saw you sign it so it's good.
They don't compare one of his signatures to another one.
Nope, hospitality.
My handwriting has gotten worse over the years.
When I was still in highschool, it was legible, but at some point over the years realized if I want people to be able to read what I write, I have to print it.
Same with signing.
Both my parents are/were deaf, and my ability to sign to where someone could understand me has deteriorated over the years.

I don't live in her district.
The one consolation is that even if she doesn't get the message - she's too dumb and surrounded by yesmen to get it - Republicans did get it: being the MAGAest member of Congress doesn't guarantee you a seat.
It's not a coincidence that the narrative has changed from 'poor Trump has been persecuted by the evil Democrats' to 'actually Trump is a piece of shit and you guys should throw him in prison before the next election cycle, pretty please?
