We'll still have the Republicans saying that the Democrats will ruin this country by helping immigrants, stealing elections, and supporting people's rights to be who they are despite what the Republicans claim the Christian Bible says.

This implies that we don’t have to try as hard as we did this election because “things are getting better.” That’s a dangerous sentiment.

Look at 2010 and 2016.
Democrats got comfortable and were obliterated.
Let’s not have that happen again.

We need to be even more determined to stop them.
