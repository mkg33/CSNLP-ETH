Clearly we need to define enforcements for disobeying lawful orders from courts and that those enforcements are not subject to weak willed individuals who hem and haw about how it might offend someone.
The oofrnse has been committed against every citizen of the state in question and this must require action to ensure the will of the people is represented.
If we do not have fair censuses or fair elections we cease to be a nation of laws.
We cede our collective authority to the mob of charlatans and thieves who will continue to erode the power of the majority until none can stand peacefully against their injustices and forcing us to violence to resolve these issues.
Something else.
This story is about the Ohio district maps; the Ohio SC rejected the maps for excessive gerrymandering and ordered the Republicans to redraw the map to be more fair, and the Republicans responded by... ignoring the court order and using the rejected maps anyway.
Ps.
we're also supposed to believe only a few people knew about the nuclear plant bribery scandal in Ohio too.
