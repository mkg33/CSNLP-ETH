Seriously.
You flat out do not understand these people if you think having an AR platform or similar is abnormal to them.
Socialism.
We want socialism instead of culture war nonsense.
We want actual, hard changes to economic reform that benefit the vast majority of people at the cost of taxing a handful of wealth hoarding parasites.
The parties are united against us.
The methodology is absolutely insane, they wanted to compare the quality of live in socialist and capitalist countries but ended up excluding the richest capitalist countries because they couldn't actually find high-income socialist nations to compare.
So they're literally controlling for economic development in a study comparing economic development.
I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please if you have any questions or concerns.
But even excluding the poorest socialist nations and the richest capitalist nations didn't work so they finally said fuck it and decided that a bunch of Marxist single-party states (Iraq, Syria, Tanzania, etc) were actually capitalist.
Brilliant.
