I’m an anesthetist.
Although we do have other drugs we can use in lieu of fentanyl the vaccine could pose some issues, especially if we were unaware of the vaccine status.
Oddly enough we use fentanyl and it’s analogues due to their attractive safety profile, ease of use and dosing, and that it is somewhat more short acting than other options such as hydromorphone.
But in short yes we could safely administer an anesthetic and not have any appreciable difference in pain post operatively.
Many of the other opioid options do tend to be more sedating and euphoric, which makes me concerned for abuse potential.
Seriously.
I know Subs don't work for every addict, but the medication legitimately gave me back my life.
I want to constantly sing its praises.
I never get cravings thanks to the drug, and I can't use opioids even if I wanted to.
Interesting!
I was asking because that was my situation with burns.
Had spent too long under cold water to manage pain until aid arrived and had become hypothermic.
