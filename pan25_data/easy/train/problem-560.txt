I hear very similar things from older Poles too.
Communism was safe in the sense that everyone had the right/guaranteed a job, there was a lot of safety where people could leave their doors unlocked and no one robbed(as everyone had the same crap, maybe) housing was guaranteed.
Ukrainians are hated and classified as Nazi collaborators and thieves.
Edit: Oh yes.
The trauma is REAL.
But in my families case, it's from both of my parents being born right at the end of WWII.
My mom has real deep psychological issues due to that.
But she still hates Nazis.

I dont have older data but Hungary was sliding down on democracy since at least 2010, in 2010 they were close to Poland level under previous government, by 2015(which is year current Polish government come to power) Hungary was already below Poland level in 2020, thats how fast they were sliding without Polish government protection and while under EPP protection, EPP only stoped protecting them in recent years when it was no longer possible to cover all their BS.
