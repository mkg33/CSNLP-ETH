See, the thing about armies is that they are trained to factor the harm that comes to them in their decisions to go to war.
In fact, the reason armies hesitate to launch into war -the reason most armies in the world today take a defensive posture- is because they are thinking of the harm that an engagement might do to their civilian populations, not to themselves.
I will never say never.
But do you understand the magnitude of what would have to take place in the nation for a minority to impose themselves on a people that have no concept of subservience?
Of a population of roughly 335 million people, the pew research center estimates "evangelicals" as 25 percent of the population.
Of that, how many are far right Christian extremists bent on domination of the country?
I haven't been able to find a number.
The logistics of 83 million people, if you were to count every evangelical as a Christian extremist, suppressing the other 250 million people is mind-boggling.
The police/military force required to keep all those people in line is ludicrous.
There is no way the military will buy into it.
As a Methodist, I am considered evangelical by pew research center and I don't want to live in a Chritian theocracy.
That's why I exercise my second amendment rights.
