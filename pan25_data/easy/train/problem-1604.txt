This is a cult on a massive scale.
The cultural war rhetoric on the right keeps people's brains drenched in cortisol.
As a group, they are living in their lizard brains, very near flight or fight, with a constant source of horror in ready supply.
There are also easily identifiable "others".
Cults isolate their members as part of their indoctrination process.
They present a leader or limited trusted sources as the only reliable or true source of information and the only real source of social and emotional support.
We now know this is easily accomplished online with resonating, siloed sources of disinformation.
That makes cult members even more likely to cling to their group despite any internal reservations because... abandonment threatens personal survival.
Of course as the violent rhetoric ramps up, leaving the group may also means becoming a potential target of the group.
