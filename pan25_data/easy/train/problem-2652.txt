Granted it could be seen as a net negative for more liberal news because Conservative views are often emotionally driven and not supported by facts like Democrat positions are, but moderate and liberal news sources already go out of their way to cover what both parties say about an issue anyways and make it a point to reach out to the opposing party for their opinion (even if they rarely actually respond).
It's why you often see "We reached out to X to hear their side of the story.
As of reporting they have not responded to our request.
".
Sabotaging power substations is just "vandalism" according to the "liberal" media.
Fact is, the vast majority of our media is right-wing.
And seeing how they're corporations, there's little to no chance for an actual liberal take on the news to call a spade a spade.
There's no other explanation for downplaying such incidents to such an extreme.
It should be no surprise that the media mirrors our current political parties: center-right (CNN, NBC, CBS, etc vs far-right (Fox News, et al).
