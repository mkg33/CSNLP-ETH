On the population issue, growth forever would have consequences, but most countries which are at or below replacement rate used to have much higher population growth.
In general, a country sees a population level fall around or below replacement when you have a decent standard of living, public education, decent women's rights, and access to basic family planning.
These are all normal parts of economic development, and very good on their own merits.
So this is one reason why global inequality is cited as a core issue in terms of sustainability.
The human ability to raise the carrying capacity also has issues, such as the Green Revolution promoting monoculture which negatively impacted our food systems, which are issues we will need to keep in mind, but humanity doesn't have a static carrying capacity.
The solutions would be getting serious about tackling global inequality, signing a global waste reduction and resource conservation treaty, and start examining larger aspects of our economy such as a need for constant resource-fueled growth.
Its sad.
I work at an airport and they have to throw away so many bags full of plastics that do not get recycled every single day.
