I bet that if Russians weren’t thrown out of Kharkiv oblast before their “referenda” they would have said that we wanted to join them as well, probably with some stupid percentage like 95-99%, because in their sick minds they think that everyone here wants to be Russian, even though here we hate them with passion, honestly probably more than anyone else in Ukraine.
Because a lot of people here, including us, have/had families from Russia, and all of them turned into brainwashed zombies as soon as the war started, immediately started calling everyone here Nazi and saying that they are coming to liberate us.
Never again will we trust Russians, and hopefully we will get a big wall with a moat along the entire border as soon as the war ends.
Amazing achievement.
The UAF strategy couldn't have worked better.
Avoiding having to storm the defensive lines of the orks, the Ukrainians meticulously destroyed enemy supplies and supply lines, thereby forcing the Russians to abandon their positions as they became untenable.
