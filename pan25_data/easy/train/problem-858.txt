Ok WHAT?
I was amazed he wasn't immediately (or ever) arrested for taking classified docs home after he lost the election and then lied about it and then was raided by the FBI, but like, he was pleading ignorance like he was allowed to have them or some dumb bullshit so i GUESS there has to be some legal running around before he is charged?
But this?
He already knows now that he shouldn't have classified docs and he's already been raided etc and there's more hidden away that they found?
He should be in cuffs NOW.
What the fuck?
Anyone else would be arrested.
Exactly.
The lower class are the only ones that are punished.
The wealthy face minimal fines that are the equivalent of $0.50 to them.
And the ultra wealthy are never even charged.
You can group politicians in the ultra wealthy category as well.
