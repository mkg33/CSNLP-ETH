Yeah, added paranoia and fear-mongering could have definitely exacerbated it.
I mean, you have isolation, strict christian lifestyle, fear mongering/paranoia, likely believing mental health issues are caused by Satan or something.
Granted I have no direct evidence of this, but based on knowing people like this I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't even believe in treating mental health conditions, and blamed it on spiritual nonsense like demons/satanic influences.
It just sucks.
I have a friend who turned alt right conspiracy theorist, homeschools her kids, and only takes them to church for socializing, and I feel so bad for them all and mad at her for being so stubbornly regressive.
I donâ€™t want them to end up like this.

Making this situation into something politics related is ridiculous.
There was some significant mental illness going on with this kid and the family and itâ€™s really not politics related at all.
