This is what these asshats don't understand.
Rich countries can afford a fuel price increase of a few dollars.
The same few dollars when converted to INR is devastating for the average Indian.
And even if the poor Indians do not own a bike or a car, they do depend on food and basic necessities which are transported via trucks, who do need fuel.
So ultimately even they will feel the pinch when fuel prices increase.
Solid example.
Currently most Indian military equipment is based on the old soviet weapons systems, so they need ties to Russia to remain strong.
Therefore, even though India needs/wants western nations to continue backing them in their border dispute with China, they can't afford to risk angering Russia without potentially weakening their military hand.
While at the same time, they risk that western support because they're defacto funding the attempted genocide of Ukraine.
Those conflicts mean that large institutional investors see India as a risky investment and the interest rates for that finance goes higher vs a more aligned country.
