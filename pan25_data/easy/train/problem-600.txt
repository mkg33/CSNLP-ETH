That just breaks my heart.
This is why parents not only need to be parenting their kids from a no violence/importance f empathy standpoint, but also why we have to stop pussyfooting around the concept of death with kids.
No more lying about the dog going to a farm to live.
No more "grandma went to a better place" with no context on the physical "dead" part.
Kids can handle learning about death and what it is, and we do them a grave disservice by sheltering them from such an important and unavoidable concept in the world.
Every fantasy story and video game shows death as a temporary affliction, and if we let that stand as their only experience of it, why are we so surprised when they act like killing someone is no big deal and they'll just respawn at the hospital and be back next week?
I have a 5 year old.
I can't fathom this Not being an accident.
This poor 6 year old is obviously being raise in bad environment.
The parents should be held liable.
They need to face a court.
I would suspect they would find child abuse.
