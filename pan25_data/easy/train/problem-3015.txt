Unfortunately, all the Christians I personally know have completely radicalized.
If you don't agree with them, they target you and make it their mission to harass you over it.
It's a massive cult.
Anyone that's been to a service in the past 5-10 years and is neutral in a religious sense, will tell her how much hate consumes the preachings.
All hate and fear mongering against anyone or anything different than themselves.
They are psychologically preparing their members to commit mass violence in the name of God and Jesus.
Meanwhile just disagreeing with a Christians "scientific opinion" can get you fined $35k in Florida if they are offended by you talking about a scientific fact (this is in response to the vaccine debate).
It benefits the politicians, unfortunately.
Attacking "the other" is an easy way to unify people behind your cause regardless of actual justifiability, ergo creating "others" to vilify is bog standard for fascists.
I know they won’t.
They don’t care till it affects them personally.
Even then, like Ms. Graham and his Lady Bugs, he is against the LGBTQ.
