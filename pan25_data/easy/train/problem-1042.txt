Why do you say that?
The technical challenges of contained fusion as a commercially viable power source are still unsolved despite many decades of work.
I find it strange that many otherwise highly rational people in the scientific community seem to have formed a consensus that nuclear fusion must be an economically viable power source.
It's not obvious to me at all.
They are totally different mechanism.
Completely unrelated.
No knowledged gained from one will be useful in the other.
In 20 years we could have the whole planet covered with sustainable power from wind and sun creating around 100 million jobs in the sector - so whats the point as atomic fusion in the scale needed is very very dangerous toy to play with and will give the greenlight for every nation on the planet to have the right for energy source in this sector where regulation would be impossible to control.
Really?
My big worry is that goverments will start to see fusion as a climate change solution before contained fusion has actually been successfully demonstrated as a potential power source.
