Another time, on Quora, someone posted a question- "Who would be more helpful if you were stuck on a desert island- Trump or Obama?"
One person responded that Obama would be totally useless because he is just a spoiled, rich "community oraganizer" (the poster put those quotes in), but Trump would be great to have because he is a self-made man, who started out life as a construction worker and worked his way up the ladder to become a genius business man.
Again- where did that guy get his info?
How oblivious do you have to be to claim that Trump is self-made or that he ever picked up some tools and started putting up drywall somewhere?
Totally.
Its seriously mind-boggling.
Like, these are adults with jobs and responsibilities.
People that can cook food, have children etc.
Yet, they somehow fall for a strategy so simple and ridiculous that it wouldn't even work for a school yard bully on 10 year olds.
