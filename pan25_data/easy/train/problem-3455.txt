It's hard to say.
Yes Mao said women hold up half the sky.
But it wasn't until Corporate China did women really start to get work and rights.
Though, there are many who say had Mao not said that to begin with, this wouldn't have moved forward the way it did.
So really, who knows.
And China's foreign policy is very strategic, pragmatic and less about some grand ideological plan or moral crusade (as is often depicted on this incredibly stupid forum).
Edit.
I forgot to add, China is certainly not a dictatorship.
The politburo holds an inordinate amount of power.
Though recently Xi did get a few loyalists in there.
They are the board of directors, they approve or deny Xi's actions.
The recent opening after COVID is a good example of this.
Xi can run it how he wants, but if the politburo says no, no means no and it better be instant.
Authoritarian, well yes corporations are authoritarian.
So it is fucked up.
And it is trying it's best to br likr taliban, in order to distract people from the reality of a fuked up economy.
