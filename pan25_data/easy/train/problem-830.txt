It's an all too often repeated myth or misconception.
Even if it were it would be an extremely dubious legal theory to test and likely no corporation would actually want to try and test it ESPECIALLY in the context of something like this as it would almost certainly result in the theory being debunked legally and by precedent thereby revealing to everyone who has been conned into believing that it is true that it in fact isn't and would then raise a lot of questions that corporations do not want people asking about their ruthless pursuit of profit.
Thanks.
I am an old-fashioned hippie who used to be a journalist.
I always keep in my address the name, phone, fax, mail address and e-mail of all of my representatives at local, county, state and federal levels, as well as current media representatives.
One letter/e-mail can be sent to multiple people with the CC's displayed so they all know who is reading.
Hard copies sent via U.S. postal service, signed in blue ink, especially on one's own personal stationery work best.
Simultaneously I make phone and fax messages.
I care enough to keep trying.
