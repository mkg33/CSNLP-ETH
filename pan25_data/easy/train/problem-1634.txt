These people are so delusional.
If we let Texas secede the first thing we would do would pull out all military, national guard, and port authorities.
We would also provide amnesty to any American wanting to leave Texas which would be a good chunk of Dallas, Austin, Houston, El Paso, and San Antonio.
Texas doesn't produce enough food to feed it's people as is and now it's ports and shipping would be decimated especially if the US just decided it didn't want to trade with Texas.
Texas would have to negotiate it's own trade deals with other countries and the US and that wont go well for them as they have no international leverage.
The remaining people would be starving to death in 6 months and Mexico would probably take back some of it's land that was stolen.
They would have a massive influx of illegal drugs due to no one to patrol the waters of the gulf or their boarders.
Undoubtedly.
They'd be hard pressed to do so, however, once they lose United States military bases, personnel, and equipment.
Not to mention, red states can't even maintain their roads and other infrastructure in peaceful times, much less their electric grid.
In wartime, they would be considerably disadvantaged.
