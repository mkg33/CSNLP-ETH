If there'd been previous advanced tech civilization, say to late 20th-century level, they'd likely have used up a lot more of the easily-accessible oil and mined materials around the world.
The amount we've pumped out would've taken millions of years to form, far longer than human-like species have been around.
Yeah seriously.
If a fella wants to be a sensationalist, let him.
If he wants to say speculation is proof in itself without really evidence yet, let the dude do it.
If he wants to sell nonsense and folks buy into it and shift funding away from the people doing the real work, you gotta just let him grift you.
Come on jeez!
Though it's possible an ancient civilization made do with other materials entirely for energy and industry, it's pretty incredible to think they'd clean up or recycle all their garbage and filled in all their mines such that we haven't found any evidence of their advanced existence yet.
Or alternatively, that literally everything they needed to advance to our current level was concentrated in some part of the world that's currently inhospitable so we haven't looked there yet.
