Easy - they turn them in to "others" same way they always do.
They're not Israelis - they're traitors that want to destroy the Jewish people and drive us from our homeland.
There's nothing new about this playbook, and fascists necessarily don't have a strong relationship with reason or truth.
I'm all for supporting local elements opposing fascism, but we need to recognise the steps that are taken to prime people for genocide.
Look at the rhetoric of the Republican Party for examples of the spectrum of how this is done - targeting leftists, "sexual deviants", minorities, women, the poor, etc.
Full on.
This gives me hope for Israel.
The conservatives and right wingers there and in the US will get them all killed I fear.
The madness must ease.
The pressure must be allowed to escape.
When young Germans/Soviets/Americans/Rwandans/Cambodians/Pakistanis/East Timorese/Burundis/Myanmars/Muslims/Christians are ordered to shoot other whichevers in protest, how will the nationalists deny they haven't murdered their own.
The “vibe”.
I’m early 30s and Tel Aviv is mostly 25-35 year olds.
They have streets just filled with nightlife and everyone is having a great time.
I’m normally a homebody but for some reason when I’m here, I enjoy going out and have a lot of fun.
