I think their doctrine is irrelevant once their civilians start being targeted.
At that point there would literally be no consequences to them using a nuke.
Sure, NATO would probably start bombing their military but we wouldn't nuke them back.
And NATO attacking them would be the last piece Putin would need to convince his people they were in a righteous war for their very survival.
They would throw everything they had at Ukraine and whatever survivors they had would sing songs of their sacrifice against the west.
Also, Russia has other weapons besides nukes that they could use on Ukraine and western Europe.
Like chemical and biological weapons.
I hope so too.
Im still hoping for an end to this madness but i have no idea how that will be achieved at this point.
Unfortunately yes.
If Ukraine started doing this to Russia they would lose the moral high ground and probably western support.
Also Russia would not hesitate to use nukes.
Professional soldiers are important.
They understand how to not freeze to death in winter, how to operate AA guns, etc.
