The primary divide is religious Jews vs secular Jews.
Most religious Jews tend to be conservative and most of them supported Trump, even through Charlottesville.
In the Modern Orthodox world, that is largely centered on Israel, with general Republican views on taxation and business not far behind.
In farther right religious communities, like Chareidi or Chassidish communities, Israel plays a lesser role than religious and social issues; these voters often have a lot in common with the Christian religious right.
There's a small but not insignificant minority of liberal religious Jews, especially in Modern Orthodox communities, where new shuls, schools and organizations have sprung up to support this cohort.
Fuck them.
His racism, sexism, lying, cheating, stealing, possible espionage, definite sedition, and being a puppet of the evangelicals wasn’t a problem but when he shows his hatred to them it’s a problem?
Again, fuck anyone who is suddenly “outraged” by Trump.
To paraphrase the great Dennis Green, he is who we thought he was.
