They were arrested for inciting people to block a highway.
So their arrests are 100% justified.
Also they have been released immediately after interrogation.
No.
The POV is "Does a certain act break a law that was enacted trough a democratic and rule of law abbiding state"?
Ilegally, blocking a motorway is such an act.
The balance of rights is something that is determined by governments, parliaments and in certain cases by the courts.
It's not determined by a person, or group of people, that feels they've got a good reason to break the law.
If it was, people wouldn't be getting arrested.
Absolutely, it's individualistic.
The idea you are responsible for your own life.
This good because there is virtually no ceiling you can hit if your successful but bad because there is also no safety net if you fail.
"definitely illegal"?
Hardly.
It is perfectly legal here in Germany, for example.
where you, as a citizen, are perfectly within your rights to use reasonable force(!)
to remove any illegal impediment to your legal pursuits.
