Trees are not as renewable as once thought.
The forests that seem to actually soak up carbon are old growth, multi-age, mixed species and high fungally intergrated.
There is no "forestry management" that "replants" forests using these techniques.
Instead most forestry corporations replace carbon soaking forests with monoculture pine orchards.
In ancient forests in N. America, old growth Mamma trees can actually share water, nutrients and glucose at the root level with the younger trees around them.
When they finally die, the mushrooms and other fungi break down the nutrients and spread them throughout the soil; in some cases these fungi networks go on for several miles.
No farmed, plantation style forest will ever equal the environmental benefits of an old growth forest.
Seriously.
Partner and I tried to be responsible adults and send out holiday cards one year, and my brother flipped out because they didn't say "Merry Christmas."
It did not occur to him that a lot of our friends might celebrate something else.
Nope, we were just being brainwashed by the woke agenda.
