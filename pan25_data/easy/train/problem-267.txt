The claim that there were death threats that prevented the case from going forward was also never independently verified; it was a claim by the lawyers, who as I mentioned, were known for lying.
And again, I'm not saying it's impossible that they were telling the truth this time; the result is simply inconclusive.
If you want to know why nothing more has ever come from this particular accusation, that's the reason.
The problem is that the accusation was not very credible.
The victim wouldn't stand behind their testimony in court, and couldn't really be confirmed to exist at all by independent reporters, and the lawyers representing her had a history of filing dishonest lawsuits.
Now, is it possible that this was a real accusation by someone who backed away after receiving threats by a very powerful man?
Yes.
But it's also possible that it was a lie.
It's not really distinguishable from a lie right now.
