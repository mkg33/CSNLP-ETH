Both Trump and DeSantis have similar agendas.
The main difference between them is that DeSantis actually has the ability to implement his agenda successfully because he's smarter and has more political experience than Trump.
DeSantis is way more dangerous.
For real… you just keep your head down, never question him, agree with all his policies and don’t make yourself noticed so he doesn’t feel the need to retaliate at you and get your company penalized like Disney or your job fired like that AG or have your house swatted like that Covid analyst or get arrested for having books he doesn’t like… Media just needs to shut up and let him be so we can all let him be how he wants to be (… or else he’ll pass laws so he specifically has expanded powers to sue the News for libel like he threatened to do this week).
I’m sorry.
The examples they listed were far from “autocratic “.
Laws that ban teaching about sexuality to kids under 3rd grade are just kind of common sense to most parents.
