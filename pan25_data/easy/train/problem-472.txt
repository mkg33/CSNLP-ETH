Tonight, I read a random Russian newspaper’s coverage of the ‘SVO,’ not published in Moscow.
They have very little of what we see as Kremlin-issued propaganda, and near nothing from any perspective outside of Russia.
Mostly just death announcements, production announcements, etc.
I agree.
He's up a creek right now.
The Russians are being more aggressive in their Belarus incorporation into the war.
People said he was stupid but the manoeuvres needed to survive this are going to be genius level.
⚡️"Ukrainians are ready" — President Volodymyr Zelenskyi announced the operation to de-occupy Crimea.
Damn.
Assuming it’s double for the 100k that it’s about to set, that’s 200k wounded total, and 170k that wouldn’t return.
Total losses, 270k.
About half of the initial invasion force and the 300k mobilized.
They’re really churning them out aren’t they?
But there’s always room for improvement.
“Russians continue to kidnap Ukrainian children in the occupied territories.
After medical examinations, the children are sent on a ‘vacation’ to Russia, from which they do not return.”.
