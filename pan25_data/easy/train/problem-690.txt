Also so they can continue to be like, "See the US is still a threat."
Like Kim il-Sung took the bombing campaigns against North Korea in the 50s and enshrined it in the national memory.
Tbh it's because in the 50s Kim il-Sung decided to use the bombing campaigns that the US carried out on them not just as a memory of war like most places, but a core national memory.
Like anti-Americanism has been their only consistent point for decades.
South Korea and Japan barely think about them.
It's like their version of Cuba or Belarus basically, and they say shit like this to at least show their people that they are still dedicated to the struggle against the US, or at least those who aren't in power.
The elites and anyone who is authorized to leave the country know that it's largely propaganda, although there's still the strange personality cult and parasocial relationship with the Kim dynasty (it's a hereditary dictatorship).
What's interesting is that they are using his sister now, which could likely be that Kim Jong-un visiting Trump may have been seen as sacrilege against this national mythos.
Probably for redundancy.
Imagine being the audio technician for this speech and only propping up one mic.
Suddenly, that mic/cable/input fails and the big announcement wasnâ€™t properly recorded.
