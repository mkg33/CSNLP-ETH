Back in the early days of the Trump administration I fell for one of those types of accounts.
Louise Mensch, I followed her Twitter for a bit.
I had a Twitter account for following her, Palmer Report, Marcy Wheeler, and a few others.
But I fell for it.
I wanted to believe the hype that Mensch was pushing.
I wanted to believe that the House Sergeant at Arms was on the tarmac where Air Force One was about to take off, holding the plane on the ground.
I wanted to believe he was actually serving Trump with some sort of legal potion that would remove the embarrassment and danger of Trump from the White House.

Many Republicans and the entire conspiracy-fiction production industry have realized people donâ€™t care about fact checking.
They just want to be told that their feelings are true.
If they hear what they like, it becomes truth for them.
And when a lie is repeated enough, it also becomes their truth.
