Those accessories to mass murder and degradation of humanity will ban a few pages riddled with words of revolutionary retribution against tyranny and civil rights iniquities in comprehensible dialects, but will force children and young/older adults to bend to mind shattering educational and occupational demands in an environment where parents, teachers, peers, and other media influencers constantly batter their crying souls with the most hate ridden, moral policies that will see to their psychological, and even physical isolation if they dare to exhibit even a slight sense of disobedience to antagonistic societal demands that are frighteningly synonymous with mass slavery and oppression of the defiant at the constant threat of modern exile or violence.
Those who are brave enough to challenge said conditions are met by their fellow peers/family members in the society with cruel psychological abuse and often times violence in domestic and public environments, because the truth will break their sense of security and their fear will drive them to sacrifice/exile the dissenting members of their own communities, in order to effectively, even for a moment, cover the cruelty of the new world order with a veil of denial that has a mind of its own.

US govt debt is now over $31.4 trillion.
At current interest rates, nearly 25% of govt tax revenues will go to service the interest on this massive debt, much of which was incurred by unnecessary wars (Iraq, 21 years in Afghanistan), financial industry bailouts in 2008 and 2020-2022, and historic tax cuts, most of which went to the top 10% of earners in this country.
And if we allow this debt to keep growing, it could get as high as 50% of tax revenue.
