Tough to be a Democrat, too, what with all the hammers to the head, and bullets to the head, and insurrections calling for Pelosi's head, and Republican politicians and candidates using Stochastic rhetoric to make people hateful and scared, and right-wing media telling their viewers that Democrats are waging a "culture war" against them, and conspiracy websites implying that Hillary Clinton is a baby eating cannibal, and the effigies of President Obama that right-wingers burned, or how Donald Trump labeled the free press an enemy of the people, to say nothing of the armed poll watchers sitting outside of voting booths with a clear agenda, and of course it's worth mentioning the people who showed up on January 6th with semi-automatic guns, pipe bombs, brass knuckles, pepper spray, and improvised a flag pole to be used as a spear.
