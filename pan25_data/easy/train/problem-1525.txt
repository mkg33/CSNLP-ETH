Yeah sorry for anyone sitting there hoping this was the start of WW3 but anything short of definitive proof that Russia deliberately targeted a fucking farm in Poland this wasn't ever going to go anywhere.
Poland is going to invoke Article 4 (not 5) and probably end up getting a ton of missile defense systems as a result.
That's it.
Next I got curious about Russian missile artillery organization.
I'm not about to go digging for it, and this is imperfect but I reviewed this video about their howitzers by battle order.
Incredible.
Hey I'm hammered all the time and I'm pretty proficient at windows 98.
What kind of job opportunities do you think I could get considering I'm a software engineer?
Yes, definitely.
This justifies NATO forces resoundingly defeating Russia in Ukraine.
Push them back to their country, restore Ukraine's independence, and put an end to the human rights violations we have only taken half-measures to stop.
You can't "whoopsie" murder two civilians in a NATO country during your illegitimate war and have it not have consequences.
That would be absolutely absurd.
