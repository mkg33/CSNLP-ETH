The more cynical view on this would be that this has been drafted to condemn problematic Russian explosive weapons attacks ("indiscriminate", and in some cases appearing to directly target civilian infrastructure of no military importance), whilst avoiding condemnation of problematic American explosive weapons attacks (that "take into account ... effects on civilians", because some lawyers looked at them and said, on the balance, the effects were acceptable, and aren't "expected to cause harm to civilians", because they use precisely-targeted weapons, whether or not the identification of targets as combatants was appropriate).
It's all a bit late.
There has been murmurs for years that Russian agents had taken an interest in ireland given our position in the EU, our lacking military intelligence and our proximity to trans-atlantic undersea cables.
But hopefully the country is finally awake to how serious a threat russian agents on irish soil could be.
