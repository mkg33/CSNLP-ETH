Something big and bad is always downplayed in Russian official media.
Like an explosion is a “clap” (as in “hand clap” or “bubble burst”).
Economy stagnation is “negative growth”.
War is “special military operation” or “this situation”.
Full mobilization is “partial mobilization”.
If your city is flooded with sewage, it’s “minor leakage”.
And so on.
Makes people not worry much.
A “clap” doesn’t sound bad, even if it demolished half of a multi-apartment house.
“Negative growth” is like… still growth?
Right?

It's working on the political extremists that were predisposed to like Russia: the far right that likes Russia's "traditional Christian values", and the far left that likes Russia's "standing up to 'Western imperialism' and restoring the Russian sphere of influence.

Modern high explosive fragmentation weapons explode a large explosive core, ripping themselves apart and blasting out fragments of the shell (called shrapnel despite that not being technically accurate) at hypersonic speeds via the explosive force.
Shrapnel shells stopped being used because they were inferior to high explosive fragmentation shells which have been the standard munition for well over 100 years now.
Old timey Shrapnel Shells TM worked as basically a box of musket balls that ripped open like a pinata when a timer reached 0 and fell down at supersonic speeds with inertia.
Basically a shotgun shell that doesn't open until its in flight.
Almost no explosives inside it.
