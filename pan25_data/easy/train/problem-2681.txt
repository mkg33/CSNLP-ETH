The last thing employees in the news industry get is free lunch.
It's not that media is lazy, it's that media is underpaid and overworked.
The system is designed to churn through talent and grind down anyone looking to change it, unfortunately it works.
Stories and angles are demanded/reinforced by management whose only job is to look at ratings and revenue as a measure of success instead of educating an audience.
The result is a bunch of ambulance and cop car chasers on local news and tweet chasers at the national level.
Journalists need improved pay, hours, and benefits like better training and professional development; they get none of those things because ownership of media is almost entirely made up corporate conglomerates and/or hedge fund owners who have a clear stake in maintaining the status quo to enrich themselves.
The easiest way to do that is to keep their employees on a hamster wheel to avoid being able to question why they're in a cage.
Seriously?
Passing the only gun legislation in decades, spending billions to fight climate change, capping insulin at $35 for seniors, trillions in needed infrastructure spending...
But yeah, almost none of his agenda.
