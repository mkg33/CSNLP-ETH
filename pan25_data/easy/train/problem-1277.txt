The problem lies in the fact that in India in matters of personal law you have the choice of following the common personal law which has the age as 18 or to follow the personal law of your religion which is partly decided by religious personal law boards.
While the Hindu personal law was ammended by passing the Hindu code Bill, the same thing was not done with other personal laws, this was done to appese conservatives of other religions sections (mostly because during the partition of India and Pakistan india lost a lot of educated muslims thereby strenhening the conservative sections, although Pakistan did turn more conservative that came later).
There has been a directive principle in the constitution to get rid of religious personal laws and replace them with Unifor Civil law but till now only one state in India has this in place.
The current ruling part has been promising UCC for the past 20 years but till now no state under their control has implemented it.
(Hope the explanation helps.
).
Unfortunately I also witnessed a handful brutal honor related incidents, so Iâ€™m very biased towards protecting young muslim women from religion/tradition.
