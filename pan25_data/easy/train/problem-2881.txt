Back in the day, NY was a political machine state, with lots of cronyism, and many of the structures in place for local politics is still reflective of that.
This results in a state-level party that is not nearly as flexible or politically responsive as it should be.
This is made worse by the unique demographics of the state in that there's a lot of area with economic and population stagnation, that's very rural and very red.
But there's also the biggest city in the US, at the complete opposite end of the state, in a weird corner separated from most of the rest of the state's area (meaning the metro area of NYC is mostly NJ and CT, not other parts of NY).
So we've already got a party that hasn't really updated its leadership structures in a century and a half, then we've got a really weird geography that makes for an unnatural political divergence between different parts of the state, and then you throw in the several layers of extra positions made in NYC specifically and it creates a complete mess.
Its true.
Cuomo was a corrupt scumbag.
When people talk about liberal elites they think of rich dyed blue elites from coastal cities who sip $$$$$$$$ champagne at vanity fundraiser events while shipping jobs to China.
They think of Hillary Clinton and Schumer and Cuomo's and so ons.
