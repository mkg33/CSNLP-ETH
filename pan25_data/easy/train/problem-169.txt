Sweeden must do emphaty and understand turkish security needs.
Otherwise why would turkiye wants to be brother in arms with sweeeds still supporting terrorism?
Without making empaty to turks and understand their needs of security, why would turks accepts sweeden to be brother in arms with turkiye?
Whoever is in power of turkey, sweeden cant be brother in arms with turkey while being terrorism safehouse.
Sweeden still is a safehouse to terrorism operations and turkey doesnt to be brother in arms while sweeds supporting terrorism.
Thats why its not about erdogan, whoever is in power of turkiye, there will still be no tolerance against countries like sweeden became safe house for terrorism operations.
If west tries to do sympaty with turks, they will understand being next to middle east, bordering with syria, iraq and iran comes with tons of chaos and westerns may never face in their lifetime..
Turkiye, being the only nato country has a huge border with syria,iraq and iran turks always had terrorism problem in the last 40 years and this caused more than 40 death, many bombings, kidnappings and even minority of turkiye forced to join terrorist ranks, kurdish girls forced to serve in pkk as sex slaves, drug traffic and many other problems..
range.
Erdogan's coalition has around 35% support.
The remaining 5% are also Erdogan's opposer but they are wild cards.
