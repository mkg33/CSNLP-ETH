If politicians were truly accountable fixing things like pollution, homelessness, healthcare, education and a multitude of other issues would be easy as if they didn't then they wouldn't get to stay as politicians - instead of always blaming "the other guys" and saying it's not their fault nothing gets done.
It is not about feeding and growth.
It about exploitation and leaving scars on the ecosystem.
There is no ecologically friendly feeding of everybody with several billion individuals distributed as they are.
The problem starts with moving food to where the people are.
There will always be a unbalanced distribution of resources and those that will use it to pressure those in urgent demand.
A world in which tens of billion of people live in perfect harmony with nature and themselves ranges between wishful thinking and a naive day dream.
So yes, I stand by it.
It is about overpopulation of the world.
We are a unsatable hive and as long as we are drawing more resources from our environment - any resource - than the environment can naturally regenerate (keyword is naturally) we are heading into a situation where scarcity of said resource will lead to conflict with those not in control of it.
