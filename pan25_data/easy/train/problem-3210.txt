And if you think that's something, look into all the diverse stuff they developed from wild mustard.
Broccoli, cauliflower, brussles sprouts to name just a few.
Scientists originally never used the term genetically modified organisms or GMOs to describe genetic engineering.
This term seems to have come from the popular media.
Bayer/Monsanto, BASF, Chemchina, etc.
big agribusiness model is to patent seeds, sell them with the promise of higher yields, and then legally block farmers from harvesting their own seeds in subsequent years, locking them into predatory "seed rent" from year to year.
This is a form of colonialism, where advanced science is used to push business models that put local farmers into debt, with many eventually losing their farms.
This has already happened in the US, and agribusinesses are pushing hard to spread this model around the world.
This is dangerous also because it decimates the genetic diversity of seeds: one blight can wipe out a monocrop, causing famine, as has happened many times before.
Furthermore, the promise of higher yields are not proven, and chemical pesticides necessary when monocropping agribusiness seeds are used are proven to be bad for the overall environment, and bad for human health.
Glyphosate (Roundup) must be used alongside Monsanto's soybean seeds, and it is proven to disrupt bees, and WHO scientists have clear evidence linking it to human cancer (the US EPA claims "not likely" but with Monsanto lobbying efforts clearly at play here).
Okay.
Considering the global food crisis, I don't think they'll have trouble finding other customers.
Mexico is just shooting itself in the foot out of pure ignorance.
FYI - GM stands for “genetically modified”.
An organism, such as a plant, animal or bacterium, is considered genetically modified if its genetic material has been altered through any method, including conventional breeding.
A “GMO” is a genetically modified organism.
GE stands for “genetically engineered”.
