The obvious country not included in the list of countries was Russia.
Trump had zero business links in Russia or even Ukraine.
For 6 years of Russiagate we were led to believe Trump was a puppet of the Russian State.
And yet all the evidence indicated he had much more questionable relationships with the middle east, Saudi, UAE and Israel in particular.
All the evidence indicated that Trump's foreign policy was deeply aligned with that of Israel.
His first trip as President was to Saudi Arabia and Israel.
And the evidence indicated that middle eastern powers, including private Israeli intelligence agencies like Black Cube and Psy Group were working behind the scenes to help Trump.
We have were openly offering to help Trump win the Presidency.
And we now know Trump had business relationships in all these countries.
Absolutely mind boggling.
I don’t understand how Trump supporters claim to be in favor of fiscal responsibility while so ardently supporting a man blatantly milking the government of their tax dollars to line his own pockets while he plays golf.
Soft?
