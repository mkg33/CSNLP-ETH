It doesn't at all.
What did you fail to understand about not being able to put the genie back in the bottle?
Some mistakes you can't walk back.
We don't _get_ to not have nuclear weapons now, because then only bad actors will have them.
It's too late.
Nuclear weapons are now a permanent facet of mankind, and it is political idiocy to think you can just wish that away.
Responsibility for them?
Do you have any idea how much money the US gives to most countries of the world?
The vast majority wouldn't make it if not for US support.
The US already takes responsibility for the world both in protection and economic support.
The reason America doesn't simply conquer the world is that we uphold the idealism of freedom and independence, the same values that America was founded on.
It's the rogue nations that idealize expansionist policies.
It has become the US military job to prevent it from happening.
If not for that, the world would be a mass of chaos.
This veterans day you can thank our military for the longest time of relative peace the world has ever known.
Without them, we would be in world War 5 by now.
