That’s quite interesting.
I have a story about a person I know very well.
It’s my old friend.
I invited him to live in my house while he was dealing with his financial problems.
I haven't seen him for a couple of years.
From the first week of his presence, I discovered he had changed.
He was really strange.
Later I felt his behaviour sort of sociopathic.
And then he proved my thoughts by saying he wants to kill people.
No jokes, for real.
I felt like I covered a maniac in my house.
The 80s and early 90s had a free, independent, and growing civic society/participation (allowed in an effort to reform and save the USSR), and the failure of that effort is part of the reason many Russians are apathetic towards democracy.
Seriously?
The US did not purposefully target hospitals, maternity wards, day cares, and schools.
Nor did they rape children to death and film it and spread it around social media.
Nor did the US take their own soldiers and bash their heads in with sledge hammers to scare other soldiers from fleeing.
Apparently not.
Anyone that's outraged about Russia's invasion of Ukraine should be equally or more outraged about the USA's actions in the middle east.
