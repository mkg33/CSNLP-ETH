I'm really glad he got vaccinated.
In all seriousness.
Some, not all, of his followers probably got the vaccine because of it.
And that's good for them and they could spend more time with their grandkids.
And, for him, his vaccination means we get to see a yuge trial.
Probably the biggliest trial ever.
Some say.
And he'll be itching to testify.
All thanks to the hard work of the science community and his personal choice to take the vaccine.
Total immunity for the win.
That is what he's always done, and he's just been very lucky he's managed to slime out of the situation without actually having to rely on the public attempting to resolve it for him, except for when he tried to get the public to reverse an election result, that did not go so well for him, just the percentage of the public he motivated to make a move on it failed as well.
Would love Trump to go to prison.
Let's be honest though - would even he let that happen if he got through all appeals after being guilty?
Seems like the type to off himself on tv saying everyone was out to get him.
I don't see how he actually willingly walks off in handcuffs to a prison sentence.
