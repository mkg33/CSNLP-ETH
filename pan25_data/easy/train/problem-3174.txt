The House Republicans are generally greedy, stubborn, selfish, closed minded.
It's no mystery why working together to find solutions within their party is so foreign to them.
This is a symptom of a group of people who should have never been elected to begin with.
If they can't find workable solutions within their own party to the simplest tasks, how in the hell do their constituents expect them to be able to do get anything done when they actually have to vote alongside 212 house democrats who have starkly different views and values.
I really don't see much getting done during the next two years as this could be the lamest duck session the House has ever seen.
It feels like this is the manifestation of a deeply broken party finally being aired to the public.
Start planning to Vote in 2024 now fellow citizens.
We need to flush the toilet.
This applies even if McCarthy is eventually elected.
Every vote for the next two years is going to have the same problem with the same 20 crazies holding out for special concessions.
