In general yes, but in this case I don’t think they’re doing it on purpose.
Democrats are laughing at them and making a mockery of how ridiculous this entire thing is (rightfully so) and they look so disorganized right now and like they won’t be able to govern.
Anyone paying attention already knew that last bit, but this is definitely not a good look for any sane non-MAGA Republican voter and I wonder if it might cost them some votes.
Absolutely.
Especially since part of their new demands are to not approve the debt ceiling.
If this happens it will have global economic ramifications.
They want to sow chaos in order to exploit it to fill their own pockets.

Seriously, people are being hysterical.
This is how our system works.
There will be occasional dissent, that is allowed for, and it's a good thing.
Frankly, I'm totally enjoying the Republican infighting.
We will get a scumbag as Speaker regardless, let them damage themselves in the process.
