This is a nothing story.
I have a decade of experience in remote sensing.
There amount of hyperbole around this is insane.
There's nothing that equipment like this can get that can't be better gotten with satellite data, except extremely fine atmospheric measurements and even then, who are they going to threaten with that.
There's better ways to collect any sensitive data.
These objects are common.
I used to work with experimental imaging Cessnas which are the most common planes used for spying.
You need to plan grid based weaves to collect anything worth anything.
These objects don't move like that.
If the data was communications based, why on earth would you use something so obvious and not a device that could be easily concealed and transported on the ground near to the source, or just use a satellite?
You can time satellite information collection for things like weather, too.
