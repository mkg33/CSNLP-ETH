I’m sure after the bay of pigs the communist Cubans would have viewed having Soviet nukes as a deterrent to another invasion as well.
History showed how well that sat with the Americans, regardless of real/perceived intentions of either side.
Likewise, it did not matter if it’s “for defensive purposes”, only how it were perceived by the Russian regarding the “defensive” nukes placed in Turkey that served as a precursor to Kruschev playing lose with his own nukes.
If placing third party nukes will become the norm (again?)
In obtaining leverage between major countries then you’ll quickly find such weapons being proliferated everywhere, on every continent.
No one wins here.
Edit: this guy likes to change what he wrote in entirety instead of holding an honest debate lol.
China plays everybody including Russia.
They only do what is good for themselves and have no “alliances” of any depth with anyone.
They are cold and calculating, much smarter than Russia.
Also very flat affect.
They will use Russia just as they are attempting to use everybody else.
Nobody is their true ally.
They also see value in Russia breaking up so their true intentions are complex.
Siberia would look awfully nice to them with a Chinese flag flying there.
Putin should be Leary of them as much as we should.
They are a greater source of danger to the free world than Russia and by a country mile.
