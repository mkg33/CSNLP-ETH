It just has to be a clear majority.
So if there's an odd number you'll round up (435 is 217.5 which means you need 218).
If there's an even number it would be a tie so you need 1 more (434 is 217 which means 218 still too).
If 430 are here but 1 abstains that's 429 or 215.
For the Dems to win they'd need 3 GOPers to defect which would never happen.
Or, they could win if 6 more Republicans skip the vote or refuse to participate because then only 423 vote and 212 becomes the majority.
Another alternative is that 30 Democrats just abstain and lower the count to 399, so McCarthy's 200 would win a majority - and while I don't see that happening either they might be able to cut a deal but the Republicans seem loathe to give anything resembling a win to the Democrats so they will almost certainly go the route where enough of the holdouts come back after being bribed that McCarthy can get to 218 and win it outright - but then the last people standing against him have to deal with the consequences of basically being another party and get no committee assignments and actively primaried out in their districts over the next in 21 months.
You're dead right.
This is scarily similar to what happened in Germany right before the Nazis took over.
Despite only getting 20% of the vote in 1930, the Nazis effectively held the government to ransom, causing parliament to be dissolved and more elections held.
They got about 30% of the vote in the 1932 elections, but even though they were well short of any majority they managed to Hitler chosen as Chancellor by making back-room deals and promising to support the government.
Obviously as soon as Hitler took power he staged the Reichstag fire, declared emergency powers, and took full dictatorial control.
All with less then 35% of the vote.
