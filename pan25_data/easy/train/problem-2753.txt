China sanctioning the US just makes China lose money and the US invest in a new manufacturing hub.
Plus wages have gone up a lot in China, so there are lots of cheaper places to operate these days AND you have to do that to make items cheap enough for the global market.
If you want to sell stuff to the average global citizens you have to use wages low enough they can afford the product, I think that's the part most ppl don't get about globalism.
It's not only a way to get cheaper products to developed nations, it's also the only way to sell products to all the people who have less money than developed nations.
