Vasily: "This morning, February 24th 2022 at 6:42 a nuclear incident occurred in the Russian oblast of Donbas.
More news to come".
After some bitching about the stupidity of previous governments and anger towards the British military that deceived them, the Aus gov went to great expense to collect as much of the radioactive materials as the could find, bury it, then glassed it with millions of volts of electricity, putting it into a hardened and mostly inert state; while it still emitted some level of alpha radiation, it was not reaching the surface to cause irradiated dust to be carried into the lung of unsuspecting Australians.
Sure.
I’m just stating they aren’t the only ones to have melted down nuclear reactors.
There have been other, smaller meltdowns in the US than three mile island.
That’s just the worst one.
After first literally vomitting in disgust, the lead investigator revealed to their employers that there was in fact hundreds of tonnes of incredibly radioactive material just sitting about in the South Australian desert, irradiating the dusty landscape with primarily alpha-emitting particles.
No.
He’s THE problem.
Of course there are societal reasons and historical factors that allowed him to come to his current state of power.
