Is it really though?
AZ was a red state in presidental elections with the exception of Biden and Clinton they voted mostly Republican since the 50s.
Their governors have been 50/50.
The fact its shifting blue in general is a good thing even if it's just slight margins for now.
It's even better considering that this was supposed to be a Red Wave with how our economy is doing and inflation yet it did not happen.
Republicans had every single election state and national that weren't heavily Democrat leaning handed to them on a Sliver platter for the taking and they fumbled that bag wanting a turd on a golden Trump plate.
Religion.
They are brainwashed from a young age that denying evidence makes you a better Christian, a TRUE believer.
So, rational thought= I'm bad, not a true believer.

MAGA is identity politics.
Someone like Baker doesn’t fit in the tent anymore, so the MAGA’s by definition wouldn’t try and have him replaced by someone like him.
