Yeah I commented about the Bourne trilogy which is exactly what you mentioned, a heroic American exposing corrupt Americans within his own institution.
I think it's because Hollywood knows its main audience is Americans and movies just sell better when the hero has a background that's somewhat relatable.
An American movie may sell well with the Americans or the CIA as the bad guys but if you make the hero a foreign nation instead of a "good American" then I'm sure you'd see sales plummet.
What?
We’re observing the ceasefire.
We’re observing the Ukrainians having a ceasefire.
Oh?
Observing doesn’t just mean acknowledging and then carrying on?
Oh.
It's true I mean one of the most successful spy trilogies in Hollywood (the Bourne trilogy) literally has the CIA as the shady organization running unsanctioned black ops assassinations and a huge part of the plot is a rouge agent trying to expose the CIA, or at least part of it.
The gaslighting is just, wow.
Makes sense now why Trump is always so good at it: he learned from a master.
His master.
For whom his mouth is a cockholster.
