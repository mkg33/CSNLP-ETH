First - both the EU and NATO immediately became the targets to reach for us.
We started working on those goals as soon as we got the politics, money, etc somewhat sorted out.
Also Kaliningrad.
Fuck knows what the Russians have got hidden on that outpost between Poland and Lithuania.
Exactly!
Quite a few high-ranking politicians and diplomats were foreign born.
I think Vaira-Vike Freiberga was definitely one of “the” faces of the Baltic states when she was a president.
Furthermore.
In hindsight a lot of things we were taught in Swedish schools during the 70's and 80'd seems so wrong.
And all the spies and informers, mostly with contacts in GDR, that were present everywhere in Sweden, sometimes in high places, is really scary to think about.
All info about them have been made top secret in Sweden for many, many years to come.
They are old now, but still walk free among us.
Finnish politics towards Estonia has sometimes been so-so in the past (unfortunately, our diverging histories and different experience with USSR has coloured our views differently until recently - IMHO Finns were too naive towards Russia, even though outside of Eastern European countries that suffered under soviet influence and occupation, Finland is probably one country that mostly had little to no dreams about Russia) and that has caused issues between the two countries, but it cannot be denied that Finnish civil society and Finnish estophiles were of a huge help during occupation period and later in the 90s.
Finnish cultural society organisations were used to help Estonia pre-restoration of independence, for example (Tuglas-seura is what comes to my mind).
