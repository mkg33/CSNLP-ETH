Similar population.
Similar culture.
Similar potential for growth.

The PRC should join them in pouring capital into India.
The PRC need not be distracted with sabotaging India; it's main competitor is elsewhere.
You say that India needs the PRC distracted as if that's some sort of retort or counter argument to what I'm saying, but I'm saying all this because the PRC is distracted.
This is a benefit that the PRC should offer to India because of the PRC's predicament with the United States.
India may want to collect this benefit instead of letting it go to waste.
Modern Indian government inherited powers and territorial boundaries from the British Raj which expanded into Tibet during colonization.
China wants those areas back and has captured some areas during 1962 war.
