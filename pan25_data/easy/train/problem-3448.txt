This warship is an aircraft Carrier boight from the french in the early 2000s, and serve many years in the Brazilian navy.
Being an older ship, it was constructed with some hazardous materials like asbestos.
The navy knew about it, so it started a decomission plan around 2016 or so.
In 2021, it was sold for scrap to a turkish company, wich planned to tow it to turkey.
When the ship reached Gibraltar, the company received a message from the turkish governament denieing port acess to the ship, due to the hazardous materials.
Since then, the company has been trying to find a port where they could dock, to no avail.
In the end of 2022, the ship was towed back to near brazilian waters, where it was also denied port acess.
The company them communicated the brazilian navy that they were abandoning ownership of the vessel, and ir order for it to not be floating around willy nilly, the navy took controle of the ship.
When they did, it was discovered that the hull was in a deplorable state, with three holes already formed.
The navy then decided to make a controlled sinking, bringing it to deep waters and removing all toxic materials they could before it.
Exactly.
And fiberglass is made of... glass.
Glass itself is not dangerous.
it's the shape of the glass that is dangerous.
Same with asbestos.
