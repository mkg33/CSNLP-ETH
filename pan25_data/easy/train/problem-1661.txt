“Reasonably” is doing a lot of lifting here.
It’s possible to legally own a firearm, but not accessible.
And your choices are few.
I grew up with guns—Santa gave me my first shotgun when I was a kid.
We gave up some of our guns in the national firearms amnesty/buyback.
My old man is still a shooter, but none of his children are.
Even if I was a “fit and proper person” (I’m not simply on account of a history of depression), I’d struggle to get a license.
To get a license you have to document your reason and for most people, be vouched for by someone.
You can shoot at clubs without a license.
But to join (and then get a license as a sporting shooter) you have to do a lot of work/spend a lot of money and sustain ongoing relationships.
I think our restrictions are positive because they force people to connect with people invested in a culture of safe use—which might to be the main difference with (some) US regulations (though I don’t know much about the US/if that’s true or not).
Conspiracy nuts apparently.
Some articles have screenshots of Twitter posts from them that make very little sense.
