In 1984, Winston ponders that the party has the power to say that 2+2=5 and it would become the new truth.

If you're Chinese and 30-40 years old, within your lifetime China would have gone from an agricultural backwater with low educational and high infant mortality rates to a worldwide superpower, the world's second largest economy (that is absolutely integral to the global economy), a host of what is widely regarded as the most memorable Olympics in decades, built several thousand km of tracks for public transit across your multiple cities, constructed tens of thousands of km of high speed rail lines, and home to a middle class that is roughly the size of the entire population of the United States.
You're not wrong.
It's ingrained in every Chinese.
'face', 'reputation', 'family's honor'.
