Edit: What also makes me sad is that there are actually so many Russian citizens who feel as horrified by this as we are.
I visited Istanbul, Turkey in October and there were so many Ukrainian AND Russian citizens.
Obviously the monstrous acts weâ€™ve been talking about are the main issue.
But when I was there, I saw people choosing to flee to a country they donâ€™t know because their respective countries are at war.
There have always been Ukrainian and Russian migrants coming to Turkey.
But this time it was just different.
There was a demonstration organized by Ukrainians bringing awareness to the child victims of war.
Iâ€™ve heard of this over and over again.
Ukrainians care so deeply about their younger generations.
The monsters know about this Iâ€™m sure.

Another video.
I struggled to get through it when youtube put it in my suggestions I thought it couldn't be that bad.
It's of a russian soldier talking to his mom and the torture methods he uses.
The son says he loves it for the thrill and the mom loves it just hearing him talk about it.
