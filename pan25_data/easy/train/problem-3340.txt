President Joe Biden, also known as "Dark Brandon," was informed of the discovery and recognized the threat posed by the bugfish.
The bugfish were described as being massive in size with a hard exoskeleton and razor sharp teeth.
They were capable of burrowing through solid ice and consuming entire ecosystems in a matter of days.
President Biden understood the danger these creatures posed and was determined to find a way to eliminate them.
The discovery of the bugfish hordes on Europa sparked a race to find a way to eliminate the threat before it was too late.
