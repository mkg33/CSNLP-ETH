It is a town that gives some fire control over some important GLOCS.
It also has some pretty extensive mines that can be used to store some supplies and is hard to root out defenders.
So Ukraine has hard work if and when it pushes back.
Soledar is also a culturally significant location as it is a 1000 year old salt mining town that used to supply salt to the old world.
It also had to be taken to take bakhmut.
So important for many reasons but like the above poster said not terribly important for the overall war effort.
Even Bakhmut is not strategically that important.
Losing it would be a morale loss and would be hell for residents.
Reasonable logistics routes, production capability, population, infrastructure, level of fortification, symbolic value, level of damage, level of local support/resistance, resource availability, and consideration with regards to larger war objectives.
Yh.
It’s not like they say it and the tanks will be there the next day.
What good is a rank if you don’t have a supply chain to make sure it’s equipped, stocked for spare parts and etc.
Exactly.
I think people here start to create narratives based on wishful thinking.
Virtually everything that guy suggested in his post is just objectively untrue.
