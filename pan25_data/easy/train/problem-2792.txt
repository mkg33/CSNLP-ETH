Russia’s influence has diminished because of its own actions.
Had Russians embraced democracy, I have no doubt that they would be an ally and increase their influence.
Instead, they have allowed themselves to devolve back to something reminiscent of the Soviet Union, and that, rightfully, scares every country that was occupied/controlled by the USSR after WWII.
I am not trying to say that Russia embracing a healthy democracy would have solved all their problems, but the fact that the Russian ppl have allowed things to revert to Soviet era authoritarianism has 100% fucked them.
I’m also not of the opinion that the US, or “the west” are perfect, but no one can deny that these cultures are waaay better off.
There are still areas of Russia without running water.
The oligarchs, and Putin, should all be dealt with, and the only ones that can do that are the Russian people, themselves.
If they can’t stand up to the corruption & abuses within their country, then they will continue to slide further into decay.
Exactly.
USA carrier aircraft, at best, have less much less that one-third the range of Chinese anti-ship missiles, they would not even be able to make it back to an attacked/damaged/sunken carrier, not to mention the very fact that the carrier-based aircraft largely carry anti-aircraft missiles, which mostly does nothing in this given scenario.
