“The outrage we’re seeing across the country right now at this latest use, building on top of previous uses that I have consistently condemned, is a moment for all Canadians to reflect and say, ‘Yeah, our fundamental rights are not to be cancelled away by governments who want to get things done in the easiest and most efficient way possible at the cost of people’s fundamental freedoms.’”.
Thanks for the link.
The article talks about municipalities and police forces not having the same level of covid enforcments.
Only mention of federal government is that they weren't as involved as they should have been.
Which is why we ended up with a shit show of different regional covid responses.
And now that the federal government is getting involved it's not right?
what emergency?
you mean the thousands that died in care homes?
the federal government did nothing to help that at all.
that was where the emergency was.
and what every government ignored.
we dont even get updates on covid deaths on care homes anymore, but people are still dying there in large numbers.
