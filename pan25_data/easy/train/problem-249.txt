As usual, Republicans are right...in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons.
They think "US influence is waning because Biden."
Reality is US influence is resurgent under Biden compared to Trump.
US influence \is\ waning overall, due to a number of factors including other countries catching up economically and militarily, as well as the longstanding trend in the US away from democracy and a strong middle class toward fascism and oligarchy.
Of course it is.
After Trump demonstrated that the word of the US can be counted on only until the next presidential election, he threw a grenade into US global influence.
If US can’t be counted on to keep any promises made, why would people be willing to enter deals with us anymore.
Trump did a shit ton of damage in the 4 years he was president.
Blowing up the Iran deal is high on that list.
Isolationist policy isn’t uniquely incompatible with global influence.
Isolationist policy is generally more about not getting tangled up in foreign wars and political issues, but that can be separate from a global influence on culture and economy.
