The biggest issue in U.S. elections today is that every state and little podunk county and precinct needs to implement their own procedures, attempting to follow both state and federal law, providing for funding, providing for personnel, providing for polling locations, etc.
This leads to opportunities where local politicians or election officials can try and disenfranchise voters by complicating or changing procedures, shutting down polling locations or messing with voting locations and hours (for political reasons or to try to save money), and so on.
If the federal government enforces by law that Election Day is a holiday, and that there needs to be x polling locations per y population, and that specific equipment is used with predefined procedures that are used across the country, then all of these issues go away.
And yours isn't?
The ruling party can call an election whenever it wants, nothing is set in stone, and the last time your government had an actual majority of the vote was with David Cameron.
And the last guy before that was Winston Churchill, your WWII guy.
One's ability to comprehend reality.
If you can't know that there is such a thing as a woman, how can you hope to understand things like monetary policy?
Therefore you should not vote.
My apologies.
I probably took it way, way too hard.
I've had a lot of British folk look down their noses at me while insisting that having a parliament would solve all my problems.
I thought your callout was from that same place.
It seems it was not.
