Israel is small enough that it can't really afford to have a reputation for bluffing otherwise it would get challenged fairly regularly.
A country like Russia doesn't have this problem - it's large enough that even its reputation for constantly bullshitting doesn't stop there from being general unwillingness to risk confrontation with it.
No.
Israel is a pluralistic democracy, meaning that it is country where the ideology of the government currently in power is not instantly projected across all of society.
Large segments of Israeli society and several Israeli cities like Tel Aviv are liberal.
A conservative government in Jerusalem has no interest in provoking that segment of Israel i society.
That is the reason that Israeli society is accepting of LGBT (and because many modern mainstream interpretations of Judaism do not care about homosexuality), not because of American funding.
So then what?
That gives license for another group to bomb civilian airports in Israel?
I mean what would happen if a terrorist group bombed Tel Aviv Intl?
Israel is being a little careless here.
