But a squad or sappers will guarantee results and guarantee not hitting own troops.
So they are either shelling far enough that it's not the plant, or it's not them doing the shelling?
So they are either shelling close to the plant, shelling themselves or are not the ones shelling.
But all of these news stories insist they are at the plant and shelling the plant.
And that just doesn't make sense.
Since NATO didn’t want implement no-fly-zone over Ukraine, bc they didn’t want to escalate the situation, I think Russia escalated the situation to the next level, nuclear level Now is the time to implement no fly zone by NATO for the safety of NATO NATIONS, it is a legitimate reasons to protect Europe and send signal to any other stone head dictator who wants to shape the world with his delusional mind.
But they are at the plant.
Like physically, at the location being shelled.
So Russians are shelling a place they know they have people and equipment.
Doesn't make sense to me.
Though it's worth saying that Russia storing military equipment on the grounds and using the surroundings as an artillery base could make it possible Ukraine is hitting them but so far we've only seen Ukraine use small kamikaze drones which have pretty low collateral as it mostly hits soft targets.
