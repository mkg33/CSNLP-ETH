The only advantage a braced pistol has is when it was designed for pistol calibers and someone wants to make it a little easier to shoot a pistol caliber accurately at the expense of added weight and overall size.
But, it isn't going to make a 9mm shoot like a rifle bc the barrel lenh still remains pistol lenh.
Shotguns don't use barrel rifling so twist rates aren't a thing and shells don't need to be matched to barrel lenhs.
Barrel lenh will affect spread pattern and some power, but shotgun shells have more than enough extra power to spare and shells filled with round balls of steel don't have a tiny point that has to be kept in the same direction and spinning at a certain rate as they fly towards a target.
Let's go back to step 1.
They are legal if used "properly".
Now they aren't legal in any way.
Which also heavily impacts the disabled.
Along the way the ATF has overstepped their bounds and here they are doing it even more.
Authoritarian governments do like to disarm before genocide.
Not just fascists, but gun registration by the French led to confiscation and murder when the Nazis arrived.
