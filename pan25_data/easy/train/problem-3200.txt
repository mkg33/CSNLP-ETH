More importantly, though, most polling is in no way inaccurate.
There are polling organizations that are better than others, but inaccurate polling is usually a choice.
Lots of people don't understand how polling or statistics works, but these reporters do.
They very carefully walk a line here that they know better than to cross... That is, they never come out and say, "___ poll got it wrong."
Polls can't really be "wrong," at least not any of the professional ones.
All they are doing is asking a set of people a set of questions, and then telling us what that data says within what margin of error.
You won't find a reputable polling house that will say they are trying to predict the results of the election.
That's why questions are worded in ways that make those time differences very clear, like, "Who do you support today," or, "Who do you plan on voting for when you cast your ballot.
