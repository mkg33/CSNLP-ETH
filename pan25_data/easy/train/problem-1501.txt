China just needs to chill the fuck out and keep their shitty shittiness in their own shitty country.
Enough space.
Enough people.
Enough power.
Just fuck the hell off.
So, a country invaded repeatedly is no longer invaded after developing nuclear weapons and a massive military, and you think that proves that those don't work to prevent invasion?
How many times have the United States been invaded before we settled on nuclear deterrence and a massive military?
At least three by just one power.
Since?
None.
Sounds like it's working to me.
Pretty sure most Americans don't even know Puerto Rico is a US territory and are US citizens and I'm also very confident that most Americans would agree that what was done in Hawaii was despicable, but sure, you go off with that whataboutism.
And after?
Just make a new Taiwan somewhere in between the borders of two other countries or something?
Not an option, any of it.
In the context of superpower and influential diplomacy, the ROC's traditional and stable allies include United States of America, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.
If China attacks Taiwan, it would be WW3.
