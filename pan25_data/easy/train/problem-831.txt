- military history is more prominent part of curriculum.
Reviving 50-year old gear and adapting repair and maintenance manuals to modern times and part availability is an interdisciplinary endeavor: a bit of archeology, a little practical engineering and a whole lot of religious levels of copium put together with duck-tape.
I'm not so sure.
Russia has the resources, manufacturing capability, and skilled workforce needed to scale its defense industry up and overwhelm Ukraine.
Their current problems mostly stem from the fact that they were unprepared for the amount of resistance they'd confront from the Ukrainians and the West.
They expected a quick victory and didn't think they'd need additional resources.
The Russian military didn't order a single new bullet, bomb or aircraft to support the invasion because they expected a fast, painless win.
They also didn't expect international sanctions to completely cut off some of their supplies.
Russian microchip makers like MCST and Mikron had outsourced much of their production to Taiwan, and were caught flat footed when sanctions cut them off.
That's really hamstringing the Russians right now.
They can't build fighters or missiles because they don't have the metal, or fuel, or microchips required to assemble them.
