There's a few things I'd like to see happen.
Police unions are currently waaay out of control and tie the hands of even good police districts who would immediately fire offenders.
We need to legislate allowing police to be fired for these kinds of infractions so unions can't make that difficult.
I'd also like to require real public outreach like we've seen some districts do with some success.
That's sending cops out to do something good in the community like a BBQ or a work day where they interact with communities they serve and a required to not make any arrests (unless someone is actively in danger) while doing it.
This has made police more friendly to their communities (maybe if you know that kid's name is Jeffery, you'll just take him home and let his mom, Bertha, straighten him out).
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.
If you want to help make this community a better place, consider !
Or political suppression of minority voting?
(Mississippi burnings killings were done by local cops.
Rught?
).
