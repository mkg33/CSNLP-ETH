While the current outbreak among non human populations is becoming concerning, we arent in major danger yet.
If governments are doing their job, we should be in the watch and manage phase.
60% mortality.
And it is extremely lethal among sea lions in nature and minks in captivity.
The mortality rate among chickens is north of 90% in 48 hours.
But regular influenza is pretty moderately contagious , about half as contagious as the original covid.
Current variants of covid are much more contagious and less deadly.
Covid revealed much stupidity , but most people (more than half) wore masks and got vaccinated.
That level of compliance would kick influenzas ass.
Or maybe pandemic influenza is more contagious, but we have little direct evidence of that.
The space of possible plague is large, and covid ain’t shit compared to what is possible… even inevitable over long time scales.

As dangerous as a crazed gunman on a rampage.
Flu viruses are much easier to effectively vaccinate against, with the main weak spot being strain variations, not a general ineffectiveness in stopping transmission plus strain variations in a highly mutagenic virus family.
I dont know.
What I'm saying is, if you're worried about it, start preparing for it.
If you arent willing to prepare for something, then you arent that worried, you're just looking for something to doomscroll about.
