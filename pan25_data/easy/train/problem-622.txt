He made the right decision in the rail strike.
First, 2/3 of the unions involved did not want to strike and had already signed on to the contract that was being negotiated.
Second, a rail strike isn't only about the rail workers, it's also about the people who depend on what the rail system delivers, including food, water, heating oil, etc., and having those things stop (not decrease but stop) for an undetermined amount of time in the middle of winter just before a holiday would have been disastrous for the economy and the people.
Third, railworkers already have long-term health coverage and time-off coverage (that is paid) what they don't have is immediate (day of) time-off that automatically falls under sick leave.
They can call in sick and after the fact request back pay for it but not automatically get paid for a sick day.
It's that automatic pay 4 of the 12 unions involved wanted to strike over.
Point being, it's a complicated issue and I think he did the right thing.
Congress however should expand the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to include paid sick leave so future strikes or even the need for that in contract negotiations isn't an issue.
I'm all for "buttslammed".
Can that please be the new norm?
It's so much more honest in its tone!
Really gets the whole "I'm a clown of a journalist" part across effectively.
