Completely agree.
Precedent needs to be weighed properly when making decisions, even by the Supreme Court.
All I'm saying is that the Supreme Court has the ability to discard/overrule precedent when they feel it necessary, and that's been built into their powers since inception.
That's always been the function of the Supreme Court: to be the highest arbiter of what is and is not permitted by our constitution.
They are encouraged to use their judgment over precedent, as each set of Justices looks over the case with fresh eyes.
