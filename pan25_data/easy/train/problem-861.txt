TBF, the Hostomel Fiasco was more due to failure of Russian intelligence and over-confidence on the part of commanders.
I'm sure it would've gone differently if the VDV had the helicopter support that got shot down because the Russians didn't think the Ukrainians had capable air defence, or if they had gotten the infantry support that was rerouted due to that same air defence network.
VDV captured the airport on time, but were basically just told they were on their own until mechanized units could advance from the north, which they also failed to do, partially because the beachhead at Hostomel didnt exist to divide Ukrainian defenders.
Yeah!
