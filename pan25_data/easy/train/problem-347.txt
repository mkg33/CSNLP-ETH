Conventionally its been ugly.
Russia doesn't seem to have alot of new new shit, but what they do have is likely formidable.
They aren't new to this.
What is new is reddit thinking they have no nuclear tricks up their sleeve because of a failed invasion against an adversary motivated and equipped to defeat them.
The economy?
My brother in Christ, it would send us back to the stone age.
But not even the stone age from before, it would be the stone age on hard mode, with a year round winter, most plants and animals dead, the air and water poisoned.
In a nuclear war, the best place to be is in a major population center that will be targeted so that you just get painlessly vaporized, because everything that comes after is hell on Earth.
Just one ICBM hitting a major population center would be the worst single catastrophe in human history, it is an insanely bad idea to bank on their arsenal failing.

Nuke treaties between the US and Russia allow each country to COUNT the arsenal of the other, but there is no provision for verifying viability.
