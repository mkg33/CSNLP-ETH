I would absolutely take this job right now.
I’m not emotionally attached to this man in any way.
I’d have a front row seat to the next three months of bullshit.
I could quit once I had enough without feeling guilt or like I should have tried harder.
I would get paid to throw up my hands and say ‘what can you do’ while talking mad shit about my boss and everyone he worked with off record, because apparently that’s the type of chaos this guy wants.
Hell, I could sarcastically come up with even more ridiculous qualifications on this guy’s resume.
I would take this job in a heart beat.
Because there are "alternative facts" now, and you can't trust the media, unless the story has absolutely zero sources, aside from the original sources that had no proof whatsoever...like, "Fox news reporting, that Hannity reported, that Trump said something was 'fake news' and the alternative fact (a.k.a.- "The Truth") is COVFEFE" Then people have 3 "news" sources telling them "Well, it is definitely COVFEFE, for sure" And there's no point in fact-checking or correcting them, bc those people will never believe you...not if you don't speak "the truth" that they definitely know!
