Just like I said in my earlier post from what I learned while working for Exxon International Headquarters in NJ years ago.
Plus, they aggregate their prices and justify them by combining their entire stockpiles prices.
Its like just making minimum payments on your credit card balance...you just continue to pay the interest.
Hence, a $30 barrel only makes a small blip when its combined with the existing amount of overall barrels....you follow the logic here?
We aren't going to see major changes in gas prices, by their "logic" for however many years of shipments at $30 phases through their entire reserves.
Think like large parts of Texas covered in those huge, round silo things.
When my boss, a VP explained it to me?
I was ashamed and haven't bought gas from Exxon in decades.
That was before they owned Mobil too.
Lastly, Google fuel profit increases in the past 3?
years...profits have jumped in some companies from 26b to 462b.
Not joking.
We've been being gouged for years now.
Before prices went this high, they were ALREADY turning big profits.wish I were a shareholder...
Hello MrJenzie.
Sorry to bother you, but I just saw the green circle on your avatar appear for a moment, and then disappear.
What you doing over there, buddy?
Everything okay?
