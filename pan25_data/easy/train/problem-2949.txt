Basically once a country has nukes (and more importantly ICBMs on which to put the nukes) it becomes a lot harder to just ignore them.
Because practically speaking theirs not all that much Iran can do to the USA or China or any other significant military power with conventional weapons, but once you have nuclear capability that equation changes.
It’s like the difference between a person threatening you with a knife vs a gun.
A singular well placed nuclear explosion can cripple a economy for years or poison a nations food supply, heck you can even chop the head off a entire government by just nuking their capitol and all the political leadership within.
So, with this in mind nuclear weapons become rather tempting.Furthermore it forces the international community to take them seriously and limits the actions other nations can take against them because if they make a nuclear armed nation very desperate they may do some crazy shit like use their nukes as a last ditch effort to win or just to make sure no one wins.
Absolutely.
And it is fully understandable that Iran wants nukes to defend themselfs as they found themselfes multiple times close to being invaded.
They are not going to nuke Tel Aviv tomorrow if they get nukes today because they know that Israel would nuke Teheran in retailiation.
They would be more aggressive in their regional power plays though.
