“I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today – it was quite long, three hours.
We analyzed the situation on the front line in great detail – in all directions, on the energy front, the situation on the borders.
The Commander-in-Chief, commanders, head of intelligence, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, head of border guards delivered reports.
We know what the enemy is preparing for.
We will respond and continue to liberate our land.
Everything related to the defense forces supply support was also analyzed thoroughly.
These are equipment, ammunition, communication, winter uniforms.
Countermeasures against missile and drone terror were considered separately – there are already quite significant results in this, the percentage of shooting down has become higher, but there is still work to be done,” President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address.
Stop it.
The US is never going to cut off support.
There's no one who wants this war more than Republicans.
Lend/lease guaranteed the safety and security of Ukraine and passed unanimously.
You want to fearmonger bs, make it that we're never going to leave Ukraine.
