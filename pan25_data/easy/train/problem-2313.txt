So Christmas to conservatives is a day to stick innocent migrants on a bus and force them out on the street in freezing weather to make a political statement (according to Greg Abbott), and a day for a narcissistic ex-President to push the worship of himself above all else.
Yes.
Yes it is but.. it is very characteristic of this orange turd.
No one should be surprised.
It is also characteristic of his followers and the party that enabled him.
They may be trying to create distance but I will stay here and remind the world that there are millions of "sane" conservatives that got in line, and would again, when this clown was saying the same nonsense in 2016.
He is a loser and so is every conservative with him.
Honestly?
As someone who was raised in a conservative house (but now actively fights against their politics), I genuinely weep at how deeply bankrupt these leaders are (both in the past, but especially now).
There's a lot of times we say things like "the cruelty is the point", and that's all true...
But I still want to live a life where I hope for the best in people.
Where even people who do deeply wrong things act out of inner pain and can have moments of self reflection.
Where I can at least empathize with my "enemies" and in that way live by the tradition of "love thine enemies" I was raised in.
