Lukashenko is being dead serious for the whole interview, while the journalist just casually falls into one big fit of non-stop laughter as the journalist realizes what is going on.
I love how the journalist interviewing Lukashenko immediately recognizes the ridiculousness of the situation and calls out Lukashenko... "How do you see this working?
The president of an independent Belarus being a colonel of the Russian Army?

“On the instructions of Russian President Vladimir Putin upon his return from the latest CSTO summit, the Russian military intelligence may attempt in the coming days to pursue a scenario involving either an assassination attempt targeting Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko or its imitation, with the aim of ultimately intimidating the latter and prompting him to finally order his troops to directly engage in the war on Ukraine, alongside Russian troops,” sources report.

and that's the point.
There's too much completely irrational moves from Putin and his clique.
One after another, increasingly stupid and self-hurting.
Really, nobody could believe they'll start a full-scale war, yet they did.
