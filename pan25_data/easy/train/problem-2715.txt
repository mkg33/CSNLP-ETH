I went to school in Russia (2007-2018), and yes, it's nothing new – although we specifically didn't have too much militarism because it was a high-tier gymnasium (basically most of the militarism was related to the victory day/army day, and once they brought us to some event organized by the army where they were trying to recruit kids to join army after school), but it has been a more prominent thing in lower tier public schools for a while now.
However, recently it's taken a crazier turn as they've been imposing increasing amounts of militarism onto children.
In fact, currently they mandated so called "talks about important" lessons which essentially are just plain propaganda put directly into children's minds, and there were more militaristic events not related to any holidays.
Sure.
One thing to point out though, I went to elementary school (it wasn’t called like that but you get my point) when Soviet Union was close to it’s end, and people were generally tired of bullshit.
Maybe it was different during old times.
I believe my grandma mentioned they were taught how to shoot in school, among other things.
