So yes, it is genocide, and even influential books Russian books like "The Foundations of Geopolitics" admit the goal is to exterminate Ukranians.
Oh, and that's a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian Military.
Russia has openly stated the intent to eradicate Ukraine.
Russia did, and has made wiping out the Ukrainian people and their national identity a major cornerstone of their war.
You've already acted as an apologist for Russia and it's attempts to eradicate the Ukrainian nation.
Don't pretend you care.
Russia is being RIGHTFULLY shunned by the international community because theyâ€™re not even attempting to comply with international law.
Let me share a quote:
Actually, there's plenty of evidence of genocide, ranging from Russia's admission that it's abducting and relocating thousands (as much as 300,000) Ukrainian children with Russia families, to the fact the war is one of the most documented conflicts in history with numerous mass executions and torture incidents.
Ps.
Idgaf about the Olympics either.
So, see?
Common ground.
Let's get a beer and talk shit about humanity!
