Iowa doesn’t make anyone jealous, which is my point, ag doesn’t matter.
And CA is 50% bigger than IA because vegetables can be grown there all year and wine.
Both of which are higher value than IA commodity corn.
But wine and vegetables are not going to conquer the world.
Given that the cheapest possible annual cost of health insurance premiums in California is $2,004 per person, and the average cost of health insurance is $6,888 per person, most people would see their healthcare costs go down significantly just from doing this alone, even before you take into account the current costs after receiving healthcare.
And this can be way more fine tuned to make the top 10%, 1% or even just 0.01% pay an even higher share, to the further reduction of costs for literally everyone else, given that the rich can afford to do so without impeding their quality of life in any way.

Yep, absolutely.
The top 0.1% can pay a lot more, and it wouldn’t affect their lifestyle at all.
It’s a shame the price tag is always a problem for anything that benefits working class people, but for corporate welfare or the military it’s never an issue.
