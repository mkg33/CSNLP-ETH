Honestly, it is nothing, new.
They did that to Ukraine for centuries.
I was born there, and my family was heavily affected, by 1917 killings of educated people (only my grand-grandma survived of 9 children), Holodomor, WWII chaos (Russians behaved similar as today, they raped, killed and burned down, and then my grandma had to call them liberators and heroes.
Stalin's rule, Chernobyl disaster, Soviet Union collapse crisis.
You see where I am going with it.
Terrorist.
All of Russia deserves to pay to rebuild Ukraine and pay reparations for the murder and raping of Ukranians.
I can't wait to see these criminals pay with their livelihoods and to become pariahs to the world.
I'm not shifting responsibility.
This children's game of obvious statement is plain useless though.
Everybody understands that these missiles can not fall into buildings if Russia had not decided to launch them in the first place, there is no point in mentioning this.
Basically.
However, Russia has lost over 100k soldiers and almost 10k of armored personnel carriers, tanks, and artillery for almost no gain.
