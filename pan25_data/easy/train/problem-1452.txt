Extremely narrowly.
He almost won even after all that.
He should have lost by a landslide but that just didn't happen.
I’ve been through enough cycles that I guarantee the average American will have no problem looking beyond all of that and fall for the typical lies about taxes and “crime” that they’ll be willing to put violent insurrectionists in charge of their government because they think they’ll save a couple bucks in taxes or that thousands of immigrants will suddenly begin flooding their tiny midwestern town the moment a Democrat takes office.
The dog caught the bus.
Perhaps 20% of the GOP base is permanently unmotivated since their number one issue has been achieved, and 20% of the Dem base is permanently motivated?
We have no idea at all how long this effect might last.
Apparently BABY MURDER and VIOLATING WOMEN'S AUTOMONY were/are hugely motivating to their respective caucuses... has this semi-permanently destroyed the GOP?
We can only hope.
No matter unpatriotic GOP behavior and actions are, there are too many Americans concerned about “socialists taking over” that isn’t happening, made up “crime” problems and pushing their religious ideology on others to the extent that they would rather defund their own government before paying taxes to fund the services they rely on.
