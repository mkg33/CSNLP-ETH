That's not necessarily true anymore.
South Korea operates American counter battery radar which can accurately determine the location of an artillery battery that had just fired and generate a firing solution for friendly artillery so that it can fire a shell back before the first shell had landed.
Given enough readiness prep (and the US can detect a build up of troops in Russia where the US has no radar assets on the border of, let alone in North Korea where the US has one of the largest concentrations of military assets in the world), the North Korean artillery gets exactly one round per gun (remember, at North Korean CEPs which isn't exactly something you'd write home about) before their entire artillery force gets obliterated by South Korean and American counterbattery fire, MLRS fire and air power.
In any military invasion the correct move would be to target enemy counterbatteries and military installations to minimize resistance, rather than committing murder-suicide by wasting ammo on civilian targets before immediately getting plastered by a counterattack.
The ocean is big.
BIG.
And although whales are bigger than people (possibly except OPs mom), they are tiny and very much spread out when you compare it to the sea.
The odds of hitting whales are astronomical.
China is a capitalistic communist society that greatly depresses many minorities, but they aren't batshit crazy.
And as amoral as the means they use to get things done, in many ways it does at least go towards the general good of the population.
I don't agree with the tactics and I don't think the means justify the ends, but I can logically understand their borderline Thanos style reasoning.
