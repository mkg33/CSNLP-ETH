I think social media is one of the biggest threats to democracy in the long term full stop.
I also think it’s legitimately warping our social experiences and the way our brains work, especially for younger people.
But you can’t ban media.
Humanity would be better without a lot of things, but people still are entitled to the freedom to choose how they spend their time.
Not on work phones, and especially not on government phones, but the fight against the negative impacts of social media apps should be cultural, not legal.
r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.

As a Cybersecurity professional....no social media or extracurricular apps should be on government issued devices.....
That was my first thought.
I wouldn’t ever consider putting a social media app my my work phone, and government absolutely not.
Even if not a rule (most all companies say only work related activity on devices), why would u want them to have all that info on their property?
