Halting hostilities on Russia's ability to wage war.
Ukraine is going to be developing its own missiles and weapons systems and drones and using them to go after any military target inside Russia and within range of the border.
This could turn into a defacto military exclusion zone, but that's still territory Russia wants to use strategically.
Honestly?
They probably HAVE put money into their maintenance.
However, as you said, it’s a bluff.
First use of nukes is, almost always, illogical.
This is 100% cheap talk.
Even in a world where Ukraine does push Russia out, of all occupied territory, there’s still likely to be negotiations for the removal of sanctions, so even in the best case scenario for Ukraine, it’s highly likely that some form of negotiations will take place, and in that specific scenario it would most likely revolve around turning over war criminals….

Ukraine will totally cut off Russia's naval access to the black sea, the mediteranian, and force any shipping from Russia that wants to get to the Atlantic to use the North Sea.
