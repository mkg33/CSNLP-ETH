That being said, one can only wonder why there are any Republicans left to support a party and a party 'leader' who despises the truth, ignores the facts, and insists that he "did nothing wrong" when his criminality is so blatantly on display.
Would you still be a Democrat if our party continued to support him as our 'leader' after all the lies told, the stupidity demonstrated, the anti-democracy policies promoted and adhered to?
Would you still be a Democrat if our party put conspiracy-spewing whack-jobs in positions of power, and praised their abject stupidity as political insight?
Would you still be a Democrat if our party promoted the idea of rigged elections every time one of our own lost an election?
Would you still be a Democrat if our party had elected a lying buffoon like Donald Trump to the highest office in the country?
Would you still be a Democrat if our party had to spend its time covering for our 'president's' crimes instead of doing the People's business?
