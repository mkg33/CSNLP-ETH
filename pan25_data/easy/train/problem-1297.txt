There is no equivalent in the House.
They don't vote the way they are suppose to, they will get primaried in a second.
The majority of these districts are heavily gerrymandered.
I wish you were right.
A little more nuanced than that.
In certain areas the red wave was strong, especially in areas where abortion wasn’t on the ballot.
In other areas, it was completely weak.
Ultimately, the map looks very stagnant from 2020 and 2016.
It’s super fascinating.
Not how it works.
If people vote 'present' or are physically not present to vote (remember some elections may not be decided yet) it does not count toward the total.
That is why Pelosi was elected with 216 votes in 2021 (with 3 Democrats voting Present and 3 Representatives who were absen).
Pelosi had 3 presents and 3 absences in the voting scheme - meaning she only required 215 votes to clinch.
Republicans (if they get to 219) can only have two absences or present or no vote and can clinch the Speakership.
Everyone else has to be in the seat and voting.
Cause if there are 216 democrats I guarantee you they will all be there and voting for 1 candidate.
He is predicting Democrats get 219.
Will see what happens here, but all it takes is one person with a health crisis, car accident, etc and you have a even House.
