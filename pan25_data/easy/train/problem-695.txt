Look, the right wants to jail their neighbor just because they have a rainbow flag.
They want iron boot fascism and trump is just milking this for his own pitiful grievances.
The problem with the rallies that I watch, they sit for hours, and trump comes out late, does a half ass job, reads off a TelePrompTer, runs a clip, shows off guest.... and they only cheer when there’s racism and transphobia.... that’s it!
And it’s really creepy seeing their smiles on low res video.
It’s ugly, but it’s what they want.
Trump would actually be somewhat of an American hero if he continues destroying the Republican party into insignificance.
Especially if he actually splits the party which I think they should because the types of things Trump and DeSantis believe in aren't necessarily in the better interest of tea party loyalists and real conservatives.
Has he?
If this election goes much better than expected, I'll gladly change my opinion.
But all indications are that Democrats are going to get slaughtered.
I hope I am wrong.
