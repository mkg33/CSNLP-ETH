It all sounds very uplifting but those units are under Ukrainian Armyâ€™s command and no one will ever let them go to Belarus unfortunately.
Because the West is gonna have a very strong say in it.
And the west will never let Ukraine let it happen.
Sorry for being a downer.
Considering Belarus political stance there also wouldn't be NATO assistance.
Even for Ukraine we only started sending over gear few weeks into the conflict when we have realized it's actually possible for Ukraine to win and they were aligned with west.
Belarus is not.
It might get it's chance if Russia gets defeated in Ukraine and something happens internally that gathers their attention.
Like their tsar dying creating a power vacuu,.
In that case it could be possible (but still risky) to potentially do so without a massive loss of life.
Yeah absolutely.
Ukraine has had several victories that really caused Russia to lose a lot of material though, like capturing that logistics point Izyum(?
), when they retook Kharkiv.
They captured an absolute fuckton of Russian gear and vehicles there.
