I'm angry to see disingenuous claims that Ukraine spending is somehow the worst example of needing oversight.
Its pure politics.
That war is the best money we have ever spent on a conflict.
No American lives lost, shoring up a fledgling ally and massively taking down a geopolitical enemy and all it costs us is money.
Supporting Kyev is turning into one of the best strategic defense moves since the first Gulf War, and maybe even WW2.

You're angry (understandable) but irrational.
The police are a necessary social service like the fire department or ems.
The problem is the policy and legal structure around police give them too much room to do anything.
That coupled with the fact that we use them for literally anything, even non emergencies, means we're calling lethal force to every situation where we need assistance in settling disputes.
Giving them less or no money will only open the door for even more trouble.
Stability in the world stabilizes worldwide economies.
Take away that stability and youâ€™ll see rampant inflation in various parts of the world on whatever products when supply lines are halted.
