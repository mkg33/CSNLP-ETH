They could accept losing Bosnia - at the end, Bosnia was an equal and different region in Yugoslavia.
But Kosovo was part of their region, so in their eyes is a chunk of land they are losing.
But there's even something to make things worse: Croatia.
Serbians have an "equal rival" to look at, which is Croatia.
I say "equal", but the truth is that Croatia has been going up since the fall of Yugoslavia, while Serbia has been going down.
Croatia has modernized, joined the EU and the Euro, their economy is stable and growing, poverty is disappearing, they are a very popular country within the EU.
You'll never find anyone here who has a negative opinion on Croatia.
Serbia is the exact opposite: they have stagnated, they tried to use military force to build their post-Yugoslavian state and they failed.
Everyone\ around them is a NATO member and either an EU member, or an aspiring one.
They've aligned themselves with Russia, which they know is a political outcast.
Absolutely.
I'm pointing out that the genocide in Rwanda had a profound impact on western governments' willingness to intervene, because the cost of not doing so might be horrific.
