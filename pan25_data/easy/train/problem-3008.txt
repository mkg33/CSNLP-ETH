And since it would be a fiction, and since he has done a wide variety of things in both states and both years that require legal residency, it would be pretty easy for him to accidentally admit, while making excuses, to primary residency in the wrong state at the wrong time, or for an insufficient number of consecutive days for his actions to all be legal.
Depends if he wins.
