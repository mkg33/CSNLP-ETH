First off, wikileaks was (is?)
an amazing thing and sadly from what everyone around Assange has later told, be it his co-founders etc., the man is a megalomaniac narcissist asshole.
Exactly.
People also forget he did this at unfathomable risk to his well being, and he's had all but the worse done to him already by the US and its allies.
Ask yourselves why the US does this to whistleblowers and leakers, what exactly is it so afraid of?
Interesting.
So the US, who is a criminal due to having committed war crimes, is calling someone else a criminal on the basis of having revealed these crimes.
A criminal criminalizing someone else.
How brainwashed do you need to be to believe that Assange is a criminal...
Pragmatism and reality.
Wikileaks, as an idea and an invention, is a good thing, as it is a lesson and reminder that the entire Western world needs to learn to be more responsible and transparent, especially if it wants to hold some moral high ground over its enemies like Russia and China.
At the same time, Assange is an enemy asset whose work could've tanked the Western world entirely, like you said.
