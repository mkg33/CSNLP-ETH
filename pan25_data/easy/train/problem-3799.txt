Are you including VAT in your calculations?
They change developers AND users VAT and Android doesn’t take the VAT from the developers side of the profits.
Apple however, collects the VAT and then doesn’t even push forward to the developers half what is collected.
Because you know… maybe they expect the developers to pay half and they pay half.
Nope.
They collect it, don’t pass it along and they take that as profit.
You on the other hand pay the full VAT forward.
And Apple's terms of service are anticompetitive if they reduce competition - which they do, by requiring identical pricing across every ecosystem, and get away with by leveraging their significant duopolic market share.
What?
The title isn’t confusing and it explains the situation pretty well.
If you try to pay for the returning verification on Twitter, it will cost you more using an Apple device.
The only thing exclusive to this is the price difference for Apple.
It does mean it’s cheaper elsewhere and it also means that it’s available everywhere.
Alienating?
It's based on business, he makes less money if you don't sign up through the web.
I wouldn't call this alienating.
It's no different than gas, produce, or housings being different based on where you live.
