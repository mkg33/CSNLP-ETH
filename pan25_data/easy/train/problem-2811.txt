Meanwhile during the Democrats' once a decade control of Congress we've done things like pass the largest healthcare expansion since the Johnson administration, outlawed the bad behavior that led to the last recession, invested in climate change and education, raised taxes on the wealthy and took steps to reduce prescription drug prices for the impoverished and elderly, forgave billions of dollars in student loan debt and created millions of jobs, and this isn't even including the legislation that Democrats tried to pass but couldn't get through the Senate, which is quite a lot of stuff, too, like national codifying abortion rights, reinforcing election security, guaranteeing access to the vote, and federally decriminalizing marijuana.
