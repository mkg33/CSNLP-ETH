All voters have a say in terms of their vote and should be able to understand medical conditions that could impact the performance of their elected officials.
Oz is a fake tv doctor.
It embarrassing to me that PA had to choose between a C list tv celebrity and someone who just had a stroke.
The fact these were the two final candidates prove (to me anyway) it’s not about electing the best person for the job, it’s about the political party and who controls the senate/house/White House.
I wish Fetterman nothing less than a speedy and full recovery.
No, random voters in PA are definitely NOT part of any medical evaluations and associated decisions for elected officials.
And again, PA voters were not deterred by Mr. Fetterman's slight speech deficits during the debates, and still felt he outperformed creepy Dr. Oz, and they voted him into office.
Unless there is a recall (and afaik there isn't such a thing for senators in PA) voters do NOT have any say in whether or not Mr. Fetterman continues his term after his current treatment.
