Surprising/not surprising democrats actually.
A lot of people view prisoners, homeless, and disabled people as subhuman.
Unfortunately that mindset reaches across aisles.
I’m cool with a lot of it.
I just don’t think felons are the people who do well as these hard working careers.
I do think these people should have jobs.
They should get skills in prison.
I just don’t get why minimum wage normal jobs are fine.
Like the prisoner solution to your problem just seems insane.
I’m pretty easy on crime and think prison is about taking your freedom and shouldn’t be much else outside of rehabilitation.
I just don’t get how you made it about first responders and teachers.
Again it’s not easy to even join the military after having been prescribed adderrall.
Hell you can be convicted for a dui and still keep your job as a cop.
I just don’t see any community saying they should integrate felons for these jobs.
Sadly these communities need to adjust the money in and out so they can attract workers.
If they can’t these communities naturally will fall apart.
