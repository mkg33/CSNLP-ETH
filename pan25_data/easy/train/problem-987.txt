Edit: As usual, there is such a gross amount of misinformation regarding the Shah in the replies of this comment.
If you want to actually learn about the Pahlavi dynasty, pick up the book "The Fall of Heaven", where actual statistical data and unbiased accounts are used to paint an accurate picture of the Shah's reign.
Don't listen to these people who are simply parrotting what they've heard without any research of their own.
Most of them are non-Iranians, who through good intentions, believe they are "helping" Iranians by setting this false narrative that one of the great nation builders of our history was evil.
The Islamic regime has dedicated the last 40 years of their existence to trashing his legacy through local and foreign avenues, much of their propaganda is being knowingly/unknowingly parrotted by Redditors.
Beautiful.
So beautiful.

Hopefully this will be a precursor to an eradication of all laws all over the world that dictate how a woman should dress based on how pure she must be while she is outside or in the company of men.
Free women!
