I have a friend from Bosnia who went back to visit recently.
He told me one evening they were eating dinner at a relative's house and he heard the dull thud of an explosion.
When he looked up to see if anyone else reacted, one of the relatives said "something set off a mine, probably a deer.
Happens often.

They pushed the 12VHPWR standard when nobody wanted it.

Very few militaries on earth have had this much experience in true modern warfare.
It’s incredibly valuable.
Hell, some of the western equipment we’re seeing them use is finally getting used against the very nation it was designed to fight for the first time.
I’m sure the Brits are going to love training exercises with them in the future.
