Yes I do love owning my firearms.
But contrary to popular believe a majority of Americans and gun owners agree on the same basis.
I’m all for gun control, but only if it makes sense.
So what do you claim to control?
The infamous gun show loophole that has been exacerbated by the left and gun control proponents?
The AR-15 which at most is responsible for 350 of the 39k deaths a year by guns.
The regulation of private transactions which already outlaw selling to people you believe to be felons, under the age etc?
Red flag laws that allow ANYONE to petition a court to take away someone’s access to guns.
Remember what happened to Brittany spears?
I am genuinely curious as to what you or others might think would help.
I am all for more gun control, but only if it’s actually going to work.
I have no problem filling out a background check, requiring some sort of training (I had to have training in WI to obtain my CCW permit, I used my hunters safety course.)
Or other measures to hopefully improve the gun violence problem in America.
I advocate for poverty reform, mental health treatment and advocacy, hell I even advocate for an actual UHC.
Murderous rhetoric?
By referencing defensive gun uses?
Yeah sounds very murderous to me.
I don’t understand how taking a look at statistics is brainwashed, when you are here using only appeals to emotion.
