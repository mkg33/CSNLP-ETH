See, your problem is you treat everything as absolutes and bogeymen.
For one, banning lobbying at the conference doesn't solve the problem of lobbying.
It just happens outside the conference, beforehand.
It solves exactly nothing.
Two, it's not their only role, protecting profits.
Legitimate concerns and obstacles are also parsed in there, they do exist, it's not just bubble gum and rainbows and free money for fossil fuel companies.
No matter how many fake quotes you imagine, it's not changing actual reality.
Nobody says insane shit like you suggest, you desperately need that strawman that bad?
Pointing out an issue like lobbying is great, your solution sucks.
Banning them doesn't change the facts, it spits in the face of them.
Pointing out how poorly reasoned your argument is doesn't make me a simp for big oil, but it sure does show me how dependent you are on needing that polarization to be a part of it at all.
Is your entire philosophy on this good guy vs bad guys?
Seriously?
You need an enemy to make a point?
Its not the same as your analogy, either.
Nobody dies if they don't take opioids.
All of civilization could collapse without fossil fuels, though.
Is it a shitty spot?
You bet.
Is your rhetoric at all useful or helpful?
Hell no.
There are plenty of independent experts who can talk about energy supply chain impacts, corporate accountability and regulatory expectations without having the perpetrators of climate crime flood the conversation with deliberate noise.

The International Energy Agency just revised its 2021 renewable energy prediction by about 30%.
That's 30% more than growth they predicted just last year.
We're adding more renewables between 2022-20227 than the last 20 years combined.
Completely disagree.
They have reps in attendance at every discussion surrounding energy you can think of.
At least in my region.
If someone knows who Greenpeace is, then they know of SC as well.
