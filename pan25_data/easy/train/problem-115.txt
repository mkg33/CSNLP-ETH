The state does only allow for civil unions.
That is what a marriage is.
Its a contract between the married in which the state's role is the enforcement of the contract.
The biggest difference between this and most contracts is that the state has stepped in to define what the contract is.
The state creates the boiler plate contract and then allows some modifications to that contract.
Who can enter into the contract is determined by the state.
Yeah nearly exclusive homosexual is super different than bisexual though.
Even today as an aggregate the LGBT population of America is over 7% not less than 5.
The data you are looking at is almost certainly outdated.
I can certainly see how the Constitution has always protect gay marriage against a Congressional act prohibiting gay marriage, as the Constitution does not grant Congress any authority over matters of marriage or contract, and I don't even think the pretzel logic of Wickard could justify marriage contracts as being interstate commerce, not to mention the protections of the 9th amendment on all matters not delegated to Congress being reserved by the people against the Congress.
