This is better than Iowa but this is still a horrible first state.
This is most obviously Jaime Harrison choosing his home state more than any other rational reason.
The South Carolina Democratic base is not close to the national representation.
SC Democratic base is made up of 60% black voters.
This is extremely unfair to the large voting Hispanic population who gets ZERO representation in the first state.
Same shit as Iowa.
Now the entire Democratic Primary pre-first primary election will be all about Black issues in America, largely ignoring a population the Democratic party very much needs and takes for granted.
Sigh.
Hispanics will continue to fuck off to the GOP.
Being laser focused on issues that only affect 13% of the voting population is going to come back and bite the Democrats in the ass.
Oh and Iowa is more of a swing state than South Carolina is.
Jaime Harrison should know since he fundraised hundreds of millions for himself just to get beat comfortably.
