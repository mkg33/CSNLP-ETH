I followed Durhamâ€™s investigation in the right and left wing press.
Anyone with half a brain knew there was very little there.
I was always astonished how the right wing press would breathlessly report the smallest development as a bombshell.
No wonder nothing came of it.
Now we find that Barr and Durham stumbled on to real criminal conduct by Trump and, apparently, suppressed it.
While I am certain that nothing will come of these recent revelations , as Garland has repeated shown timidity when confronted with political misbehavior, both Barr and Durham should rot in hell for apparent unethical/illegal behavior.
Thank you!
Dem messaging on this has been so bad.
Forget prosecution.
I want to know as a matter of fact the details of the relationship bw Trump team and Russia.
Was he a foreign agent?
(We can prosecute too but I want to understand facts.
).
1.Durham opened a criminal investigation into possible financial crimes involving Trump, based on a tip from Italian officials.
While it had nothing to do w/ the Russia inquiry, Barr decided Durham should keep control of it.
He never brought charges.
