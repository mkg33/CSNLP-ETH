I’m starting to wonder if pretty much everyone would be able to get reparations.
One of my ancestors was an indentured servant.
Pretty sure, 90% of the population can prove relation to some persecuted in the past.
I think the best we can do is move forward, stop profiling people, give everyone the same chance… we all bleed red and piss yellow(though does depend on how hydrated you are… so the clearer is probably better).
Politicians do not have their constituents in mind They look out for themselves We should bond over that and work to replace most of them!
Maybe I’m delusional.
Sorry.
So this entirely predates America and the government of Connecticut.
I understand the sentiment, but it seems more than a little performative when no one involved is a significant aggressor or victim.
There's been roughly 14 generations in 375 years, so unless these people have been inbreeding for 375 years the victimized ancestor is 3.5% of their lineage.
