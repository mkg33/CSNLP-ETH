So the US and European nations own most of the tankers and insurance companies responsible for the Russian oil deliveries.
The price cap of $60 means that if a delivery is supposed to be for a nation buying for over $60, these tankers / insurance companies will not allow the delivery.
So if a country is not participating in a price cap, it just means that they’re not doing the same thing with the tankers and insurance companies from their own country.
But it really doesn’t matter, because the US and EU have an overwhelming majority in regards to owning these tankers and insurance companies (I think like 90-something percent of the insurance companies involved in Russian deliveries), so they basically control it.
They look like a couple of dodgy old geezers.
So long as the oil from Russia is processed in India it passes the whole sanction bullshit?
Fucking corrupt bunch of cunts.
>“We welcome the fact that India is doing so in a way that advances our goals of denying resources to the Russian Federation which Vladimir Putin uses to pay for the brutal attacks we are seeing on Ukrainian citizens,” he added.
Really fucking stupid if you ask me.
Africa is a much better place and you can still talk some sense or money into them.
