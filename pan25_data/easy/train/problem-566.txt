Oh come on leave George alone.
At least he tried his best and meant well ðŸ¤£ Trump said dumb crap just to make people mad.
Biden doesn't have a clue what he is saying.
Pick your poison I guess.
Record high national debt, four decade high inflation and cost of living, just got over a baby formula shortage, going into a winter with heating oil reserves 75% lower than historical average with prices up to over $5,000 per household each winter.
Fuck this.
Who didnâ€™t see this coming with the news of Iran selling drones to Russia.
And Iran threatening Saudi Arabia?
We can't free anyone.
If people want to be free, they have to do it themselves.
If one does not fight for their freedom, they don't deserve to have it.
And any freedom one does not fight for themselves, is not a lasting freedom; it is merely temporary.
Because if they won't fight for freedom now, they won't fight for it later, when it eventually and inevitably comes under threat again.
And there is always a next threat to freedom; ALWAYS.
Freedom is bad news for people who want to have and maintain power.
They will forever challenge it.
There will NEVER be a time where freedom is not under threat.
