I'm a railroad worker, and finding bird smashed by trains alongside of rails is a everyday occurence, but finding dead bird not smashed on the floor wasn't, and since last year, it's a crazy the amount of them i've found and they don't even looks in bad shape, it just look like they were fine and dropped dead in an instant.

Supply and demand will even it out.
There are plenty of smaller farms that will sell eggs cheaper.
As far as I know there isnâ€™t a monopoly on eggs.

Oh!
I hadn't thought much about it, but have recently seen a few different dead birds on trails I run.
Pigeon, blackbird, other sparrow sized.
Not something I noticed in previous years.
