The FBI, under the command of Trump at the time if you remember, performed a 'rush' investigation during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing at the behest of the GOP.
And by 'rush', it was a piss poor attempt that couldn't even be called a real investigation.
NEITHER party of the primary investigation were interviewed AT ALL.
Kavanaugh?
Zero questions.
Ford?
Zero questions.
People on the sidelines who may or may not have known ANYTHING about it?
Sure, we'll ask them.
So if I contacted the FBI and said I'd been sexually assaulted sometime in the 1980s, and I don't remember the date or the location but here's the names of three people who were there, but those three people deny ever being there (which is what happened in this case), do you really think the FBI would be interested?
End result?
"We investigated everyone who knew nothing and learned nothing."
Add to that the fact the GOP rammed his confirmation through as fast as they could - almost as if they KNEW that any long-term digging on this guy would turn up more dirt than you'd find at a Lowe's garden center.
But sure.. he's squeaky clean.
