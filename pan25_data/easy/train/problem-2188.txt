The first thing that stood out to me is the "forced to undergo puberty as the gender they are uncomfortable with," bit.
I'd like to reframe this.
It is the only puberty biologically available to a person.
Completely arresting one's physical development is likely to have lifelong health impacts.
This question is a bit different than trying to imitate the other puberty.
I have less confidence about the negative physical repercussions of that, but I know of one for sure: sterility.
I think it paramount to allow children to have at least one set of functioning reproductive organs as they enter adulthood.
Anything less is can be considered abuse.
One cannot trust the child to have agency over their ability to reproduce before they are even of the age where they can or should begin to make use of it.
It might be different if fertility weren't such a delicate matter, but it is too easy to lose it forever, especially when playing around with the chemical balance of a growing body.
It's cool.
I didn't even know I was intersex until I was in my 20s, although I certainly felt and looked different enough.
I'll have to preface by saying that I'm intersex in addition to being transgender and I have always been sterile.
I never wanted kids and knew I never wanted kids, even when I was younger.
It just so happened that it was also impossible for me, although I didn't know it until I was in my 20s.
