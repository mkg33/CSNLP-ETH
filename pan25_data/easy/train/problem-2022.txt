People really don't understand the way the Chinese think about their economy.
Remember: communist.
They don't care as much as you think about profits and efficiency and export potential and such.
They have people who are able to work.
Those people will be given gainful employment.
They will be paid for that work and buy products that they need.
If at some point they have a company that will never turn a profit or they have a highway with a permanent traffic jam of trucks that takes 3 days to get through, that's okay.
Maybe someday they'll fix it, but in the meantime money will be found to pay the salaries.
So all the things that you think are going to have a horrible impact on them are actually going to whoosh on by.
I'm not saying they won't or can't ever screw up or wreck things.
But I wouldn't bet on it.
The tyranny of the majority is an entire study (first explored by John Stuart Mill) in political philosophy describing authoritarianism in democratic political systems.

Exactly.
We can't have high paying manufacturing jobs in America AND cheap goods.
It's one or the other.
The exception to that is automation, which is likely part of the reason we're seeing some resurgence in American manufacturing.
