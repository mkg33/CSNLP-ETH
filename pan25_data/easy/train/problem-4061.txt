Of course they won't.
There's not much they could hope to accomplish in Ukraine and getting the army involved in an unwinnable war will almost certainly be regime suicide for Belarus and that insecure dork Lukashenko knows it.
So if it backfires, and he ends up being the one needing to divert troops to quell a popular uprising in Belarus he would've found yet another way to screw himself.
I suspect it would be more than just a distraction for him seeing how he needs all hands on deck in Ukraine, but even just a distraction would be disastrous for Putin.
The only reason he might want Belarus fighting with him is to keep some Ukrainian forces tied up and away from the main theater in donbas..
I mean even Putin isn't stupid enough to think Belarus could hope to occupy Kyiv.
This literally already happened.
Luka was supposed to join the war on day 1.
His military refused.
Why?
Because they aren't shit people who want to kill their Ukrainian brothers.
As it turns out, Russians aren't being forced to kill Ukrainians, they choose to, and their only qualm with it is they want it to be somebody else dying to do it.
