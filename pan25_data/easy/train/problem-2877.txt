It's just people using any means necessary to justify their anti-western rhetoric even if it makes no sense whatsoever.
People are comparing Germany refusing to keep selling German technology to Brazil as an example of westerners encroaching on and diminishing Brazil's sovereignty.
It's just so fucking stupid.
Oh im sorry i thought you meant intervining on a foreing nation to back a internal group supported by yourself that goes against the nations self determination and democratic elected officials like Russia did in Ukraine or the US did backing dictatorial parts of Latin American armed forces, and plus you can blame latin American states for US intervining if you wish after all the dictators were Brazilian, Argentines and so on, point is no one cared when dictatorships ruled over latin America until the end of the cold war, so why should we care Putin is trying to install a puppet government in Ukraine to stop it from entering Nato or the EU?
What?
The vehicles are made from parts produced in Germany.
If Brazil wants to keep receiving those parts then it has to abide by Germany's export controls.
This is Germany using its self-determination.
Brazil is all the more welcome to ignore Germany, it should just be aware that western nations will retaliate and will refuse to send them parts.
Trading with the west (or any nation) is a privilege not a right you're entitled to.
