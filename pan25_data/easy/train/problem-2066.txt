Lol don’t turn this around on me.
I’m simply stating that from the perspective of a Jewish person, Omar is an antisemitic person.
Im saying it’s demeaning that people who know nothing about Jews other than the propaganda they are fed are deciding for us what is or isn’t antisemitism for the purpose of politics.
And no, Omar isn’t released because she’s Muslim.
And she isn’t dismissed because of antisemitism.
She’s dismissed because she is just a number, and got outvoted by a greater number.
Both left and right don’t actually give a shit what she thinks or says, nor what her ethnicity or background is.
They just want the votes, and this was an opportunity for the right to use antisemitism as a crutch for greater power by removing her from the committee.
Another way to look at it is that almost just as many democrats voted no, and were ok with an antisemite being there.
Because it’s all about politics and they don’t really care about you or I. Omar is just a voting number to them, and they cared more about that number than voting yes to remove her for being what they pretend to not be.
That speaks volumes to me too.
As I said, both sides are so morally skewed it’s baffling.
