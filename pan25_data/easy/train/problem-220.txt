We've (the US) has painted itself into a corner with the gun issue.
There are 400 000 000 guns in civilian hands in the US.
About 75% of those are in right wing hands.
(and about 20 or so in my neighbor's hands).
Media puts these nutcases in the limelight, general degradation of mental health, civil war era political polarization and radicalism, non zero chance of federal involvement, free healthcare and UBI would prevent a majority of shootings but it’s easier to advocate for obvious non-starters like seizures so you don’t actually have to do or change anything.
I like this idea.
Don’t give them any ppe or even gloves.
They should actually get to feel the blood on their hands.
They have so much of it metaphorically after all.
Fit-for-purpose mental health provision, more accessible education, gun owner-competency laws.
It would be a long process and all of those that need fit-for-purpose mental health provision, a better standard of education, and wouldn't pass owner-competency tests would fight against it.
