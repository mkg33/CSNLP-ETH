Well we should stop and acknowledge what the Green Party was then.
Redditors seem largely unaware of who Jill Stein is and what the purpose of the G.P.
She was investigated by the Senate for colluding with Russia to try to help the GQP win 2016.
We were not told of their findings of course for national security reasons but it's pretty clear why she was uncooperative in the beginning and made a deal to tell all before she disappeared from the limelight.
Now consider how many others in the Party there must have been who were not only aware but also Kremlin targets (they seek people with certain kinds of mental disorders that they can utilize for the benefits).
I'm willing to bet if you followed the money that's driving her, it would take you across the Atlantic.

Exactly.
So many complain about the candidates running in the general, yet the vast majority of them don't even participate in the primaries.
A lot of races have choices in the primary, people just need to show up and select them.
