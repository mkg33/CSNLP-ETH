But Russia doesn’t always act rationally and the Eastern European countries know that and have been trying to prepare for a potential Russian invasion for years.
Imagine a scenario where Russia concludes that “the US won’t defend the baltics” and then proceeds to invade.
Even if the US does come to the defense of them it’s very possible that Russian forces can storm Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in that time.
Even if Russia only occupies those countries for a few weeks before being pushed out then that opens the door to essentially genocide against the people in those countries and all of their cities left in rubble.
That may be an unlikely scenario but it’s certainly not implausible and given how catastrophic it is it’s something the Baltics have been focused on stopping for decades.
Basically their entire foreign/military policy since they regained independence was “how to make sure Russia doesn’t come back.”.
It's not that bad.
If Russia needs 5-10 years to regain strenh, by then we should be so far reformed that we can send some actual divisions to help.
At this point, I would consider the EU to be defended, which would allow the US to make a final big pivot to Asia.
