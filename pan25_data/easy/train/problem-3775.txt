Wake up from the distractions, turn the television off.
Nobody wants you to be informed properly, only just enough to be a sheep.
This story sound a lot like “Hitler” which is how they are trying to paint Putin.
It’s a pathetic attempt to fool the people yet again.
Asylum and citizenship are very different statuses.
Now the argument you’re making is very different.
Initially you implied that the Venezuelan government would turn him over.
You’ve also edited your first post, but it doesn’t matter because even with those edits you clearly still don’t recognize the difference between legal extradition and extraordinary rendition, which is illegal.
The US has still done it, but any agent of the US government involved in such an attempt would be in violation of Venezuelan law and would be subject to punishment under that law.
Propaganda!
The leaders all rub shoulders in their little secret groups.
The war itself is bullshyt.
They need a way to keep the powerful on top and war is the best way for them to do so.
Remember that the same banks are funding both sides of this war.
They been doing this for so so so long and we as citizens still cannot see what’s in front of us.
