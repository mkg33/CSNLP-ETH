Who do you think taught NATO and Ukraine those techniques?
Ukrainian tactics in this war will certainly be put into the playbook of NATO, US, British and other armed forces of the world.
And they will be studied and improved upon at West Point and other military academies across the globe.
HOWEVA Outside of British SAAS, French Special Forces and most likely some elite Indian and Chinese units, I don’t think there’s any branch of any military worldwide that would say they could hold their own against the basic combined arms of the US Air Force and Army in even a small localized engagement.
That’s not even including our special forces and Navy.
You and anyone else in the world don’t want the smoke.
The Dominican Republic, Guatemala, the contras wars, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Korean War, Libya?
Got it.
So we should solve all of the problems for you and the rest of the world bc we have the most money?
How does that sustain that money or benefit our sovereign citizens?
Sounds to me like you and the collective world want to bleed us dry for our money, resources, and as some sort of massive social experiment on complete socialism.
