The emphasis on Europeans hating Americans is utterly wrong for major parts of Europe.
Sure we do believe the stereotypes about “stupid Americans” but you’re loved as a nation in certain parts.
Poland for example is not only so happy to have US military presence but also glorifies America to a major extent.
Hell our government will probably bend over backwards to your will.
Not to mention we were one of few nations who was spending the established 2% of GDP on military.
It's entirely accurate.
Europe wants protection, no responsibility, and the political latitude to criticize the US at every turn.
I remember saying this shit ten years ago and being endlessly dogpiled for it.
Europe has been behaving like spoiled sheltered children.
... Thankfully we have had multi-ethnic militaries going back centuries, multi-ethnic military alliances going back as far, and we currently have the UN peacekeeping forces and NATO itself to look to for guidelines on how to create a cohesive multi-cultural military force.
