Colorado districts are picked by an independent commission.
Her district is not Gerrymandered, in fact it's mostly along county boundaries.
It's very rural and geographically large.
There almost zero gerrymandering in Colorado.
Who is MAGA?
Neither of these groups have an organization list of members.
Antifa stands for anti-fascist, of course, but there are people who demonstrate under the banner and declaration of being antifa.
Just like MAGA isn't a specific group either, but there are people supporting that as a type of group.
Are all Republicans, or conservatives MAGA?
Just like, is everyone who opposes fascism antifa?
You could even say the same thing about the Q idiots.
They're not an organized group, but are still a group identifiable by slogans, apparel, online posting, etc... Just because it's decentralized and autonomous doesn't mean it's not a political movement that people can recognize as being a distinct movement, by a distinct group of adherents.
You might say that MAGA has a leader, but does MAGA go away with Trump?
Hell, did MAGA even start with Trump?
