My prediction is that now that Trump has become dead weight, the GOP is going to quietly move to have him banned from office by giving the DOJ what they want.
Once he’s out of the way, both parties (with the exception of the progressive minority in the Democrats) are going to try to convince us that America has been cured of its problems and we can stop worrying.
Meanwhile, DeSantis and those like him continue making their way into positions of power, they keep slowly pushing draconian laws, the donor class gets what it wants, Kanye’s breakdowns distract everyone else, and the elites remain happy.
WHAT?
The same guy who mocked a handicapped journalist, a Vietnam War POW, said there were good people "on both sides" where the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee was protested by white nationalists or neo-Nazis, the guy who said he'd be dating his daughter if they were not related, the guy who bragged that he could shoot a man on 5th Avenue and not lose any supporter.....that guy?
Well, I am sure this will be the last straw!
