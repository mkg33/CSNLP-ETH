The saying goes: Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
The way Africa is handled by the USA specifically is essentially pointing at a corrosive river, screaming at the person to fish without a fishing rod (proper investment), forcing them to wade into it to fish (create wealth) with their bare hands and snatching that off them before they can even think of taking a bite, much less prepare a good meal (building appropriate infrastructure).
Fair trade deals, for a start.
Incentivise anti-corruption and pro-democratic progress with better deals.
Stop trading when slaves, child labour, or poor conditions are had.
Pay any reparations directly into projects that will develop infrastructure, including providing equipment and services.
Yeah, right.
Because the western world and specifically the USA are "teaching them to fish" by exploiting them for cheap labor, using them as a giant trash dump and instigating, amplifying and benefiting from deadly tensions.
