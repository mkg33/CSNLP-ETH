“Although food would not be impacted if Hall’s bill became law, medicine and science could be, since fetal cell lines can be used to develop and test drugs.
These lines can be collected from a single miscarriage or abortion, then replicated in labs, over and over again, for decades.
(Cell lines derived from aborted fetal tissue can be preferable, both because it’s easier to collect and because fetal tissue derived from a miscarriage may carry whatever genetic or chromosomal problem may have caused the miscarriage in the first place.)
Fetal cell lines have led to development of many major vaccines, such as the vaccines against chickenpox and Hepatitis A.

Technically, one company that is not even in operation anymore, Senomyx, patented some artificial flavorings that they used HEK293 cells to develop.
The HEK293 cells were used to develop a "proprietary taste receptor-based assay system” that would allow them to accurately make artificial flavorings and effectively reverse engineered the human palate.
These cells, like many research cells, originally come from an aborted fetus kidney in 1970.
Republicans are psychotic.
When will we take the kid gloves off and call republicans what they are?
Terrorists.
Racists.
Fascists.
Misogynists.
Liars.
They have shown themselves to be the enemy of free peoples.
When will we stand up and put them in their fucking place?
