We pushed the "capitalism rules" meme too hard in this country.
The "red scare" was a little too effective.
Eastern Europe is heavily supporting Ukraine and providing massive logistical and repair support.
They also donated large portions of their soviet era weapons which Ukraine already has and knows how to use and repair.
It doesn't get mentioned though because they're small counties.
Hard agree here; aside from potential benefits to American interests once the reconstruction process starts - the US has spent absolute pennies on the dollar in aid to Ukraine, for the result of absolutely eviscerating Russia's military.
Yes, Russia is still a potent military threat and the war is far from over.
But, before the invasion, the Kremlin had spent billions "modernizing" its armed forces to the hypothetical extent that they could take on NATO.
That Potemkin military has been destroyed at this point.
From an American perspective, this has been one of the best foreign policy deals we've ever done.
