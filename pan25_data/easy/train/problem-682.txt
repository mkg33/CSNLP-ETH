Such a dumb idea.
How does the logic work that says we ignore the will of the voters in our own state in order to oblige the voters in another?
And then to add insult to injury the basics argument is that in order to save democracy, we must ignore democracy.
So dumb.
Oh and yeah, it’s DOA with this SCOTUS.
Emergency injunction and never again sees the light of day.
Imagine the scenario when a Republican wins the popular vote and California, by virtue of this pact, is forced to award its electors to the Republican candidate.
I imagine that would be the end of the NPVIC.
Be kind of funny though.
It’s probably unconstitutional.
The constitution very explicitly forbids interstate compacts without approval of congress.
Yes.
A lot of people live in large cities.
Over 50% of the population lives in just 9 of the states.
What does that have to do with the point I just made that it does not make them all the same so their votes should not be diluted simply because they live closer together than other people?
