When Mexico lost present day Arizona and New Mexico to the US, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo guaranteed Mexican-American children education in their language, Spanish.
But the US isn’t known for keeping promises to its conquered peoples, and it did not take long for laws to change and [Anglo] public schools to become English-only instruction with textbooks that used derogatory messaging about Mexicans.
Catholic schools, however, continued to offer education in Spanish and taught Mexican history - and for many that was the only quality education they were really offered in their area because of segregation for a long time.
There is a reason Mexican American people have historically clung to religion, and insulting them further for their religious beliefs certainly isn’t going to win their votes.
Oh the young!
You have the numbers with millenials and Gen Z please use your numbers to take control from the failed boomers.
I am a boomer hoping you flex your muscle and make your future into something better than my generation managed.
The damage we are doing as we die off is just terrible.
