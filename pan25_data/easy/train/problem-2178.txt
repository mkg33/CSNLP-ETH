You are a young russian lad from bumfuck nowhere, central russia.
You finished school and since there aren't really any good jobs around you join the military.
After basic training you get assigned to a tank depot because you are somewhat mechanicly inclined.
The job is kinda shit though, pay is bad, conditions in the depot are rough and the depot commander is an asshole.
Since the depot commander is selling the fuel meant for regularly moving the vehicles and also pawns off replacement parts that are somewhat valuable you have a lot of free time since there isn't really much to do.
Seeing the commander make quite a few rubles on the side you also have an idea.
There isn't really much of value in these old tanks except for the copper wiring and that is fairly easy to rip out.
So you get your buddies in the depot on board, find a local scrap dealer and get going.
The tanks obviously aren't moving anymore but theser are old T-64, the last time they have been moved was 25 years ago so you figure no one will notice anyway.
UK intelligence reports.
They said recently that Ukraine was taking casualties in the low to mid hundreds per day.
I’d take that as 300.
But they’re obviously not publicising it, so as not to undermine Ukrainian messaging.
