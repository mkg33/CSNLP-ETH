Your opposition did something that you would have done?
Well clearly they didn't do it correctly or it came too early/too late.
Gotta make sure the goal posts are moved so that you can always be seen as the one who doesn't deserve criticism.
The US military industrial complex.
There's factions within the government.
Not necessarily a "deep state" but there's warhawks and doves.
Biden doesn't really want a war and has tried to prevent a lot of conflict, but concedes often enough that the warhawks can maintain a strong position.
It's probably nothing significant.
If it were, it would have been shot down way quicker.
The Chinese government said it's a research balloon that was blown off course and I honestly don't doubt it.
Why would they be using a giant balloon that's visible to the naked eye to spy on the US?
Satellites are insanely powerful.
It just doesn't make any sense that they would be using a balloon with the resources that they have available.
