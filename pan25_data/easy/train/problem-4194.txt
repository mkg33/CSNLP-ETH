I think the equivalent is a college final, but the professor informs you _what_ the final project is going to be on the first day of class, and tells you that you can work on it during the whole semester, but for whatever reason you wait until the night before the project is due, then whine that you couldn't turn it in.
Somehow, instead of failing you, the school decides to hold up every other class on campus, requiring all students, staff, and faculty to attend-- and to cover the upkeep, the school starts selling its land.

It’s absolutely ridiculous.
For the past decade at least, Republicans only goal has been to destroy faith in our institutions so they can point out how broken it is and how we need to vote them in to fix it.
They are 100% willing to let the government default so they can point to it and say it’s all democrats fault.
Doesn’t matter if it’s true or not.
Their constituents religiously watch a single “news” source that tells them exactly what to believe.
