But the EC could be nullified via the NPVIC, which can be adopted state-by-state, and just ratified by Congress via the normal legislative process.
It could be nullified by more states adopting the NPVIC and Congress ratifying it.
An amendment would be safer, because the Supreme Court couldn't claim it's somehow unconstitutional, and it wouldn't depend on enough states signing on or changes due to reapportionment, but nullification should work.
Yup.
Fun fact, I got bored one day and decided to make a spreadsheet of all the states, their population, EC votes, etc.
By my math, you can win 270+ EC votes with either 23% of the PV is you go for 50%+1 vote starting from the lowest population states, or about 29% of the PV starting from the highest population state.
Most people only focus on the former case, but this shows that the system really is broken no matter which way you cut it.
