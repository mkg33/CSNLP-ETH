Despite how bad trumps rhetoric was in terms of fundamental changes in policy his presidency had it was relatively little.
This isn’t really because he and the republicans were holding back but more because he simply wasn’t competent enough to organize an agreement in government.
Still most people assumed republic power wouldn’t really have much consequence even if they seemed crazy after Jan6th and roe v wade I feel like most know it’s not the case.
