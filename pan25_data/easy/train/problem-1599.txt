The league idea itself is not bad.
Everyone hates FIFA and UEFA, but they forgot how much everyone hates these greedy top clubs too.
And then they went and announced it in the worst way possible and told everyone else “fuck you, you’re not invited”.
Only to backtrack after the obvious backlash and propose a 20-team league but with built-in demotion protection for the main 12, as if that would go over well.
FIFA and UEFA suck, but don’t underestimate how greedy these guys from the largest clubs are.
They’re all the same.
There has been public fronts against FIFA from the German FA, Netherlands FA and a few more over Qatar and the way it is run, since this tournament is under 16 it won't get as much attention but if they were to do something similiar with the senior internationals I could definitely see something happening, most of the North American and South American countries would soon follow as well.
Are you kidding?
Rents in Tbilisi are through the roof.
There are plenty of Georgians worried about Putin declaring Georgia a Russian state similar to Crimea and Donbas due to the quantity of Russians residing in Georgia.
