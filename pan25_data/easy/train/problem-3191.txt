EDIT: buddy I replied to has a hidden comment saying he's got a cheap aca plan and that I'm a teenager who doesn't live in the US, believes everything on Reddit, or understand anything and that there are no minimum wage jobs in their town.

To which I ask how many hours of work does one need at $15/hour to afford a two bedroom apartment?
Just because you can get a cheap plan and jobs pay above minimum wage does not mean they won't bankrupt you if you have to go to a doctor or that you won't have to work multiple jobs to make ends meet.
