The Germans were also more willing to essentially use prototypes on the field because they were desperate.
A Me-262 looks futuristic, because it was at the time and was incredibly unreliable.
Its even worse when you look at the rocket propelled Me-163, nobody in their right mind would mass produce such a thing except a country desperate for a secret weapon.
This has the side effect of making them look more advanced vs countries that did not risk their pilots with machines that were not ready for mass production.
Absolutely agree.
I don't think NATO/the West would preemptively attack.
So, it's a matter of counterattack after a Russian 1st strike.
That 1st strike has the potential to be devastating.
So, it's a classic situation of mutually assured destruction to some extent.
If Russia doesn't wipe out conventional western forces, then we'd likely strike in force with conventional forces in response to a low yield nuke.
If it was a widespread attack that severely limited conventional forces, then you'd likely see a direct nuclear response.
Either way, it's a scary scenario for all.
