The closer Ukraine gets to Crimea though the more worried I'd be for putin to do something crazy, it seems very unlikely he survives to see Russian soldiers retreating from Crimea if an assault on Crimea ever did happen.
Love it.
With this statement and a little time to see how the Russians react to it.
Ukraine will make the best calculated move.
Will they start abandoning the lines in north east?
Will the make a move to solidify the east bank of the dnieper river?
Due to the vast and empty terrain it would be a suicidal mission.
I really love this statement.
Putin survives even if China alongside Japan decided to gobble some Russian territories, Czech Republic grabbed Kaliningrad and Ukraine seized Belgorod.
This really isn't true.
Crimea had its water cut off from the Dnieper since Russia occupied Crimea in 2014 and didn't have it turned back on Russia occupied Kherson Oblast in March of 2022.
Ukraine blocked off water to Crimea as soon as Russia occupied it back in 2014, and it remained that way until March 2022 when the Russian's got control over the Dnieper river.
They would block access to water because Crimea does get a lot of its drinking water from the Dnieper, it's more pressure, but this is something that Russia has dealt with in the past.
