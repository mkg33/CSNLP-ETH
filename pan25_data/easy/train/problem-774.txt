I think too many people are too quick to vilify those that surrendered, they simply don't understand that not everything is black and white.
Not everyone in the world sees the same way as you, there are many different cultures.
Just like the countless redditors who couldn't believe that some Ukrainian men didn't want to stay and die in a war.
Yeah it's good that there are plenty willing to fight, but I think it is fundamentally wrong to block men (or anyone) from fleeing the country and then requiring them to fight in a war.
People have a right to their own lives.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine have liberated around 3,000 square kilometres of land in southern Ukraine over the course of the past 24 hours, and have therefore increased the total area of liberated territory tenfold.
Well said.
If we learned anything from the war in Afghanistan, I think it should be that we cannot give liberty to another culture.
They have to want it so badly that a critical mass of the population is willing to fight and die for it.
