There is a perceived leniency towards Russia by the republicans, but it’s nothing more than a perception.
Other than a handful of MAGA losers voting against Ukrainian military aid (which can’t be directly attributed to a pro Russian sentiment), the republicans are as anti Russia as they’ve always been.
The only difference between now and the Cold War is that some think we should ignore Russia and focus on antagonizing China, whereas others think we should continue antagonizing both.
Good.
Dictatorships are inherently inferior at science and technological development.
The lack of freedom ultimately affects not only political expression, but the creative freedom needed to explore new avenues of science.
For decades, we've operated under the assumption that giving technology and trade to dictatorships will result in a healthy middle class demanding political reforms.
It is now beyond clear that this assumption has failed.
All we've done is empower the most brutal governments on the face of the Earth.
