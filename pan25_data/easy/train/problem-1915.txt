In the Roman Forum there was a random door on the side of a building about 20 feet up.
Some time in the dark ages people expanded back out through the city and found these walls sticking out of the ground so they added a door and roof and made it a church.
Then eventually we find out there's more stuff under all these walls and now the entire Roman Forum is unearthed.
It's super interesting and pretty amazing to see in person.
Really makes you realize just how freaking old Rome is.
Currently, the government and scientists are conducting a high-precision survey using terrestrial and portable laser scanners, terrestrial and aerial photogrammetry, drones, spherical cameras, and multi-spectral sensors of the region to create a 4-dimensional HBIM model (space and time).

Bronze is definitely not thrown away.
Metal before the Industrial Revolution is expensive.
People even used to pry apart marble columns just to get at the metal bolts holding together each piece.
Some of the most famous and well-preserved bronze artefacts were recovered from shipwrecks.
Finding on land an intact bronze statue of any significant size is exceedingly rare.
