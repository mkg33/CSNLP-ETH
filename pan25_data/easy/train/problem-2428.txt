The Canadian government wants to bring in large numbers of immigrants--and lots of people want to come here, this is why the population is growing rapidly.
As someone who immigrated from China to Canada, I have nothing against mass immigration into the country--as long as they build enough housing.
In the end, like the US, Canada has NIMBYism issues.
When you import lots of people, you need to build more houses to keep up or else prices go up, and it doesn't even matter much if mortgage rates stay high for a long time.
On the contrary, China is experiencing population decline and therefore, home prices will keep going lower there for the foreseeable future even if rates go to 0% and stay there forever.
"They" talk about it all the time.
It's not a secret that a good chunk of population growth in many developed countries, where the birth rate of generations-native citizens tends to be lower than the replacement index, is through immigration.
It's a fact of human behavior and economics that richer, more developed countries see their birth rates go down.
People increasingly find they don't need a bunch of children for whatever reason, or that they don't want children, or that they can't have children and maintain a lifestyle they like.
But that's not the case in poorer countries.
And when those poorer immigrants come over, generation after generation, their birth rate starts to trend towards their new country's.
