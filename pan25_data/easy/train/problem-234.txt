You are correct the two events are not equivalent.
But, that will not stop the GOP propaganda machine from saying otherwise.
The loss of life from the Benghazi attack was terrible.
There was an intelligence failure that cost lives.
What did the GOP do?
They attacked Hillary Clinton for years, they did the same with her emails and Hunter Biden.
False equivalencies, what-aboutism, is a tool used to undermine the authority and legitimacy of the other party.
In the last election, they claimed voter fraud when there was no proof.
Why would this be any different?
Only because trump and his supporters cant understand nuance and think missing some documents after leaving office is the same as intentionally stealing thousands of, many above top secret, documents and then intentionally withholding them and lying to investigators until ultimately your house has to be raided by the FBI because you won’t comply.
Same.
I’m in Ohio.
We are really considering moving to a bluer state, even if it’s just Michigan.
Eventually it’ll all get overrun by GOP so we are making a 10 year plan to get the fuck out completely because I have a daughter that needs to be able to make decisions about her own body.
It starts with abortion and it’s just going to snowball from there.
