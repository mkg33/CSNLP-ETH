I’ll copy my longer response below but the short answer is: manic phases can last for months to over a year.
And for people with “Bipolar 1 Disorder” (normal manic depression), there is no diagnostic requirement that they experience depression at all.
All a Bipolar 1 diagnosis requires is a manic episode lasting at least a week or requiring hospitalization, and many people with that diagnosis do not get depressive episodes (I personally do).
See my other comment below:
I'm unmedicated bipolar.
I've been working hard at it, so stuffs not so severe now, but I could get manic for a few days to a week at time before I crash and get depressed for a month or so.
Comparisons to Jesus, MLK, etc.
are forms of delusions of grandeur.
Mania can give a massively increased sense of self importance and an unfounded sense of greatness that are part of that.
Right now, Kanye is literally viewing himself as being on the same level of significance as MLK.
In the past, he has also compared himself to Jesus.
These are typical features of a manic episode and part of the grandiosity and inflated sense of self that goes along with it.
I think the important thing to realize is that Bipolar disorder isn’t an external disease like a virus, rather it’s just how his brain naturally works, so the fact that he made the mental leap to compare himself with MLK is consistent with that manic frame of mind.
