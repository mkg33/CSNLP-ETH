The situation was completely different 80 years ago, but the threat of nationalism is still real.
The Kremlin has worked hard for the past decades hijacking nationalist movements in foreign countries or sprouting their own movements that usually have the nationalists turning on their own countries governments.. Look at January 6.
Look at the NRA being infiltrated by Russian spies.
Look at the Spanish nationalists who were just instructed to try to overthrow their government by their Russian handlers.
It is a very real threat.
Nationalism has its place as a tool to liberate in wartime, but it is not a good ideology in peace-time, and will end up having destabilizing effects if left unchecked.
