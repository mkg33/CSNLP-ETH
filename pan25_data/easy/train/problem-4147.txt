How about, I don't give a fuck what the founders intended?
Whether or not it supports my view.
We could and should interpret the Constitution in a way that applies to society's needs today, not almost 250 years ago.
That's crazy.
“”State and federal courts historically have used two models to interpret the Second Amendment: the "individual rights" model, which holds that individuals hold the right to bear arms, and the "collective rights" model, which holds that the right is dependent on militia membership.
The "collective rights" model has been rejected by the Supreme Court, in favor of the individual rights model, beginning with its District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) decision.””.
Disagree.
Why would a skilled writer, with the context of a single sentence veer from addressing the rights of all people to addressing the rights of the militia?
Bottom line is “people “ are “citizens in the well regulated militia”, not Bubba with an ar15.
Madison would be appalled at how the imprecision of these words has metastasized.
