I feel that is short-sighted selfish to be frank, and whether or not my opinions on the matter change the situations outcome, this is an internet forum where I get to comment that i think that kind of gatekeeping of emotional processing is really lame.
It's almost as if you feel more empathy after becoming a parent because you now have to worry about you and yours which I get, but if I applied that through my own understanding of empathy, I would feel reallly fucking selfish and silly that it took me having to reproduce to fully feel like I could imagine whatever situation is happening to someone else.
So easy to say.
Yet, you'd be dead, as would your daughter.
Once you're dead, you no longer have a chance to do anything for her or anyone else, your existence is irrelevant to the world at large.
Death as it turns out is quite absolute.
Religious extremism, while brutal, is often capable of producing a functional society.
Look at Iran, without sanctions they'd be thriving.
Afghans are special in the sense of how pathetic they are.
You're ridiculous.
Life is cruel, we are built to survive no matter the cost.
We leverage that every fucking day, people sit on their high horses scoffing at what others have to do to survive.
It's very easy to feel superior and have the moral highground when your body isn't literally devouring itself.
