Cuba historically has always been in a disadvantaged position when it comes to its capacity for development, from it being a colony to spain, to then being a neocolonial arm of the United states and finally a dependent of the USSR, like you mentioned.
However, the social advances made on the island from point A to B can be observed even with the embargo, even with all the economic struggles, when we compare it from point A to B, and then compare it with its actual peers, meaning other caribbean nations and then even a lot of latin-american nations.
This is true.
I'm not trying to shit on Cubans when talking about their economy.
I think their problems are nearly all on the government side.
While Cuba is poor it's not a lawless hellhole like Haiti and frankly like a number of other Latin nations.
It also has okay access to heathcare for how poor it is.
For both of those things, you can check out the UNCTAD reports on Cuba, both tackling the extraterrioriality of the sanctions, the ways in which they make it difficult for cuba to import nescessary goods, and also this by fairfield university, which yes, is outdated in a lot of ways, but will show to you some of the concerns that are still applicable in relation to extraterritoriality and enforcement, and then also show you that it wasn't just "18 months", but rather that directly or indirectly restricting Cuba's access to dollars was a feature of the embargo for several administrations.
