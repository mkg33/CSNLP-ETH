For all the people worried about Bakhmut, this helps put it in perspective.
Ever since the Russians launched their first attacks on Bakhmut in august, the Ukrainians have liberated almost all of Kharkiv oblast, Izyum, Lyman, and Kupiansk, and are still pushing towards Luhansk oblast.
They liberated Kherson city and all the settlements north of it.
Honestly?
After spending a good amount of time on both of those subs I think you're actually correct.
Russian efforts around Bakhmut indicate that Russian forces have fundamentally failed to learn from previous high-casualty campaigns concentrated on objectives of limited operational or strategic significance.
Of course.
But unless you live in North Korea, every national culture has external influences.
And Russian cultural influence has now been wiped in Ukraine.
Congrats Putin for destroying any cultural influence your country had in Ukraine.
Now generations of Ukrainians are going to grow up rejecting Russian culture and embracing Western culture instead.
