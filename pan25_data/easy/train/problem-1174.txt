Sure there will always be some shit compagnies trying to abuse this new system as usual.
Compared to the "old" times, when technologies weren't what they are now, our work/life ratio has become so unbalanced that we went from "working to live" to "working to survive".
There is no incentive to work 40+ years of your life just to barely afford the necessities of life and I can't see this momentum of having to work huge workload for so many hours as we - as a society- currently do, for so little financial or free time rewards.
A LOT of the workforce is overworked, burnt out to the bone and clearly we reached the point where this economic system based on making the base of the pyramid do more for less only for the benefit of the top of the pyramid is not longer sustainable as - from this system's point of view - there can only be a top is there is a base.
And the base is crumbling, for good reasons.
Seems like their greed made them abuse their own system (oh surprising...).
Well, it's technically available anywhere.
Governments don't dictate the working hours of private companies.
You just have to convince your organisation to try it out for themselves.
