See I agree fifa bad.
Qatar not that good.
The issue is for me outside of soccer the so called western world don’t give a fuck.
I could care less about arm bands.
People who play go do what they love best.
They play for themselves and their country.
More corrections should of happened right after the vote.
Qatar can basically do whatever they want.
I struggle to support any place that doesn’t allow women and or lgbtq people to live similar lives to their cis male counterparts in all aspects.
It’s just so complicated.
Like I can appreciate someone wearing proper clothing in Islamic tradition.
At the same time I just don’t like how a woman can’t do x and y but a man can because Islam forbids it.
Just today I learned when you are on your period you basically stay away from religion as a woman during it hahahah.
Either way it’s amazing how these rich countries treat workers like shit.
It happens everywhere even in the west.
It just seems Qatar can’t even feel bothered to give a shit.
What would happen if we ran similar work schemes like Qatar?
Pay you like crap put you in camps.
Get no potential citizenship and no anchor babies?
I mean we are in debt like 90k+ per person in us.
Qatar is like green with like 1.4 million per citizen.
Seriously?
I understand the statement itself, you lower the tension before the match itself, make them focus on the match.
