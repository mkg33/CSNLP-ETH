As it stands folks in smaller states have way more say in presidential elections than the founders intended.
It would just be ensuring equal representation in the house, the Senate would still be tilted toward small states, and small states would still retain more political power per person through the electoral college, even if that edge is lessened.
If they had wanted this lopsided they would have made it this lopsided, they chose to give small states an advantage, and they would still retain power in the Senate that would balance out the larger states.
Also, check my flair, from a small state...I'm not saying we should disenfranchise small states, just saying voters in each state should have something close to the same electoral power...

The other guy suggested automatic voter registration.
Why is that insane?
It's not like they are being forced to vote.
They're just registered to vote if they want to.
