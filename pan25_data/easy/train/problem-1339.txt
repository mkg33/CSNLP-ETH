There are so many videos of Ukraine picking off soldier 1-3 at a time with drone dropped grenades or mortars along with plenty of tank and bmp explosions I almost think that’s a low estimate.
Russia is even saying “Kherson is still ours even tho we’re evacuating” frigging clown show in the Russian government.
Exactly.
If I were in charge, my plan for defectors would be to make them “casualties” and just slide them right into the forces without comment under a fake identity.
They’re dead to Putin, your force has mysterious extra power, and it’s a good incentive to defect.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
Say what you want about Russian soldiers but it’s very obvious majority of them would not be fighting if Putin didn’t force them to.
My grandpa barely survived the Vietnam war (both legs lost) and now my family tree has 67 kids/grandkids that are all now in the US and quite frankly living the American dream and contributing to society.
To think all of this happened because my grandpa was too stubborn to die in someone else’s war.
