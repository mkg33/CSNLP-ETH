Besides, my original point was only that if you believe aliens have visited us, you have to assume advanced technology, so you can't really claim such a craft would easily be shot down.
It's like saying someone shot down an F-22 with a bow and arrow.
Electrical systems?
That's a new one.
Calling bs on that specific detail.
edit: see thread below where I find I am wrong lol.
Also add, I don't believe this is 100% true (the kids who made abduction claims could have all made it up together, and I believe in that youtube doc there is something that could point to that, as one parent it sounds like was allowing kids to meet up at her house that was a safe space to talk about it), it's just that if you believe aliens and alien technology exists, it's ludicrous to claim an F-22 could shoot it down, and that what they shot down is probably terrestrial irregardless of what side of the aliens fence you sit.

Not too long ago someone brought up the idea we could colonize Venus' atmosphere using balloons to keep cities aloft.
