Jesus man, get off your horse.
I was drawing a comparison between the terrible shit Russia is doing to Ukrainians and the definitely-not-nearly-as-terrible-but-using-similar-general-strategy stuff private companies do in order to privatize public services.
Namely how Russia created the problem they're now claiming to be trying to "solve" by abducting these children and committing essentially cultural genocide if they manage to hold onto them and raise them as Russians rather than Ukrainians.
Identify a thing you want for yourself (Ukraine and its people), cause problem in/with the thing that you can then claim to have the solution for while ignoring/hiding that you caused the problem in the first place (invade country and blow up infrastructure, causing unsafe conditions for children and most likely a lot of orphans), implement the solution in a way that gives you what you wanted (abduct/relocate tens of thousands of Ukrainian children from occupied zones to raise them as Russian or at least pro-Russian).
Rape me?
Sure.
All day long.
Take everything I own?
Sure.
Kill the dog?
If you have to.
But to take my children… the flesh of my flesh… there is no physical pain you can inflict upon me that would cause a greater pain.
Absolutely not one thing.
Cutting my heart out with a rusted spoon and no anesthesia would bring less damage and less pain.
