I guarantee that if the Republican legislature had any control over when, whether, or how to implement the 2018 independent redistricting amendment, that amendment would have never been implemented or it would have been bastardised beyond uselessness.
Other states that have passed various ballot initiative laws have experienced this exact phenomenon, ranging from state legislatures not implementing the ballot initiative/purposefully delaying implementation (Missouri’s expansion of Medicaid) to state legislatures proposing confusing and misleading amendments to repeal or prevent passage of popular initiatives (Missouri and Mississippi) to challenging the validity of ballot initiatives in court (countless states, including Michigan).

Independent redistricting passed in Michigan in spite of a Republican legislature, because Michigan’s constitution provides for constitutional amendments via ballot initiative that automatically come into force and circumvent the legislature entirely.
