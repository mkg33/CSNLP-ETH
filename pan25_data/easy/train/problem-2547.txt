Bingo.
It's not only the brainwashed "conservatives" in this country that keep voting these assholes in, but a part of the problem.
Plus, to make it worse, several "corporate" Democrats on the left don't really support healthcare for all either.
The insurance companies can afford to lobby the politicians hard on this, while drowning out the opinions of a majority of Americans (who want universal healthcare).
Edit: Guys I just want to say thanks.
Even with the differences of views and conflicting information in some of the comments below this one no one became abusive, no name-calling etc, just a putting forth of views and following up with links for those who want to look deeper into it, so thank you for everyone who has/is taking part in the convo below for their civility so we can all learn something new and get a better understanding of the situation surrounding the war in Ukraine.
Yeah.
That's why I'm a firm believer in Socio-capitalism.
As in- when society is functioning normally, don't touch anything, but when poor disadvantaged people are being preyed on, getting hurt, we have to step in and help them.
