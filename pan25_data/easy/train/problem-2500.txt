> Honestly, I am skeptical there would be any way to end this 'gender war' without abolishing conscription system.
Of course, most 'feminist' group support abolishing it - but many of them also support 'tweaking' compensation as well, so it's hard for young men to see them in a good light, given that almost everyone expects that 'conscription system' will persist for at least decades.

Koreans love fighting to their death with divides that they created.
You think US political party division is bad?
Look into Korean politics it's a clown fest.
Absolutely.
I do not agree with the reactionary men here.
But I sympathise with them.
Korea is a hyper competitive society.
It's almost unimaginable how much pressure there is compared to the West.
This means everything from looks, dress, exams, job, etc.
They call it 'Hell Joseon' for a reason.
And young men resent having to give up 18 months (was 2 years until recently) in the prime of their life to live in an abusive military bootcamp that drives many to suicide.
I can see why that breeds resentment.
It's a complex issue.
I still think it is mostly reactionary nonsense, but I also understand (if not agree with) the resentment.
Exactly.
Thank you.
People are completely misinterpreting what's going on here, because these people call themselves "feminists," which leads normal westerners to think, "Oh, they just want equal treatment.
".
