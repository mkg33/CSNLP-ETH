Today was yet another pretty quiet day.
We had some country-wide air raid alerts, but it was just Russian MiG-31K as usual, which they mostly use to scare us, but also for reconnaissance, because apparently it is used in a pair with their AWACS aircraft.
Thereâ€™s a pretty high chance that the next big missile strike might happen in the next couple of days, because it will be orthodox Christmas soon, and they will almost certainly try to ruin it for us.
Interesting!
Previously analyses had stated offensives on both sides were waiting for freezing of soil.
Unfrotunately ISW has assessed previously that a delay would reduce Ukraine's momentum and allow for Russian forces to reconstitute.
There is none.
You're looking at it from the perspective of having standards.
If say US army sieged something and used infantry as part of the spearhead, it is because they believe they can succeed with their resources and with minimal casualties.
RU strategy is to throw warm bodies at problem until success, because they do not really care about casualties.
If at the end of a long line of Russian corpses there is victory, that is viewed as flawless success.
For US forces, that would be considered an utter failure, despite victory.
