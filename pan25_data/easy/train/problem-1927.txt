We don't even learn about that shit in Europe and I doubt you learn about that stuff anywhere in the world exept the middle east.
History normaly only teaches things your country was involved in or the region that is now your country.
As an example I am Austrian we learned all about medevil Europe espacily about the continent nothing about the Mongols or Britain we also learned nothing about China or Africa we than moved on to talk about 3 years of our 4 years history about ww 1 and ww 2 over and over and over again.
I imagine it is like that everywhere like Americans will probably learn over and over and over again about the American Civil War and Japanese people about sengokushidie.
Northam's draft had 400 pages.
Youngkin's has 68.
I haven't been able to find a copy of the previous 400 page draft but I'd be curious as to why there is such a big difference in the page count.
