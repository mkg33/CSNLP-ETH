Did you know that one of the lowest estimates of the civilian death toll from the American involvement in Afghanistan is about 50,000.
No wonder the rest of the world hates us.
We only lost like 6,000 people over there troops and contractors combined.
So go on and tell me about how that's over 100 years ago.
Go ahead and tell me about how when the Vietnamese people appealed to us in the 60s and we decided to side with their French overlords.
The Vietnamese had so much more in common with our original purpose during colonial times.
Yeah we went over there for our buddy's France and absolutely shit all over their civilians.
How about you tell me about Cuba how because of one person Fidel Castro we have completely destroyed their economy.
They have access to only the most basic technology and almost all their cars are old pre-sanction ones.
Do their kids deserve to starve?
Even though the Cuban missile crisis was over 50 years ago we(and our allies/those who want to trade with us) still have all these sanctions on them.
And when you think about the Cuban missile crisis it's really not all that crazy considering that we have actual nuclear sites in our submarines just below the waters all around the coastlines of our enemies.
I suggest you look in the mirror and also read more about history.
Not trying to justify China, just telling you that we're not necessarily all that much better.
Honestly?
There would be 5 layers of government management on their side of the project team.
The bottom person, who is responsible for overseeing the project, selects an client-side PM from an external consultancy who then manages the tender for a managing contractor.
