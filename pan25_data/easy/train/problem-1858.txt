lol.
Right now we only have one serious political party.
Our system of voting forces a two party system.
The republican party isn't going to just disappear if Democrats are in control for a while.
Saying we should be voting in democrats isn't the same as saying we want a one party system.
Attempting to overthrow the government and install the election loser as a dictator, going to the SC to try to allow local legislatures to ignore legal votes and install whoever they want, etc.
Stuff like that is very much a problem for democracy and is an attempt at creating effectively a one party state.
And until that is not what the republican party stands for, for the survival of democracy they must lose.
