In 2019 it was estimated that the breakeven price for Urals crude was around $49 a barrel.
This is below the $60 cap agreed by the Western powers.
So Russia can in theory continue to pump oil and make a profit.
The problems arise when Russia tries stupid games like insisting on payment being made in rubles or won't sell at prices within the cap price.
They have to keep pumping oil or the infrastructure will back up and literally freeze solid.
Then they're faced with the facts that their Western partners who built that infrastructure will have nothing more to do with them and that they don't have access to the skills or equipment to get things moving again.
So sad, never mind.
Because I do see some retailers claiming they can get you one for $1500 (and translating that to average purchasing power of a typical citizen - it's like 2-3 months of work just to get your phone) with 120 days delivery time since it's not officially sold anymore and it has to be pretty much smuggled in (good luck with your warranty).
GPU prices have also gone up through the roof.
