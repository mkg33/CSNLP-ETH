We knew all this but kept giving them favorable trade deals, letting them cheat monetarily, letting them steal stuff, and not challenging their Taiwan delusions.
We do this because weâ€™re greedy, but also because we have bought into the geopolitical theory that a globally enmeshed economy would be too big to fail, and that this would be the best way to ensure peace and money.
We know that they know this.
Imagine knowing any history of American foreign interventions in democratic governments and not realising why all American competitors in recent memory like the USSR and China have all been authoritarian.
The alternative would not have survived to become competitors, as history has shown how easy it was to coup democratic Iran but not Cuba.
The US has made a self selecting environment where if a country wants to be competitive with the US then they have to do some version off state surveillance or information control or risk coups when their nation interest clash with American business ones.
