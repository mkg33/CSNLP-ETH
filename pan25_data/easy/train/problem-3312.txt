Ukraine currently claims over 3300 tank kills.
A sizeable fraction of those have been independently confirmed.
And Russia has been putting tanks into the field that are decades old, like the T-64.
I don't think you're going to find a single source with exact stats, but the overall picture it paints is that yeah, they have lost half in a year.
The good half mostly, no less.
The accusations from Russia will never equal the simple fact that there was no legitimacy for their invasion of Ukraine and even less for their use of terror and indiscriminate killing of Ukrainian civilians.
Russia is getting it's ass handed to them and they desperately want their people to believe that there is an excuse beyond, "Our military is incompetent, our leadership is corrupt and Putin is a fucking failure.
".
If Ukraine starts taking Russian territory, that will be an extremely threatening situation for all living people, because that could be enough to result in Putin using a tactical nuclear weapon, which Western countries would be forced to respond to, which could lead to the use of strategic nuclear weapons, which could kill all of us.
Some people think there's a chance that Putin might even use nuclear weapons if Ukraine starts retaking Crimean territory (which he claims is Russian territory).
Elon Musk definitely seems to be worried about that, which seems to be why he announced a couple months ago that the Starlink satellite communication system that the Ukrainian military is dependent on would be disabled in Crimea, which will significantly hinder and disrupt the Ukrainian military when it does try to push into Crimea.
