Yeah, she was very much qualified.
Her resume was impeccable.
Her ambition is unparalleled.
Your greatest strenh is sometimes also your biggest weakness.
Clinton was such a targeted calculating perfect candidate she lost points for being too political-machinery-ish.
For example, she didn't support gay marriage until the polls said she could.
That might be good politics, but it is not good leadership.
She apparently had the entire DNC beholden to her, and there were many down-ballot races lost in 2016.
That's good politics, to get all the money for your big race, and her race was the most important, but it wasn't great leadership.
She had the DNC wrapped around her finger, and to be honest, we all started the year willing and hoping to support her.
But when it came out how the DNC lacked neutrality in their own primary, and even said as much when sued, it really hurt her and the entire party.
When everyone blamed Russia/ WikiLeaks for telling on the DNC instead of owning up to the bias (except in court), it really left people questioning the leadership here.
Resume, great.
Ambition, top of the class.
Leadership... C-.
Americans (regardless of party affiliation) actually like progressive policies.
So when someone who looks like them, talks like them, and champions the policies they want... it's a slam dunk.
