Their revolution has happened already, essentially.
As detailed in the amazing book Dark Money by Jane Mayer, the ultra rich have spent decades transforming higher level education at top universities as a way of influencing the next business leaders of America.
Same.
I think people have some kind of rose-colored glasses about the past.
There's plenty of garbage in this decade, but it's never been better than now.
We see conservatives harping on trans rights and bathroom preference like it's some crazy regression.
Trans rights were not even a topic of polite conversation among liberals 30 years ago.
Conservatives have nearly stopped talking about gay rights.
And I also see this constant dread over the miserable economy based on the same completely mythical version of the past when everyone was rich.
We've weathered some incredible disasters and government policy was just extremely effective and preventing the kind of pain that occurred in past downturns.
Shit happens and will continue to happen, but we're dealing with it better than ever.
