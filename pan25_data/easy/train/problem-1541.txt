I've got a down the street neighbor, 28 or 29 year old Russian girl who came to the U.S. with a modeling career and married an American.
She's been in full support of everything from the civilian killing to the assaulting women.
When asked about the assault she said "It's war.
The Russian soldiers fight for their country, they are entitled to the women of their enemies.
It's just sex anyway."...
Then there is a Russian guy over here for work who always works out and showers and eats breakfast at the club at the same time I do every morning.
The news will be on, and he'll go on rants about how if a country can't hold its land then it doesn't deserve it, and Ukraine is only able to hold because other countries hold for it, before going on to say how they should just wipe out entire cities, men, women, and children alike to win once and for all.
Dude even has family in Kiev, who at this point he'd see die with the rest of them because "they have showed their true colors resisting Russia"...
"Accident".
Good one.
If this is true, Russia is the second country in history to use nuclear power in a war.
Because that is what you get when you throw artillery at a fing nuclear power plant.
