My thoughts exactly.
I would be shocked if NK hosting it would net any different results than the current one.
A bunch of hoopla leading up to it ("20 people died per minute for this event" or whatever the stat would end up being that nobody will care about) and then nearly everyone just watching the ball be kicked around anyway, resulting in the money pouring in, and FIFA just doing whatever it wants because, you know, soccer.
I don't know how you change it, but I do know that it won't magically change because it's hosted in NK after what would be a very lucrative and calculated decision with likely no negative outcome other than the same continued paradoxical hatred of FIFA.
I agree.
I also think that the type of story plays a role in the perceived reliability of eye-witness accounts.
If an eye-witness is describing first hand accounts of documented events, I am much more likely to believe them than somebody describing an event that they are the only documented witnesses of.
To be clear, I’m not saying that eye-witness accounts are more or less reliable depending on the kind of information they’re offering.
I think that for the most part, eye-witness accounts are merely something that should be used to spark interest in a subject.
I don’t think they should be used as evidence or be taken as fact until something objective has been established.
