My teen daughter likes to watch YouTube shorts.
We've told her that it's really easy to have your feed devolve into right-wing nonsense.
She got a glimpse into that recently.
She liked one video about a woman in China who got abandoned at age 2 by her parents during one child policy, became successful, and then refused to buy her younger brother an apartment so her parents sued her and won.
Within a day her feed was full of Let's Go Brandon shit that she had to thumbs down to get rid of.
Had to explain to her that the cycle of xenophobic hate starts with one thing that seems innocuous and common sense, then slowly eases you into more and more hate.
It sucks, but thankfully she's a smart kid and has always been a champion of the downtrodden, so she just rolls her eyes and moves on to the next video.
I still worry about the kids who aren't as savvy, don't have parents who pay attention to their social media consumption, and are more susceptible to indoctrination.
It's just so easy to fall into that trap.
If nothing is verified, then any politician can claim they won and represent themselves as the rightful Senator/Governor/congressmen etc.
