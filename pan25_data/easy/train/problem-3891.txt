But yes, to the point you’re trying to make, if a living, breathing, walking, talking human were physically connected to my body and needed to sustain that physical connection to survive, I would not be morally obligated to maintain that connection even if it resulted in the death of that person.
Bodily autonomy is why organ donation, bone marrow donation, and blood donation are opt-in and not mandated.
No one has any obligation to be pregnant if they don’t want to be, no one is obligated to donate an organ to keep another human alive if they don’t want to, no one is obligated to donate blood to save human lives if they don’t want to.
In the US there is already legal precedence for this with , in which a man sued to force his relative, a suitable bone marrow donor, to donate bone marrow, and it was ruled that a person cannot be compelled to undergo a medical procedure on their own body to save another person’s life.
And bone marrow donation is LESS RISKY than pregnancy is!

Former embryologist here: that's also scientifically completely murky.
This doesn't factor into anti-choice laws of course, but no one can say definitively when consciousness starts.
It almost certainly is later than when cardiac cells start pulsing, because most neurons aren't made by then and they're not connected in synapses at that point.
