Trump never wanted to win.

Trump expected to lose and become a Fox News heel to rage against Hillary.
Just look at him the moment that's not the face of a man that achieved the victory he wanted after two years campaigning to make America great.
That's the face of a petulant child that's suddenly had responsibility thrown on his shoulders after decades of getting by on his obscene wealth.

Arkansas resident and an unapologetic lefty progressive here.
As far as Republicans go Asa Hutchinson is far from the worst.
If his profile becomes more well-known he could become a force in 2024.
He is not an extremist or a craven publicity hound in the mold of Trump or DeSantis but rather an old school "nice guy" conservative Republican.
His appeal to the quiet undecideds would be huge.
I would never vote for him but for those centrists tired of inflammatory rhetoric he could certainly be their voice.
