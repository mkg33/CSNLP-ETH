Independent state legislature theory has a glaring inconsistency in that even its advocates acknowledge that the state's governor would still always have veto power over any state legislative decisions regarding federal elections, presumably because that check is just part of the standard process by which legislated things become law.
But, court review is also, obviously, part of the standard process which determines whether legislated things can be enforced or not.
So just what the hell kind of absurd carve out are these clowns trying to create here?
They apparently want to cherry pick which checks and balances are allowed?
This is just disingenuous gaming, transparently aimed at weakening our democracy.
This is the key.
Congress has become irrevocably broken when House seats were locked.
Every state gets one rep just for showing up.
But high population states now eat each others representation due to the fixed seat count.
Nobody.
He’ll do what he wants and if someone doesn’t like it they’re either racist or bigoted or a left wing extremist.
