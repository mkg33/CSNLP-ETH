Didn’t Israel actually attack Iran’s military sites like a few weeks ago?
I don’t think Israel is threatening anymore, they might actually become serious with this especially because they have done a lot of stuff in the background that many people don’t know w/ Mossad in their quest to prevent Iran from getting a nuke.
What?!
Iran has death squads around the globe, Iran is a main destabilizing force all across the Middle East: Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, Turkey, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, and now it is the main supplier of weapons to Russia in Ukraine, Iran supports extremism across the Muslim world and is the main supporter to the most totalitarian regimes from North Korea to Syria.
Iran with nuclear weapons would be a huge threat to any western and moderate Muslim country.
Saudi Arabia?
Same with Iraq I doubt they'd be supportive of letting Israel fly fighter jets over its territory.
They probably wouldn't want to be involved in the fight due to that.
And even if they do allow it the jets would have to fly over a wide open area, which has a large amount of radar coverage.
