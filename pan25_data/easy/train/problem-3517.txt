I'm not saying they didn't.
I'm saying they're still thinking the methods used 80 years ago, still work in a modern world, against a military armed with modern equipment.
That's resulting in a ton of dead young Russians.
Again.
Leaving aside the "terror" aspect of bombing civilian targets, at least the carpet bombing of WWII did impact Germany's military industrial capacity, but Ukraine is getting most of its new equipment from outside its borders.
Seems correct.
Also you would guess that Russia uses the energy infrastructure attacks to aid their other evil plan of the mass migrations and forced migrations, moving Ukrainian kids out to the far east, while offering tons of money for Russians to settle in annexed regions, trying to replace the demographics instead of defeating them, same tactic China often employes in its planned, long term annexations (such as Tibet.
).
Refugee crisis seems plausible too, because that also leads to destruction of economy and mobilisation reserves.
Kinda same final effect + letâ€™s be real, not nearly all, not even half of these refugees will return in foreseeable future.
