None of those are likely to expand into a larger war.
Russia has expended far too much of their military already.
They can't afford to open new fronts.
And, yes, how many people our planet can support depends on more variables than just the number of people, including logistics, fertilizer availability, natural resources (like fish in the ocean, like a sustainable life style for everyone (including using less meat and fewer to no fossil fuels), climate as a whole (imagine another little ice age happening - or global warming getting out of hand) and who knows what else.
Why??
It literally doesn’t matter.
If a world war pops, I’m going to be blown to bits by nukes like everyone else.
Why should I stress about it in the meantime?
Israel and Iran are relatively small military powers.
Iran is currently experiencing large internal protests.
No.
But fertilizer shortages cause a reduction in food production, which leads to hunger.
The land can only support so many humans - more with fertilizer, less without.
