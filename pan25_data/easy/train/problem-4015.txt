His sister living in the apartment he listed as his home adress in Queens, is facing eviction charges for not paying over 50k in rent over the last two years.
Court date is in February.
meanwhile another politician is golfing today with no concerns about criminal liability.
srsly, wtf is taking so long?
it's been two years since t\\\\ was recorded asking for 11,000 votes.
his business was found guilty of what?
tax fraud?
why is he still free?
what about stormy daniels?
what about the sexual harrassment case(S???
)?
I doubt he is in that much actual "limbo" with the Brazil charges since we don't have really much of a track record of extraditing really anybody to other countries to my knowledge, especially U.S. citizens.
These charges started to resurface right around the time their fascist ex-President/wannabe dictator was seen hanging out in Florida (not that the two are really related) which I think kind of shows that we are not going to be quick to act to remove/blick or prosecute/extradite folks that other countries may currently not like since various nations could move to do the same against pretty much any American for so many reasons in retaliation.
