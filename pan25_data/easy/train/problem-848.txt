First: We did resist.
Since the start of the war and throughout 2022, the police in Russia arrested almost 20,000 opponents of the war.
According to human rights groups, protests have taken place almost every day in different cities since February 24, 2022, and only 18 of those days have passed without arrests and detentions.
Against this background, we have seen astonishing examples of civil courage.
For instance, Vladimir Rumyantsev, a provincial fireman, got three years in prison for building a ham radio to broadcast reports against the war, while Alexei Gorinov, a member of the Moscow city council, got seven years after he called for a minute of silence during a meeting of that chamber to honor the Ukrainian children who had been killed.
I'm afraid you are missing the point.
If any free state did a 180‚Å∞ turn and invaded a neighbour, the people of said state wouldn't have it.
Instead ask yourself if you would come to Russia and speak out.
Of course, you have no idea how many people would come with you.
That's always a problem.
And what would it change, you might ask yourself.
They will just throw me in jail.
Besides, it is not your country, let someone else do it.
And so on and so forth.
Also, every Friday Russian government announces a new list of "foreign agents" - musicians who publicly said something against the war (the last one was Zemfira), academics, theater actors, organizations, fighters for LGBT-rights, etc.
P.S.
And you know what's the most terrifying?
When you finally do it, and you're realising that you're alone.
Because there are no leaders - they are all long in jail, and all the people who could have been with you were already detained before you arrived.
And you realise that next they come for you.
This is what the protest looks like in a fully totalitarian regime with unlimited police resources.
