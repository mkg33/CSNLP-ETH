tbf its actually fairly likely, the system out-ranges much of what Russia has in theatre and Ukraine know how valuable they are so HIMARS are rarely being deployed outside of areas with good AA coverage so Russian aircraft cant hit them and even with their range advantage its a system purpose built to shoot and scoot.
Oh no!
Russia's threatening violence after illegally invading a sovereign nation as part of a land grab?
I guess we probably shouldn't send the tanks after all, right guys?
/s.
The UK just doesn't have that many spare tanks to send, since defence planners have (possibly unwisely) spent the last few decades assuming that the main job of the British Army is going to be fighting insurgents alongside the USA, and training local militaries, and spent their money accordingly.
"Tea time".
"C'mon man - just 3 more rus tanks then we'll stop."
"No need to stop - Brits thought of everything.
Just hit that button for the kettle, and keep firing" "Do we by chance have some food?
Feeling peckish".
"Yep Press that button for some hot biscuits" "Damn right These tanks are awesome!
".
