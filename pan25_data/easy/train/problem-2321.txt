A Ukrainian documentary called "Рік" (A year) was published yesterday, where Zelenskyy, Zaluzhny, Budanov, Reznikov, Syrsky, and others talk about many things, including the first days of the war.
Zelenskyy showed where he lives, and the place where the military decisions are made is also shown.
Zaluzhny shared how a 4-year-old boy asked him if they will return to Mariupol and Zaluzhny answered: "Yes, this year.
".
Almost as if they have a networked system where counter artillery radar can directly digitally transmit the Excalibur artillery round programming solution directly to a group of motorized artillery units which operate in unison with one moving, one on standby and one reloading meaning they can always have one gun ready to fire.
Seeing as the radar can pick up arty rounds quite early in their flight and fire solution is transferred digitally and the round programmed automatically one should be able to fire off a GPS precision guided round back towards an enemy artillery position before the enemy artillery round has even struck its intended target.
