Republicans have been running against the "woke" agenda for several decades by now, it's just that what "woke" means changes with the decade.
Typically Republicans run against the culture war issue, whether it's anti-bussing, anti-school integration, anti-gay, anti-trans, or whatever.
Then, because Republicans don't actually care about the latest culture war issue, they horse-trade the culture war for lower taxes on the rich and other concessions once they win.
This horse trading serves two purposes, it gets Republicans what they want, but it also, strangely enough enflames their base, as their base goes even harder on the newest culture war issues, even as they concede the previous culture war issue.
The problem isn't the anti-woke agenda, it's that Republicans are now electing true believers These modern Republicans have been raised in the culture war agenda, and actually believe it As a result, instead of horse-trading the culture war like previous Republicans, they're doubling down It's the radicalization that's biting them in the ass.

Old white people, man...she was absolutely sure going back to my minority-majority school would be unsafe for me because "the blacks are attacking whites because BLM is pushing that".
