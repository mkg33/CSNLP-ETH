Weapon deliveries always take YEARS.
The weapons that the United States sold to Taiwan under George W. Bush took 4 years to deliver.
And thatâ€™s not taking into account the pandemic or the war in Ukraine.
Those political considerations are backed with economic.
Taiwan produces much of the key chips that China's economy needs so badly.
China wants to control that although it also acts as a bit of a brake on an attack.
Russia wants to control Ukraine to limit Europe's access to alternative energy sources so that they can blackmail the EU.
Totally.
They need anti air to protect the anti ship and anti tank.
If China is allowed to achieve air superiority, Taiwan will be extremely difficult to defense.
Land-based anti ship will be important to keep the massive Chinese fleet to carry out effective coastal bombardment to stage the amphibious landing before external helps can arrive.
No.
The USMC is transitioning towards being a littoral force for the western pacific.
Abrams aren't that useful when your job is landing on islands and fighting through jungle to secure landing zones.
