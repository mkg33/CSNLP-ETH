Also, Republicans consistently poll terribly among Millennials and Gen Z, who see Cons as scary, bigoted, and hostile to every political policy (climate change, taxing the wealthy, government funded healthcare, corporate accountability, etc) both demographics care about.
Not to mention the Cons offer these demographics absolutely nothing of worth, policy wise.
This could change if they move toward the Left and start trying to be real policy makers, but they had that chance after Romney lost to Obama and chose to double-down on BS.
