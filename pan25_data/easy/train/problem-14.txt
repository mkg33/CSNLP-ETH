I don't know if the 14th amendment route is smart given the current Supreme Court but it sure should be in the Constitution that Congress can't pass one law saying the executive must spend X dollars while another says the executive branch can't borrow X dollars to pay for the thing they must do.
Yep.
Pisses me off when people get angry about this because “it’s not anybody’s place but hers to decide when she wants to step down” or “she was a champion or women’s rights”, “integrity of the court”, or whatever else.
Like yeah, no shit, it’s her choice - she had been sick for a long time, she knew there was a substantial risk of her dying at the wrong time and being replaced by a right wing extremist, she had an extremely easy way to safeguard against that, but instead she chose to roll the dice and she lost.
For literally no gain, too.
Was her legacy really improved/altered by her last few years on the court?
No, not at all, her legacy was solidified decades ago.
If anything she ruined her legacy, as her actions directly handed free reign to extremists who are doing their damndest to dismantle everything she ever stood for.
