Russia would spend a day bleating about how they're gonna nuke the whole world, check their nuclear readiness and find their ICBMs can't make it out of the silos, attempt to launch anyway, and irradiate Russia beyond habitability for a century or so.
Way too small.
These are akin to the US Hellfire missile, with a 6.3kg warhead.
These are meant for small vehicles.
It might be worth it anyway, given the conduct of Russia and the undue level of suffering they're intentionally causing to Ukraine's civilians, and how it's unlikely that putin's successor would want to carry on a war that's already lost, but even so, a move like that would come with a longer term strategic consequence.
As I said, we are not perfect.
Nor are our peers, I'm sure.
That said, sometimes what you really need is a laser guided missile with a range of 50km that can be remotely guided from the comfort of a command bunker on the other side of the country to turn a specific enemy tank into a pile of flaming wreckage.
And on that needful day, we make a very good friend indeed.
