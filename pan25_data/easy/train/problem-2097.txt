so the group of assholes can choose to ignore him or authorize a higher minimum payment, but there's nothing about the debt ceiling that will prohibit them from using the card to their hearts desire.
as it is written, the debt ceiling is more like theres a company where a whole group of people have access to a no limit company credit card, and there's one guy in charge making the minimum monthly payments, but how much he can pay back is a set amount.
so each time the other group of asshole are going crazy on the credit card, the minimum payment is going up and this one guy is like, 'hey, the minimum is higher this month, either increase how much i can spend or we'll miss the payment.
'.
He is right but how do you fund government services like justice, defence, and education when their constituents (corporations are people too my friend) want the necessary taxes to pay for those services reduced year after year.
It absolutely is a farce.
I've been saying this for years, the national debt ultimately does not matter.
