As someone who works in Recruiting let me tell you: That's not true.
The reality is even more ridicolous.
Also, the 'ageing demographic' is also happening in Canada, USA, Australia, Japan, basically every developed country.
How?
Lmao.
The AI would be made, programmed, and repaired by a mega corporation with government contracts, political connections, and shareholders looking for dividends.
Yes.
A significant chunk of the German labor force is either not in their “learned” field, in early retirement, or working part time.
For example: there’s a shortage of teachers… because so many teachers have left their positions because it’s so shitty.
Ditto for nurses and even some doctors.
Especially since the labor shortages are so bad currently because during the height of the corona crisis instead of using the for the crisis easy to use "Kurzarbeit" (I don't know the english term, it's when you can reduce the weekly hours but the employee gets part of the lost money from the state) and instead fired absolutely everybody that wasn't needed to keep the company going while there was very reduced business and now that the market is growing again the applicant market is extremely low because - surprise - every company now realizes that they will need the people they fired again when they want to do the work they did pre Corona.
Why?
They’re not going to pay you anything.
Germany doesn’t have a labor shortage, they have a cheap labor shortage.
Unless you want to earn $7/hour after taxes, you’re not missing anything.
