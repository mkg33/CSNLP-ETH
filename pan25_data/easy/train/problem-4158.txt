People don't understand how this works.
If we say it's alright for an American to sue a foreign head of state for anything, it opens the door for everyone else to do the same thing to us.
It's been this way forever, but suddenly, it's a mark against Biden or a giant conspiracy involving basketball.
People are fucking stupid.
One of the biggest and easiest things the US could do to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels is the conversion of our power grid from fossil fuel power plants to nuclear with supplementary wind, solar and hydroelectric wherever possible.
More than 60% of our national power supply comes from the burning of fossil fuels, that is not at all necessary and hasnâ€™t been for decades.
The burning of fossil fuels for power generation in the US accounts for over 30% of our yearly carbon emissions, that in and of itself should be the biggest motivator for a move.
The fact that it would make gas for combustion vehicles (which are still necessary for the moment) cheaper as well as make the cost of electricity cheaper as well are just huge bonuses on top of that.
