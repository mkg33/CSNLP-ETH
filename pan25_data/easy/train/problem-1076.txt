I've unfortunately started using facebook more and more because I'm turning into an old fart and it's where we go.
Anyway, I keep getting random right wing shit popping up on my feed and I've made a hobby of jumping into the comments and getting involved with crazy right wing boomer arguments.
It's like crack, I can't stop myself.
Brexit was about Nationalism.
Saying you voted for it based on one of the appallingly transparent lies, is like saying you supported the Nazis because the trains were always on time.
If you are in the same club as the fascists, guess what?
You are one of them.
No evidence at all, and nothing in the act itself, indicates an organising intelligence greater than a single emotionally disturbed individual of rather moderate intellectual capabilities.
Oh I just do it for entertainment.
I tried to cinvince some old right wing bloke screaming about immigrants in Britain that Mongolia dislodged itself in the 1950s and spent a few years as a pirate ship country floating around the sea before accidentally popping back into place.
I don't think he believed me but it was fun all the same.
Suggesting that everyone who voted Brexit is a fascist sympathiser is not a reasonable contribution to our political dialogue.
Please donâ€™t foster division like this or discourse will only get worse.
