I had a cousin who committed suicide with a handgun, after a bad breakup.
I believe he might still be alive had he not had a gun in his home that night.
I had a conversation with a guy I used to hunt with who told me he had his wife in the sights of his .30-06 when she was sitting on her porch after the divorced, He said he heard his daughter voice and that stopped him from pulling the trigger.
My best high school friend told me he pulled a gun on a homeless guy who approached his car.
The guy was not being threatening other than asking for change, but he "looked mentally ill" He did not even touch his car.
But he felt threatened, and had a gun so he showed it.

However.
My life, my logic, and plenty of people who have studied the topic have come to the conclusion, more guns lead to more violence.
I don't think it is an unreasonable concept, nor do I think it is, even for a gun rights supporter, one that defies logic if you look at it objectively.
