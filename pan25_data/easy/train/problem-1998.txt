I watched a short documentary today which argued that the only reason fascism hasn't been successful since its defeat in World War 2 is that economic conditions have not been harsh enough.
i.e.
That conventional marching-through-the-streets-in-uniform fascists can only be successful if people are facing starvation and cold.
No they wonâ€™t.
This happens every time.
They make insane threats.
We freak out.
The government shuts down.
We freak out some more.
The economy tanks.
The fed uses tricks to keep servicing debt.
The market takes another dip.
We freak out.
The repugs cave.
But in the long term even with all these antics that destable the US economy that only Republicans pull for some reason the country as a gestalt sees them as better on the economy because "America" and they think social spending and taxing companies will hurt the economy, I mean just ask Europe ... Oops.
That's the yes.
The recent popularity of fascist ideology within the GOP and the fact that fascism is so dependent on desperation will, I think, put a very different colour on the budget battles to come in comparison with the shut down threats of the Obama era.
Will some of the more hard-line Republicans welcome a shutdown as an opportunity for their Proud Boy friends and similar groups to gain ground?
