Gender is how you identify yourself in society, so it makes sense that some people want more than 2 options.
If it brings that many problems and the govt wants to make things easier, why even ask people their gender (especially if you need to choose out of given options)?
Just ask their sex.
Why did people start asking gender, if all they want to know is one's assigned in documents sex?
Then why does it matter what gender you are?
Just give sex boxes.
Why add a gender option, if gender is how YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF, not your sex.
Not like there are 2 options possible, so why even ask such information (especially via boxes)?
Just ask their sex.
No, they won't, because as anyone with actual archeological expertise knows, determining accurate information solely from heavily degraded bones is a fucking joke.
This.
