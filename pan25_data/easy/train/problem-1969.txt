Tl'Dr: You kind of said it yourself, other groups differ, so take observe thimgs where they diffet and see if those are actually your local (assuming bit here of your cultural area) quirks, instead of some mystical universal default.
Basically if mostly all other larger groups seem to have their own cultural quirks, compared to "ones who as group do not have any, but from who those other groups can stilm be told apart from their quirks", it usually is just sign that that group's quirks have been normalized very heavily in observer's mind, to point where they just do not spot them, does not mean they are not there.
Uh... no?
Unlike most other religions, Judaism is an ethnoreligion- so that's one of the few where it can be said that an individual is Jewish culturally but not religiously, this cannot be said for Christians and Muslims, as belief in God/Allah is a prerequisite.
You literally can't be Christian without believing that Jesus Christ is your lord and savior and believe in an all powerful God.
