I became a lawyer and went into practice with the belief that my peers were intelligent.
I held SCOTUS in such high regard.
Then I began practicing and realized most lawyers are book smart, and although intelligence is important, most of these schmucks couldn’t find their way out of an empty barn if the doors were wide open and they were walking towards the exit.
Yes!
I thought I was the only one growing up that thought you had to be the absolutely best and smartest person to run the government.
How naive we were.
I can see it as like Cartman getting a massive balloon and then trying to see if Kenny would float and it gets out of hand and it cuts to like the csi and an agent reporting to his higher up and it cuts to him with a shocked face and he picks up his phone and calls who ever and say something about it being a Chinese spy balloon and they try to get it down by sending up a balloon of their own and it gets blown away and later the balloon ends up over china.
Probably not the best plot or idea but I can just see it being an incident caused by Cartman.
Politicians?
Maybe.
Managers and leaders as a broad generalization?
Completely disagree, it sucks that maybe you haven’t been surrounded by these people, but they exist.
