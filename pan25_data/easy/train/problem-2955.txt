One thing you need to understand is that Erdoğan is up to his neck with this shit.
It's all about him getting a hold of people, and them getting a hold of him back.
The current cabinet is full of narcos.
The former prime minister's son and current interior minister is accused of serious drug trafficking.
These ties created through political favors really incapacitate Erdoğan because they can drag him down with them.
Erdoğan probably knew about the coup, played it along, and wiped them off of the army along with what little remains of loyalists because sectarians appearing as loyalists gave him a reason.
Remember what I said earlier.
And after all this, you'd think he would wise up and stop fucking with sectarians, or wipe them as well.
He actually replaced these new enemy sectarians with different sectarians who are miniscule in power in comparison to Fetullah.
Cry me a river.
Incompetent american leadership should ve not ally itself with the rebranded PKK.
They ll get stomped and all you can do is moan about it.
