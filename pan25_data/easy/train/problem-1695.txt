Yes, they are celibates but preach about sexuality, they are single and preach about marital love, they are man and preach about women’s rights to abort… the list goes on and on… and I was raised a catholic but happens to be in a mixed school with fairly progresist priests and the thing that always baffled me is that you read the New Testament Jesus is preaching a very leftist socialist approach (love each other, take care of prostitutes homeless and those with ilness, etc…) but then the actual Church as an organization is a shithole… it’s sad, they are hipocrites that preach the opposite of what they’ll do, and I have no doubts that if real (I’m an agnostic now) Jesus will punish all of them for all their shittiness (not gonna happen but I can dream).
Two reasons.
One, priests don't attract attention for being unmarried, so it's historically a convenient place to hide if you're gay or a pedophile.
Two, and more importantly, children in general are incredibly vulnerable and society as a whole is extremely bad at looking out for their interests.
While the consequences of getting caught are sometimes dire, getting away with molesting or raping a child is usually pretty easy, since most parents don't trust children to be honest about their own needs and don't teach them about consent (though this is changing).
Predators nearly always get caught because they don't stop at one and eventually slip up or get sloppy.
