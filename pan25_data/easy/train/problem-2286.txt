> More than half the respondents to the American organisation’s survey did not know six million Jews were murdered and 29% believe the death toll was below two million.
Easily.
"The education system" isn't really a single system.
There are just over 17,000 public school districts in the US, and that's not counting the private schools.
All of these are pretty independent.
There are efforts at the state and national level to standardize things, but a lot of that consists of nudges rather than outright dictating what must be taught and how the school must be administrated.
Exactly.
You can know that many Jewish people were killed but not know the exact number.
You can even know that there were more groups of people targeted before they got to Jewish people and then wind up unsure of how many from each group contributed to the massive number.
Not necessarily.
What made me think that the holocaust was exaggerated was how it was taught in school.
it was shoved down our throats how evil it was but very little was properly explained and very little context was provided.
As a kid I just assumed that if someone is that insistent on pushing a specific narrative it must be because they are at least partially lying.
But I never doubted that it had happened and always thought that it was evil, due to there being too much evidence for it to be made up.
And any genocide is obviously horrible.
I agree.
I’m not sure that this survey was designed very well in that regard.
Also, they appear to have relied on landlines and online polling to reach people under 40.
Both of these methods have some serious issues.
