Something similar sort of happens in the first season of The Thick of It— they call a press a conference to announce something but then, right before the press conference they’re told they can’t announce it so they have a press conference to announce nothing and try to spin it as that’s what they meant to do.
Meanwhile they had leaked the press conference material ahead of time and so they also have to spin that as a story made up by a disgruntled employee.
Except then the PM accidentally announces the thing and so then they have to cover for him.
So they try to spin the press conference about nothing into a press conference where they announced the thing they didn’t announce and the story about the disgruntled employee making up the policy was actually a story made up by a disgruntled employee.
Yes!
It's kind of necessary.
An important part of learning how to manage my bi polar was establishing boundaries between 'my mental illness sometimes makes things difficult for me and I need understanding' and 'I treated you badly, and I need to accept responsibility.'
Excusing shitty things with mental illness just helps to cement a pattern of doing shitty things.
