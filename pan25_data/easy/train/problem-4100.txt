You kill one or a dozen, you are a murder,, kill a thousand and you are hero.. in Putin’s case, take that piece of crap out,, and you are hero.,, it is the exception to the rule.
Absolutely not.
Ukraine has never held irredentist ideals and never will.
An invasion will destroy all western goodwill forever.
Transnistria borders both Moldova and Ukraine equally and also roughly holds an equal amount of Moldovans, Russians and Ukrainians.
Moldova has always unquestionably held rightful claim, even in Soviet times.
The area really is just another remnant of very poor and spiteful Soviet policy making.
It’s a very fascinating read on Wikipedia if you want a rabbit hole.
disagree.
if they see that russia is going to proceed to overthrow moldova completely, ukraine and moldova would be way better off handling it now, than after russia controls the government and sends more troops and equipment there to try to attack nato and western/eu supplies as they enter ukraine.
that would be bad news for everyone.
