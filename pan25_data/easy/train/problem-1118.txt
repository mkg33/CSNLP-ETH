Kept the presidency warm for putin they switched places.
Even then as President Medvedev was taking orders from putin.
How does putin reward this lil bitch?
Makes him PM......which let's him take the brunt of the frustrations people have.
He becomes a laughing stock.
He loses the PMs office and gets sent to some random position with no influence.
Plus is not in putins inner circle.....that tells you just how far he has fallen.
Russia seems to always float between inferiority complex and megalomania.
First, the Western slavic states of Poland, Hungary and Bohemia (Czechia) adopt (or get forced to) Christianity, then they are turned into kingdoms or are part of the Holy Roman Empire.
Kiev gets conquered, Moscow gets conquered, but then the tide slowly turns as Russian Empire emerges and the western slavic states cease to exist, being incorporated in other empires or partitioned between them.
Then the slavic nationhoods begin to wake and Poland, Czechia and Hungary are independent for a brief moment before getting under the soviet boot.
They all fight the oppression one way or another to finally emerge in the current era of EU integration and relative prosperity.
