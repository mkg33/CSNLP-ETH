I’m Georgi Kantchev, a WSJ reporter based in Berlin.
I started reporting for the Journal in 2014 in London, covering energy and financial markets.
After that, I was stationed in Moscow where I wrote about Russia and the conflict in Ukraine.
The opposition, or alternatives.
To understand the matter, we first have to realise that 90s were really traumatic times for us (hence why we traded freedom for stability that Putin offers).
Because of that (primarily because of the yeltsin's rule + the trauma) democracy is associated with the term "deception".
So any democratic opposition is seen as people who want us to "sell out" again.
Maybe if not for the narrative and propaganda it would be seen otherwise, but at least in 2021 it was like that, can't tell for 2000-2012 period really.
Investigators haven’t yet identified who’s responsible.
That said, some European politicians have pointed the finger at Russia - which denies any responsibility.
What both sides have coalesced around is the idea that the blasts weren’t accidents but sabotage.
Swedish authorities, for instance, have said that they had found traces of explosives on several foreign objects nearby.
But experts say that such investigations take a long time because the evidence is underwater and because whoever did this would have been covering their tracks.
It’s a real energy and geopolitical whodunit and it might be a while before we know for sure.
