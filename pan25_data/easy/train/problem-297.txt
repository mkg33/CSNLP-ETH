Healthcare, Housing, I think you are forgetting how Iraq and Iran exploited diplomatic efforts and promoted the corruption that they experienced far before the wars.
Governments gave them educational funding, Healthcare access, and etc.
and almost every time, it was exploited for feudal power amongst the Taliban and used as agitprop by Iraq.
It was all about roping in Islamic Ideals to rope in public sentiment towards the west for all their problems, but in truth, it's a double-edged sword, we failed in understanding their concerns and logistics and they failed in creating/maintaining the needed structure, and cultural tolerance for the well-being of Afghanistan.
It's in an arid state of affairs, wild, corrupt, and rinsed dry of critical thought.
Saddam counted on that softening of Afghanistan prior to War with Iran (1979, Which he also hoped was softened by the Iranian revolution and mostly back-fired).
Yup.
Also, most religious people claim their chosen religion's extremist fringegroups (almost every religion has them) do not represent their faith.
When in fact the extremist groups are usually the ones that adhere to their chosen religion's doctrines the most.
They truly are the most faithful and true representation of that religion.
All the 'moderates' basically pick and choose what principles they want to adhere to.
