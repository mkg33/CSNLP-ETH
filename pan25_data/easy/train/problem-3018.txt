In the first phase of the pandemic, we didn’t have ANYONE come to the ER.
Then we had a few covid people come in, then we had to watch a lot of people die of covid, then we had a lot of people coming in like, “oh who cares, the government is lying about it” after we just had to watch a lot of people (with a wide variety of ages and risk factors) die in front of us, completely helpless to do anything about it.
I didn’t say that.
When my time comes it comes.
If you think humans belong here after what we’ve done, or that we are capable of change, your delusional.
And it seems….. angry.
I didn’t say start culling.
I said disease will cull and it inevitable, based on human behavior.
Best of luck!
I’m saying one of those countries is an authoritarian regime which regularly commits human rights violations and the other is geographically isolated and economically prosperous.
The first is not a way that should be replicated and the second was mostly possible because of geography and having the infrastructure to endure.
There was no way that could be replicated globally.
