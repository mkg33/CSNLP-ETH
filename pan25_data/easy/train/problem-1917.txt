Thank you for putting together this list!
I have already been boycotting all of these companies except for Visa and Adidas.
Adidas wouldnâ€™t be challenging to boycott either, and I will make it a point to - however Visa is a different story.
How does one go about boycotting Visa?
It's not just the fact that thousands of people died building these stadiums in the middle of a dust bowl that will just rot away after the tournament is finished, but the fact that Qatar also has backwards religious laws around women, homosexuality, and alcohol, the fact they've already went back on their word regarding a deal about beer in stadiums, and have already harassed and threatened to destroy the camera of a Danish journalist before the tournament even began, spells disaster.
They seem to be extremely intolerant but want everyone to tolerate their nonsense.
Regarding the clothing laws, if they came to the West for a tournament and we said they had to follow our "culture and values" and expose their shoulders, arms, etc., they'd be up in arms.
