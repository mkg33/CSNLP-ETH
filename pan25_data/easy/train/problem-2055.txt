My friend's mother went to place flowers to a statue like that.
He says she knew she could be arrested for that, but she wanted to do at least something to not be a silent majority.
Interesting parallel with pre-imperial Rome.
Then there were constant internecine conflicts and vicious civil wars (thank-you corrupt and ambitious Roman senators).
When Julius Caesar showed them how to be a good, smart, honest military leader, the jealous Senate couldn't handle that and killed him.
But that lead to their golden age as an empire.
Chances are during Iraq these people saying this were not plotting to overthrow the Bush administration, or even leaving the country en masse, or, as I've seen a lot of younger Russians on the internet, at great risk to themselves, donating to organizations that give money to resistance fightersâ€”which, to really hit it home, means they are funding organizations that are killing their countrymen.
Not an easy thing, no matter how brutal their country's invasion is.
There were a lot of protests for sure before the invasion of Iraq, but when it happened, everyone went on with their lives.
Fallujah was getting shelled with depleted uranium munitions while people sent Jibjabs to their coworkers.
For the next few years after that, young men were jerking off to Jessica Biel and playing Halo 2, and then later jerking off to Megan Fox and playing Halo 3.
We finally left Iraq in 2011, nearly nine years later, and wouldn't leave Afghanistan for another near ten.
