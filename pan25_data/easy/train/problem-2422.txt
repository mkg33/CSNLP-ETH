As an aside, if you're curious as to why I place doubt as to whether the Gospels can be trusted, it's because of when each of them were written.
There was politics at play every instance, and you can see parallels between contemporary politics for each time period (both from historical record and in the contemporary non-gospel missives included in the New Testament).
Saul's letters to missionaries in Greece contain a "be a good person even if you have to break the rules a bit" message that's suspiciously similar to Christ's portrayal in the Gospel of Luke, and suspiciously dissimilar to his absolutist portrayal in Matthew.
Mark's portrayal of Jesus (and Jesus' criticism of the Pharisees) can easily be viewed as a criticism of the Jewish nationalists pushing for open rebellion against Roman rule shortly before...you know...the open rebellion against Rome that led to Jerusalem being taken under siege and the temple later being reduced to literal rubble.
Exactly.
People act like they were taxed 90% and all of it flowed down to the low and middle classes to create some kind of utopia.
When the reality is the rates they actually paid were much lower.
