It's like complaining about america because of some dumb shit happening in florida or because the GOP is being fucks.
Yes we have our morons, but they don't represent the whole country, the 'lgbtq free zones' were majorly recieved by poles with the same reaction of bewilderement and facepalming as outside poland, lgbt people don't go missing in them, they're just places which eat themselves up with propaganda and religious zealotry, but even there they don't actually do anything besides that.
What about it?
Are fathers whose wives die or are divorced with full custody forced to marry another woman in Poland?
Or are they allowed to raise their child on their own?
That seems way worse in terms of impact on the child than two dads raising a kid instead of one dad and one mom.
And what about paternal deprivation?
Two moms would be better than one mom too.
All that does is forbid pride parades, and they already got flak for being religious zealots and morons for it from the rest of the country, you say it as if there's gay people being hunted in the streets or something, it's not saudi arabia ok, let's not get ahead of ourselves, we have our morons but even our dumbest areas aren't actively violent, just stupid.
