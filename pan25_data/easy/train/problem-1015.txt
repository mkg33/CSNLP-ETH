This is the problem when people talk about “common sense” gun control, the anti-gun lobby will never be satisfied.
The assault weapon ban of 1994 happened before AR, AK and similar semi automatic rifles really became mainstream and in the case of AR platform rifles affordable.
When the ban sunset in 2004 sales took off and semi auto AR rifles became extremely popular.
A new ban would do little to nothing to reducing violence because there’s tens of millions of these rifles circulating.
Most states do not require a background check for private parties sales and even states that do can do little to stop private parties from illegally selling firearms without a background check since there’s no national registry of firearms.
Common sense gun laws do little to nothing to protect lives while stripping rights from people who don’t commit gun crimes.
Banning ergonomic features?
I doubt this will do much to stop crime considering these have no serious influence on the overall "lethality" of a firearm.
Law abiding gun owners will like the 1994-2004 ban.
Criminals won't give a single shit.
