I mean… all it takes is reading bills that’s trying to be passed by multiple Republican majority states all around the country & seeing what Republican legislatures are doing in exerting this power.
Idaho and Tennessee have no exceptions for health/life of the mother (not like it would matter much anyway, exceptions are just Republican PR).
A judge in Florida denied a 16 year old with no legal guardians judicial bypass for an abortion because her grades weren’t good enough.
In states like Arkansas, women can be investigated for miscarriages.
In Louisiana, a woman who was fourteen weeks along was denied an abortion even though her fetus was nonviable and was dying within her.
SC tried to pass a six-week ban, but it was struck down by the state Supreme Court.
However, the current legislature isn’t going to give up in trying to restrict abortion.
Totally agree.
Sexually frustrated young men are a terrifying demographic.
And rather than teach them how to improve themselves and have healthy, respectful relationships with women, conservatives double down on these young men's frustrations and resentments.
It's incredibly dangerous.
