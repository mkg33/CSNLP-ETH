Now I don't know how likely Chile is to send some small portion of their arsenal to Ukraine, but they are one of the only countries in the region best suited to supply Ukraine with this level of heavy support.
It could also be an opportunity for Chile to dump some of its older stock and secure deals with NATO and allied countries for more modern replacements.
Chile has had a fairly good track record of achieving these types of deals, recently recieving 3 ex-RAF E-3 Sentry AWACS for a bargain.
There's been rumors of Chile trying to secure a deal for at least 20 ex-RAF Eurofighter Typhoon fighters to replace the F-5 Tigers and older F-16MLUs.
Should this go through, those F-16s might need to find a new home.
Maybe they could serve as spares or trainers for a new UAF squadron?
none of these terms and descriptions are wholly accurate but its a general developed, developing, and undeveloped economies can be split into global north being more developed or developing and global south being developing or under developed.

The US is trying to convince them to send Russian weapons to Ukr.
because that's the weapon systems they know, and offering to replace them with US weapons in exchange.
