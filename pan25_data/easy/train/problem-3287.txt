That's not the goal at all.
It's to get students a better education regardless of whether it's public, private, or otherwise.
The education monopoly has had 50 years to get it right.
They have failed miserably for underprivileged children.
It's time to acknowledge that the answer is not to just keep writing bigger and bigger checks to the teacher unions.
Time is up.
Underprivileged kids deserve a good education and it won't happen through failing public schools.
These kids need the opportunity of alternative schools.
I find it completely despicable to keep kids that want to get a good education locked into these failing public schools.
Anyway.
Case in point DeVos has never stepped foot inside a public school before her appointment.
It's absolutely laughable.
Also the tactic to dumb down the populace via these tactics is commonplace among other, pro authoritarian or kleptocratic governments.
And again, they take inspiration from the US, IE stupid fucking humanity destroying GOP inspires all the other monstrous bastard leaders in the world(as evidenced in the past 6 years by erdogan, duterte, whatsisname Brazilian shit-for-guts, putin etc.
).
