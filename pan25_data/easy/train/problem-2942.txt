Just to clarify- Ukraine will not push anywhere outside its own borders because the one and only objective Ukraine has here is full control of own borders and peace, safety and prosperity within said borders.
The people of Ukraine support only that and the current government represents the people of Ukraine.
Ukraine does not want or need anything outside of its borders.
Otherwise, yes, Ukraine would lose the moral high ground and a big chunk of support.
But I think one of the reasons Ukraine has an overwhelming moral high ground here is precisely that Ukraine genuinely, to the very bones only wants what belongs to Ukraine within its own territory and not a iota beyond that.
Huh!
That’s interesting.
I’ll keep that in mind.
I live in Alaska so we don’t have fleas but I’m finishing a project in Idaho and they are down here.
I’m not wanting to import any back home.
I’ve heard if you get them into your house they can take up residence.
That’d be such a bummer.
Ditto with picking up bed bugs while traveling.
Thanks for the tip.
The United States and allies have repeatedly said Crimea and occupied territory is Ukrainian territory and not under any restrictions.
How?
Ukraine lacks a navy and has very little air power.
Russians have dug in deep in Crimea since 2014 and can be resupplied by rail, sea and air.
I cannot imagine Ukraine taking back Crimea by military force, it simply lacks the capacity to do so.
Ukraine may be able to take back all the rest of the Russian occupied areas, but Crimea would be a meat grinder for them and Russia will not give it up and will just commit it's entire military to keeping it if it has to.
It will only be handed back to Ukraine under diplomatic means IMO.
