A corporation is a legal fiction that enables durable contracts that are not void upon death of the contracting party.
Capitalism does not promote innovation.
It supports monopolising.
You can see it with the big multinationals, they don't innovate, the just buy up any competition that sprouts.
Amazon is a prime(haha) example, they penetrate a market with unsustainably low prices no one can compete with, buy up all the competition and then start raising the prices.
They can suffer losses for a long time, longer than any competitor.
Not necessarily.
Someone might have fucked up and assumed the war would be over by now, sanctions would be lifted and Russia would be a profitable market.
They stayed because they thought they would always have a chance to leave on the same conditions that were a year ago.
Now they might want to leave and the profit of doing business there no longer makes sense, but they canâ€™t sell it anymore for remotely acceptable cost.
So they stay begrudgingly since they still keep hoping they will at least break even eventually.
Corporations are amoral, profit-seeking mechanisms.
No corporation would pull out of Russia as long as its shareholders could see returns for doing business there.
