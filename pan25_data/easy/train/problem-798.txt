He is not a silovik nor old school oligarch.
Everything he has in terms of wealth and power was granted to him by Putin and I really don't believe that Wagner or its leadership would side with Prigozhin if Putin denounced him.
Putin not only has the loyalty of the FSB, he basically is the FSB.
Patrushev and Bortnikov are the next two most powerful men in Russia after Putin and both have been directors of FSB like Putin (Bortnikov as current).
If Prigozhin so much as sneezes at Putin, they could make him disappear in a million different ways.
What can Prigozhin hope to achieve?
His Wagner army, even bolstered to a new size of around 40k members (with all its elite prison convicts), is still tiny next to the 1.5 million members of the police forces, national guard, etc.
Its all theoretically possible.
Not a good idea though.
Blackwater was a glorified security company that never saw "combat" (offensive fighting, like on a frontline), but saw insurgency and ambushes.
They would best excel at internal security, with only a few crimes (or massacre's) while they're at it.
