Why release this at Christmas?
The break was a mistake, IMO.
I was intently watching the hearings...and then they stopped...for months...and I wasn't as interested.
Strange to now turn this on the public = no fanfare headlines.
They really fumbled the momentum of those early hearings and probably could have recommended criminal charges in July.
Now, we're not as interested because it's almost 2 years later and we don't need to be convinced of what we saw.
Charge him or STFU.
Which means that Trump's call for violence was literally written ahead of time, while this report claims that "agencies apparently did not (and potentially could not) anticipate the provocation President Trump would offer the crowd in his Ellipse speech, that President Trump would “spontaneously” instruct the crowd to march to the Capitol".
Nah.
I think it was political posturing for the midterms.
Voters have a short memory.
Now they have to drag it out for another two years with criminal cases and use it for the next presidential election cycle.
