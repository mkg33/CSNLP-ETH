Honest question: are some of the letters on your keyboard swapped?
I feel like youâ€™re transposing letters in a way I can almost discern but I canâ€™t put my finger on it.
Perfectly understood your message.
But the keys are a mystery.
Your country 1000x more rich than Ukraine but even we managed to have free school and free full university education >for citizens<(except dormitory and food in universities not free, and only discounts for buss/train/metro) with such massive economy itâ€™s just totally weird you have student loans existenceðŸ˜•.

As for why Ukrainians should keep fighting...
I just can't.
Think for a second, apply this situation to just about any situation were a foreign invader is RAPING another country, or even an allied country?
I don't want to sound patronizing, or condescending, but if you have any knowledge of history you should consider using it.
I'll go with an easy example - Think of WW2, should the Allies have just said "well, millions of people of people are dying we might as well bend over!
