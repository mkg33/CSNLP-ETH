You're seriously delusional if you think Xi is going to go to Russia to discuss importing Russian women (however that even works).
This place feels like it's full of high schoolers.
Russia's dug itself into a hole it will have a very hard time getting itself out of and things are only going to get massively worse as European markets continue to move away from Russia and their primary breadwinner of NG and oil especially as the world moves to renewables or to nuclear.
How about those comment chains of puns?
I always read those and wonder, who are these people in real life?
Are they doing this as a self-aware joke or are they genuinely getting some great joy by adding another pun to the list?
Absolutely true.
Though I'm sure that Xi would love to make a weakened Russia into its vassal state with all those massive untapped raw resources...be able to cut off western countries who are their current suppliers (and weaken western military influence in the Pacific while he's at it - which is what would happen if Australia's economy tanked as a result).
