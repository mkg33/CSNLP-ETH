The GOP's only policy position is that of 'what will hurt people most?'
In 2022, Biden and Dems have done the following:
Trump is an opportunistic narcissistic.
He would announce before the mid terms if he was confident the GOP would win.
He could say "look - I announced my candidacy and we won the mid terms!
".
announced $156 million for America's first-of-its-kind critical minerals refinery, demonstrating the commercial viability of turning mine waste into clean energy technology.
But he didn't.
He knows their chances don't look good and wants to come in after as an "I told you so!"
moment.
invoked Defense Production Act to rapidly expand domestic production of critical clean energy technologies.
Yep.
He's probably found out, or guesses, that the DOJ will indict him the day after the election, so he wants to announce before that happens so he can claim that he's got immunity or it's a politically-based witch hunt.
But if he announces right now, he pisses off the GOP by fracturing the party right before an election.
So he's basically got a tiny, tiny window of opportunity to announce.
