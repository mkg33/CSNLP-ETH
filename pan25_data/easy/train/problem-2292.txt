Can you elaborate a bit?
I am genuinely curious.
I always thought that when the economy “cooled” prices would go down because demand would drop due to job losses etc.
Well, at least in an ideal world.
Normally calorie intake and obesity levels increase during an economic recession.
Emotional or stress eating goes up during economic recessions.
It is one of the few distractions that most people can still afford.
POSSIBLE?
How many of these companies shrink portions AND raise prices, purely to maximize profits.
Most could care less about the struggles of the middle and lower class in this economy.
We know costs have gone up… you don’t have to tell us; we see it every fucking day.
God forbid you earn a little less profit than pre-pandemic.
Most don’t love this country or their fellow citizens!
They love one fucking thing… $.
communism and capitalism are naturally emerging systems of human interaction, the former needs trust and mutual interests, whereas the later is trustless, hence why a family with a single breadwinner can be great because they actually love each other, and even bigger communities can behave similarly with success(UK's NHS) but this breaks down as the population diversifies where they all see each other as strangers, and thats where capitalism takes over.
We need to isolate, spotlight, and boycott some of the worst offenders.
Most of corporate America can go fuck themselves!
In the same vein, we need to thank and patronize those who have proven their sacrifice and that they are ’human’ (‘corporations are people’), and they will forego a few years of max profit til the nation as a whole has recovered from Covid.
