If you want to fix democracy, vote in the democratic primary, and push candidates that say they're for ending FPTP and doing, at the very least, ranked choice voting.
Any party that runs their own candidates instead of endorsing members of Democratic or republican primaries/ general election is being a spoiler unless proper reforms have passed.
What do they think these things are?
Permanent positions, or policies, or people?
Nothing stops any movement or faction from making either party theirs except a lack of an organized mass.
You certainly can't start a new party and make it competitive without organized mass, or get an independent elected to the presidency which frankly wouldn't change either party....why should it?
It shouldn't need pointing out that someone who can't organize enough of a mass of people to take over one of the current parties or to win their primary also can't compete against the big two.
They can only split votes off from the party closest to their own platform, this helping the party furthermost from their platform.
