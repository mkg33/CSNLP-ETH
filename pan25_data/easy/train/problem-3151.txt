I should pay more in taxes, but I'm not going to do it voluntarily while my peers don't.
".
The group of 205 millionaires and billionaires, including the Disney heiress Abigail Disney and The Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo, on Wednesday called on world leaders and business executives meeting in Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF) to urgently introduce wealth taxes to help tackle “extreme inequality”.

My Dad is a retired accountant.
He ran his two person accounting/bookkeeping company for decades and he made a living and raised four kids, but I wouldn't put him in the "rich" category by any stretch of the imagination.

However, I do also know one guy who's Dad started and ran a tool and die company who I would consider quite wealthy and my friend inherited the company and runs it and I could consider him wealthy.
So it depends on the business.
But running a business is hard work.
People who think "Oh the employees do all the work and the business owner is just a greedy prick living off their labor" has no concept of what it means to run a business.
