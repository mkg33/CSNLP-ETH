Edit: it also seems like the wording of the law specifies only males can rape by using words like "he" consistently throughout.
It could've been legally impossible to convict a rape charge since they were trans.
These laws really need to be updated.
Also before anyone chooses to go on an anti-LGBT crusade here, every human demographic has rapists, murderers, and thieves, this transperson deserves their jail time and probably more, but the bad actions of some do not mean there is a black check for taking it out on all other LGBT people who didn'tnhavr anything to do with molesting the kid and are as against pedophilia and all other forms of sexual assault as one can be.
I did read it.
I just don't know how you can impregnate someone and not be convicted of penetrative rape by definition.
Again, gender identity has nothing to do with this.
I just think sex offenders aren't taken as seriously as they should be.
Occupation =/= gender identity.
The person's position can sometimes be necessary for explaining the context, but whether the perpetrator was trans or cis doesn't matter nearly as much.
