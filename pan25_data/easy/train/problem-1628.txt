Japan is considered para-nuclear, as its long assumed they don't just possess the capacity to produce nuclear arms at will, but to do so immediately, but do not maintain a stance which announces they intent to ever do so.
South Korea and Japan are both nuclear threshold states, also referred to as nuclear latent, meaning they have the ability to produce nuclear weapons but choose not to, and don't acknowledge if they keep ready to assemble parts on the shelf.
Many non-nuclear nations are nuclear latent, even Taiwan.
How in the world does that mean trump played kim?
Nuking a country and then blaming another country for it is something a 5 year old would think of.
It's like the dumbest thing I've ever heard re: NK.
This is also technically different from Israel, which is near-universally regarded as a well stocked nuclear power, but maintains an unwavering policy of strategic ambiguity towards its nuclear capabilities.
Lol wat?
Trump still raves about his love letters with kim, I think one of the docs found at MAL he sued to keep was that letter.
