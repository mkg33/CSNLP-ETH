There's no shortage of pieces like this but I'm encouraged by a few things: 1) The latest midterm results showed that the public at large is becoming tired of it; 2) The GOP has no clear goals to promote - they are against everything the democrats advocate for, but not for anything that the public cares about; and 3) fascist parties of the 30s obtained broad support by providing supporters with actual tangible benefits, contrast this with the GOP that claims anything that would actually help their base is communist/socialist (One recent example is the legal battle to kill Biden's plan to lessen the burden of student loans).
