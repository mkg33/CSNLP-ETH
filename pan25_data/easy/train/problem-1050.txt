I do genealogy as a hobby so when this started I decided to make a family tree along with 60 other people on Ancestry.

His father and a maternal uncle show up in a New York directory in 1989.
His mother is here in 1992.
He marries in 2012 and divorces in 2019.

His father is not registered.
If I was betting I'd say it looks more likely that the ex-wife married for citizenship.
I'm glad the media has not hounded these relatives as they seem to be pleasant people.
