Im pretty sure they are going to get charged with that no matter what at this point.
There are videos of missiles being launched at Ukraine from inside Belarus since the start of the war.
Don’t underestimate putin.
putin’s leverage is HUGE this winter.
This winter the Russian Special Operation will become the Gas War, with putin buying loyalty and hundreds of thousands of troops from nearby countries who will avert freezing by helping putin destroy Ukraine.
N.Korea is supplying weapons and troops.
China is sending tons of military winter gear (in 50 ton loads) to Russia.
Watch for troop coordination, training and war games over the next few weeks.
The attack will happen by February.
NATO and the EU need to make sure that allies don’t switch sides to get gas(looking at you Hungry).
Belarus will succumb to putin’s demands and fight.
From the Dead Sea, Russia will attack via Moldova.
NATO and EU must be proactive to avoid losing because their inaction means Ukraine is overrun a month from now.
Kick putin.
