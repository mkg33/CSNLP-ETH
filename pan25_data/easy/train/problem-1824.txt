Removing books from libraries is far short of censorship.
Your local library doesn’t have every single book written.
They choose what they want to stock.
Every library does it.
Are they all banning books?
So naturally the average resident of reddit (I presume a liberal, communist, progressive, etc.)
Would place more scrutiny on conservatives with LGBTQ books, while less on Ukraine doing effectively the same thing; because the former poses a threat to an administration that at least pays lipservice to them, while the latter is an ally.
No!
Do not stoop to the level of the Russians with all the copious propaganda and hiding of information.
When the truth is your friend there’s no need to do that.
As a Ukrainian, I definitely don’t think that precious limited resources and storage capacity should be given to Russian-language literature, when the sheer volume of items and the outright domination in numbers over Ukrainian-language books has been as a result of centuries of colonization, which included several outright bans of speaking, writing and publishing books in Ukrainian.
Here's the difference though.
Ukraine are allies with the US state department.
Conservatives in Alabama aren't (and pose a risk to the current administration in 2024 if they have enough votes to oust Biden).
