Afghanistan's biggest source of potential wealth is mineral resources.
However, no one knows how much wealth there actually is (could be a few trillion, or the US funded surveys a decade ago were inaccurate and it's a tens of billions), even if someone did know how much there was and where to mine there aren't railroads or roads to carry material in and out, and even if there were the logistics would have to go through Russia, Syria, Pakistan, Iran, or Iraq to reach a port.
All have security and international political problems.
No.
It’s not an oversimplification.
Businesses are at the mercy of the consumers.
Period.
People CHOOSE to spend their money with shit companies.
Saying otherwise is bullshit.
No one needs to shop at Walmart.
If you have no money, shop at thrift stores and overstock stores.
Cut out processed food & meat.
Buy cheap, nonprocessed foods like dry beans, dry rice, discounted fresh produce, dry pasta, canned tomatoes, bulk cheese, etc.
It is a myth that poor people can’t afford healthy food.
Stop spreading bullshit.
And before you say it, I am well aware of food desserts.
I have lived in food deserts for most of my adult life.
Most folks are just lazy & apathetic.
People want everything handed to them.
Violent Religious fundamentalists ruling a nation.
Bound to turn out awesome for everyone.
Sure to be a winner on the economic front.
Where do I invest?
