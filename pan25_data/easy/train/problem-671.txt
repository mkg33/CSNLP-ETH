Great!
They get training in many other countries too, eg UK.
I cannot wait for the news about training of Ukrainians pilots.
Hopefully they are already months into their training.
Calls for actions aimed at violating the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation (Abandoning Russian territory) = prison.
Nice gif!
Reminds me of the Kharkiv offensive .

it's beautiful.
A little out of date by now, I think - things are happening fast, again.
Ukrainian defenders continue to advance south.
Warriors from 1 Separate Special Purpose Brigade named after Ivan Bohun report the liberation of Borozenske, Kherson region, from Russian invaders.
The servicemen of Ukraine's 128th Mountain Assault Brigade entered the settlement of Bruskynske in the Kherson Oblast of Ukraine, located South of Davydiv Brid.
Its hilarious.
Why would USA promise a corridor in a war they have no men in.
Russian bots are also a little late.
Ukraine 7 hours ago said no green corridors were requested by Russia.
If Ukraine actually shelled a green corridor Russia would be sending UN meeting requests immediately to tell the world how terrible Ukraine is.
