Did I ever tell you about the time I went horseback riding with George Santos, but there weren’t any horses around?
Well, Santos throws a saddle on my back and rides me around Wyoming for three days.
Well, wouldn’t you know it, my stamina increases with each day and I develop tremendous leg muscles.
So anyway, Santos decides to enter me in the Breeders’ Cup, right, under the name Turkish Delight.
And I’m running in second place, and I’m running and I break my ankle!
They’re about to shoot me.
Then someone from the crowd yells out, God bless him, ‘Don’t shoot him, he’s a human.
'.
8’11 former NBA MVP George Santos is donating his entire $57 million dollar salary to charity because he’s the most charitable human ever.
Literally.
He won the prestigious Most Charitable Human Award in 2019.
Elton John presented, and their duet later that night won six Grammys.
The documentary about the event won an Oscar.
Santos himself was nominated but bowed out due to conflict of interest, given that he’s an Academy voter and has been since 1982 — which incidentally was the year he won his first World Cup.
