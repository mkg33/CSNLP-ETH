So, in short, supermassive black holes today are heavier than they should be according to previous theories.
This is because the space that exists behind the event horizon also generates the same vacuum energy as the universe outside them, leading to the black hole just growing in mass from its own stretched space time?
I am not clued up enough to know for sure if this right (reddit physicists pls help), but my understanding is that unlike physical energy or matter, more space-time can just be created through stretching or expansion.
Laws of conservation of energy and matter don't apply to the "canvas" they lie on, ie space-time.
Repeat infinitely.
A parent universe can only die when all itâ€™s children black holes die.
But those children black hole can only die when their children black holes die.
Potentially meaning that there is an infinite chain of dying children universes.
There is also an infinite chain of parent universes going backwards in time.
There is no end or beginning to the totality.
Only the ends of intermediary steps.
Presumably vacuum energy.
What happens in short is that they realized that the black holes grow faster than we expected by X amount, and it happens that X matches with what would happen if dark energy is vacuum energy, and the source of it.
Excellent dissection and explanation.
What I love most, though, is that you are an engineer who understands that science is about attempting to falsify hypotheses rather than prove them Gold star for you, friend.
