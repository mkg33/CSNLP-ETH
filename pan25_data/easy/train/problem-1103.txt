It’s just for show.
They wouldn’t be able to drain federal funding if they seceded.
That would also mean losing out on 2 Republican senators and a net loss of 12 Republican representatives in U.S. Congress.
And then they’d have to deal with border checkpoints and passports every time they try to go out of Texas, they would be subject to all the various trade restrictions and tariffs that US international trade has, they would no longer have the US military that they love so much, they would have next to no taxes for supporting their own government at all, and so much more.
Hell, their power grid would meltdown or explode after just one bad storm, and they’d have no federal government to beg for help.
If Texas were to ever actually secede, they find out real quick just how bad Republicans actually are at governing.
It would show the lie of Texas being this totally self-sufficient, independent, ah-don’t-need-no-help state for the propaganda it is.
I wish.
Let texans see what it is like to need a passport to visit the US.
Let them see what it is like having to deal with Washinon on international trade policy.
They will starve and die without the money from the federal government.
Look at their power grid, it is completely fucked and one storm away from a disaster again.
Fuck texas!
