Yes, but in Catherine’s case, she literally grew up in Prussia as Sophie von Anhalt-Zerbst.
She only took up the name “Catherine” after conversion to Russian Orthodoxy for her marriage.
Most historians probably disagree.
They did kill the emperor and got rid of most things associated with him, but Soviet Russia was still a de facto empire and sought to expand Russian influence within its borders and beyond.
And Putin has obviously restored many features of the old empire like the status of the Russian Orthodox Church.
Exterminate?
Lol.
How does it happen, that is, three hundred years were destroyed and everything was not destroyed?
And it does not bother you at all that even during the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, Ukrainian culture was an important part of the cultural life of the country.
That the same Gogol became popular in St. Petersburg with his stories about the life of Ukrainian villages.
His works are still reprinted, staged on the theatrical stage, many films and cartoons have been made based on them.
And it is included in the compulsory school curriculum.
The same can be said about a lot of other famous writers, artists who represented Ukrainian culture.
Uhhhhhh, ethnic cleansing much?
I get it, Russia is being a fuckhead right now, but that is no excuse for the blantant ethnic cleansing that Ukraine has on its agenda.
Forceably erasing a culture is ethnic cleansing, regardless of whether you support that side or not.
