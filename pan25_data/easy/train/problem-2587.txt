It was all part of there plan to privatise healthcare but they have done it in a way that people like myself who have had to wait for 9 hours to see someone in a&e while having bad chest pains has been seriously thinking after not being able to see a doctor for over a year to spend the money on going private, it is not much now but will increase, remember the conservatives cut NHS funding by 20 billion and then had a big party in the press when they gave 5 billion back.
It starts at 20k a year.
And that's for Bands 1-4 who are 'assistants', not nurses.
Band 5 is newly qualified nurse, and you hit that at 6 years, not 8.
And hopefully like always happens the economy will strenhen prices will drop and they will nationalise what needs nationalising , rail and energy being the most important in my mind as the taxpayer is paying unreasonable prices to prop up businesses like british gas that are seeing profits higher percentage wise than ever seen before.
To be forced to pay the crazy amount we are for sewage and water is also something that needs to be sorted out very quickly.
