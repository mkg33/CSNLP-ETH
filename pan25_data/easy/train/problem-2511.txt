Off top of my head, the $1 billion package included 10 120 mm, 82mm, and 60mm mortar systems plus ammo, the patriot battery, more Excalibur 155mm howitzer rounds and HIMAR rockets, more MRAPs (mine resistant trucks) and HMMWVs, more HARM anti radar missiles, and JDAM guided missiles.
Then the $800 million that's actually part of the US military budget is to purchase Soviet caliber artillery munitions (122mm artillery/rocket, 152mm artillery, and 125mm tank rounds).
Then there is a whole assortment of small arms and munitions.
Uneducated opinion.
Takes around 1-2years to train a pilot from scratch.
Couple months to retrain an existing pilot onto a whole new hardware system, which would be a poor idea anyway since Ukraine doesn’t really have the pilots to spare while they’re country is being bombed and jets are needed for air defense and infantry support.
Me either.
I was mostly a republican voter until 2016... and they just kept going.
This last election I didn't vote for a single republican, and honestly I can't see myself doing so again.
If the state party apologized for saying Trump won 2020 and thoroughly distanced themselves from the whole MAGA thing, I'd consider it, but I can't see them doing so.
Two entirely different scenarios.
Putin isn't trying to eradicate ethnic minorities or conquer Europe.
And it's a shame.
My state rep is a good man who has done a lot of good for our district, and for my family personally.
Got the transportation department to actually do something after the 3rd vehicle went off the road into our fence.
But as I told him this year, I can't vote for someone who is a part of and supports the republican party in our state.
They denied what happened on Jan 6th, and voting for him means supporting them, and I won't.
If he went independent I'd vote for him again gladly, but it's blue and grey for me, at least for the foreseeable future.
