Mueller didn't follow the money and STILL found sufficient evidence to convict beyond a reasonable doubt on 10 counts of obstruction of justice.
Not as a matter of law, as a matter of fact, I want to find out what the hell actually happened between Trump team and Russia in 15 and 16.
Let's get the senate intelligence committee on it?
What were they obstructing?
Al Gore was a fine candidate, but yes he ran from Clintons amazing record as President because President Clinton was seen as so toxic after 8 years of endless fake "scandals" investigated by Republicans in Congress and the media.
Sigh.
Dude.
You aren't even pointing out the relevant scandal to Gore.
(China fund raising scandal).
Clinton was MORE popular because of the scandal, not less.
The people who had their knickers in a bind over it were never going to vote Democrat and getting a blow job from an intern was not considered the scandal it is today (more of a wink nod nod who wouldn't).
Literally - "it's the economy stupid".
The B.S.
investigations into Benghazi and Emails absolutely hurt Hillary Clinton's credibility enough she lost in 2016.
