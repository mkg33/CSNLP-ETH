To the point of this article, it is true that AIPAC spends millions in every US election and in many cases swings results of primaries to get candidates more friendly to the Israeli govt, that is not antisemitism it’s just a fact.
It happened right here in Michigan where aipac spent millions to help defeat a Jewish progressive in a democratic primary mainly because he was critical of Israel.
I think this person the times of Israel went after is guilty of poor word choices more than intentional antisemitism, but they are correct that it at least appears antisemitic so really what’s the difference at that point.
We have to be very careful not to conflate criticism of the Israeli government with antisemitism just as much as we need to be very careful not to blame Jewish people for the actions of the Israeli government.
There are millions of Jewish people worldwide and even in Israel that side with the Palestinians and want progress and freedom for them.
Just as there are Palestinians who want a peaceful end to the apartheid and no harm to come to any Israeli.
Jewish people worldwide are under threat, but that doesn’t excuse what the government of Israel consistently does to the Palestinians every day, week, month, and year.

Antisemitic is not a lingo literal word , it means the hatred of Jews and was coined to make Jew hatred sound more scientific.
