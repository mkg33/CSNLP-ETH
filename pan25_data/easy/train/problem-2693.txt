Funny thing is, Disney is going to make that profit no matter what.
Sure, we think POTUS is the leader of the free world, but do you know what he can’t do?
Influence, with great effectiveness, how another country deals with Disney.
Punish Walt Disney World and the other parks just gain better things luring guests to those locations.
You think Ron DeTrumpLite is going to have a prosperous relationship with France?
Japan?
China?
So again just watch the park divisions earn more there.
As far as the stunt Ron is pulling on Disney, it was never going to succeed beyond the initial passing.
The whole thing has a target date for when he’s out of office, giving him the ammo to say “look what I did to Disney,” so the next guy gets the blame when it fails because Ron’s long gone.
Whomever picks up that fight with Disney afterwards is immediately going to be in a position of weakness.
They’ll never be as savvy as Ron and heaven forbid the public stance turns badly, aka crippling Disney, that DeSantis and the next guy effectively ruined the Florida economy.
And if that’s the case, Ton better be praying for miracles or his political life ends in 2024.
GOP isn’t backing him in 2028.
He’s termed out as Governor, so what’s left?
Cannibalizing an existing GOP official?
Of course not.
Florida gave Disney a 500 million dollar tax break a few years ago, plus the 150+ million in annual infrastructure costs for their parks gets dumped on the tax payer.
Disney is in a great position, they are going to save hundreds of millions and Florida's own government is making its own citizens pay for it instead.
And functionally nothing is going to change to how their parks are run.
Disney is laughing all the way to the bank.
