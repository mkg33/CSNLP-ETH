I was a foster parent who went on to adopt our foster daughter.
(For reference, our daughter was sexually molested(almost daily) by her grandfather starting at 18 months.
)When she came into our care (aged 5) she had already had 6 placements where the other foster families were unable to manage her behaviors.
After a year in our care the state ended parental rights and we where finally able to apply for the adoption.
As the court date approached we found out her bio-dad and a small of Native American which could prevent the adoption from going through.
What that would mean is basically she would forever be a foster child unless a member of her dad's tribe wanted to step forward to claim her.
To us this was an outrage.
Where was the tribe all this time?
Why couldn't one of their member offer this poor child a home?
In the end we were able to work it out with the courts and the tribe but it could have just as easily gone the other way.
