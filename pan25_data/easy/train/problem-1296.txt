Meanwhile, you're ignoring the entire sector of middlemen data brokers who straight up do sell your data wholesale.
The most obvious and influential ones being the credit scoring services (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax, FICO).
Their whole business model is being privatized corporations who catalogue and analyze your financial history, turning it into credit scores and reports they sell to lenders and financial institutions BEFORE then selling your data back to you!
They were FORCED by law into providing you a singular free report per year, and Facebook was among their clients before a certain event.
I'll stick with that one for now, as there are endless databases from thousands of data analytics companies who sell anonymized and PII data (Acxiom, Experian, Oracle Data Cloud, TransUnion, WPP PLC, etc.)
that naming every type and niche would be its own endless post.
Essentially, Google and Facebook don't exist in a vacuum, they're just the biggest data brokers in an already enormous industry.
TL;DR - Google and Facebook are more than just simple data brokers, but those brokers still exist and thinking they, as multinational corps, only sell to American interests is naive to the extreme.
Selling your data, either directly or as targeted ads for your product, is what they do for profit.
Gotcha, apologies for assuming.
Itâ€™s just that similar points are being used to criticize anything U.S. related while conveniently ignoring the same actions of other countries.
You can definitely tell that Russian and Chinese shills feel a sense of urgency these days.
