Carbon capture will only become efficient once we dully transition to green energy, or green energy with a minor portion of nuclear.
Even if you run a carbon capture device on a green energy system, you are putting that green energy system to waste in your mission to reduce carbon dioxide emmissions, as that green energy could have been use to reduce emmissions directly, and more efficiently, instead.
Because you are now using that green energy for this carbon capture, somewhere else in the world, someone is going to need to use fossil fuels to compensate.
There's also a background political dynamic at play: fossil fuel companies will seize on the notion of carbon capture to justify continuing the use of fossil fuels to governments.
They are provably that malicious and currently actively do this.
Transitioning away from carbon-intensive energy sources and building out carbon capture technology are not mutually exclusive.
In fact, they are complementary and both needed to reach net zero by 2050.
