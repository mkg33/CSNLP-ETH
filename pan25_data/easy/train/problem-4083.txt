The respect for marriage act is as important to republicans as it is for democrats.
In 2024 there are still going to be a lot of crazy right wingers in the electoral pipeline and the Republican presidential candidate will need to moderate after running to the right in the primary.
That candidate will need to say “Hey, don’t worry about the crazy social conservatives in my party, we passed the respect for marriage act on a bipartisan basis so there is your proof that we are not as nuts as the MSM wants you to believe” and that will work in just enough counties in the 5 swing states to possibly elect a Republican president.
What was more important?
Running on gun control or protecting social security, the affordable healthcare act, snap benefits, medicare, medicaid, education, clean water, clean air, voting rights, environmental protections, infrastructure, financial reform, law enforcement reform, tax reform...Come on, is gun control more important than every single thing else?
Victory?
Dems lost the house.
They will not pass another bill to their liking for years.
Just bills to keep the lights on, and they’ll have to pay for that in stripping existing priorities of theirs.
