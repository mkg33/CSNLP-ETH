The Palestinians who don't have Israeli citizenship go figure aren't Israelis.
That doesn't make Israel's actions good, but it sure as shit doesn't make it Apartheid either.
I'm Canadian and indigenous.
And we have this kind of way of discussing it here.
We can say, wow that's terrible and we'll fix things... and then admit that there's no way to go back.
There's no way to go back... just because we don't want to.
Israel and Palestine are really at the beginning of this process.
The Palestinians no longer ask for their lands back, they ask for the lands that they got pushed on back... and in ten years they'll be asking for the next set of lands they were pushed into back.
Much like in Canada with BC indigenous, you'll have groups that weren't native to that region trying to claim rights to the land they never lived on.
Israel isn't committing genocide.
There's valid criticism to be had regarding how they have handled the settlements, certainly, but this just propaganda.
A population that is actively being genocided does not more than double over 30 years.
