Yes there is a need for more plants that can take LNG and turn it back to gas.
There isn't nearly enough capacity for that yet.
But there has been significant progress already in Germany, where it is needed most.
These plants are usually slow to build because of bureaucratic issues and a lack of urgency.
However when there is a strong need to get capacity up and running quickly, you'd be surprised how quickly those plants can be up and running.
Next winter might not yet see many of those being operational, but by the winter after that they absolutely will be.
Combined with the already 20% reduction in gas usage in Europe on such short notice, I'm not particularly worried.
Nothing breeds efficiency like necessity.
Jfc do you not have google?
Russia has about 14% of the world's gas supply.
That's an insane amount.
Look at the size and placement of russia on a map and you'll se why they have these resources.
It would take you 5 minutes to google.
The reason we didn't start off with numbers is that we expect people to have this basic knowledge.
Even my 13 year old knows this.
