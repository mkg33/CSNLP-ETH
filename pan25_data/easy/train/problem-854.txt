So he was banned around the time that he was winning back-to-back gold medals.
He was a top contender for Mr. Olympia in 2018.
But he didn't get anything, all because some Orangutan didn't like Middle Easterners and issued a travel ban.
After that, he wasn't able to win gold in Mr. Olympia until now.

The death of Mahsa was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.

We are talking 43 years of kangaroo courts, imprisonment, torture, and killings, whilst the regime squanders Iran's wealth on state sponsored terrorism.
We are talking thousands executed in 1988 when now-president Raisi was on the "Death Committee".
1500 more in 2019 when they blacked out the internet and killed citizens.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
The Iranian people have had enough...
The difference is that now, they're past being scared anymore.
