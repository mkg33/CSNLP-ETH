Of course, other Muslim countries like the Central Asian -stans (outside of Afghanistan) and Albania/Bosnia are pretty okay for women, although I think that's the communist legacy more than any religious practice (frankly, the religion probably erodes those advances).

How evolved lol.
Unfinished construction has been one of the big stories out of Sochi, fueled by tweets from journalists who have been meticulously documenting every exposed wire, uncovered manhole, broken curtain rod and makeshift shower curtain along the way.
