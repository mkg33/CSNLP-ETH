Yeah, neither did anybody else for that matter, the mainstream media dedicated more air time to negative stories about Clinton than any other candidate, they dedicated less air time to covering her policy than any other candidate, she had to carry around all the nonsense baggage from the primary about her nomination being "rigged" and how "as a neoliberal capitalist" she was as much "a part of the problem" as the Republicans, and then the cherry on top was James Comey making the historically unprecedented choice to hold a public press conference to discuss an on going FBI investigation about Clinton the week before the election.
