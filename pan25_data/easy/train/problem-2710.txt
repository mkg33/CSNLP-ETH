I imagine that Chinese aid isn't so much aid officially as it is the Chinese government turning a blind eye to Chinese companies selling all sorts of stuff to the Russians against sanctions or "letting it fall off the back of a truck".
There's thousands of miles of border shared with Russia and China, they can pass stuff to the russians at will and no one will know what they're actually sending, and since it's not government mandated the Chinese government gets plausible deniability.
Congratulations.
You just learned how many pro-whatever side bots/paid agitators reside in reddit.
Some of the most inflammatory posters all use a similar writing style, wonder why that is.
Nah, they're totally imperialist.
They just get around that accusation by simply dismissing the sovereignty of the people that they dominate.
Since they "aren't real groups of people" then China can't be imperialist All internal affairs ðŸ™„.
Honestly?
Not a whole lot.
Can't really sanction China the same way we're currently sanctioning Russia.
Our economies are way too intertwined.
