I dunno my coworker’s wife works in anaesthesia, and she was telling me about a guy who tried to blow his brains out and lived.
They couldn’t tell where a lot of pieces of his face were and I guess they had to reconstruct his bottom jaw but he lived.
Poor immigration/integration policies leave young immigrants/children of immigrants vulnerable to criminal environments.
Gang violence is highly overrepresented by immigrants typically from Africa/middle-east/west Asia/south-east Europe.
It doesn’t mean that there aren’t criminals and violence from ethnical Swedes and other ethnicities, it just means those groups are overrepresented.
Granted it was a few years ago I looked at statistics for this(was a huge topic a few years ago in Sweden), but I’m pretty confident it hasn’t changed much.
I’m not blaming immigrants for getting recruited into criminal environments, but rather the Swedish government/politicians for being naive, morally self-serving and sloppy, which is the root cause to why this is happening.
