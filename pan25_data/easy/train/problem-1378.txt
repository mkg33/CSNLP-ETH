I wish people would get how much education happens in daycare.
I've done it all in early childhood work, and I taught a two year old room for many years.
My state considers 2 year olds preschoolers.
This way only one person is needed during nap time, because the 12 kids are asleep HAHAHA.
We had cirriculums and planning and omg obviously young children are not that great with cutting, so there was so much prep work.... And we do all this teaching interrupted constantly by someone pooping in their pull up.
LOL.
So much less pay, and we still needed to use our money for stuff in our class.
Can't forget that your aid is payed even less than you, so you shouldn't expect a lot of help.
That's another terrible analogy.
You have to go through a 3-5 year Doctor of Chiropractic degree program to become a licensed chiropractor, pass a bunch of exams via the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, and obtain whatever other requirements are necessary for licensure in the state you're practicing in.
They aren't Medical Doctors (MD) but they aren't just shmucks who took a 24-hour correspondence course and started their own practice.
