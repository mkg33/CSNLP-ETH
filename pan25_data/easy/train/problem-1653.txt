Probably because republican don’t just hate LGBT people, and it’s not a deal breaker for everybody.
You can vote for republican for a lot of other reason, and when you have to vote specifically for LGBT rights a lot of them would be for it.
It might be hard for some people but you can be for LGBT rights but still vote for republicans, for economics reason, for immigration reasons, for gun rights reason, ect… People just see blue and red, but their is a lot more than that.
You can also have people hating LGBT peoples still vote democrats.

Thank you for standing up for equality, Nevada!
Hopefully other states will follow your lead soon.
And when actually confronted with queer people that doesn't necessarily mean much because their definition of hate, discrimination, ....etc.
isn't always in line with reality.
