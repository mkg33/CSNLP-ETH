But if you live in a rural area that is overwhelmingly conservative, the culture is conservative, and Fox News and Talk radio are always playing somewhere.
People hear it at churches, hear it from the old guys getting coffee at the diner, and in line at the Piggly Wiggly.
So When the culture is conservative, even the people that follow politics and vote for democrats mostly just look at their feet and don't say anything, because who wants to get into a political argument in line at Piggly Wiggly?
But due to the conservative culture in the area, for a lot of people, even though these people don't really pay attention to politics, many have consciously or unconsciously developed a head canon where "liberals" or "the democrat party" are crazed, blue haired, frothing at the mouth leftists who want to destroy churches, get rid of the police, take everyone's guns and force everyone to attend gay re-education camps.
I'm exaggerating, but only a bit.
Primaries, caucuses, midterms, gubernatorial, polls, lawsuits, pundits, misinformation, disinformation, majority, slim-majority, wave.
It should yes.
Could you imagine how stupid Sanders must have felt when he defended keeping Iowa as a caucus and demanded the very rules that screwed him?
