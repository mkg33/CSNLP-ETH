Fact is, the POTUS visiting Kyiv is a signal of American strenh and dominance.
Russia bombarding Kyiv while he is there, is a challenge to that dominance.
Therefore, a response to cement that dominance would be required on the part of the US.
What the response would be, is hard to say.
I'm sure the Biden administration would have gamed out those scenario's beforehand, and may have even informed Russia on the type of consequences they could expect through the deconfliction hotline when they informed Russia of Biden's visit.
Why?
I couldn't give less of a fuck whether you believe me, you can look it up yourself.
Not like posting any more proof than has already been posted is going to make a difference.
It's all there, dumdum.
I know American schools have a reputation for gun violence but teachers don't actually need armored personnel carriers or infantry fighting vehicles or landmine resistant armored vehicles.
No.
The majority of America, which you do not personally know, would most likely not sit back after a US president was murdered because they are Americans that care about America.
ANY US President killed by another country would start a war.
Russia knows they would be destroyed.
That kind of community funding comes from the people who also support Ukraine, the problem is the republican opposition to any social programs supporting disadvantaged/underserved communities.
Whoosh.
Let me catch you up, you wrote anecdotal validation to support your opinion.
“Most people I know” is the part I may have made less “valid” by saying you don’t know the majority of Americans ‘personally.’.
