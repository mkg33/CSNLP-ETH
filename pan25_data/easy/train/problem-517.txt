Then it got turned into "winning the war" meant "end Islamic extremism in Afghanistan and turn it into a democracy."
It's impossible to reach those goals unless you went in super hard and killed a lot of noncompliant civilians along the way.
So now the US has to take the "L" in the history books because they don't know when to declare victory and pull out.
Germany already has a pretty significant amount of renewable electricity production.
40,9% compared to US 11% in 2021.
With nuclear plants they would be solid.
France is 69% nuclear, 7% gas and the rest is renewable which is quite cool.
Exactly.
It cracks me up when people act like the US military was "defeated" in Afghanistan.
The stupid ass state department trying to turn a bunch of loosely associated tribes into a liberal democracy was what they failed at.
If you told the US public in 2002 that the US military would go in to Afghanistan and the end result was that the US would decimate Al-Qaeda + kill Bin Laden, they would have been like "Cool, so justice was served and we won!
".
