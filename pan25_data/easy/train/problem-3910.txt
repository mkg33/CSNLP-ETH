This makes way more sense than making it illegal.
Combine them with vape and liquor stores.
Shops don't do too well when they are too limited on what they are allowed to sell.

I feel like the cases of abortion being criminalized have been as a result of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision (which was not achieved by a majority vote of the citizens of any state), and subsequent state legislatures passing bills to restrict the ability of doctors to perform abortions (which to my knowledge have not been as the result of achieving a majority vote of the citizens of any state where it has occurred, only the votes of several dozen mostly white male legislators).
Thank you!
