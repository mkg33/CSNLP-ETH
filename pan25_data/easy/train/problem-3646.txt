"Fuck David Frum.
He gladly shilled for the Bush White House and contributed to the division that gave us Trump.
He's not saying that shit as some kind of wise prophet who's become disillusioned with the party, he's saying it because he's another Neocon who has no problem with Trump policies, he just doesn't like that Trump is crude and mask off about the descent into fascism that the GOP has been pursuing since The Business Plot against FDR.

In a vacuum I think a lot of county lines in the US could do with redrawing (Navajo/Apache counties probably should be split N/S instead of E/W, the Apache reservations shouldn't be spread across 4 separate counties and the Tohono O'Oodham and Navajo across 3 each, etc.).
But the specifics of this proposal are hamfisted (lots of splits of city boundaries, for starters) and solely retaliatory in nature.
I agree.
This is a terrible idea, funny how they only care now that Arizona turned blue.
If they actually cared they’d focus on the districts you mentioned.
I’m just worried to see this pass.
