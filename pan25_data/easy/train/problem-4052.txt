Subject A leaves work one day with classified documents.
Subject A realizes some hours later what they have.
Note that the lenh of time in question isn't necessarily relevant to any potential disciplinary/legal actions that Subject A may be liable for.
It only matters in this case for the purposes of the investigation that will be conducted, specifically the counter-intelligence portion of the investigation.
Subject A immediately upon realizing what has happened contacts their security team and informs them of the details.
The documents are turned over in their entirety and taken back to an approved location.
A counter-intelligence investigation is started to determine a) the potential damage to national security, and b) any actual release opportunities that existed while the documents were out of the approved location.
At the same time a security investigation is started into Subject A and perhaps more importantly, how it was that Subject A was able to leave a secure location with classified materials.
Depending on the findings of those investigations Subject A could be liable criminally, but if the findings were favorable and the circumstances surrounding it were benign, most likely Subject A would walk away with a security infraction on their record.
Wait!
What if there is privileged information?
Where is Biden's "Special Master"?
This incident will only serve to show how these documents are supposed to be handled irl.
