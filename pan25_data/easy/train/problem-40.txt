Yeah that's not true in any way.
The might want it to seem that they do good for their population, but they dont.
This people literally close entire cities because there's 1 case of covid; they have social points that literally do not work cause aside of being an awful system per se, its also not standard across the nation; they literally are comitting genocide on a part of their own nation; and lets not forget that what we see of China is just a little part of what it actually is.. poor and not taken care of.
Chips.

Heâ€™s not wrong.
The perception that China has its populations best interests at heart is 15 years out of date at this point.
Perpetual Covid lockdowns, crackdowns on industries perceived as a threat to the CCPs power, inequities in the housing market, etc.
are all symptoms of unchecked authoritarian rule.
Where what is good for the party or leader is more important than the population.
