I'm curious if by this time next year we will have another SCOTUS level decision on AWBs and maybe even magazine capacity bans.
Seems like after the Bruen ruling it's open season on gun control laws and the whole "history and tradition" thing is going to be what kills them if anything ever does since there is no history or tradition of arbitrarily banning guns based on removeable features or even those features.
IIRC the first actual ban on the type of gun you could legally own was in the 1960's when they banned importing certain "saturday night special" cheap guns and introduced the "sporting purposes" test for importing guns.
Federal background checks weren't required until the 1990s and the federal AWB then might have been the actual first flat out "You can't buy, import or sell these guns" regulation.
The 1934 NFA might have been the first actual federal level gun control law of any significance.
And that's not a ban just a tax and registration act so once an AWB has to stand up in court against the Bruen decision it will be interesting.
