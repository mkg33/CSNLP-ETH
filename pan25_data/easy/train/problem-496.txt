Dictators like Putin require a constant show of strenh and power to keep their constituents in line, to the point that any sign of weakness can threaten the balance of power.
Putin has seen how when Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi lost power and were not just kicked out of office but killed by their citizens and he is terrified of that happening to him.
It's why he's so paranoid.
If Putin leaves Ukraine with nothing to show for it (or worse losing Crimea) coupled with a crap economy and the death of so many Russians, the propaganda might break and the populace may go for his head.
It's why he changed his goal to grapping the parts of Ukraine next to Russia instead of all of it and why he's throwing all his soldiers into the meat grinder.
Because he needs something, ANYTHING, to save face to his citizens.
Because if he loses the war he might lose his life.
This wasn't Putin just lashing out at a random former Soviet state/Imperial Russian possession - reintegration of Ukraine would've turned Russia into an economic powerhouse that might have too much market power in vital areas to sustain sanctions on (they'd be exporting something like 23% of the world's wheat, for example, and they'd be bumping themselves up several spots in the lists for a number of other staple crop exports) while also stopping planned Ukrainian development in economic zones that Russia's economy is dependent on.
