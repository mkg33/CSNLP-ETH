Not radioactive, but I read about an incident where someone didn’t set the latches on a rocket pod properly, and between the pad and the target range (training exercise for helicopter gunship crews) 3 rockets went AWOL.
Army did a “hands across America” sweep looking for them.
Of the 3 rockets lost, >6 were found.
From serial numbers, it was determined that all 3 of the rockets lost on that mission were recovered.
Probably didn’t go very well for the other people (traceable to mission by the serial numbers) who lost rockets but didn’t report them.<.
Absolutely.
"capabilities" are extremely sensitive, simply because if you know exactly how something works, you can usually make something that _specifically_ defeats it.
uh, ?
The explanation sounds logical to me, I think your source of contention was simply that you were personally effected.
Which I do empathize with.
The International Atomic Energy Agency visited the site and reported very low radiation levels.
As have multiple journalists and bloggers.
