No, it’s not just the headline.
The afghani military gave up very quickly and surrendered in many areas.
The harder battles fought were almost exclusively civilians picking up arms or small regional areas who wanted to remain independent from the taliban.
Shrug.
At this point who cares.
Don't ask them for anything.
Don't send them anything.
Maybe your god will provide for you because the rest of us won't.
And another thing, just because you fools supported an invasion of IRAQ over ‘weapons of mass destruction’, then kept supporting it (and re-elected the even bigger fool who called for it) doesn’t in anyway suggest there aren’t better people to wage a war against the Taliban and certainly I think an all female army would be far superior than what you guys mounted for 20 years, (which you couldn’t handle by yourselves to begin with: see rotation in from UK and Canadian forces to help you sorted lot out).
Gee whiz.
That went well the last 20 years.
A trillion dollars in US military expenditure and guess what the result is?
