To them, saying things outloud, loudly and publicly is action.
As far as they've been convinced, that's the only option.
They've been conveniently and purposefully mislead to think there's a magical liberal barrier keeping their reps from introducing good legislation that helps people.
No it couldn't be that their reps introduce unfavorable or completely asinine bills over moral outrage and corporate boot licking, or that what they're asking for is unconstitutional or impossible to achieve..
So if you can't fight it on paper, if it looks like you might punch the problem-- well you're doing more than the guy who doesn't say shit, just votes and introduces or sponsors bills..
The fucked up part is that every single sitting member's votes are public record.
You can easily read the bills introduced (though yes many are dauntingly long and burdened by legal language and often unrelated things being tacked on) and then see who voted for or against.
Instead tucker and hannity spin it a quarter turn to the right and make it seem like an attack or a wholesale scam etc and now none of these "disenfranchised" voters trust themselves to read it nor care to challenge their preferred talking head's interpretation...
It's fuckin sad.
