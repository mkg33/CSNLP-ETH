millennial co-worker.
I asked her once during the Trump election if she'd voted (not who'd she voted for) and she flat out said to me "oh I let my husband take care of that."
They are divorced now, though.

Seriously.
Pregnancy is really hard and scary.
I've had 3 kids, that I chose to have, and still really struggled with the pregnancy.
Not to mention labor and delivery and then caring for an infant.
Plus living in a country with shockingly high maternal mortality rates for the first world, even worse for minorities.
Bringing a child into this world should be a choice.
Because forced birth is terrifying for the people carrying the child and frequently much worse for the child that has to be raised by someone who didn't want them.
