The one thing I don’t get in all this is how Russia is censoring their wounded soldiers from speaking the truth in Russia.
This is what made a huge difference in the USA during the Vietnam War— soldiers would come home and tell the truth about what they experienced (that they were not welcomed as liberators, that they were not fighting a just war, and that they were not winning- even if specific battles might be won, the enemy was never giving up).
No amount of propaganda can shut this up.
No amounts of threats can shut this up— what can the government do to such people that they haven’t already done?
How is Russia stopping these people, or are wounded Russian veterans not returning home?
Seconded.
At first I thought his arm was bent weird when he first spins and lays down, but he moves it normally again when he turns over.
He was probably throwing a tantrum knowing death was coming.
Remember late-September to early-October?
When people were saying that having those hordes of untrained, unmotivated, underequipped mobiks on the front line will only increase the russian casualties?
