Interestingly enough in my time as a PhD student attending international conferences, I found there to be a greater expectation of deference to one's seniors amongst German academics in particular.
I remember an incident where I questioned a flaw in a professors argument during a Q&A of a talk and being shut down quickly without an answer by the German conference organiser.
I was a bit taken aback, but in the break a fellow PhD from Germany pulled me to one side and told me that I had a point but that German academic culture was very old school and it was not the done thing for PhDs to ask probing questions like that of professors.
I found that weird as it definitely wasn't the case in UK conferences or elsewhere, where PhDs who made good points against their seniors were encouraged.
Mind you that's just an anecdote and might have been specific to my discipline.
The UK continues to be the second richest country in Europe, with recent trends it is likely we will slow down for the next couple of years but this can also change, the long term trend shows the economic backlash from Brexit should stop in 2024 if predictions are correct, also if the next party to win the election isn't the Tories it is likely in 2025 the UK will look for new trading partners and various EU countries will be open to that (most likely).
exact, was.
And if the economic trend continues like this I don't know how the British gross domestic product can increase.
