Dems weren’t pushing back.
They didn’t have the Republican votes to pass the bill.
Instead of the bill failing and then them having to re-establish a new bill on the agenda, which would be a delay and extend the strike, they wanted to try and garner those votes for a chance of it passing.
They finally got some Republicans to see past their personal greed for two seconds and push this bill through.
Glad Dems could finally get through the thick heads of at least some of the greedy GOP sleaze balls and pass this bill.
I think Biden was off his rocker with bad ideas on how to resolve this when he should’ve just demanded Congress give them their damn sick days and abolished the permanent on-call bullshit they’re subjected to.

Congress members have extraordinary taxpayer funded healthcare, too.
The fact that they're shoehorning in 7 days as a triumph is sickening to be honest.
