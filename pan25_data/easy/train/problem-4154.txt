It has symbolic value … it shows that people can still trust in the process and concede as they are supposed to … and doing it against one of the most vitriolic election deniers … it’s taking the high road AND subtly telling her to go F herself.
Interesting perspective.
I guess I don’t see how sensible gun laws and banning assault rifles would contribute to mass shootings.
I DO see how a lack of mental health does….
I get it … As others have noted, the recount will happen anyway, and IF he were to come out on top, he would win … the concession is an acknowledgement of trust in the process … it is him publicly acknowledging that even though it is close, he realizes it is likely impossible … it’s taking the opposite route of someone like Kari Lake … or Lauren … maybe he will run again in 2 years and the contrast will help him ….
No.
Concessions don’t change the outcome in Canada either.
I just find it weird from an optics perspective to not wait til the recount is done to officially say you lost.
