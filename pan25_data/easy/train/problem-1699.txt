Fuck yeah This is something scientists have been trying to achieve for over half a century I know its still just a small step towards a limitless energy future, but its an important one.

But as I said in my first prompt- this is doubly lovely in that it provides direct contradiction to europoors favorite theme on this app- namely that Americans are all dumb.
Our scientific community just changed the world for the better, with effects that will be felt downstream potentially for the rest of time- TWICE in a week and a 1/2.
It is something to celebrate and be proud of.
Sorry you can’t grasp that.
Oh that's easy, every rationale universe is converging towards nuclear apocalypse.
The only reason we haven't is we live in a universe just absurd enough to avoid that conclusion.
