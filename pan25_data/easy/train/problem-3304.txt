The last big earthquake in Turkey was 23 years ago and while that's enough time to make sure new buildings are strong enough and retrofit some old buildings it's not enough to change every single dwelling.
Wars in neighboring Iraq and Syria during that period surely didn't help either.
In either case though, we shouldn't be seeing casualties in the tens of thousands today if there was a plan that was followed to minimize the damages of a possible future earthquake, but expecting single-digit numbers like in Japan or Chile would be unrealistic too.
Anger?
The death toll "now" is close to 20.000.
Estimated 7000 buildings have flattened.
Some calculations expect 200.000 dead.
Kids disappear after being saved from under the rubble god knows where, there is looting, cold, lack of support, they even tried shutting down TWITTER.
TWITTER, that people are using to get organized.
Twitter where people post their locations, waiting to be saved.
It was such a huge fuckup they had to turn it back on.
It is a total clusterfuck expect for the efforts of volunteers.
