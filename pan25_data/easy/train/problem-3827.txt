They’re not going to send US troops into Ukraine to train them on the system.
The plan is to train them in Germany most likely on the patriot equipment that is already there.
Then they’ll either swap in place a system being shipped from the US to the unit there, or they’ll ship a system to the Ukrainians specifically.
I doubt they’ll utilize the German systems as it’s a US aid package and the German equipment especially radar and launchers differ from US.
They won’t risk training crews on the equipment until they finalize the plan and get Biden to sign off on it.
They’ve likely already got the software build they’re going to give the Ukrainians in place along with prebuilt system conditioning instructions and threat database so that won’t cause any delays but this is likely not to come to fruition for a significant amount of time.
No.
It's cheaper and safer for us to give Ukraine the means to keep defending themselves than it is to allow Russia to invade neighbors at will.
Keeping Russia broke is a good thing for all of us.
Patriot interceptors intentionally target the cockpit of aircraft they engage.
I can assure you with almost complete certainty there is no ejecting after being struck by a Patriot interceptor.
