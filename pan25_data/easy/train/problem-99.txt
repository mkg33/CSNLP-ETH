\- Sitting around on a portal but never going anywhere, while the fleet commander has everyone be quiet because they're talking with other FCs on other channels?
Boring.
The Iranian regime spent many years building terrorist organizaitons and cells throughout the world to frighten its enemies from retaliating on its soil (this is also why they seek nuclear weapons), this caused this false sense of security which you and others may have had but you aren't safe because of its power, you are (or were) safe because Iran's shenanigans weren't significant enough to warrant said countries to smack you directly and risk escalations.
God Bless you.
I have great hope that the Iranian People will see true freedom.
I work with some folk that got out and they are the nicest, warmest people Iâ€™ve ever met.
As Iran is increasing its hostilities and draws closer to breaking towards nuclear weapons, these tactics become too tame to 'teach them a lesson' and increase in size, scope and destruction, sure their suicide drones are being sent to Russia for Ukraine's war, but everyone with half a brain knows its just a matter of time until these are even more mass produced and start striking all over the middle east (mainly Israel and US forces in the region).
